<HEADLINE> Kenya's Tea Output Down by 16.3% in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's tea output dropped by
16.3 percent to 246 million kilograms in 1999 from 294 million
kilograms in 1998, the Kenya Tea Board said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kenya, the world's third largest producer of black tea,
experienced hardships due to drought early last year.
</P>
<P>
The output in the first quarter of 1999 was 41.9 percent lower
than the figure for the same period of 1998. The high output in
1998 was boosted by heavy El Nino rains.
</P>
<P>
But production started picking up in the last three months of
last year, thanks to ample rains and higher temperatures.
</P>
<P>
Tea is one of the major foreign exchange earners for the east
African country.

<HEADLINE> Barak Names New Central Bank Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak has chosen David Klein, head of the Bank of Israel's monetary
division, as successor of outgoing central bank governor Jacob
Frenkel, sources in the bank said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Barak phoned Finance Minister Avraham Shochat to inform him of
the appointment from Shepherdstown, West Virginia, where Barak are
engaged in the rugged second round of peace talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The nomination will not take effect until next Thursday because
it should wait for approval by the Committee for Senior Appointment
as well as cabinet, which can not convene until Barak returns from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The nomination came after Frenkel agreed Sunday to stay on his
job for another week to wait for Barak's choice by the end of this
week.
</P>
<P>
Frenkel, who told Barak about his intention to leave the post
last summer, announced his resignation on November 15 last year
after eight and a half years in the governor's chair.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Barak has repeatedly said he wants a governor in
Frenkel's image -- an adherent of Frenkel's economic views, and
someone capable of standing up to heavy pressure.
</P>
<P>
Klein, the effective NO.2 in the Bank of Israel, turns out to be
such a person. Indeed, he is widely regarded as taking an even
tighter monetary policy than Frenkel, who has been blamed by some
analysts for suffocating the newly-born economy recovery in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Since joining the Bank of Israel in 1987, Klein fully supported
the central bank's policy of high interest rates, and if appointed,
will undoubtedly lower rates very cautiously. He is also strongly
opposed to any intervention in the foreign currency markets.
</P>
<P>
Because of these financial philosophy reputations, Klein's
nomination has triggered not only warm welcome from Frenkel but
also some harsh reaction from cabinet and Knesset (Parliament).
</P>
<P>
Shohat, who preferred to choose more moderate candidates such as
Treasury Director-General Avi Ben-Bassat, has not made reaction yet
but he surely does not want Frenkel to be replaced by more hawkish
Klein.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Shochat has already vetoed one of Barak's
candidates-- former finance minister Yaakov Ne'eman -- and is
therefore likely to be extremely reluctant to veto another one.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Yossi Sarid said he expects all ministers of
the Meretz party will oppose the nomination, adding Meretz is more
interested in a central bank governor who will be less concerned
about one percent rise in inflation than one percent rise in
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Shas's Knesset member David Tal, Chairman of the Knesset labor
and welfare committee, called on Barak to reverse his decision,
which Tal said will be at the expense of the poorer section of the
society, who have suffered extensively from Frenkel's interest rate
policies.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts have warned that a Klein appointment sends a
message to the markets that monetary policy will be tighter than
ever and market turbulence might be ahead.
</P>
<P>
But other analysts believe that once in office, the difference
between Klein and other candidates will be less dramatic than their
policy pronouncement and personal philosophies suggest.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Curb Inflation: IMF Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- An official of the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) has said he believes Turkey will pull down its
inflation rate to 25 percent in the year 2000 as the government
targets.
</P>
<P>
Carlo Cottarelli, chief official for Turkish affairs in the IMF,
made the remarks at a meeting sponsored by the Turkish Banks Union,
the Anatolia News Agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
He attributed Turkey's chronic high inflation in the last 20
years to two main reasons: the weakening public financing and
deteriorating poverty among the ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
He said the efforts exerted by the Turkish government to curb
inflation in 1995 had failed. However, the present program to
combat inflation is bold, the IMF official warned.
</P>
<P>
Cottarelli added that the success of the program depends on a
few factors, such as the government's determination to stick to its
promises in the stand-by agreement with the IMF, how the government
will cope with emergencies and the structural reforms which are
under way.
</P>
<P>
Later last year, the IMF signed a stand-by agreement with Turkey
to support its economic reforms and the IMF will open an office in
Ankara to supervise the implementation of the deal.

<HEADLINE> 1 Killed, 3 Injured in Prison Rioting in Istanbul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- One person was killed and three
others were injured when Turkish policemen rushed to put down a
prison rioting in Istanbul, the Anatolia News Agency reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
During the unrest, inmates in the Metris Prison in Istanbul took
hostage 19 warders and a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
Members of the outlawed Islamic Great Eastern Raiders Front were
behind the riot, Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit told reporters at his
office.
</P>
<P>
"We must prevent the prisons from becoming headquarters of
illegal organizations," said the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He said that Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of State
Husamettin Ozkan had convened an urgent meeting to deal with the
incident and a protocol was issued after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"When we begin to implement this protocol in coming months, it
will be easy to prevent such incidents in the prisons in the
future. The protocol envisages improvement of health conditions in
prisons and adoption of further security measures," he added.
</P>
<P>
Officials told Anatolia that the prisoners took the action in
protest against intervention by security forces in a hunger strike
in the Prison of Bandirma, a port city on the Marmara Sea.
</P>
<P>
The hunger strike, which began two days ago, was reportedly
stirred up and organized by a group of members of the Front, who
were transferred to the prison from the Bayrampass Prison in
Istanbul.

<P>
MOSCOW, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Friday announced a
suspension of aerial and artillery attacks on Grozny, capital of
the breakaway republic of Chechnya, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The suspension was made following the detonation by Chechen
rebels of mines with toxic agents, Tass said, citing Lieutenant
General Gennady Troshev, a deputy commander with the federal
military group in North Caucusus.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Mozdok, which was partially shown on
Russian NTV television Late Friday, Troshev explained this
decision by the need to allow civilians still remaining in Grozny
to leave the city and to avoid the impact of toxic agents on
personnel after the rebels blew up containers with chemical agents
recently.
</P>
<P>
Although the move could be a setback from a military point of
view, it was designated to protect the civilians trapped in Grozny,
he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the military operation against rebels will continue in
other parts of Grozny where there are no civilian presence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sources in the Russian Defense Ministry said Troshev
will no longer lead the federal eastern grouping. He and commander
of the western grouping Vladimir Shamanov will be replaced by
their deputies General Sergei Makarov and General Alexei Verbitsky.
</P>
<P>
The replacement of the commanders of the western and eastern
federal groupings in Chechnya "is not a consequence of any
professional errors in the counter-terrorist operation," said the
sources.
</P>
<P>
"Both of them will get back to their duties which they
performed before the operation in the North Caucasus," the sources
said, adding that until recently the operation in Chechnya was
mostly conducted by the officers and generals of the North
Caucasian Military District.
</P>
<P>
Since a counter-terrorist operation was launched in the North
Caucasus, more than 20 generals have undergone combat practice in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Russian federal forces launched a key stage of an operation to
storm Grozny on December 25 last year.
</P>
<P>
According to an Itar-Tass report, by Friday Russian federal
troops have come to the center of the city and some units now are
already near the stadium and the House of Press which are 300 and
900 meters respectively from the former buildings of the Chechen
Interior Ministry and Security Service.
</P>
<P>
Russia began its military offensive against the Chechen
separatists in late September last year after Chechen rebels'
armed incursions into neighboring federal republic of Daghestan
and a spate of apartment building blasts that claimed over 300
people in Moscow and two other Russian cities. Russian authorities
blamed Chechen extremists for planning and carrying out the
terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
In the last several weeks of 1998 Russian groupings
successively freed the second biggest Chechen city of Gudermes and
other key towns of Argun, Urus-Martan and Shali, closed the
surrounding of Grozny. By now, Russian units have reportedly
controlled all flat-land Chechnya, or over two thirds of the
republic's territory, where 90 percent of Chechen population live.

<HEADLINE> Donor Nations Urged to Support Zanzibar's Development Vision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar's President
Salmin Amour has appealed to donor nations to support the Isles
"Vision 2020" aimed at improving its shattered economy.
</P>
<P>
The assistance from donors is a key component for the
successful performance of the vision, the president said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said the vision, prepared with the support of the United
Nations Development Programs (UNDP), would promote Zanzibar's
economy for sustainable and balanced development.
</P>
<P>
The development vision was designed to lead Zanzibar to a
brighter future in the wake of ongoing globalization and
marginalization challenges, said Amour.
</P>
<P>
"Vision 2020" is intended to increase discipline in tax
administration with the view of improving revenue collection as
well as control expenditure.
</P>
<P>
There is a big discrepancy between revenue collection and
government's requirements, making it difficult for the state to
achieve its goals, including a 5.3 percent growth of the gross
domestic product (GDP), said Amour.
</P>
<P>
Zanzibar's GDP growth will average 10 percent from the current
4.8 percent, the vision predicts, further forecasting that per
capita income for the islanders will raise to 3,000 U.S. dollars
in 20 years.

NAIROBI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government has
directed its food purchasing institutions like schools, hospitals
and prisons to buy straight from farmers at good prices, the
Rwanda News Agency reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Prime Minister's Office, the government has
issued a farm produce purchasing policy to the relevant

The new policy was aimed at providing markets for Rwandan farm
produce and enabling government institutions to buy such products
at reasonably affordable prices.
</P>
<P>
New measures were deliberated and adopted as government policy
in a cabinet meeting late last December, the office said.
</P>
<P>
The prefectural authorities will have their budgets boosted to
enable them to directlrm produce tenders to farmers and to relax some
stringent pre- qualification requirements like producing
registration certificates, income tax, and any such requirements
that farmers normally do not.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's ANC Receives Fake Bomb Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 7 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling
African National Congress (ANC) received a fake bombing threat
just on the eve of the 88th anniversary of its founding.
</P>
<P>
An anonymous caller telephoned the ANC's headquarters here on
Friday that there was a bomb in the building. A bomb disposal
unit was immediately called in but the police found no explosives
at all.
</P>
<P>
Referring to this incident, ANC's chief information officer
Smuts Ngonyama said that this is "an attempt to destabilize the
ANC as it prepares to celebrate its birthday and prepare for local
government elections."
</P>
<P>
"We take it very, very seriously and our security staff will be
 conducting investigations," South African Press Association
quoted Ngonyama as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ANC spokesman noted that the year 2000 would be
dedicated to preparing for the launch of the "African century" in
2001.
</P>
<P>
"For almost nine decades the masses have looked to the ANC to
free them from great suffering. We are committed to not failing
them," he said.
</P>
<P>
In their speeches at a series of anniversary rallies in all the
 provinces Saturday, the ANC leaders would focus on the challenges
facing Africa.
</P>
<P>
These challenges included ending poverty, diseases, racism,
tribalism, corruption, the oppression of women and the pervasive
feeling of defeat, Ngonyama said.

<HEADLINE> Tourist Attack in Namibia not to Affect S. African Tourism: Spokeswoman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The attack on a group of
French tourists in Namibia earlier this week is unlikely to impact
negatively on South Africa's tourism industry, an official source
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman of South African Tourism Stella du Plessis said
that it was an isolated event which would probably not have a
negative effect on tourism in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
However, she noted that it is still too early to draw a final
conclusion on the impact of Monday's attack.
</P>
<P>
Three French children were killed and their parents seriously
injured when gunmen in uniform opened fire on the vehicle in which
the victims were travelling in Namibia's Caprivi Strip.
</P>
<P>
Two aid workers were injured, both in the legs, in a similar
attack about 30 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government blamed members of the Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) for the attack but the Angolan
rebel group later denied the allegation.
</P>
<P>
Du Plessis said if there were more such incidents, it could
create a problem.
</P>
<P>
But because most international flights to Africa arrive in
South Africa, "we won't lose any tourists," du Plessis said. "They
could just decide to stay in South Africa, and not visit some of
the neighboring countries."
</P>
<P>
However, Namibia's Tour and Safari Association said it would
not conduct any tours to the Kavango-Caprivi region in the next
three months.
</P>
<P>
The association said in a statement that it had advised
tourists on December 23 to avoid the area in Namibia where the
violence was escalating.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Namibian government invited the Angolan army to
use its territory as a springboard for attacks against UNITA in
southeastern part of Angola where a civil war has been going on
for over 25 years.

<HEADLINE> Britain Voices Regret over Daily's Insulting Article </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 7 (Xinhua) -- British ambassador to Iran
Nicholas Brown on Friday expressed regret over an "insulting"
article printed by the London daily Times in its millennium issue,
just ahead of a landmark visit of Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi to Britain.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Hamid Reza
Asefi, Brown said the brief article in Times does not represent the
official standpoint of the British government, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Times reprinted a 1989 obituary which termed the religious
verdict by late Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini
against the life of British writer Salman Rushdie as "a disaster,"
comparing it to the Mongol invasion to Iran in the 13th century.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry on Tuesday summoned British charge
d'affaires Neil Crompton in absence of the ambassador in protest
against the article.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's official in charge of the mass media Morteza
Darzi Ramandi conveyed Iran's strong protest to the British
diplomat, saying the Iranian nation and government are sensitive to
desecration of the Islamic values and the Times' "affront" has
aroused public hatred and disgust.
</P>
<P>
Expressing regret over the issue, Brown said that his government
is eagerly awaiting the ground-breaking visit of the Iranian
foreign minister to London, which will start on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi's visit and his scheduled meeting with British Prime
Minister Tony Blair and Foreign Secretary Robin Cook are of special
importance to the British government, he said.
</P>
<P>
Asefi underlined that "the Iranian people continued to remain
ideologically attached to the aspirations of the Islamic revolution
and to the path and course of life" led Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran adheres to the principle of non-interference
in the internal affairs of all countries and also respect to sacred
and religious values.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Britain promoted their relations to ambassadorial level
last May after the two countries agreed to put aside the issue of
Rushdie, who was sentenced to death by Khomeini in 1989 for alleged
blasphemy against Islam in his controversial novel "the Satanic
Verses."

<HEADLINE> EU Registers Foreign Trade Deficit in October 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The first trade evaluation for
the 15-nation European Union (EU) with the rest of the world,
inclusive to October 1999, showed a deficit of 200 million euros (
206 million U.S. dollars) compared with a surplus of 1.1 billion
euros (1.18 billion U.S. dollars) in October 1998, Eurostat, the
EU's statistical office, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
There was a deficit of 10.1 billion euros (10.4 billion U.S.
dollars) in the first nine months compared with a surplus of 13.2
billion euros (14.2 billion U.S. dollars) in the same period of
1998.
</P>
<P>
The deterioration in the EU trade balance is explained by a
slight fall in exports over the first nine months of 1999.
However monthly figures for September indicate that exports were
growing strongly on a year to year basis, continuing the trend
that began in June, Eurostat said.
</P>
<P>
Exports were weak across all main product groupings except "
Chemicals," while imports in "Primary products" was outweighed by
the growth in "Manufactured goods," Eurostat added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bloc's trade with its major partners was mixed,
with some strong and others weak or falling. Particularly strong
were exports to China with 13 percent, the United States with 10
percent, imports from Hungary with 17 percent, from China with 13
percent, and the Czech Republic with 12 percent, according to the
Eurostat.
</P>
<P>
Trade flows with Russia were -45 percent for exports and -1
percent for imports, with Norway were -10 percent for exports and -
12 percent for imports, and exports to Turkey was -15 percent.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the 11-country euro zone recorded 6.9 billion
euros (7.1 billion U.S. dollars) surplus in its trade with the
rest of the world in October 1999. This gave a total surplus of 42.
1 billion euros (43.3 billion U.S. dollars) for the first nine
months of 1999, compared with 61.5 billion euros (some 66.4
billion U.S. dollars) in the same period for 1998, the Eurostat
said.

the same time, Iraq should cooperate with the United Nations and
implement relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions. The
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq should be respected

Center of the U.S. led by Dr. Gordon L. Streeb observed primary
elections of a villagers' committee in north China's Hebei
Province today.
</P>
<P>
More than 1000 voters took part in the election, held at the

<HEADLINE> Quantum Computer On Anvil: Indian Expert Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI January 7 (Xinhua) -- An Indian expert said Friday
that a new computer that could render the current supercomputer
junk by solving complex problems beyond the reach of both
innovative human brains and supercomputers is on the anvil.
</P>
<P>
A quantum computer would be a reality in the next five years,
predicted E. C. G. Sundarshan, a scientist at the National
Research Institute, associated with the University of Texas in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
According to the Press Trust of India (PTI), Sudarshan said
that the quantum computer might turn out to be superior to the
human brain by solving even the most complicated mathematical
problems like Permat's last theorem, an international problem that
requires 300 years to solve, or Reiman's hypothesis, the most
famous unsolved mathematic problem, within seconds or hours..
</P>
<P>
Computational efficiency would also be enhanced tremendously so
that problems like data mining or searching large database that
requires minutes in present computers could be done in seconds
with the new computer, Sundarshan told the 87th Indian Science
Congress,which ended today in Pune, 1,400 kilometers southwest of
New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Sudarshan said another major advantage would be the
availability of same information at two places which is not
possible with the present set of computers.
</P>
<P>
For example, Sudarshan said, if only one copy of a film was
available, it could not be viewed at two places simultaneously --
a task that would be achievable by quantum computers.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the new computer would look very different
from the existing ones that consist of a monitor, processing unit
and keyboard.
</P>
<P>
"It may look like a tiny box with facilities to cool atoms at
sub-zero temperature," Sudarshan said.

last close of 4,460 rupees (103.72 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two-carat gold was nominally quoted better at 4,135
rupees(96.16 dollars) per 10 gram from 4,125 rupees (95.93 dollars)
.
</P>
<P>
However, ready silver (.999 fineness) ended at 8,090 rupees (
188.14 dollars) per kilogram, showing no change from the previous
close.
</P>
<P>
Raw silver (.916 fineness) also held steady at 7,960 rupees (

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government Friday
asked Pakistan to either prosecute or deport to India the five
hijackers of the Indian Airlines aircraft.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the External Affairs Ministry said that the onus
has always been on Pakistan as the hijackers were widely-believed
to be in that country.
</P>
<P>
He said that Islamabad must react as it is a signatory to a
number of international conventions on hostage taking.
</P>
<P>
Asked if any country had questioned the evidence relating to
the hijacking made public by India, he said, "We have no feedback
from anywhere which questions the veracity of what we stated."

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Calls on Moslems Not to Kill Each Other </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid here Friday called on Moslems, especially in the strive-torn
area of Maluku province not to kill each other for the sake of
certain political interest.
</P>
<P>
"Religion has been used as a political instrument to control
another Moslem," the president said in a dialog with Moslems after
Friday prayers.
</P>
<P>
Wahid said that he has instructed the newly-installed
Indonesian Police Chief Let. Gen. Rusdihardjo to seize whoever
comes to Maluku with weapons.
</P>
<P>
He said Maluku has already been put under a special control
command headed by the regional military commander.
</P>
<P>
Stern actions were needed but the government has had no plan to
impose an emergency status for the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Defense Force (TNI) headquarters said that
altogether there have been 8,000 additional army troops deployed
in North Maluku to support about 1,000 personnel of the police and
military troops in maintaining security in the district.
</P>
<P>
Community clashes which erupted in a number of subdistricts in
northern Halmahera island of the North Maluku district have
reportedly claimed hundreds of lives and damaged various
government and public facilities.
</P>
<P>
Located about 2,400 kilometers northeast of Jakarta, the Maluku
province covers 86,000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The clashes first erupted on January 19 last year on the island
of Ambon following a dispute between a public transport driver and
a migrant. The violence has since spread to at least five other
islands in the Maluku archipelago, once noted for its religious
harmony.
</P>
<P>
According to the military, a year of conflict between Muslims
and Christians in the islands have left more than 1,134 dead, over
2,300 wounded and 8,500 buildings, including 122 places of worship,
either damaged or burned.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands have fled their homes, seeking refuge with
the local military or elsewhere in the country.

<HEADLINE> EU Hails Winning of WTO Steel Case Against U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Friday that it welcomed the results of a WTO panel initiated
against the United States concerning allegedly illegal duties
imposed on a British Steel company.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU) executive body's trade commissioner,
Pascal Lamy, said in a statement that the EU is "pleased at this
outcome, which will be of great help to the company concerned and
may have wider benefits for other privatized EU steel producers,
which are currently subject to U.S. countervailing duties."
</P>
<P>
The WTO panel confirmed all the main arguments against the 1916
U.S. law-based action put forward by the EU and concluded that by
imposing countervailing duties on British Steel the United States
had breached the WTO subsidies agreement, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
The WTO dispute panel rejected U.S. arguments that steel
exports by British Steel plc are unfairly subsidized because the
state-owned company -- then British Steel and now the Corus Group -
- had been given government grants prior to being privatized in
1988.
</P>
<P>
The WTO ruled that since the privatization itself was conducted
at market price, British Steel's products were not unfairly
subsidized.
</P>
<P>
The panel ruling, though interim, is expected to be adopted by
the end of January. The U.S. has threatened to appeal.

<HEADLINE> Six Illegal Immigrants Killed in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- At least six illegal immigrants
were killed and 28 injured, two of them seriously, when a stolen
truck transporting them from the Turkish border overturned Friday
outside the northern Greek city of Komotini.
</P>
<P>
Police said the truck slid off an ice-covered road, rammed into
a utility pole and overturned.
</P>
<P>
Another 30 immigrants were arrested. Police are searching for
the driver and a suspected accomplice driving a car ahead of the
truck to warn of police checks.
</P>
<P>
Police said about 80 illegal immigrants, all of them young
Iraqi men of Kurdish origin, were in the truck, which they boarded
in Evros on the Greek side of the border with Turkey, and were to
be transported to Thessaloniki and the capital city of Athens.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, 15,000 illegal immigrants reportedly entered Greece
through the country's border with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Currently, refugees make up 9 percent of Greece's population,
which increased marginally in 1999 by 18,000 people, of whom 14,
000 were immigrants.

WASHINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- House GOP leaders on Thursday abruptly switched direction on
taxes, abandoning their press for an immediate massive tax cut in
favor of swift action on a far more modest package that would
include popular provisions such as marriage penalty relief and
educational tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
-- Attorney General Janet Reno declined on Thursday to reverse
a decision by the Immigration and Naturalization Service to return
six-year-old Elian Gonzalez to his father in Cuba, as hundreds of
Cuban Americans took to the streets of Miami in a mostly peaceful
but determined protest.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Governor George W. Bush unequivocally pledged never to raise
taxes and promised to cut them. In a debate among six contenders,
Mr. Bush and Senator John McCain sparred aggressively over
prescriptions for campaign finance and taxes.
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton spent a third day coaxing Israel and Syria
toward the framework of a peace accord, with American officials
reporting that the pace of talks had picked up.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Investors fled the tech sector and rotated to health, energy
and financial stocks. The Nasdaq composite fell to 3727.13 points.
The Dow Jones Industrials advanced 130.61 to 11253.26.
</P>
<P>
-- Russia claims to have stanched a Chechen counterattack in
and around Grozny with heavy rebel losses. Acting President Putin,
meanwhile, said he supports cutting interest rates and tightening
foreign-exchange rules, which the IMF wasn't pleased to see.

HONG KONG, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA) announced Friday that Hong Kong's official
foreign currency assets amounted to 96.3 billion U.S. dollars at
the end of December 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to an HKMA spokesperson, the 4.2 billion U.S. dollars
increase in settled foreign currency assets in the month of
December was mainly due to the issue of additional currency notes,
which are backed by U.S. dollars deposited by the note issuing
banks with the Exchange Fund.
</P>
<P>
In terms of foreign currency reserves ranking, Hong Kong is now
the world's fourth largest holder of foreign currency reserves
after Japan, China's mainland and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The total foreign currency assets of 96.3 billion U.S. dollars,
including unsettled forward contracts, represent over six times
the currency in circulation or about 39 percent of Hong Kong
dollar, one of the highest ratios in the world.

<HEADLINE> HK Holds Forum on Human Resource Experience </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Some 50 human resource
executives from small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) in Hong
Kong gathered for the first time Friday to share practical
experience in labor relations matters in a forum organized by the
Labor Department.
</P>
<P>
"We are encouraged by the highly positive response from
participants who took part in the lively discussions and exchanged
views on issues of common concern in individual trades and
industries," Commissioner for Labor Matthew Cheung Kin-chung said
after opening the forum marking the launch of the Small and Medium
Sized Enterprises Human Resource Executives Club.
</P>
<P>
The setting up of the club was one of the Labor Department's
latest initiatives in promoting harmonious labor relations,
effective communication between employers and employees as well as
good human resource management among SMEs in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"According to the June 1999 figures published by the Census and
Statistics Department, there are some 280,000 enterprises with an
employment size of less than 100 people. They are the Labor
Department's promotion targets as they make up more than 1.5
million of our workforce, forming a backbone of Hong Kong's
economic development," Cheung said.
</P>
<P>
"We are now forming three regionally based human resource
executives' clubs on Hong Kong Island, in Kowloon and the New
Territories for these SMEs. They will provide useful vehicles for
fostering harmonious employer-employee relations, and enhancing
employers' knowledge of labor laws and the best practice in human
resource management," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We will regularly organize meetings for these executives'
clubs and brief participants on newly introduced labor legislation.
Consultants, academics and veteran practitioners will be invited
to talk on the latest development in human resource management,"
Cheung said.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Four days of heavy rains and snows
brought nearly 500 million cubic meters of water to Jordan, which
has been hit by the worst drought in half a century.
</P>
<P>
The capital city of Amman, home to one third of the 4.8 million
total population, received 263.8 million cubic meters of rain out
of the 487.7 million dropped on various parts of the desert kingdom
as of Friday, said sources with the Water and Irrigation Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The rainfall accounts for 11.6 percent of the annual average of
some 8 billion cubic meters on the kingdom in good years, the
sources added.
</P>
<P>
"This is good for our springs, agriculture, and livestock," said
Minister of Water and Irrigation Kamel Mahadin.
</P>
<P>
Jordan depends mainly on rainfalls for supply of fresh water for
its human consumption and agricultural and industrial needs.
</P>
<P>
As of Thursday, the country's four main reservoirs - King Talal
Dam, Wadi Al Arab, Kafrein and Shurahbeel - had taken in 703,000
cubic meters more rainwater, 12 percent of their total storage
capacities.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologist said the rains and snows would ease for the
weekend before another cold front could bring more water to the
kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has a Mediterranean weather, it is mild and rainy in
winter but extremely hot and dry in summer. However, it suffered
from the worst drought that hit the region in half a century, and
had little rains in the rainy season in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Amman's city authorities cut water supplies to water tanks of
the residents from twice a week to once as part of a contingency
plan.

billion U.S. dollars from the United States to cover the costs of
withdrawal from the Golan Heights and other expenses entailed in a
peace agreement with Syria, local daily Ha'aretz reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Defense Ministry Director-General Amos Yaron is scheduled to
present a bill list to U.S. officials in Washington next week.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said Israel had asked for a 17-billion-dollar
security package from Washington in return for a withdrawal from
the strategic Golan Heights it captured from Syria in 1967.
</P>
<P>
That list included Tomahawk cruise missiles, Apache attack
helicopters, Airborne Warning and Control Systems (AWACS) planes
and anti-missile missiles.
</P>
<P>
The package was apart from the 25 billion dollars Israel had
requested from the U.S. to re-settle the 17,000 Jewish settlers in
the Golan Heights in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The latest Israel bill list include, in addition to the above-
mentioned requests, a host of clauses relating to expenditures of
troop redeployment, security expenses, stabilization of water
systems and others.
</P>
<P>
Among these clauses are expenses of the evacuation of about 40
military camps, divisional and brigade headquarters, logistics and
intelligence facilities and their redeployment in Israel.
</P>
<P>
They also include intellegence and early warning systems,
including three advanced radar aircraft and satellite
communications, as well as anti-rocket and anti-missile systems.
</P>
<P>
However, Washington is not expected to be willing to bear all by
itself the financial burden of Israel's peace agreement with Syria
and is likely to ask the European Union, Japan and other Arab
nations to share their parts of the "peace price."
</P>
<P>
The second round of revived Israeli-Syrian peace talks started
at Shepherdstown, West Virginia of the U.S., on Tuesday, but no
tangible progress has been reported so far.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-brokered talks deal with Israel's withdrawal from the
Golan Heights, sharing of water, security arrangement for Israel
and normalization of relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian talks were relaunched last December in
Washington after nearly four-year suspension following a series of
terrorist attacks in Israel carried out by Islamic militants in
early 1996.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Tightens Security After Clashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Special security measures were
taken in Lebanon on Friday following a wave of violence that swept
across the country during the past week.
</P>
<P>
The measures mainly focused on centers of Islamic groups in
Mount Lebanon, the country's central mountain province, a security
source said. It was not disclosed how long these measures would be
kept in place.
</P>
<P>
All police leaves were canceled and security was beefed up near
churches and mosques and in districts hosting embassies and
diplomatic residence.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the year 2000, a group of Sunni Muslim
fundamentalists ambushed an army patrol in the Dinnieh district in
the country's northern port city of Tripoli, instigating a five-day
clash between the army and the militants.
</P>
<P>
Some 11 soldiers, including an officer, at least 20 militants,
and two civilians were killed in the clash while more than 60
extremists were arrested.
</P>
<P>
A Palestinian man assaulted the Russian Embassy in western
Beirut on Monday, killing a policeman and wounding two others. He
was killed later by the security forces.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, an army checkpoint in the country's southern port
city of Sidon was hit by a hand grenade, which caused no
casualties.
</P>
<P>
A Christian nun was killed Sunday by an unidentified man in
southern Beirut. The killing came amid frequent attacks against
Christian churches in Beirut and Tripoli in recent months.
</P>
<P>
The security sources said they are investigating possible links
between the violent incidents across the country.

<HEADLINE> Muslims Urged to strengthen Bonds of Brotherhood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Yang di-Pertuan
Agong (King) Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah Friday night urged
Muslims to forgive one another and strengthen their bonds of
brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
This was because Islam exhorted its followers to be always of
mutual help, good to one another, tolerant and be willing to
forgive and forget past misdeeds and misunderstandings, the king
said in his message on the celebration of Aidil Fitri, Muslims'
new year, which falls on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The king also urged Muslims not to use mosques as venues for
any political feud. "Keep different political ideologies away from
mosques and suraus (Small chapels). The holiness of the Muslim
place of worship should be upheld as it symbolizes the greatness
of Islam and its followers and hence this should not be tarnished
by any act that will lower this dignity."
</P>
<P>
He expressed his happiness that the measures taken by the
Malaysian government to overcome the economic problems had been
successful and that Muslims in the country were now able to
celebrate Hari Raya (festival day) in a climate of almost full
economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
He said economic recovery was vital as it meant Malaysians
would continue to have development, a better quality of life and
other facilities.
</P>
<P>
The king was also happy that Malaysians celebrate the first
Hari Raya of this new decade in an atmosphere of peace and
tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
He was confident that in such an atmosphere, the people will be
able to work with more zeal and determination for the country's
continued development "without being harassed by untoward
incidents."

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Officials Insist on Transition Tenure in Cote d'Ivoire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Officials of the Mediation
Committee on Cote d'Ivoire have insisted that the military junta
should return the country to a civilian government before June,
The Guardian newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lansana Kouyate, executive secretary of the Economic Community
of West African States (ECOWAS), reaffirmed the bloc's
condemnation of the Christmas eve coup d'etat in Cote d'Ivoire
which ousted President Henri Konan Bedie.
</P>
<P>
He restated that the demand that democratic rule in the country
be restored by June while all political detainees be released.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Foreign Minister Alhaji Sule Lamido said in Abidjan
Thursday that Nigeria condemned the military's usurpation of
President Bedie's government because there are constitutional
means of removing a bad government instead of resorting to the
barrel of the gun.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who is member of an ECOWAS delegation comprising
foreign ministers of member states including Nigeria, Mali,
Benin, Liberia and Ghana, insisted that the deadline set by
ECOWAS for the return of power to a civilian government in Cote
d'Ivoire must not be breached.
</P>
<P>
He added that it was abhorrent for soldiers to use force to
bring down a government chosen by the people and that such an
action stands condemned no matter the justification.
</P>
<P>
Lamido noted that six months would be enough for the Gen.
Robert Guei- led government to restore power to civilians as it
was done in Niger and Mali.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ugandans Urged to Contribute to National Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has urged all the people in the country, Muslims in
particular, to contribute more to the development of the nation.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal at the breaking of fast dinner hosted in
honor of the Muslim community in Uganda at Sheraton Hotel here
Thursday evening, a press release from the President's Office
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Museveni stressed the generation of financial resources by the
different religions in Uganda will lay a strong foundation for
them so that they do not have to rely solely on foreign donations
to do their work.
</P>
<P>
They were urged to shoulder the responsibility in causing
development in African societies. The way of tackling the problem
of under development lies in education, privatization, modern
agriculture, training of vocational skills and building an
industrial base, he said.
</P>
<P>
He congratulated the Muslims on the completion of the holy
month of  Ramadhan and said that the breaking of fast dinner for
the Muslim community will henceforth become an annual event.

<HEADLINE> China's Railways Eliminates Losses Ahead of Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Minister of Railways Fu Zhihuan
announced today that China's railway sector has become loss-free
one year ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
The country's railway system carried 976 million passengers and
1.57 billion tons of cargo in 1999, with total income up 8.3
percent year on year to 99.8 billion yuan, said Fu at a national
railway work conference held here today.
</P>
<P>
Industrial enterprises as well as material supply and
construction firms within the sector, which eliminated losses in
1998, also registered a significant profit increase in 1999,
according to Fu.
</P>
<P>
The railway sector, which used to be considered "the last
stronghold of the planning economy," was known for low-efficient
operational and management systems as China transformed into a
market economy.
</P>
<P>
The rail enterprises had been suffering losses since 1994, and
by the end of 1997 these losses amounted to 15.6 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In early 1998, the industry decided to change this picture
within three years.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here point out that the success of the sector, which
was able to end its losses as the textile industry had done, will
positively push forward the goal of seeing all large and medium-
sized state-owned enterprises turn losses into profit.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that China poured 57 billion yuan into
railway construction in 1999 to build 1,087 km of new lines and 1,
041 km of double tracks.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 1,040 km of new lines, 1,293 km of double tracks,
and 607 km of electrified railway were put into operation.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-President Meets Iraqi Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao
told visiting Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz here this
afternoon that the early solution of the Iraq issue is beneficial
not only to the Iraqi people but also to the lasting peace and
stability of the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark during his meeting with Aziz at the Great
Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
Hu reiterated the principled stance adopted by China on the
Iraq issue, and said all relevant parties should show a
willingness to resolve the Iraq issue through political means. At
the same time, Iraq should cooperate with the United Nations and
implement relevant UN Security Council resolutions. The
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq should be respected
by the international community, he said, and noted that the
Security Council should "fairly and objectively" appraise Iraq's
implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions and, based
on this, will gradually lessen and eventually lift all sanctions
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relations, Hu expressed appreciation that Iraq
attaches importance to the development of Iraq-China ties, adding
that China is willing to make concerted efforts with Iraq for
further growth of the traditional friendship between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Hu also stressed that along with efforts made by the relevant
sides, China, as a permanent member of the UN Security Council,
will continue its efforts to push forward the just and rational
solution to the Iraq issue, tackle the remaining problems left by
the Gulf crisis, and bring lasting peace and stability to the
region.
</P>
<P>
Aziz extended congratulations for Macao's return to China and
conveyed greetings from the Iraqi leaders to the Chinese leaders.
He said that Iraqi leaders give great attention to the growth of
its traditional and friendly relationship with China and are
willing to strengthen friendly cooperation with China in all
fields.
</P>
<P>
Aziz also briefed Hu on his government's stance on the Iraq
issue, expressing appreciation for China's friendly, just, and
active stand on resolving the issue. He said he hopes China will
play an even larger role in the effort to lift sanctions against
Iraq at early date.

<HEADLINE> 3,300-Year-Old Ancient City Found Near Yin Ruins (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The grand 3,300-year-old
capital city of the ancient Shang Dynasty, older than the famous
Yin Ruins, was recently discovered not far from the Yin Ruins in
Henan Province, central China.
</P>
<P>
The ancient city is the largest Shang Dynasty (16-11 century BC)
capital ever found, covering more than four million square meters.
Yin Ruins was the site of the dynasty's last capital city.
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the most important archeological discovery of
the end of the 20th century, and is of great importance to the
research of the complicated and confusing history of the Shang
Dynasty and the origin of Chinese culture," said Wang Wei, deputy
director of the Institute of Archeology under the Chinese Academy
of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The square-shaped ancient city was buried 2.5 meters
underground, and the artery railway from Beijing to Guangzhou runs
right through the city.
</P>
<P>
The remains of city wall's groundwork have been found, with
each side of the walls more than 2,000 meters long and nine meters
thick.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists discovered the remains of houses, wells, tombs,
and pottery and bronze ware within the city. And some inscriptions
on bones and tortoise shells, China's earliest written characters,
were also discovered in the city.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 100 years, more than 150,000 bones and tortoise
shells bearing China's earliest written language have been
discovered at the Yin Ruins opposite the newly-discovered ancient
city just across the Huanhe River. However, no city wall has been
found at Yin Ruins during the 70 years of large-scale excavations.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the Great Wall which was built with grey bricks, the
city wall of the Shang Dynasty was built of solidly rammed earth.
</P>
<P>
"It was not easy to build such a capital more than 3,300 years
ago," said Chinese archeologist Yang Yubin. Some experts believe
that another Shang city in Zhengzhou, a little smaller than the
newly-discovered one, took more than one million slaves at least
seven years to construct.

<HEADLINE> Circular Stressing Development of Border Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The State Ethnic Affairs
Commission today issued a circular urging ethnic affairs
departments at all levels to further push forward the border area
development drive.
</P>
<P>
Beginning last year, the drive was designed to increase the
development of China's border areas to enrich the local people,
solidify national borders, rejuvenate the nation, and promote
cross-border relations.
</P>
<P>
The circular pointed out that since most border areas in China
are home to various minority ethnic groups, the drive has a
significant meaning for efforts to achieve faster development in
these areas.
</P>
<P>
All ethnic areas will see an obvious improvement in
infrastructure, living standards, and social and economic
development, the circular said.
</P>
<P>
The circular urged related departments to make overall
arrangements, conduct in-depth investigations, and take practical
steps to guarantee the drive's success.

<TEXT>
<P>
During the 600 years from 16th century to 11th century BC, the
Chinese of the Shang Dynasty migrated from one place to another,
and were reluctant to settle down. According to historical
documents, the Shang Dynasty built eight capitals in all.
</P>
<P>
With the passage of time and the lack of historical records,
the once prosperous cities fell into oblivion, and today's
archeologists search for them.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists believe the ancient Shang cities at Yanshi and
Zhengzhou in Henan Province were the capitals of the early Shang.
</P>
<P>
However, after the discovery of this Shang city, some experts
say it was the real Yin Capital built by Emperor Pangeng, while
others say it was the Xiang Capital built by another Emperor,
Hedanjia, of the Shang Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
The new discovery raises more questions for Chinese
archaeologists at the start of the 21st century, said Wang Wei.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chinese archeologists have a deep understanding of
the early and late Shang Dynasty, while little is known about the
middle period of the dynasty. The new discovery will help
archeologists research this neglected period.
</P>
<P>
Tang Jigen, a leading ancient city specialist, said they plan
to use carbon-14 dating and remote sensing technology to further
excavate the city in order to learn exactly when the capital was
built, when it flourished, and when it was abandoned.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists have asked for state-level protection for the
newly discovered ancient Shang Dynasty city.

<HEADLINE> Interview: WTO Seattle Failure A "Blessing In  Disguise": Supachai (2) By Xu Haijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
However, the benefits generated from the more favorable trading
environment have been distributed in an unequal manner, Supachai
said.
</P>
<P>
"The developed members have benefited from the various WTO
multilateral trade negotiations much more than the developing ones,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
"If this continues, there is little doubt that the majority of
nations will soon lose faith in the WTO as well as in the
multilateral trading system," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Supachai therefore called for more efforts to make the WTO a
truly universal organization wherein all can participate on an
equal footing.
</P>
<P>
He explained that this implies that favorable treatments and
considerations need to be given to the interests and genuine
concerns of developing and least-developed members in order for
them to participate more actively and effectively in the WTO.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that sufficient assistance be provided to non-
members in their attempt to gain admittance into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
When asked about China's possible entry into the WTO after
China and the United States reached bilateral trade agreement late
last year, Supachai said China's entry will be "an auspicious
event for China, the WTO, and the multilateral trading regime as a
whole."
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, he said, China will gain a great deal from
becoming a WTO member in terms of the sense of predictability,
transparency, and great access to markets and resources to
expedite the Chinese market reforms and thus enhance the
opportunity for growth and development.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the accession of China, a huge market of
over one billion people, will be a big boost for the WTO and the
entire multilateral trading system for it will greatly enhance the
attempt to create a more open and freer trading environment, he
said.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the process of globalization and its impact on
the world economies, Supachai said people should not shun
themselves from the process of globalization despite its negative
impact which could be seen from the spread of the Asian financial
crisis.
</P>
<P>
With a better and faster telecommunications system, advanced
computer technologies, and rapid innovation in financial and
information services, it is widely believed that globalization
would contribute positively to world development, Supachai said.
</P>
<P>
But he also pointed out that countries should continue to adapt
and properly adjust to the changing environment brought about by
globalization.
</P>
<P>
He said developing nations need to make far more adjustments
and far-reaching reforms so as to keep up with the rapid
globalization paces.
</P>
<P>
But with proper adjustments, they still gain more in terms of
increasing their resource base, expanding their market
opportunities, and expanding the needed technological know-how and
expertise.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said the world is facing an uphill battle in the
endeavor to establish a freer and fair multilateral trading system.
</P>
<P>
But once the battle is won, he said, after both the WTO and its
members make the necessary reforms and adjustments, there will be
"a new, more effective, and more vibrant international trading
organization," and "a multilateral trading environment which is
more robust, representing and working for the interest of all."

<HEADLINE> Interview: WTO Seattle Failure A "Blessing In  Disguise": Supachai (1) By Xu Haijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The result of the World Trade
Organization (WTO)'s Third Ministerial Conference held in the
northwestern U.S. city of Seattle in November last year is "a
blessing in disguise", Supachai Panitchpakdi, the WTO-Director
General-in-waiting, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a written interview with Xinhua, Supachai, Thailand's deputy
prime minister and commerce minister, said the breakdown of the
Seattle Conference was a "wake up call" to the more advanced WTO
members that they will need to give greater consideration to the
needs and interests of developing and least-developed members.
</P>
<P>
Since he began running for the post of WTO Director-General in
November 1998, Supachai has labeled himself as a representative of
developing nations and enjoyed popularity among developing members
of the world trade body.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, he said, the collapse of the Seattle talks
has revealed all of the urgency in searching and developing a more
effective and transparent decision-making process within the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"With the increase in the number of membership, it is clear
that the WTO institutional framework and negotiating tools would
need to be improved so as to accommodate the inevitable rise in
the number of diverse interests and complex issues as well as
differences in the basic values and culture of the participants,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Seattle Conference has revealed what are the areas that
require the utmost attention, Supachai said.
</P>
<P>
The first priority of the WTO in the new century, he said, must
be to ensure that the WTO continues to be an effective forum for
global trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to implore all member countries to maintain the
momentum of multilateral liberalization processes by intensifying
their efforts to find a common ground so that we can launch a new
round of trade negotiations," said Supachai, who will succeed the
current WTO Director-General Mike Moore in 2002.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that efforts should be made to assure that all
WTO agreements and future trade negotiations lead to the long-term
welfare and prosperity of the world economies as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Being a genuine international organization with 135 members
compared to 23 members in its predecessor, the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in 1948, the World Trade Organization
has gained increasing public awareness, he said.
</P>
<P>
It created rules and norms for international trading practices,
which injected greater predictability and transparency into the
world market place.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Begins Reducing Tariff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia started reducing its
customs tariff on January 1, 2000, the first step to comply with a
zero-tariff agreement of the ASEAN Free Trade Area, or AFTA.
</P>
<P>
Among roughly 7,000 products listed in the country's tariff,
about 3,100 items subject to immediate tariff reduction. Some 3,
500 items are temporarily excluded, while nearly 200 items such as
weapons, antiques and some agricultural products are excluded
permanently or listed as goods subject to negotiation.
</P>
<P>
The immediate tariff reduction items include machinery,
agricultural products and seldom-traded commodities.
</P>
<P>
According to the ASEAN department of the Finance Ministry, the
cut is aimed at promoting foreign and domestic investments and
minimizing the negative impact on Cambodia's economy, especially
on a national budget that relies heavily on customs revenue.
</P>
<P>
Tariffs on nearly 500 items, including dairy products, meat,
cloth and jewelry, will be reduced from 35 or 50 percent to 20 to
25 percent in the first year while Tariffs on metals and machinery
such as copper, drills and electrical appliances will be reduced
from 15 percent to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia, officially admitted to the ASEAN at the end of April
last year, is now required to gradually reduce its tariff to zero
by the year 2018 under the AFTA Agreement, in which member states
will be able to import commodities from ASEAN (the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) countries without taxes.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Forces in Korea Apologize for Evacuation Over Bomb Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Forces in Korea (USFK)
Friday apologized for having ignored South Korean residents when
it evacuated its personnel over a tip that terrorist bombs would
explode in Camp Edwards in Paju, South Korea.
</P>
<P>
"We deeply regret the inconvenience this incident has caused to
your civilian community and our coalition soldiers," said
Commanding General Robert Dees of the U.S. Second Infantry
Division in a letter to Paju Mayor Song Dal-yong.
</P>
<P>
The USFK was tipped off Tuesday morning from Washington that
bombs stored inside Camp Edwards were set to go off Wednesday, and
this caused a massive evacuation of U.S. military men in the camp.
</P>
<P>
The tip was found to be false.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 South Korean residents nearby were woken up by
sirens to evacuate at 1:30 a.m. Wednesday, seven hours after the
pull-out of U.S. servicemen from the military base in Paju which
is very close to the truce village of Panmunjom.
</P>
<P>
The residents trembled with fear for hours in the cold on the
street as there were no shelters prepared for them.
</P>
<P>
The USFK came under strong fire in the past few days for
neglecting the safety of South Koreans and exposing them to a
terrorist threat.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Utilizes 2.9 Billion-U.S. Dollars of Foreign Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing municipal government
announced today that the city's actual utilization of foreign
funds in 1999 is expected to reach as much as 2.9 billion U.S.
dollars, one percent more than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The goal for 1999 was set at 2.2 billion U.S. dollars, or 2.5
billion U.S. dollars at most. Statistics show that the figure for
the first 11 months last year was 2.7 billion U.S. dollars, 4.7
percent more than that of the corresponding period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Among this, 928 million U.S. dollars of foreign funds were
added to 230 ongoing foreign-funded projects, and 225 million U.S.
dollars of this amount came from 16 multinational corporations.
Thirty-three of the 47 large projects with investments of more
than 10 million U.S. dollars each were either in real estate or
high-tech enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The sales income of the city's 5,351 operational foreign-funded
enterprises for the first 11 months last year reached 107.3
billion yuan (about 12.9 billion U.S. dollars), 27.4 percent more
than the same 1998 period, and these enterprises realized net
profits of 660 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The total investment by 86,021 foreign-funded enterprises in
Beijing reached an accumulated 39.33 billion U.S. dollars by the
end of last year.

<HEADLINE> China to See Rapid Urbanization in New Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- China expects to have a total
urban population of 630 million and an urbanization rate of 45
percent by 2010, according to experts and officials with the
Ministry of Construction.
</P>
<P>
Vigorous local economic growth has led to the emergence of city
clusters nationwide, said Chen Xiaoli, director of Urban and Rural
Development Planning Department under the Ministry of Construction,
here today.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that most city clusters are concentrated in the
Yangtze and Pearl river deltas in the east and south of the
country, on the Liaodong Peninsula in the northeast, and in the
Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan region in the north.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that China had developed 666 cities by
the end of 1999, including 32 cities each with a population of
over one million. Forty-three cities have a population ranging
from 500,000 to one million each, 192 cities have a population of
200,000 to 500,000, and more than 400 small cities have a
population under 200,000.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that rapid urbanization has to a certain degree
improved the uneven distribution of cities between eastern and
western China. The former region accounts for 44 percent and the
latter 19 percent of the total number of cities.
</P>
<P>
The fast progress of urbanization in both eastern and western
regions has effectively helped improve economic development
nationwide, the official added.

<HEADLINE> Most Major Chinese Cities Report Poor Air Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The quality of air in most major
Chinese cities worsened this week, according to the weekly air
quality report issued today by the China Environmental Monitoring
Center.
</P>
<P>
Weak wind and weak cold current over most of China early this
week failed to disperse air pollutants, resulting in bad air. But
the quality of air improved later due to light to moderate snow,
helping to disperse pollutants.
</P>
<P>
Between December 31, 1999 and January 6, 2000, Guangzhou, Xi'an,
Beijing, Tianjin, Guilin, Changsha, Hangzhou, Shanghai, Chongqing,
and 11 other cities reported poor air, while Nanjing, Harbin,
Kunming, Suzhou, and 16 other mostly coastal cities reported
slightly polluted air.
</P>
<P>
Lanzhou, Hohhot, and Xining, three cities in northwest China,
reported hazardous air, while Taiyuan, Zhengzhou, and Yinchuan
reported unhealthy air.
</P>
<P>
Lanzhou, Hohhot, Xining and 33 other cities listed suspended
particles as the major pollutant.
</P>
<P>
Nitrogen oxide was the major pollutant in Shanghai, Guangzhou,
Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Nanchang, Ningbo, and Suzhou, while Chongqing,
Guiyang, and Qingdao claimed sulfur dioxide as the main culprit.

more ethnic minority cadres and promote the cultural level and
education of those ethnic groups each with a population below 100,
000.
</P>
<P>
State Councilor Ismail Amat attended today's meeting and urged
related departments to handle ethnic affairs better in order to
better serve the nation's reform, social stability, and
development.

<HEADLINE> No Extra Wage Rise for Civil Servants: Turkish PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit refused a demand for compensation of wage to keep up with
inflation by the Turkish Public Workers' labor Union, Turkish Daily
News reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit made it clear during meeting a delegation from the union
in his office. Resul Akay, chairman of the union, said after the
talks that while the government had raised civil servants' wages 56
percent, the inflation rate for 1999 was 68.8 percent in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Akay said that "civil servants are due 12.8 percent of wages
from the government. We asked for compensation from the prime
minister."
</P>
<P>
He reminded that on June 23 last year the government had
promised that the inflation rate would not exceed the wage increase
for civil servants and the government would not allow its workers'
wages be eroded by inflation.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister pledged, however, in his meetings that Turkey
would be free of its economic difficulties in a few months and when
the economy recovers, the conditions of civil servants and
pensioners will be bettered first, Akay added.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Launches Fresh Campaign Against PKK Militants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Five members of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) were arrested in southeast Turkey in a
recent government campaign against the separatist militant group,
the Turkish Daily News reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Emergency Rule Governor Office on
Thursday said that three of the PKK militants were captured in
Lice, Diyabakir and two in Dargecit, Mardin.
</P>
<P>
The operations are still under way, the statement added. The PKK
has declared a cease-fire since September 1, but this rejected by
the Turkish government as a ploy to save Abdullah Ocalan's life.
</P>
<P>
The Kurdish rebel leader was captured by Turkish a commando in
Nairobi, capital of Kenya in Febuary, and was sentenced in June to
death for leading the 15-year war for Kurdish autonomy. Some 37,000
people, mostly Kurds, have died in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan has sent out a call from his cell last November on his
followers to lay down arms. But a number of hardliners vowed to
continue their fight in the mountainous areas, either remaining
inside the organization or splitting to form a separatist gang.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, four members of the pro-Kurdish People's Democracy
Party were arrested after police found illegal publications
relating to the PKK in a search of the party's building in
Sanliurfa in southeast Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, leaders of the three parties which
form the coalition government, namely the pro-secular Democratic
Left Party (DSP), the right-wing Nationalist Movement Party (MHP)
and the central-right Motherland Party (ANAP), are scheduled to
take up the Ocalan issue at their meeting on January 12.
</P>
<P>
Ankara is hard pressed to comply with the European Union
criteria, including a reconsideration of Ocalan's death sentence.
The EU has abolishes capital punishment, and the Ocalan case
becomes a real test of Ankara's aspiration for the EU membership.
</P>
<P>
Turkey was named a candidate member of the EU at the bloc's
Helsinki summit last November.

<HEADLINE> Manila Helps Overseas Filipinos in Distress  in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Friday that it continued its efforts in 1999 to help thousands of
overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) in distress and freed hundreds of
those detained in foreign jails.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Foreign Affairs said in a report that it
assisted thousands of overseas-based Filipinos by handling 12,548
cases from January to September 1999.
</P>
<P>
The cases involve individual and mass repatriation, employment
follow-ups, insurance and death benefit claims, shipment of
remains and personal effects of deceased Filipinos, and rendering
assistance to imprisoned, detained, injured and sick OFWs.
</P>
<P>
In addressing the problems facing OFWs and other overseas
Filipinos in terms of the number of cases, the government's
efforts "had brought landmark success," Foreign Secretary Domingo
Siazon said.
</P>
<P>
"With assistance to nationals as one of the main pillars of
Philippine foreign policy, Philippine diplomacy has taken on a
more human face," he added.
</P>
<P>
The earlier report released by the Department of Labor and
Employment said it had deployed a total of 664,643 overseas
Filipino workers (OFWs) between January and September 1999, up by
1.56 percent compared to the 654,460 registered in 1998.
</P>
<P>
For the January-July period in 1999, foreign exchange
remittance of overseas workers amounted to 4.47 billion U.S.
dollars. The government expects foreign remittance to reach 8
billion to 10 billion dollars in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's 4 Islam-Based Parties Agree to Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's four Islam-based
political parties have agreed to merge into one, General Chairman
of the United Development Party (PPP) Hamzah Haz announced here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The other three political parties are the National Mandate
Party (PAN), the Justice Party (PK) and the Crescent Star Party (
PBB).
</P>
<P>
Addressing a rally reportedly attended by about one million
Muslims at the National Monument here Friday morning, Hamzah said
unity among the country's Islamic political parties would greatly
benefit the Indonesian Muslims as they stand as one.
</P>
<P>
There should be one Muslim political power in the next general
election, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hamzah was responding to President Abdurrahman Wahid's recent
statement that in the future, there will only be two political
parties -- the National Awakening Party which he founded and the
Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle led by Vice President
Megawati Soekarnoputri.
</P>
<P>
Hamzah said that it would be better to have one big Muslim
party which has more power, than to have many small Muslim parties
with smaller powers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, General Chairman of PAN and Chairman of the People's
Consultative Assembly (MPR) Amien Rais promised to make the
necessary moves to realize the merger soon.
</P>
<P>
The four political parties all together got about 20 percent of
the votes in the general election held in June last year.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Petrochemical Aims High in New Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Petrochemical
Company Limited (SPC), China's leading petrochemical producer, is
preparing to start a large joint venture with Britain's BP.
</P>
<P>
Lu Yiping, SPC's chairman and general manager, said the venture,
with a designed annual production capacity of 650,000 tons of
ethylene, is expected to turn his company into one of the world's
top petrochemical corporations.
</P>
<P>
Located in southwest of Shanghai, SPC is a highly integrated
petrochemical complex whose main products are synthetic fibers,
plastics, and various other kinds of petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
SPC began a series of technical improvement programs several
years ago, and one, completed last year, increased the 300,000-ton
ethylene production capacity to 400,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
By year 2005, when all the programs are completed, the company'
s annual oil refining capacity is expected to reach eight million
tons and ethylene production capacity 1.5 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has listed the petrochemical industry as
one of the country's development priorities for the 1996-2010
period.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has also made the petrochemical industry a new
economic focus and has decided to build a new chemical industrial
zone around SPC.

<HEADLINE> Elders Living Better, Happier Lives In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- There is an ancient Chinese
saying that the happiness between husband and wife is more
desirable than spending life as a god.
</P>
<P>
So says 103-year-old Zhang Zongying when talking about his
happy 80-year marriage to his dearest Huang Ouxin, who is one year
younger.
</P>
<P>
The centenarian couple live a peaceful and happy life on
Chongming Island at the mouth of the Yangtze River in the East
China Sea. Chongming Island, one of Shanghai's counties, is
considered a good place for people seeking a long life because of
its charming local scenery and pleasant weather.
</P>
<P>
The couple has a large family, with five sons, two daughters,
and grandchildren and great-grandchildren. All their descendants
pay great filial piety to the elderly couple, and make it possible
for them to enjoy their later years.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the local government shows great care for the
elders by granting them a stipend every month to buy nutritional
food and providing them with free medical care. Local officials
also visit them on important holidays.
</P>
<P>
Elderly residents of Shanghai now live longer, happier, and
fuller lives than in the past because they get much more attention
from the local government and society in general.
</P>
<P>
To serve the aging, a comprehensive network has been
established in Shanghai covering a variety of areas including
medical services, entertainment, and education.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is one of the nation's cities facing a serious aging

HAIKOU, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Heavy fog since last night
delayed several flights in the southern island province of Hainan
while ten were canceled, including one to Hong Kong, local
aviation authorities said today.
</P>
<P>
The visibility was only 200 meters early this morning, far

<P>
The weather did not clear until late this morning, when the

SHANGHAI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Customs revenue for the city of
Shanghai reached 34.5 billion yuan (about 4.14 billion U.S.
dollars) last year, 94.7 percent more than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
This figure was 16.7 billion yuan higher than the central
government's target customs revenue for the city for 1999, a
record high, customs officials said today.
</P>
<P>
Of the total revenue, 12.66 billion yuan was from imports, up
95.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists attributed the big increase mainly to the efforts to
expand domestic demand and increase trade activities, as well as
the stern campaign against smuggling.

Shanghai, as a major trade and financial center, handles one-
fifth of China's imports and exports.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Cartoon Producers Compete for Domestic Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Animation Film
Studio is now making a 52- volume cartoon series "Music Up", which
is expected to be shown on TV at the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Being different from the "Lotus Lantern", the studio will
choose amateurs from the over 1,500 applicants to do the dubbing
job.
</P>
<P>
"We do so, for we want to provide a chance for the audience to
participate in the production so as to make it more acceptable and
humorous," said Jin Guoping, the studio manager.
</P>
<P>
The characters in the series look a little similar to those in
Japanese cartoons, for the makers did a study of the Japanese
cartoon characters, while their facial expressions, eyes, and the
costumes are rather Chinese characterized.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China produced only a total 6,000 minutes
of cartoon products last year, more or less the same with that of
one Japanese cartoon company. While the need for cartoon programs
of one domestic TV station alone is about 7,300 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 36 million of the Chinese population are below the
age of 17, composing the main part of the audience, but the slow
development of domestic cartoon industry has left a large space
for foreign producers.
</P>
<P>
Instead of home cartoon characters, Chinese people have been
deeply impressed with Mickey Mouse, Tom Cat, and Chibi Maruko Chan.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for low yield of homemade cartoon is the lack
of investment, pointed out Zhang Songlin, vice president and
secretary general of the China Animation Film Association, adding
that the annual governmental allocation for the industry is only
60 million yuan, as the Disney's "Lion King" alone cost as much as
60 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Lotus Lantern", which was on show last August, received warm
welcome nationwide, with its box office income reaching 25 million
yuan, more than that of Disney's "Mulan".
</P>
<P>
Jin said that it is a successful try in market operations. And
it has also been a inspirer to the long-time weary domestic
cartoon industry, though there is still much room for further
improvement in story telling, and character sculpturing.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that lack of humor and dry sermonizing have also
contributed to the lag domestic cartoon industry. Cartoon, as a
kind of entertainment, must be, first of all, entertaining.
</P>
<P>
The competition brought by the market operational system will
surely encourage more and more home cartoon producers to shift
their attention to the needs of the audience.
</P>
<P>
Jin said that China's entry of WTO (World Trade Organization)
will not despair domestic cartoon producers. " We will not sit
there and see the domestic market to be occupied by the foreign
cartoon producers. But rather we would grasp every possible
opportunity to develop ourselves and compete with them."
</P>
<P>
China has only produced five cartoon films in the last 70 years
of development, while Disney has up to now made 37 films, and
Japan has already formed their own cartoon characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Liang Xiaotao, director of the Animation Department of the
China Central Television, said that the "Lotus Lantern" was a
bright spot in cartoon filming industry in 1999, while the Chinese
producers ought to see clearly that there is still a long way to
go to catch up with the Disney.
</P>
<P>
What is important now for the Chinese cartoon makers is to set
practical goals according to their actual conditions, and to
prevent blindly copying Disney and Japanese cartoon industry.
</P>
<P>
The output of the Shanghai Animation Film Studio has seen rapid
increase since its entering into market in 1994, with the figure
up to 1,800 minutes in 1999. And its output is expected to reach 5,
000 minutes this year.

<HEADLINE> China Reaches "Turning Point" in Revamping SOEs (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- China has reached the "turning
point" in revamping its large and medium-sized state-own
enterprises (SOE), thanks to the government's "pro-active fiscal
policy" and various reform measures, said Sheng Huaren, minister
in charge of the State Economic and Trade Commission, here today.
</P>
<P>
"Most important of all the government measures were allowing
more bankruptcy, merger, debt-equity swap and government subsidies
for technological renovations," Sheng told a group of 200 deputies
in Beijing to the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Xiang Huaicheng, minister of finance, and Wang Chunzheng, vice-
minister of State Development Planning Commission, also joined
Sheng in reporting the country's economic work to deputies to the
country's top lawmaking body.
</P>
<P>
In the first 11 months of 1999, industrial profits of the SOEs
and enterprises with SOEs as major stock owners doubled the volume
of the same period in 1998 to 76.51 billion yuan, and the number
of loss-makers has decreased by about half from the end of 1997 to
some 3,000 today, Sheng revealed.
</P>
<P>
In the first ten months last year, 26 of China's 30 provinces,
autonomous regions, and municipalities saw their overall SOE
performance improved to varying degrees.
</P>
<P>
The northeastern provinces, China's heavy industry center and
in the red for years, all started to make money, and the profits
made by Heilongjiang Province jumped by 108.3 percent over 1998.
</P>
<P>
Textiles, petrochemical, machinery, electronic, pharmaceutical,
metallurgy, and construction material industries all started to
make profits, Sheng said.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Chunzheng of the State Development Planning
Commission, the 60 billion yuan national debt in 1999, in addition
to 100 billion yuan debt in 1998 floated for the purchase of state-
owned banks and designed to increase fixed assets investment, has
greatly contributed to the stimulation of market demand and the
improved performance of the country's SOEs.

<TEXT>
<P>
Sheng, minister in charge of the State Economic and Trade
Commission, said that bankruptcy and mergers were the most
important factors leading to the streamlining and restructuring of
the SOEs.
</P>
<P>
More than 6,400 large- and medium-sized SOEs saw their size
reduced and profits increased through these means during the three
years from 1997 to 1999, and 860 such SOEs, which benefited from
the same efforts last year, are expected to stop losing money,
Sheng told the legislators.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that 90 billion yuan was used in the pilot
debt-equity swap scheme for 45 loss-making enterprises by mid-
December last year, and most of the enterprises involved should
put an end to their losses and make profits that year.
</P>
<P>
According to Finance Minister Xiang, the state put 13 billion
yuan in subsidizing the technological renovations of 648 SOEs last
year, with a total investment of 60 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Other factors contributing to the SOE revamping include: down-
sizing out-dated or inefficient industries, increasing export
rebates, cracking down upon smuggling, and improving government
regulations and the internal operation mechanism of SOEs, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
However, Sheng pointed out that market demand is still slack,
and the number of loss-makers and their losses and bad debts are
still huge.
</P>
<P>
"The turn for the better with regard to SOE profits and
efficiency is preliminary, but it is a shot in the arms for us to
realize the three-year goal of rejuvenating many of them," Sheng
said.

MACAO, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Macao International Airport
handled more than 2.64 million passengers in 1999, an increase of
19 percent over the previous year, the latest figures released by
the airport show.
</P>
<P>
In December alone, more than 210,000 passengers came to Macao
via the airport, up by 15 percent from the same month of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The increase is believed to be related to the effect of Macao's
return to the motherland. In 1999, there had been more personnel
exchanges and tourist arrivals over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Cargo traffic at the airport stood at 53,118 tons last year, an
18 percent drop from 1998.
</P>
<P>
The airport witnessed booming cargo traffic in 1998, as there
was something wrong at the Hong Kong new airport during July and

<HEADLINE> HK Government Committed to Promoting E-commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government is
committed to promoting e-commerce to help retain Hong Kong's
competitive edge and to drive its overall economic expansion, a
senior official said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a forum on Hong Kong's competitiveness in the new
millennium, Director of Information Technology Services Lau Kam-
hung said that the conduct of trade through the Internet was
gaining popularity worldwide.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the total amount of trade conducted all over the world
through the Internet was 200 billion U.S. dollars. The number of
consumers who shop on the Internet are expected to increase from
31 million in 1998 to 183 million by 2003.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are about 1.5 million of Internet users in
Hong Kong and the use of the Internet in Hong Kong last year,
calculated in the time spent on the dail-up network, doubled that
in 1998, according to Lau.
</P>
<P>
The total amount of trade of goods and services in Hong Kong
conducted over the Internet is predicted by the industry to rise
to 2.4 billion U.S. dollars by 2003 from 60 million U.S. dollars
in 1998, Lau said.
</P>
<P>
With a view to promoting and facilitating e-commerce in Hong
Kong, Lau said, the Hong Kong government has adopted a proactive
approach to enhance Hong Kong's infrastructure and services.
</P>
<P>
The government is working with the Hong Kong Post in the
development of a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) to enhance the
users' confidence in electronic transactions, Lau said.
</P>
<P>
The Information Technology Services Department is going to set
up the Certification Authority Recognition Office (CARO) to
support the PKI, he said.
</P>
<P>
Through the use of digital certificates issued by certification
authorities (CAs) and digital signatures, participants in
electronic transactions will be able to ensure the authenticity,
security, integrity and non-repudiation of messages exchanged in
the transactions, he said.
</P>
<P>
To provide the necessary legal framework for the conduct of
electronic transactions in Hong Kong, the government had
introduced into the Legislative Council the Electronic
Transactions Bill which was enacted on January 5, Lau said.
</P>
<P>
With the enactment of the Bill, electronic records and
signatures used in electronic transactions will have the same
legal status as that of their paper-based counterparts, and a
framework is established to promote and facilitate the operation
of CAs to ensure trust and security in electronic transactions.
</P>
<P>
"To lead by example in the adoption of e-commerce, the
government is going to introduce the Electronic Service Delivery (
ESD) scheme," Lau said, adding that the scheme was expected to be
launched in October this year.
</P>
<P>
Lau believed the ESD scheme could help create an environment
conducive to the development and adoption of e-commerce as the
open and common information infrastructure being developed for the
scheme would be available to the private sector for conducting e-
commerce at a later stage.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- A 14-year-old boy was eaten
Thursday by a crocodile in Tana River in eastern Kenya, local
police officers have confirmed.
</P>
<P>
The victim, identified as Charles Mukungi, was in the river for
a bath when the reptile got hold of him near the river bank, the
East African Standard daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
As he struggled to free himself from the beast, it dragged him
deep into the river and swallowed him alive.
</P>
<P>
The cases of killing by crocodiles are reported rather
frequently in the east African country, which values the
protection of wild animals and therefore causes a dilemma for its
residents.

LUSAKA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The International Y2K cooperation
center (IY2KCC) and its partners have pledged support to the third
world countries that may experience computer and automated control
system malfunctions in the next few months, Times of Zambia
newspaper reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report leaders of the global Y2K team
assembled under the auspices of the United Nations and supported
by the World Bank made the pledge following the roll over from
1999 to 2000 without significant disruptions.
</P>
<P>
Members of the IY2KCC said in a statement that glitches were
expected to continue over the weeks ahead although the global
center was confident that most could be dealt with locally.
</P>
<P>
"We are proud of the outstanding international program that has
 successfully addressed the potentially serious impacts of the Y2K
computer problem," IY2KCC director Bruce McConnell was quoted by
the newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
McConnell hailed the unprecedented international cooperation
and dedicated efforts of the millions of Y2K workers to whom he
attributed the center's success.
</P>
<P>
"We believe it is now appropriate to reduce the level of
monitoring and return to a more routine schedule," said the
director whose center was set up in February last year to update
computer and automated control systems.
</P>
<P>
The director said there could have been much more dramatic
speculative movements in 1999 with significant economic and social
costs had the threat of the millennium bug been completely
ignored.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean HIV-infected Cases Sharply Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 7 (Xinhua) -- A total of 187 South Koreans were
newly infected with HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) that causes
AIDS last year, bringing the number of HIV patients to 1063, said
the Health and Welfare Ministry Friday.
</P>
<P>
The newly-infected sufferers showed a sharp rise of 45 percent
in contrast with an annual average growth rate of 12.8 percent
over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the sharp rise to the fact more people
were tested for HIV last year after the South Korean government
allowed the results to be reported anonymously.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1063 patients, 34 developed full-blown AIDS last year
while 44 died of the disease or other causes.
</P>
<P>
Among 945 patients, 905 contracted the virus through sexual
contact while 38 were infected through transfusions of blood or
blood-based pharmaceutical products and two young children
inherited the virus from their mothers.
</P>
<P>
By age, 381 sufferers were in their 30s while 337 were in their
20s.
</P>
<P>
South Korea reported its first HIV case in 1985.

SEOUL, January 7 (Xinhua) -- South Korea enjoyed the highest
stocks price rise among Asian countries or areas at 82.8 percent
last year due to the faster-than-expected economic recovery, said
the Bank of Korea Friday.
</P>
<P>
Singapore ranked the second with 78 percent, followed by
Indonesia with 70.1 percent, Hong Kong 68.8 percent, Malaysia 38.6
percent and Thailand 35.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The stocks in Taiwan of China showed the poorest performance in
Asia, up only 31.6 percent because of the impact of political
issues and devastating earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the economic recovery of Asian and European countries
and a robust U.S. economy, most global investors expect stocks
prices to continue their upward momentum this year, said the Bank
of Korea Friday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank predicted that easing concerns over the much-
hyped Y2K computer bug would significantly increase the inflow of
foreign funds into Asian stock markets.

WASHINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- After a humiliating loss to
Vancouver, Miami Heat center Alonzo Mourning scored 28 points and
blocked nine shots to pace the Heats for a 111-99 victory over the
Houston Rockets on Thursday.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Monks Win Lawsuit Against Cigarette Factory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Monks of the Daming Temple in
Yangzhou City of east China's Jiangsu Province recently won a
lawsuit against a factory making "Daming Temple" brand cigarettes,
and the factory must pay 20,000 yuan in compensation for
infringement of the temple name, according to a court ruling.
</P>
<P>
The use of the temple name as trade mark for cigarettes is
regarded as an offense against Buddhist practices, which forbids
smoking.
</P>
<P>
The temple's monks were unable to negotiate with the Laifeng
Cigarette Factory privately and were forced to resort to the court.
</P>
<P>
The cigarette factory, based in Hubei Province, central China,
began to produce "Daming Temple" cigarettes last year.
</P>
<P>
The 1,000-year-old Daming Temple is considered one of China's
most important Buddhist sites, enjoying high prestige among
Buddhists in China and abroad.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Heavy snowfall since the
beginning of the new year has affected the agricultural
production in northeast China's Liaoning Province, destroying a
number of vegetable greenhouses.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that the frequent snows, rarely seen since 1956,
have crushed greenhouses in the Panjin, Fushun and Anshan areas.
</P>
<P>
Agronomists said the snow cover has also blocked sunlight
which is important for killing insects, and ultimately has
affected the vegetable supplies to the provincial capital city of
Shenyang and other major cities.
</P>
<P>
However, they also pointed out that some good has come of the
nasty weather: The snow has improved the moisture content in soil,
easing the drought that started last year, and will also put more
water in reservoirs. In addition, it has covered the wheat
farmland like a warm blanket, spurring the growth of the crop.
</P>
<P>
Plant diseases and insect pests that descended on large tracts
of forest in the warm winter of 1998 seemed to have vanished from
the province thanks to low temperatures brought by the recent snow.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Reaps Bumper Grain Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region in
southwest China harvested 917 million kg of grain and 38 million
kg of rapeseed in 1999, an increase of 7.9 and 10.5 percent,
respectively, from the previous year, a regional agricultural
department official said today.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the good harvest to the improvement of
low-yield farmland, the spread of modern agricultural techniques,
the application of improved crop strains, and the increase of
multiple cropping areas.
</P>
<P>
To improve agricultural production, the regional government
allocated 400 million yuan annually in the past few years, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
So far, Tibet has set up 27 commodity grain production bases
with a combined area accounting for 60 percent of the region's
total farmland, producing 560,000 tons of grain and oilseeds a
year, 64 percent of the region's total.
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, the region had to import 150 million kg of grain
from other parts of China annually. But at present, Tibet boasts
surplus grain capable of meeting local needs for five years.
</P>
<P>
In northwest China, Gansu Province reported a grain harvest of
8.1 billion kg in 1999, the third-highest output in its history.
This resulted from a change in the crop mix and the spread of new
techniques.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Expects Lowest Temperature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The temperature in northeast
China's Liaoning Province today is very likely to fall to around -
30 degrees Celsius, the lowest in over four decades.
</P>
<P>
Records from the local meteorological observatory show that the
last time it was this cold in Liaoning was 1955. Apparently,
global warming in the decade or so caused the local people to
become accustomed to a warmer winter.
</P>
<P>
"I would rather endure the freezing days, because snow makes
the sky bluer and it will also be a lot of fun," said Chen Jia, a
16-year-old middle school student.
</P>
<P>
Many more residents have caught colds this winter because of
the low temperatures. "Cold makes me feel a bit sick, but it is
worthwhile. Snowfall brings us a clean environment, and we have
not seen so much snow for a long time," said one elderly patient
named Wang Zheng.
</P>
<P>
Northeast China is one of the coldest part of China during the
winter, with below freezing temperatures for most of the season.

<HEADLINE> Cold Wave Brings Losses to South China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The south China province of
Guangdong, battered by a cold wave last month, reported heavy
losses of winter crops and fruits over some 66,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
As the worst cold weather in 30 years in this subtropical
province began on December 17, 1999, temperatures dropped abruptly
to -3 degree Celsius, and most areas of the province were
enveloped in frost, quite rare here, according to experts with the
provincial observatory.
</P>
<P>
The cold weather broke on December 25. No cold-related deaths
were reported during the period, but it affected the vegetable and
fruit markets in the northern part of the country, which depends
heavily on the supply from Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
The temperature has returned to normal and several million
local residents have been mobilized to save the crops and fruit.
</P>
<P>
Some tropical fruits such as bananas will be lost, said sources
with the local orchards.

<HEADLINE> China's Economy to Retain Rapid Growth in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- China's economy this year is
expected to grow faster than last year and probably attain a
growth rate of 7.5 percent, Chinese economists have said.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that the economy grew by 7.1 percent in
1999, meeting the beginning-of-the-year target for growth.
</P>
<P>
"Based on the economic situation in 1999, China's economy will
maintain a steady and improving momentum as the gross domestic
product grows by 7-7.5 percent this year," said economist Xiao
Zhuoji, a professor at the prestigious Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
In a newly published book "Analysis and Forecast of China's
Economic Situation in 2000", a group of authoritative economists
from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences say that economic
growth will stand at between 7.5 and eight percent this year.
</P>
<P>
They predict that the first industry will grow by 3.5 percent,
while the second and tertiary industries will grow by nine percent
and seven percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Professor Wang Songqi, deputy director of the Financial
Research Center at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told
Xinhua that this year, the Chinese government is expected to
continue to pursue an active fiscal policy. He predicts that the
country's economic performance will be better than last year, with
a growth rate of nearly eight percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists here widely agree on the positive forces behind this
year's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
First, deflation is being alleviated as measures taken by the
government had begun to take effect. This year, consumption will
receive a boost from the holidays, celebrations and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Second, the recovery of the Asian economy and the soundness of
the economies of Europe and America have helped create favorable
conditions for China to increase exports. Exports are expected to
grow by 8-10 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Third, acceleration of reform will improve efficiency and
profits of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the launch of large-scale development in the western
part of the country will also help promote economic growth this
year.
</P>
<P>
According to the results of a random survey conducted by 13
surveyors in 14 cities around China in the end of 1999, nearly 58
percent of urban residents expect a better economic situation in
2000. Another 23 percent of urban residents believe that the
economic situation will remain unchanged this year, while only 7.7
percent of the people questioned are less optimistic about this
year's economic situation.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, economists pointed out that there are still
many difficulties in economic development this year, including
inadequate demand and deflation.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the retail sales of commodities increased 6.8 percent,
slower than the overall growth rate of the economy. So far, the
prices of production material have been dropping for 44
consecutive months, while the prices of consumer goods kept
decreasing for 25 consecutive months. And the prices of retail
goods showed merely a marginal recovery. Economists say that the
consumer market has yet to see any bright spots.

<HEADLINE> Top German Orchestra to Perform in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Dresden State Orchestra of
Saxony, Germany, will make its China debut in Beijing late this
month.
</P>
<P>
The 115-member orchestra, under the baton of the outstanding

unique tradition of playing productions by Weber, Wagner and
Strauss, while presenting a varied repertoire of works by Haydn,
Mozart, Verdi, Puccini and others.

<HEADLINE> Method Passed for Choosing NPC Deputies From Macao SAR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 7 (Xinhua) -- A specific method for choosing the
deputies from the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) to the
Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) of China was passed here
this morning by a local electoral conference.
</P>
<P>
According to the election method, residents of the Macao SAR,
who are over 18 years of age and have Chinese citizenship, can
apply for candidates for NPC deputies if they are able to collect
recommending letters from 10 or more members of the electoral
conference.
</P>
<P>
Applicants are required to ask for and turn in registration
forms in person from January 8 to 22. In the meantime, they should
submit the sufficient number of recommending letters, according to
the method.
</P>
<P>
The election will be held on January 28 through a multi-
candidate system and secret ballot. Considering the fact that
seven new NPC deputies from the Macao SAR shall be chosen, a
preliminary election may be held to decide final candidates if
there are too many applicants.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a regulation which restrains the behavior of
electoral conference members was passed together with the election
method.
</P>
<P>
The regulation makes it clear that the members can only act on
behalf of themselves, they cannot request or receive bribes from
applicants or candidates, and that they cannot influence the
stance of other members.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Signs of Golden-Weather Economy in NZ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Consumer confidence in New
Zealand has rocketed to its highest in three years, a good sign
for a golden-weather economy this year, according to a local bank
survey.
</P>
<P>
The latest WestpacTrust survey shows confidence up six points
to more than 120 last month, the best level since December 1996.
</P>
<P>
A figure above 100 shows more optimists than pessimists. A
figure under 100 shows a gloomy outlook.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a net 24 percent of those surveyed expected good
economic times in the next 12 months, up strongly from a net one
percent in September expecting bad times.
</P>
<P>
"A strong rise in consumer confidence is further evidence that
the economy is firmly in growth mode," WestpacTrust's chief
economist Bevan Graham said in the survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey was taken in the first couple of weeks of December,
just after the general election. The change of government appears
to have raised the confidence of those over 50 years of age and
the unemployed.

<HEADLINE> Cultural Exchanges Active in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua)-- Cultural exchange activities
between China and foreign countries in 1999 have added splendid
flavor to China's artistic stages, and the country's home-grown
talent has won high acclaim overseas.
</P>
<P>
Included on the list of prestigious performers coming to China
last year were the U.S. National Orchestra, Japan's Takarazuka
Revue Company, the British Royal Ballet and the Russian Kirov
Ballet. Performances by various Chinese artists overseas included
a cultural week about China in Paris, a performing tour of Japan
by Chinese Beijing Opera artists and acrobatic troupes, and
European trips by the Central Nationalities Orchestra and the
Beijing Opera.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Cultural Ministry show that in 1999 China
sent 486 performing groups and hosted 128 exhibitions abroad in
addition to receiving 299 foreign groups and 99 exhibitions at
home. Chinese cultural delegations visited about 20 countries and
cultural delegations from more than 30 countries visited China.
</P>
<P>
Also last year, cultural minister Sun Jiazheng made an
important visit to the U.S., the first by a government official in
his position in the past 20 years since the establishment of
diplomatic ties between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Muslims Call For Solution to Conflict in  Maluku </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Muslims Friday called
for an immediate solution to the communal conflict that had
crippled the eastern province of Maluku since early last year.
</P>
<P>
About one million Muslims from various mass organizations
flocked to Monas Square here Friday morning in a show of
solidarity.
</P>
<P>
They issued a joint declaration stating that the history of
human civilization has recorded that Islam is able to enjoy
peaceful coexistence with communities of different faiths.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by People's Consultative Assembly
Chairman Amien Rais (general chairman of the National Mandate
Party), General Chairman of the United Development Party Hamzah
Haz and leaders from the Justice Party and the Crescent Star Party.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Rais asked President Abdurrahman Wahid and the
military to solve the Maluku clashes in one week.
</P>
<P>
Hamzah in his speech asked the government to declare military
emergency in the province.
</P>
<P>
Located about 2,400 km northeast of Jakarta, Maluku province
covers 86,000 square km.
</P>
<P>
Clashes first erupted on January 19 last year on the island of
Ambon following a dispute between a public transport driver and a
migrant. The violence has since spread to at least five other
islands in the Maluku archipelago, once noted for its religious
harmony.
</P>

According to the military, a year of conflict between Muslims
and Christians in the islands have left more than 1,134 people
dead, over 2,300 others injured and 8,500 buildings, including 122
places of worship, damaged or burned.

HARARE, January 7 (Xinhua) -- At least 127 Cuban doctors are
expected to arrive in Zimbabwe this month to help alleviate the
acute shortage of doctors, especially in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The assistance is a result of a meeting held between
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe and Cuban President Fidel
Castro in September last year, the daily Herald reported on

</P>
<P>
He said the doctors would be attached to the major hospitals
for introduction during the first few months before deployment to
rural hospitals, where there was a critical shortage.
</P>
<P>
"I am very impressed at the way the Cubans are so committed to
their work and not money. All of them are ready to work in the
rural areas," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- There have been so far no Y2K-
related problems which can have a serious effect on routine work
in Myanmar, the New Light of Myanmar reported Friday, quoting an
announcement of the country's Y2K related Problems Supervisory
National Committee (Y2K PSNC).
</P>
<P>
However, in the communications sector, there has been a slight
change in the data of a mail system and measures are being taken
to solve that problem, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to Minister of Communications, Posts and Telegraphs
Brigadier-General Win Tin, who is also the Y2K PSNC's chairman,
Myanmar has no large computer network to speak of and taking the
precautionary measure for Y2K is not difficult.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K PSNC was set up last January and three sub-committees
on Y2K awareness, problem identification and problem solving were
further formed to deal with the issue.
</P>
<P>
With the cooperation of Japanese experts and the respective
Myanmar ministries, the country announced in December that all the
Y2K problems have been solved and that it was "ready for Y2K."
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry as
well as some foreign organizations have been offering to help
Myanmar for the Y2K problem.

<HEADLINE> Disney Names New Top Executives for Asia-Pacific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Walt Disney Co. Thursday
named four executives to top posts in the Asia-Pacific region,
apparently in a continuing effort to strengthen its operations
there.
</P>
<P>
Disney is focusing heavily on gaining overseas market share for
its consumer products. It created the new Walt Disney
International division in 1999 for that purpose and installed
veteran ABC chief Robert Iger as its head.
</P>
<P>
"Asia offers tremendous growth potential," Iger said in a
statement. "Today's announcement of appointments to key Asian
posts completes the lineup of our top regional and country
executives at Walt Disney International."
</P>
<P>
Edward Borgerding was named as executive vice president for
Asia-Pacific, Koji Hoshino as executive vice president for Japan,
Brian Spaulding as chief financial officer for Asia-Pacific, and
Jun Tang as vice president for China affairs.
</P>
<P>
Borgerding, 44, who also will serve as Walt Disney
International's manager for Hong Kong, is a 20-year Disney veteran
and one of the original executives to start the Walt Disney
Television International division in London in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Hoshino, 43, has been a senior vice president for Disney's
video company, Buena Vista Home Entertainment, in Japan, and has
been with Disney for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Spaulding, 39, most recently served in the Asia-Pacific region
as vice president, business development and finance, for Walt
Disney Television International.
</P>
<P>
Tang, 38, has served as vice president of China affairs. A
native of China, he continues to be responsible for Disney's
relationship with the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
Disney generates 80 percent of its 23 billion U.S. dollars in
annual revenue within the United States, and the rest overseas.
It wants to duplicate its domestic revenue and profits in Asia-
Pacific region.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Navy Blockades Maluku Waters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Navy Thursday
deployed nine warships and five warplanes to blockade Maluku
waters, press reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"To blockade the waters, we have set up a task force led by
First Admiral Ferdinand Manengkey," Navy spokesman Second Admiral
T. Ontowiryo was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The navy seaport in Bitung, North Sulawesi, is also well-
prepared to support the operation, Ontowiryo said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, thousands of troops fanned out across the Maluku
provincial capital of Ambon on Thursday to quell the prolonged
bloodshed in the territory.
</P>
<P>
According to the Jakarta Post, Ambon had remained generally
peaceful over the last two days. Offices were open on Thursday,
but very few employees were present.
</P>
<P>
A curfew is still in effect, but local people said they felt
more secure. The military continued door-to-door searches for
weapons in the city.
</P>
<P>
Maluku military chief Max Tamaela said in Ambon that the
military has reestablished control of Seram island near Ambon.
However, the situation on Halmahera island in North Maluku was
still uncertain after reports said hundreds of people may have
died on Tuesday and Wednesday in fierce fighting.
</P>
<P>
Tamaela said the military had sent in extra troops to try to
quell the violence on Halmahera but he said he didn't know if
clashes had ended.
</P>
<P>
Maluku Governor Saleh Latuconsina said he regretted inaccurate
media reports which have tended to exaggerate the number of dead.
</P>
<P>
"I really regret the way the press has focused on this without
double-checking their sources," he said, adding that such reports
were creating an unhealthy atmosphere and did little to help the
peace that local officials were trying to forge.
</P>
<P>
Located about 2,400 km northeast of Jakarta, Maluku province
covers 86,000 square km.
</P>
<P>
Clashes first erupted on January 19 last year on the island of
Ambon following a dispute between a public transport driver and a
migrant. The violence has since spread to the Maluku archipelago,
once noted for its religious harmony.
</P>
<P>
According to the military, a year of conflict between Muslims
and Christians in the islands have left more than 1,134 dead, over
2,300 injured and 8,500 buildings, including 122 places of worship,
damaged or burned.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands have fled their homes, seeking refuge with
the local military or elsewhere in the country.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Queries Malaysia's Promises in AFTA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 7 (Xinhua) -- A senior Thai government
official said that Malaysia should not be allowed to enjoy the
ASEAN tariff-reduction scheme if it continues to exclude its
vehicles and spare parts from the list of products under the ASEAN
Free Trade Area Agreement (AFTA), The Nation reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Charnchai Musignisarkorn, deputy director general of the
Finance Ministry's Fiscal Policy Office, was quoted as saying that
the 10 countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (
ASEAN) would meet again in May to discuss Malaysia's position.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has in the past threatened to withdraw palm oil from
the AFTA inclusion list if Malaysia continued to exclude vehicles
and spare parts. But Thailand eventually backed down and agreed to
conform to the initial ASEAN agreement on AFTA.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's decision to keep palm oil products on the inclusion
list means the country will have to reduce import tariffs on those
products by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Charnchai said the Agriculture Ministry has confirmed that
Thailand's 20,000 palm-oil producers will not be affected by the
decision.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said Thai palm oil production was competitive in
both price and yield, he added.
</P>
<P>
On January 1, six of the 10-members in ASEAN began to reduce
tariffs for 15 product categories to zero to five percent. These
items are on what is known as the fast-track list. For Thailand,
the 15 categories cover 7,737 product items. In late 1998,
Thailand decided to include 1,190 more items to its fast-track
program.
</P>
<P>
The 7,737 items constitute 85 percent of the total number of
products for which Thailand has pledged to reduce tariffs by 2003.
The total number is 9,103.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government has estimated that the country will lose
542 million baht (14.6 million U.S. dollars) in tariff income from
the latest addition of 1,190 items a year.
</P>
<P>
Charnchai said Thailand's tariff reduction will not have any
adverse impact on the country's industries, particularly the
agriculture sector.

<HEADLINE> Nelson Won't Coach Mavericks Next Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The impending sale of the
Dalls Mavericks already has impacted the future of coach-general
manager Don Nelson and his son.
</P>
<P>
After meeting Wednesday with prospective new owner Mark Cuban
to discuss his future with the franchise, Nelson said Wednesday he
will drop his coaching duties while retaining his position as GM,
the Dallas Morning News reported.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also reported Nelson recommended to Cuban that
his son, Donn, not be considered as coach. Donn Nelson was being
groomed to take over for his father.
</P>
<P>
"I told Mark I'd do anything if he asked me, but that I didn't
think it was a good idea for the franchise or for me to coach
after this season," Nelson told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
It is unclear what the future holds for the Mavericks. Cuban,
the billionaire cofounder of BroadCast.com, had a similar meeting
with Mavs president Terdema Ussery on Tuesday, one day after
reaching a preliminary agreement to buy a controlling interest in
the team for a reported 280 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Current owner Ross Perot Jr. will retain a minority share
following completion of the proposed transaction, which could be
completed as early as March, pending league approval. Cuban has
been described as someone who will have a more "hands-on" approach.
</P>
<P>
Nelson was hired by Perot on February 7, 1997 and added his son
to the staff on January 2, 1998. The elder Nelson has been unable
to turn around the Mavericks, who were one of just two non-
expansion teams that did not win a playoff game in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Dallas has lost four in a row and eight of nine to drop to 9-22
this season under Nelson, whose coaching and personnel decisions
have come under scrutiny.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- O'kying Chilai Doje, the 17th
living Buddha of Garmaba, the white sect of Tibetan Buddhism, left
the Curbo monastery in Lhasa of Tibet recently together with a
small number people around him, a spokesman for the Information
Office of the State Council said here today.
</P>
<P>
In his letter left at the monastery, O'kying Chilai Doje said
that he went abroad this time to get the musical instruments of
the Buddhist mass and the black hats that had been used by the
previous living Buddhas of Garmaba.
</P>
<P>
This did not mean to "betray the State, the nation, the
monastery or the leadership," he said in his letter.
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old O'kying Chilai Doje became the 17th living
Buddha of Garmaba at a ceremony of ascending the holly throne in
the Curbo monastery in September of 1992 with the approval of the
Administration of the Religious Affairs of the State Council.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Teak Export Increases Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar exported 249,181 cubic-
meters of teak in the first eight months of 1999, earning 124
million U.S. dollars, according to the latest figures published by
the country's Central Statistical Organization.
</P>
<P>
The export volume and earnings respectively increased by 184.5
percent and 103.6 percent compared with the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar also exported 314,979 cubic-meters of
hardwood in the eight-month period, earning 21.56 million dollars
of foreign exchange. The export volume and earnings rose by 293.28
percent and 70.43 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The figures of the Myanmar Ministry of Forestry show that the
country's forest area is shrinking year by year. The percentage of
coverage by forest in the country dropped to 50 percent at the end
of 1998, compared with 57 percent in 1962.
</P>
<P>
The forest depletion is attributed to indiscriminate felling
and cutting of trees to build farms, and over-dependence on
firewood for cooking.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is implementing projects for greening the arid
districts, under which revival of firewood plantations is among
the measures being taken.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is now extensively using briquette as wood-substitute
fuel.

<P>
In recent years, Myanmar has sped up the pace of
infrastructural construction of roads, bridges and dams, resulting
in a shortage of cement day by day.
</P>
<P>
To meet the rising demand for cement, Myanmar spends a large
sum of foreign exchange buying in cement worth about 70 million U.
S. dollars annually. Reports say that Myanmar is trying to get a
foreign loan of 150 million dollars to build a 4,000-ton-capacity
cement plant.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Minister Quits Due to Infighting: Press </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Policy differences among members
of the economic team had led to the sudden, irrevocable
resignation of Philippine Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu,
press reports here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
With Espiritu's resignation, Trade and Industry Secretary Jose
Pardo on Thursday confirmed he would be heading the Department of
Finance, the newspaper Today disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said Pardo and Philippine Central Bank governor Rafael
Buenaventura can work closer and end "infighting in the cabinet
and lead to more coherent policy."
</P>
<P>
Pardo and Buenaventura were reportedly appointed as members of
a "super" economic body created by President Joseph Estrada.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the creation of the "super" body, which Espiritu
opposed, had been one of the triggers for the finance chief's
resignation on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Buenaventura and Espiritu had also clashed over monetary and
fiscal issues. Pardo and Espiritu, on the other hand, reportedly
had disagreements over a loan issue that involved the Social
Security System.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Rolnado Zamora was quoted as saying that
Espiritu also objected to Estrada's announcement that interest
rates on housing loans would be lowered.
</P>
<P>
But reports pointed out that both Pardo and Buenaventura had
made the assurance about the continuation of policies amid fears
that the change in leadership in one the key economic agencies of
the government might affect investors' confidence in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing has changed. Policies have not changed. The
replacement (for Espiritu) is acceptable," Buenaventura said.

<HEADLINE> Two India-Trained Terrorists Arrested in Pakistan:  Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Two terrorists allegedly
trained in India and involved in a bomb blast injuring at least 18
people were arrested Thursday in Pakistan, the state-run
Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.
</P>
<P>
Salim Ahmed, arrested by police in Hyderabad of central Sindh
province, and his accomplice Muhammad Irfan were alleged to be
involved in the bomb blast on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Salim, he visited India where he was trained by a
person named Shahab (Eds: only one name) in bomb making and
planting, APP said.
</P>
<P>
On his return, Shahab asked Salim to carry out bomb blasts. He
gave Salim 10,000 rupees (192 U.S. dollars) for conducting a blast
in front of the Press Club in Hyderabad, the second largest city
in Sindh.
</P>
<P>
The two alleged terrorists were claimed to have earned 25,000
rupees (481 dollars) for another blast which occurred in front of
a thickly populated cloth market in the city on Wednesday injuring
at least 18 civilians including several women.
</P>
<P>
According to APP, Irfan, who said he was a friend of Salim,
also admitted to having received training in India.
</P>
<P>
The report said the two persons were directed to plant bombs at
various places after their return. Last month Irfan planted a time
device at Hyderabad-Kotari railway station which was defused later,
it said.
</P>
<P>
Irfan said they planted a bomb in the cloth market where he
managed to flee from the site while Salim was arrested. Later,
Salim was also arrested and police recovered material which is
used for bomb making, according to APP.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Republican Presidential Candidates Hold Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Texas Governor George W. Bush
and five other U.S. presidential hopefuls within his Republican
Party held their first debate in the election year Thursday night
in Durham, New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
The main feature of the evening debate was a struggle between
Bush and Senator John McCain, neck-and-neck rivals in the polls in
New Hampshire, where the first primary of the year will be held on
February 1.
</P>
<P>
In Thursday's debate, an aggressive Bush pledged to push for
tax cuts if elected to the White House and accused McCain of
seeking campaign finance changes that would hurt the conservative
cause.
</P>
<P>
"If there's a recession it's important to cut taxes to make
sure the economy grows. It's also important to cut the taxes where
there's times of plenty," said Bush, the Republican presidential
front-runner.
</P>
<P>
Senator McCain of Arizona swiftly parried Bush's attack on the
issue of campaign finance and possible damage to the Republican
Party, noting that his proposal includes steps to limit union
political activity.
</P>
<P>
Besides Bush and McCain, millionaire publisher Steve Forbes,
former U.N. ambassador Alan Keyes, Senator Orrin Hatch and Gary
Bauer, a former government official at the Reagan Administration
also took part in the 60-minute debate that covered topics ranging
from tax cut to abortion, religion, judiciary and other issues.
</P>
<P>
The six Republican White House contenders traded fire over gays
in the military. The debate followed pledges Wednesday night by
both of the Democratic presidential hopefuls that they would make
sure that homosexuals could serve in the military openly.
</P>
<P>
Bauer said Democratic stance would further the "radical
homosexual agenda" while Keyes promised to "return to the ban on
homosexuals in the military."
</P>
<P>
"I'm a don't ask, don't tell man," Bush said.
</P>
<P>
The series of debates will continue Friday night in South
Carolina as the opening round of primaries approaches.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Navy to Build 32 New Destroyers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Navy announced
Thursday that it will spend 25 billion U.S. dollars to build 32
new-generation destroyers.
</P>
<P>
The first class of DD-21 destroyers, which will start joining
the fleet in a decade, will be using revolutionary "electric drive,
" Navy Secretary Richard Danzig said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The stealthy new warships will still use a diesel or turbine
engine. But the engine will both propel the DD-21 and generate
electric power, unlike the current warships which have separate
bulky engines for movement and electricity.
</P>
<P>
Danzig said the Defense Department budget to be submitted to
Congress in early February will propose spending some 250 million
dollars in the next six years to develop the "electric drive"
technology to be used on the DD-21 ships.
</P>
<P>
The surface ships in today's U.S. Navy -- aside from nuclear-
powered aircraft carriers -- are powered by gas turbine or diesel
engines that are attached to reduction gears. Those gears reduce
the speed of rotation of the drive shaft so that it turns the
ship's propeller at the appropriate speeds.
</P>
<P>
In the DD-21, the same gas turbine or diesel engines will be
used. But the reduction gears, which take up a tremendous amount
of space and are difficult to maintain, will be gone. In their
place will be smaller, more efficient and quieter electrical
generators attached to electric motors. The motors will control
the speed of the propeller independent of the engines, and there
will be no need for a long drive shaft.
</P>
<P>
Current U.S. Navy destroyers have a crew of more than 300. But
by saving space and equipment with the new power integration unit,
that number could be reduced to about 95 sailors, Danzig said.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Brick Found in Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Archaeologists have discovered a
581-year-old brick similar to those used to construct the imperial
palace in Beijing's Forbidden City, in Tianjin, the largest port
city in north China.
</P>
<P>
The 55 cm x 55 cm brick, weighing 50 kilograms, was discovered
in an ancient bungalow that is slated for repair.
</P>
<P>
The clay brick is of the variety often referred to as "gold
bricks" because they were reserved for palace construction, and is
the first such brick ever found in Tianjin. Ancient Chinese valued
"gold bricks" for their hardness and rareness.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists estimated that the brick was made during the
Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) when emperor Zhu Di built the Forbidden
City. But this brick is much heavier and larger than those in the
Forbidden City, which weigh some 22.5 kilograms each.
</P>
<P>
Inscribed on the relic are the name of the person who made it,
along with the date and location of its casting.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the brick has provided important clues for
archaeologists studying the history and construction styles of the
city. It is also evidence to the fact that ancient Chinese had
developed superior brick-making technology.

CARACAS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela will declare a
sanitation alert to prevent epidemics that might be caused by
floods in the last three weeks, said Health Minister Gilberto

<P>
He told a press conference that the outbreak of epidemics is
more possible than ever, although there are no reasons to declare
a sanitation emergency.

He said that the conditions across the country make the
outbreak of infectious diseases very possible, especially in the
devastated states of Vargas and Miranda and in the centers crowded
with flood victims.

The minister estimated that between 10,000 and 15,000 people
have been killed by the floods. "It is impossible to know the
accurate number of victims and probably it will never be known,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Americans Prefer Stereos to PC Music: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAS VEGAS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- While some analysts predict
downloading and listening to music on the personal computer is the
wave of the future, statistics released Thursday indicate that
more Americans prefer to listen to music on their stereos, not on
computers or portable players.
</P>
<P>
A national survey of 1,000 people, conducted last December by
Bruskin Surveys &AMP; Audits Inc., found that three in four consumers
prefer to listen to music on their stereos. What's more, over 50
percent of the respondents said that they had no intention of
listening to music from a PC.
</P>
<P>
According to the American listening habits survey, the CD is
still the single most widely used and purchased music content
vehicle, with 75 percent listenership. More than 40 percent of
the respondents primarily listen to CDs at home, most of them in
the 18-35 age bracket.
</P>
<P>
The survey, released at the ongoing 2000 Consumer Electronics
Show in Las Vegas, also shows that people who listen to CDs at
home own an average of 91 CDs, with men reporting ownership of
over 100 CDs and women 80 CDs. Survey respondents, both men and
women, report that an average of 15 new CDs were added to their
collection last year.
</P>
<P>
Most adults want their stereos to have conveniences and control
similar to that provided by on-demand television, the survey
indicates. In fact, 55 percent of the adults said they would be
strongly interested in a stereo product that would allow them to
instantly play any song from their entire collection by type of
music, artist, album or song name.

<HEADLINE> Computer Problem Grounds Flights in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. computer problems
grounded airplanes Thursday for a second time this week,
frustrating passengers trying to fly to and from about a dozen
cities, according to the U.S. Federation Aviation Administration (
FAA).
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of flights were delayed when a computer at its air
traffic control center in Leesburg, Virginia, experienced problems
transferring data about 6:45 a.m. EST, said the aviation
administration.
</P>
<P>
Normal operations resumed at 9:49 a.m., but the delays left
passengers sitting up to two hours or more aboard planes lined up
on runways or waiting at gates for flights postponed or canceled,
it said.
</P>
<P>
William Shumann, a spokesman at the FAA's headquarters in
Washington, said the problem has not yet been identified, but it
does not appear to be related to Y2K, the term used to describe
glitches that occurred as computers made the rollover from 1999 to
2000.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's delays were experienced by passengers traveling to
or from the airports including Reagan National, Dulles
International and Baltimore-Washington International, John F.
Kennedy, LaGuardia and Newark.
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, a computer malfunction at the FAA's center in
Nashua, New Hampshire, delayed flights at airports in
Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York States.
</P>
<P>
FAA officials said that a backup computer system was used when
the main computer at the air traffic control center experienced
problems for about three hours.

 For ages, drinking water with a high content of fluorine
posed a threat to people's health in this region, causing yellow

</P>
<P>
 In 1999, the government of Tangshan decided to change this
situation. In the year, it raised more than 1.5 million yuan (
about 180,000 U.S. dollars), sinking 32 wells free of fluorine and
laying 30,000 meters of pipelines for the villages.
</P>

 Expressing satisfaction over these projects, farmers in
Zhangmawan village said that several fluorine-induced diseases now

<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, January 7 (Xinhua) -- People in Xihaigu Prefecture,
one of the eight poorest counties in China, came out of poverty
last year thanks to the protracted anti-poverty drive in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Xihaigu Prefecture, in the southern part of the Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region, has achieved marked progress in helping the
poor develop a diversified economy by offering economic assistance
and technical guidance, according to an economic conference
recently held in Yinchuan, the region's capital.
</P>
<P>
Xiji County has created a potato base which processes 300,000
tons of potatoes and turns out 40,000 tons of starch annually,
making it one of the largest starch producer in China. Local
farmers now earn 300 yuan each annually from potato production.
</P>
<P>
To improve the poor farming conditions in the prefecture, the
central and provincial governments have invested heavily to build
130 irrigation projects which have brought 66,600 ha of arid land
under adequate irrigation.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the grain output of the six counties in Guyuan
prefecture rose to 600 million kg last year, the second highest
output in its history. More than 100,000 people previously living
below the poverty line in the county now have a better life
because of these improvements.

<HEADLINE> Necaxa Drews with Manchester 1-1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, January 6 (Xinhua) -- England's Manchester was
held to a 1-1 draw by Mexico's Necaxa on Thursday in the first
round of the Club World Championships.
</P>
<P>
Christian Montecinos' free kick gave Necaxa a 1-0 lead at the
14th minute. The ball sailed over Manchester's wall, entering the
goal high in the left hand corner.
</P>
<P>
Then Manchester received a stunning setback when star striker
David Beckham was shown the red card for violent play in the 42nd
minute. The Man Union possibility would have to face Brazilian
powerhouse Vasco on Saturday without Beckham.
</P>
<P>
However, FIFA officials said the red card did not mean Beckham
would necessarily miss Saturday's game against Vasco. A special
committee will decide the case Friday.
</P>
<P>
With only 10 men on the field, Manchester was still able to
pick up the pace and threaten Necaxa's lead through much of the
second half.
</P>
<P>
Necaxa blew a number of chances, including Alex Aguinaga's
anemic penalty kick in the 58th minute which was easily picked up
by Manchester goalie Mark Bosnich.
</P>
<P>
A tie seemed almost inevitable when Manchester got a penalty in
the 80th minute, but Dwight Yorke's kick got knocked aside in a
brilliant save by Necaxa goalie Hugo Pineda.
</P>
<P>
Minutes later he got it right, scoring the tying goal on cross
from Ole Solskjaer and blasting it past Pineda in the 82nd minute.

<HEADLINE> China Improves Alkaline Soil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, January 7 (Xinhua) -- China has made great progress in
improving its alkaline soil over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that more than 100,000 hectares of
alkaline land at the Yellow River Delta, one of the country's
three major river deltas, have already become fertile.
</P>
<P>
This is attributed to the growing various alkaline-tolerant
plants on alkaline soil.
</P>
<P>
During the past 10 years, scientists at the Dongying Alkaline-
Tolerant Botanical Garden in Dongying, a city in Shandong Province
at the mouth of the Yellow River, selected more than 80 varieties
of plants that can resist salt and alkali, including Chinese
flowering crabapple, Chinese toon, lucerne, and narrow-leaved
oleaster.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in Zhanhua County in Shandong earned more than 50
million yuan by planting narrow-leaved oleasters on alkaline land
last year.
</P>
<P>
China has about 40 million hectares of alkaline land, and
experts say that growing alkaline-tolerant plants may serve as an
efficient measure to improve the soil.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President Dismisses Reports on Cyprus Issue  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
Friday denied reports that the U.N. has rejected a proposal by the
Greek Cypriots regarding the territorial aspect of the Cyprus
issue.
</P>
<P>
It is equally untrue that the U.N. has proposed that a Federal
Republic of Cyprus should have a president and a prime minister,
said Clerides in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
Such reports are regrettable and have created confusion and
bitterness to those who work on behalf of the U.N. or the
governments for reuniting the Cyprus island, said Clerides, also
leader of the Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the U.N. has received the proposal by the Greek
Cypriots, but made no comment so far.
</P>
<P>
Clerides noted that "U.N. Secretary-General's Special Adviser on
Cyprus Alvaro de Soto has not made any proposal nor has he proposed
an equal distribution of powers."
</P>
<P>
He clarified that the U.N. official "merely recorded without
discussion the positions of the Greek Cypriot side and the grounds
on which these positions are based."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
The first round of U.N.-sponsored proximity talks on Cyprus was
held last December in New York to pave the way for substantive
negotiations on a solution to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
A second round talks has been scheduled to start on January 31
in Geneva.

JOHANNESBURG, January 7 (Xinhua) -- South African Trade and

implementation of a trade agreement signed with the European Union
(EU) last year.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to reports that Italy and Greece, two member
states of the EU, are having doubt about ratifying the Trade,

According to Erwin, the certainty of implementation of the

The competence for the supervision of the implementation of the
trade aspects of the agreement lay with the European Commission on

<HEADLINE> Unemployment in Switzerland in 1999 Lowest for Seven Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- There were about 98,600 people
out of work in 1999 in Switzerland, accounting for 2.7 percent of
the population, the lowest level for seven years, said Swiss Radio
International Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss Economics Ministry was quoted as saying that it
expected unemployment to continue falling in the medium term, to
reach about 2.1 percent, or 75,000 people, by 2003.
</P>
<P>
The figure compares favorably to the previous year, when around
3.9 percent of the population was registered as unemployed.
Switzerland's average unemployment rate is the lowest of any
country in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development.
</P>
<P>
However, there are some considerable regional differences in
Switzerland. The breakdown by canton shows four cantons like Uri,
Nidwalden, Obwalden and Appenzell-Innerrhoden in central
Switzerland are with rates below 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
French-speaking western Switzerland and the southern canton of
Ticino still have the highest levels. Canton Geneva has the
highest rate of 5 percent unemployment.

Speaking at a military base in canton Aargau Friday, Ogi said

Some right-wing members of Ogi's Swiss People's Party,

<P>
Strong opposition is also coming from certain left-wingers, who
want Switzerland to do away with its armed forces altogether.

Asked about his response to Florida Governor Jeb Bush's request
to reverse the INS's decision, Clinton told reporters at the White
House, "I believe that they (INS) followed the law and the
procedures."
</P>
<P>
"This is a volatile and difficult case. And those who want to
challenge it will have to follow the law and the procedures. I
think that's the only way to do this," Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
Exiled Cubans in Florida have launched a campaign in Miami to
keep the six-year-old Cuban boy, Elian Gonzalez, in the United
States. Elian was rescued from sea after his mother and nine
others were killed when their boat capsized last November near
Florida when they tried to flee Cuba to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The boy's father, supported by the Cuban government, demanded
his son be returned to him. The INS decided Wednesday that
Gonzalez should leave Miami and return to Cuba by January 14.
</P>
<P>
"We need to keep this out of the political process as much as
possible within the established legal channels," Clinton affirmed.

</P>
<P>
"The president thought it was a good meeting, very constructive,

headway.
</P>
<P>
"Both the prime minister and the foreign minister are quite
engaged," Lockhart said. "There are a lot of issues on the table.
There are a lot of things that have to be worked through, and it's
going to take more than one afternoon to work on these issues."
</P>
<P>
After the three-way meeting, Clinton again met with Barak
separately , then headed for Washington.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said both sides would be looking at the document on
Friday and Clinton might return for talks with the principals over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin called the working
document a "progress" for the discussions, but he cautioned that "
We have limited expectations what can be completed with one round"
of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
No details of the working document were disclosed by both White
House and State Department spokesmen.
</P>
<P>
"I think the sides will be looking at the document today and
there will be further discussions," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
A Syrian source said the Syrian team was satisfied with the
document "because matters now have become more well-defined and we
won't be going back to square one every time we meet."
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth time within a week that Clinton came to the
small West Virginian town to personally intervene in the peace
talks as the two sides refused any face-to-face meeting because of
procedural differences.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving Washington for Shepherdstown this morning,
Clinton told reporters that the Syrian-Israeli peace talks were "
difficult stuff" .
</P>
<P>
"This is difficult stuff. This is very hard," Clinton said
before leaving the White House. "But let me say they are working
hard and they are trying to find ways to resolve their differences
and they are trying to imagine the end of the road here."

<P>
GENEVA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Geneva has won the annual Wakker
prize for the protection of Swiss heritage.
</P>
<P>
The prize worth 20,000 Swiss francs (13,000 U.S. dollars) was
given to Geneva for its work in renovating public areas along the
Rhone river, said Swiss Radio International Friday. The theme of
this year's prize had been "Building on Water."
</P>
<P>
The prize, based on the legacy of Henri-Louis Wakker, has been
awarded annually since 1972. But it is the first time that Wakker'
s hometown has won the prize.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the municipal contemporary art foundation commissioned
a study to improve the banks of the Rhone, which was lined with
19th century industrial buildings. The following year a Geneva
architect, Julien Descombes, was commissioned to improve the
environment with the help of artists.
</P>
<P>
Six projects are currently under way. The projects have
transformed the sites into a living space, said the committee
which gave the prize to Geneva.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes Increased Measures to Fight Computer Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Our critical systems, from power structures to air traffic
control, are connected and run by computers. We must make those
systems more secure so that America can be more secure," Clinton
said when speaking to reporters in an appearance outside the White
House.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will request 2.03 billion dollars for computer security
in his 2001 budget request early next month, up from 1.75 billion
dollars allocated in the 2000 budget, a white House official said.
</P>
<P>
Included in the request are a boost in information security
research spending to 621 million dollars from 461 million dollars,
and 91 million dollars in new initiatives to fight computer
attacks. Other related increases bring the total spending increase
next year to 280 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the New Year's Y2K threat underscored "how really
interconnected we all are", and revealed how one person can use a
computer for good or sinister purposes.
</P>
<P>
He has frequently expressed concern about the "emerging threat"
that other governments, hackers and thieves pose to a nation and a
world now dependent on high technology.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration announced last year that it was
creating a government-wide security network to protect against
hackers. The plan included an elaborate network of electronic
obstacles, monitors and analyzers to watch for suspicious activity.
</P>
<P>
The first 500 intrusion monitors are to be installed on
nonmilitary government computers early this year, and the full
system is to be completed by May 2003.

<HEADLINE> Romania Backed Up by Citibank to Improve System of Payments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Citibank Romania signed a
partnership with the State Treasury for the improvement of
logistical base of cash flows to and from treasury territorial
institutions, Citibank said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The aim of this partnership is to conduct in real time the
payments and the returns of public institutions and economic
agents in relation with the state budget and other budgets.
</P>
<P>
"Due to the alteration of the payment system in relation with
the state budget, Citibank Romania, together with the Treasury's
General Direction, tried to find ways to improve the services
offered to Romanian and foreign companies. The result is a much
faster solution for economic agents," said Dana Ionescu, an
official of Citibank Romania.
</P>
<P>
Treasury general manager Aron Racea considers that the
implementation of this solution will ensure the flow and the
increase of incoming cash to the state budget. At the same time,
the services offered to the companies in Romania will be improved.
</P>
<P>
Citibank Romania SA is a branch of the Citicorp American
company. It is a member of the world's largest financial
institutions, namely Citigroup. The bank was presented in December
1999 with the title of "Romania's Best Friend in 1999" as an
acknowledgment of its presence on the local market with
significant financing and innovative
financial solution.

BUCHAREST, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Renowned Romanian soccer coach
Anghel Iordanescu, former coach of the country's national squad,
early this week signed an one-year contract with Saudi Arabia's Al
Hilal Ar Riyadh team.
</P>
<P>
Iordanescu, who signed the contract worth 600,000 U.S. dollars,
is replacing Brazilian Lori Sandri who quit amid disagreement over
selection of players.
</P>
<P>
Iordanescu, 49, led Romania's national squad at United States '
94 and France '98 World Cups. Right after the France World Cup, he
took over the Greek national squad, leading it in the 2000 World
Cup qualifiers. He was sacked, however, after a few months only,
because of a lack of results.
</P>
<P>
Al Hilal, who won their last champion title in 1998, being
coached by another Romanian, Ilie Balaci, has their poorest
showing in 10 years, ranking 7th in the national championship. The
Saudi club, however, has qualified in the Asian Champions Cup
quarter-finals.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Venture-Backed IPOs Escalate in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 7 (Xinhua) -- A total of 271 U.S. venture-
backed companies went public in 1999, accounting for nearly half
of all initial public offerings (IPOs) in the year, an American
information services company reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Never before has venture backing been so important for the
success of the sometime shaky confidence in the IPO market," the
Venture Economics group of Thomson Financial Securities Data said
in a report, "Venture-back IPOs helped fuel the growth of a record-
setting year for the Nasdaq Stock Market in 1999."
</P>
<P>
The 271 venture-backed companies in 1999 raised over 23.6
billion U.S. dollars for themselves and marked a total post offer
valuation at offering dates of 136.2 billion dollars, according to
the information services company, which has been tracking the
venture capital and buyouts industry for over 35 years.
</P>
<P>
The average offer size for a venture-backed IPO was up 75
percent from the previous year to 87.2 million dollars along with
an unprecedented average post offer valuation of almost 503
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
They not only raised more money, but also went public at an
earlier age. The median company age of venture-backed IPOs was
four years, compared to 4.5 years in 1998 and 5.5 years in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that half of all IPOs in 1999 were venture-backed
companies is hard evidence that the venture capital community is
driving economy growth," the report quoted chairman of the
National Venture Capital Association John Martinson as saying. "
For decades, venture capitalists have invested in cutting edge
technologies and ideas. The industry's efforts are creating
successful companies while rewarding investors who see portfolios
of high growth companies as worthy investment."

NEW YORK, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average continued to rise at the new high while the technology
heavy Nasdaq composite index bounced back strongly Friday despite
a profit warning from Lucent company and a strong job market
report.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index closed up 269.30 at 11,522.56, surpassing the
record closing high of 11,497.12 set on December 31, 1999. The

<P>
The Nasdaq index rebounded to close up 155.49 at 3,882.62 after

tradings. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 38.02 at 1,441.47.
</P>

The market surged as investors continued to buy the cyclical
stocks in defiance of the government report on strong labor market.
Procter &AMP; Gamble, Coca-Cola, Merck and Johnson &AMP; Johnson led the
Dow to the new record.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported that the U.S. unemployment rate

Investors also rushed into the market to buy technology stocks
after a three-day bout of profit-taking despite news of weakness
from Lucent technology, maker of telecommunications equipment.
Lucent said late Thursday that it missed earnings expectations in
the final quarter of 1999.

JOHANNESBURG, January 7 (Xinhua) -- South African Trade and
Industry Minister Alec Erwin Friday dispelled doubts about the
implementation of a trade agreement signed with the European Union
(EU) last year.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to reports that Italy and Greece, two member
states of the EU, are having doubt about ratifying the Trade,
Development and Cooperation Agreement.
</P>
<P>
According to Erwin, the certainty of implementation of the
multi-billion- rand agreement could not be in doubt and as far as
South Africa was concerned it came into effect on January 1 this
year.
</P>
<P>
The competence for the supervision of the implementation of the
trade aspects of the agreement lay with the European Commission on
one hand and with the South African government on the other, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "neither the Italian government nor the
European Union can unilaterally change the terms of the
agreement".

<HEADLINE> Unemployment in Switzerland in 1999 Lowest for Seven Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- There were about 98,600 people
out of work in 1999 in Switzerland, accounting for 2.7 percent of
the population, the lowest level for seven years, said Swiss Radio
International Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss Economics Ministry was quoted as saying that it
expected unemployment to continue falling in the medium term, to
reach about 2.1 percent, or 75,000 people, by 2003.
</P>
<P>
The figure compares favorably to the previous year, when around
3.9 percent of the population was registered as unemployed.
Switzerland's average unemployment rate is the lowest of any
country in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development.
</P>
<P>
However, there are some considerable regional differences in
Switzerland. The breakdown by canton shows four cantons like Uri,
Nidwalden, Obwalden and Appenzell-Innerrhoden in central
Switzerland are with rates below 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
French-speaking western Switzerland and the southern canton of
Ticino still have the highest levels. Canton Geneva has the
highest rate of 5 percent unemployment.

Asked about his response to Florida Governor Jeb Bush's request
to reverse the INS's decision, Clinton told reporters at the White
House, "I believe that they (INS) followed the law and the
procedures."
</P>
<P>
"This is a volatile and difficult case. And those who want to
challenge it will have to follow the law and the procedures. I
think that's the only way to do this," Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
Exiled Cubans in Florida have launched a campaign in Miami to
keep the six-year-old Cuban boy, Elian Gonzalez, in the United
States. Elian was rescued from sea after his mother and nine
others were killed when their boat capsized last November near
Florida when they tried to flee Cuba to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The boy's father, supported by the Cuban government, demanded
his son be returned to him. The INS decided Wednesday that
Gonzalez should leave Miami and return to Cuba by January 14.
</P>
<P>
"We need to keep this out of the political process as much as
possible within the established legal channels," Clinton affirmed.

<HEADLINE> (UPDATED WITH MORE DETAILS): Clinton Offers Working Document to Syria,  Israel  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHEPHERDSTOWN, W. Va., January 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President
Bill Clinton on Friday presented Israel and Syria with a working
document aimed at solving their differences in their peace talks,
the White House said.
</P>
<P>
"this working document provides a summary of the issues to be
decided and the differences between the parties. it is designed as
a procedural tool to focus the substantive discussions and to help
bridge the differences that now exist," White House spokesman Joe
Lockhart told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The working document was offered to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh when Clinton held
the second trilateral meeting with them for an hour, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
"The president thought it was a good meeting, very constructive,
" he said. But he did not said whether the president made any
headway.
</P>
<P>
"Both the prime minister and the foreign minister are quite
engaged," Lockhart said. "There are a lot of issues on the table.
There are a lot of things that have to be worked through, and it's
going to take more than one afternoon to work on these issues."
</P>
<P>
After the three-way meeting, Clinton again met with Barak
separately , then headed for Washington.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said both sides would be looking at the document on
Friday and Clinton might return for talks with the principals over
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin called the working
document a "progress" for the discussions, but he cautioned that "
We have limited expectations what can be completed with one round"
of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
No details of the working document were disclosed by both White
House and State Department spokesmen.
</P>
<P>
"I think the sides will be looking at the document today and
there will be further discussions," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
A Syrian source said the Syrian team was satisfied with the
document "because matters now have become more well-defined and we
won't be going back to square one every time we meet."
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth time within a week that Clinton came to the
small West Virginian town to personally intervene in the peace
talks as the two sides refused any face-to-face meeting because of
procedural differences.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving Washington for Shepherdstown this morning,
Clinton told reporters that the Syrian-Israeli peace talks were "
difficult stuff" .
</P>
<P>
"This is difficult stuff. This is very hard," Clinton said
before leaving the White House. "But let me say they are working
hard and they are trying to find ways to resolve their differences
and they are trying to imagine the end of the road here."

<HEADLINE> Geneva Wins Annual Wakker Prize for Swiss Heritage Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Geneva has won the annual Wakker
prize for the protection of Swiss heritage.
</P>
<P>
The prize worth 20,000 Swiss francs (13,000 U.S. dollars) was
given to Geneva for its work in renovating public areas along the
Rhone river, said Swiss Radio International Friday. The theme of
this year's prize had been "Building on Water."
</P>
<P>
The prize, based on the legacy of Henri-Louis Wakker, has been
awarded annually since 1972. But it is the first time that Wakker'
s hometown has won the prize.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the municipal contemporary art foundation commissioned
a study to improve the banks of the Rhone, which was lined with
19th century industrial buildings. The following year a Geneva
architect, Julien Descombes, was commissioned to improve the
environment with the help of artists.
</P>
<P>
Six projects are currently under way. The projects have
transformed the sites into a living space, said the committee
which gave the prize to Geneva.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Proposes Increased Measures to Fight Computer Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Our critical systems, from power structures to air traffic
control, are connected and run by computers. We must make those
systems more secure so that America can be more secure," Clinton
said when speaking to reporters in an appearance outside the White
House.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will request 2.03 billion dollars for computer security
in his 2001 budget request early next month, up from 1.75 billion
dollars allocated in the 2000 budget, a white House official said.
</P>
<P>
Included in the request are a boost in information security
research spending to 621 million dollars from 461 million dollars,
and 91 million dollars in new initiatives to fight computer
attacks. Other related increases bring the total spending increase
next year to 280 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the New Year's Y2K threat underscored "how really
interconnected we all are", and revealed how one person can use a
computer for good or sinister purposes.
</P>
<P>
He has frequently expressed concern about the "emerging threat"
that other governments, hackers and thieves pose to a nation and a
world now dependent on high technology.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration announced last year that it was
creating a government-wide security network to protect against
hackers. The plan included an elaborate network of electronic
obstacles, monitors and analyzers to watch for suspicious activity.
</P>
<P>
The first 500 intrusion monitors are to be installed on
nonmilitary government computers early this year, and the full
system is to be completed by May 2003.
