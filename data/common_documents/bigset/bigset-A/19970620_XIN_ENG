<HEADLINE> HK Return Tribute to Wisdom of China Leadership: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The peaceful return of Hong Kong
to China is "a tribute to the wisdom, vision and will of the
Chinese leadership," a high-ranking Pakistani official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
"We feel that the peaceful accession of Hong Kong to the
People's Republic of China is a very significant triumph of Deng
Xiaoping's policy of 'one country, two systems' which was
initiated in 1979," Mushahid Hussain, advisor to the Pakistan
prime minister on culture and information, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the photo exhibition "Hong
Kong's History and Today" held by the Chinese Embassy here,
Mushahid said, "It is also a tribute to the wisdom, vision and
will of the Chinese leadership."
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani people share the joy and jubilation with their
Chinese brothers on this historic occasion, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that "with the peaceful return of Hong
Kong, China will achieve more strides and will be more stable,
stronger and more prosperous."
</P>
<P>
"And its stability and strength are very positive to the peace
and stability in Asia especially in South Asia," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Zhang Chengli said on the
occasion that "Hong Kong is enjoying sustained economic growth,
growing public confidence and an increasing flow of people
returning from the overseas."
</P>
<P>
"Both the Hong Kong people and international investors have
great confidence in Hong Kong," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's political stability and economic prosperity
benefit a lot from the Chinese government's consistent policy
toward Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador said the ingenious concept of "one
country, two systems," which embodies the Chinese leaders' vision,
courage and insight, has been successful in solving the question
of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"It also provides fresh experience for the peaceful solution of
international disputes, especially historical questions remaining
between countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
About 200 people from all walks of life attended the opening
ceremony. The exhibition will last for four days in Islamabad
before proceeding to other major Pakistani cities including
Lahore, Quetta and Karachi.

<HEADLINE> Bildt Expresses Concern on Bosnia's Military Expenditure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The outgoing international
community's High Representative, Carl Bildt, said today that he
was deeply concerned about the heavy military expenditures by the
parties of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"We have military expenditure (in Bosnia) in relation to the
size of the economy that is of the same proportion as those to the
Soviet Union or Israel before there was the peace process in the
Middle East," Bildt said at a press conference marking the
hand-over of power to his successor Spanish diplomat Carlos
Westendorp.
</P>
<P>
Westendorp said that he fully agreed to Bildt's assessment that
Bosnian parties have not made serious efforts in arms reduction
and the issue should be addressed during his tenure.
</P>
<P>
Bildt said that the level of military expenditure is a severe
burden on the social and economic development of Bosnia where
"there is now a quantitive reduction, but we now go for
qualitative buildup of forces."
</P>
<P>
His remarks were of the most outspoken criticism by a European
politician of Washington's "Train and Equip" program to beef up
the army of the Muslim-Croat federation which the Bosnian Serbs
have reportedly reacted by attempting to acquire Russian weapons.
</P>
<P>
Although the weapons are donated to the Bosnian parties, they
are just a minor part of the military expenditure because it
requires a large amount of money to train and maintain by the
parties which "will be the burden on the economy here," Bildt
said.
</P>
<P>
Bildt also called for more coordination among Western powers on
the issue of Bosnia, because "there is always the tendency towards
unilateralism by the one or the other."
</P>
<P>
"I think that the international community can have an impact on
development here and in the region on one condition that we work
together and we are united," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Western countries have started to learn that
lesson but "the learning of the lesson needs to be completed for
us to be absolutely certain of being as effective as we should be
in the peace making efforts here."

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Swaziland is facing a grain
shortage of 55,000 tons this year, according to reports reaching
here today.
</P>
<P>
The Swazi Agricultural Ministry officials estimated that grain

</P>
<P>
The total national requirement is 183,000 tons of maize and

Beside, Swaziland will also need to import 38,000 tons of wheat
as farmers in the country only produce about 6,000 tons of wheat per
year, they added. enditem

<HEADLINE> World Wheat Production Expected Lower in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 19 (Xinhua) -- World wheat production in 1997 is
currently forecast at 578 million tons, about 3 million tons lower
than in 1996, the Grains Conference '97 of the International
Grains Council was told today.
</P>
<P>
Better crops are expected in China, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and the
countries of Central/Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
However, production is forecast to decline in the European
Union, Canada, the United States, Australia, Argentina and Russia.
</P>
<P>
The production forecast for China has been further increased to
112 million tons following reports of an area increase and
favorable weather.
</P>
<P>
In Ukraine, spring sowing has been completed helped by adequate
soil moisture. Winter crops are believed to be in better condition
than last year.
</P>
<P>
Planting of spring wheat is also progressing well in
Kazakhstan, with about 60 percent sown by the end of May. Heavy
spring rainfall has brought much more favorable conditions than
last year, which saw severe drought.
</P>
<P>
Production in the countries of Central/Eastern Europe is
currently estimated at 33.9 million tons, up from the
disappointing outturn of 26.1 million tons in 1996.

<P>
DAMASCUS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- A Syrian official today extended
congratulations on the return of Hong Kong to its motherland,
hoping it may mark the beginning of the return of all the occupied
lands to their legitimate owners
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Xinhua, Syrian Minister of State
for Foreign Affairs Nasser Qaddour described the Hong Kong
handover as "a very important event for the Chinese people, Syria
and many other countries of the third world, the friends of the
friendly Chinese people."
</P>
<P>
"We join the Chinese people in their celebrations for the
achievement of this great victory," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qaddour said he wishs that July 1 will "mark the beginning of
the return of all occupied parts of the third world countries to
their motherlands, such as the return of the Golan Height and the
Palestinian territories to their legitimate owners."
</P>
<P>
"We wish that that day would be exemplary of other days to come
for those peoples whose territories are partially sliced away and
occupied," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed confidence that Hong Kong, after its return
to the motherland, will be even more prosperous and stable,
because the Chinese government will preserve its characteristics
within the concept of "one country, two systems".

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Condemns Ecevit's Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government today
strongly condemned a statement made by former Turkish Premier
Bulent Ecevit that Cyprus' Turkish-controlled northern areas are
"a security line" for Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"We condemn strongly these provocative comments. Turkey, which
continues to occupy part of the Republic of Cyprus, wants to
deal a blow against next month's direct talks between President
Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash,"
Government Spokesman Manolis Christofides, said in a written
statement.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit, who ordered Turkish military intervention in July
1974 in the wake of a Greek Cypriot coup seeking union with
Greece, claimed that the Turkish Cypriot regime in northern
Cyprus is very important for Turkey's security.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's invasion of Cyprus violated the Treaty of Guarantee
and international law and order, the Spokesman pointed out,
noting that it has brought suffering and misery to Greek and
Turkish Cypriots alike.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey should know that the sole purpose of the Treaty
of Guarantee is the maintenance of the independence, territorial
integrity and security of the Republic of Cyprus, to exclude
the Republic's union with any other state and avert its
division," Christofides stressed.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, Greece and Britain were guarantors of Cyprus'
independence under the 1960 Treaty of Establishment of the
Cyprus Republic.
</P>
<P>
This Eastern Mediterranean island has been divided into the
Greek Cypriot south and the Turkish Cypriot north since Turkish
invasion in 1974.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides and Denktash are scheduled to meet under
the U.N. auspices on July 9 near New York for the first
time in three years, to discuss a comprehensive solution to
the Cyprus problem.

<HEADLINE> Elephant States Win Battle on Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe, Botswana and Nambia
today won their battle to lift the eight-year ban on ivory trade
on conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
(CITES) voted in favor of their proposals to delete elephants
from the endangered list.
</P>
<P>
According to the conditions set by a 19-member CITES working
group Wednesday, the three southern African countries would be
able to sell specified experimental quotas of their ivory stocks
to Japan after the expiry of an 18-month moratorium.
</P>
<P>
Botswana would be allowed to sell no more than 25.3 tons,
Nambia 13.8 tons and Zimbabwe 20 tons subject to strict
monitoring by the CITES Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
The three countries will also be able to issue sport hunting
trophies for non-commercial purposes and export live jumbos to
appropriate and acceptable destinations.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, on the other hand, is now allowed to export hides as
well as leather goods and ivory carvings for non-commercial purposes.
</P>
<P>
According to the conditions set by the working group, the standing
committee would have a mechanism to halt ivory trade and immediately
transfer the downlisted elephants back to Appendix One if poaching and
illegal trade escalated.
</P>
<P>
Before vote on the proposals, the conference considered and
voted for the report of the working group which outlined the
conditions under which to resume ivory trade.
</P>
<P>
But Australia and the United States said they did not support
the set conditions which gave the CITES Standing Committee a
mandate to monitor ivory trade within the three countries.
</P>
<P>
"We voted against these proposals because we are concerned about
effects,'' a U.S. delegate said, adding, "however, we respect the
decision which was taken today and we are prepared to work with the
panel of experts and the standing committee in the elephant range
states so that there is minimum risk to the elephant populations."
</P>
<P>
The Southern African Development Community (SADC) today hailed
victories by Zimbabwe, Namibia and Botswana to downlist the elephant
from Appendix One to Two under the CITES, as a demonstration of
solidarity among the SADC member states. enditem

<HEADLINE> PNA Official Warns Against Failure of Egyptian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 19 (Xinhua) -- A senior Palestinian official
warned today that the failure of current mediation efforts by
Egypt to revive the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks could lead
to full confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Marwan Kanafani, spokesman for Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat, issued the warning at a news
conference held in the West Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
He described the Egyptian efforts as the "final barrier
preventing a total confrontation" between Israel and the
Palestinian side. He warned that the PNA would not be
responsible for future outbreak of violence in the streets
caused by Israeli hardline policies.
</P>
<P>
Kanafani made the remarks following the failure to break the
deadlock by Egyptian mediator Osama el-Baz and a team of visiting
Israeli officials, who held talks in Cairo Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli team comprised of Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh,
Foreign Ministry aide Yaacov Bardugo and two advisers to Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu Uzi Arad and Yitzhak Molcho.
</P>
<P>
Naveh held a meeting today with Egyptian Ambassador to Israel
Mohammed Bassiouny to discuss the current situation. Israeli
officials said the gap between the Israelis and Palestinians was
still wide and the Egyptian efforts were going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
This was also reflected by statements by Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa which were published on today's Egyptian
newspaper Al-Ahram. Moussa said the Egyptian efforts to relaunch
the Israeli-Palestinian peace process failed to achieve progress
due to Israel's settlement policy.
</P>
<P>
Moussa pointed out that settlements were the main obstacle in
the way of the peace process. He also said that the role of the
United States in the peace process should be based on the
principle of exchanging land for peace and stopping the Israeli
settlement activities on the occupied land.
</P>
<P>
The recent deadlock in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks
began in March when Israel started building the controversial
Har Homa settlement in disputed East Jerusalem. The PNA is
insisting on a halt to the Har Homa construction and other
settlement activities before resuming the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian protesters today continued to clash
with Israeli soldiers in the West Bank city of Hebron for the
sixth straight day. Palestinian youth threw petrol bombs and
rocks at Israeli soldiers, who responded with rubber bullets and
tear gas.
</P>
<P>
Today's clashes were at a lower scale and no injuries were
reported. Unlike in the past days, several Palestinian policemen
came out to contain the Palestinian protesters. Israeli police
said the Palestinian police began cooperating with Israeli
soldiers to maintain order.

</P>
<P>
Sherif said that the agreements cover the reception and
re-transmission of the Egyptian Satellite Channel around the clock

</P>
<P>
The signatories of the agreements are Uganda, Zambia,
Madagascar, Cameroon, Nigeria, Niger, Congo Brazzaville, Guinea,
Mali, Djibouti, Ghana, Kenya, Zimbabwe and Senegal.

<P>
Meanwhile, it will receive various news and cultural programs
from some of these African states to be aired by the Nile TV, she
added.
</P>
<P>

communication ventures and tackling challenges facing the African
development have topped the agenda of the three-day meeting of

<HEADLINE> German Gov't, Central Bank Agree to Raise Value </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 19 (Xinhua) -- German Finance Minister Theo Waigel
and the central bank president, Hans Tietmeyer, said today that
they have reached an agreement to raise the value of the bank's
dollar reserves to plug a huge hole in the state budget.
</P>
<P>
"We have found a good solution," said Waigel after a meeting
with Tietmeyer who heads the central bank, known as the
Bundesbank.
</P>
<P>
However, neither of them disclosed what the Bundesbank's new
dollar value would be, and how much extra revenue from the
revaluation would be transferred to the government. What is clear
so far is that the money will only be used by the government in
1998.
</P>
<P>
Under the Bundesbank's current accounting methods, the bank's
dollar reverses were valued at 1.36 German marks per U.S. dollar,
much lower than the current market values of over 1.7 marks per
dollar.
</P>
<P>
Speculations in German media said the reserves could be
revalued at 1.50 marks per dollar, which will pump a windfall of
about 13 billion marks to the government's account.
</P>
<P>
News reports also said that the value of the Bundesbank's gold
reserves were also expected to be raised in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Bonn government has triggered a feud with the Bundesbank
with its plan announced last month to revalue the bank's gold and
foreign exchange reserves in line with market prices in order to
slash its budget deficit by trimming some of the state debt of 833
billion marks (480 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Waigel has hoped that the money gained from the revaluation
will be transferred to the government in 1997 so as to help Bonn
in its struggle to meet the qualification criteria for joining the
planned single European currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
But the plan has met strong protest from the Bundesbank which
warns that it would infringe on the bank's independence, and risk
"a loss in trust in the stability of the future European
currency."
</P>
<P>
Waigel had to back down from the original plan earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
According to official forecasts, Germany's budget shortfall
will rise from 18 billion marks (10 billion dollars) to 31.6
billion marks (18.2 billion dollars) next year, mainly due to the
sluggish economic growth and the cost to finance the benefits for
near record unemployment.

<HEADLINE> British Conservatives Elect Hague as New Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The British Conservative party
today elected former Welsh secretary William Hague as its new
leader to succeed John Major who was the party leader and the
former prime minister.
</P>
<P>
In a ballot of the Conservatives' 164 members of parliament,
Hague won 92 votes against 70 for ex-Finance Minister Kenneth
Clarke, his sole rival for the leadership.
</P>
<P>
The Conservative party was ousted from power in the May 1
election by the Labor Party and Major announced he would step down
as party leader soon after the party was defeated in the election.
</P>
<P>
In his final contest with Clarke, 36-year-old Hague clinched
victory after winning the backing of former Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"I come out firmly for William because the principles that he
is founding his vision upon are very much the principles I founded
my government on for quite a long time," Thatcher said.
</P>
<P>
Clarke was supported by John Redwood, who came third in the
second round of ballot and forced out of the final battle.

<HEADLINE> Angola to Push Forward Mining Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Angola's Geology and Mining Minister Marcos Samonda said
recently that his country, rich in various minerals like diamond,
copper, iron, gold, uranium, regards mining as its polar
industry.
</P>
<P>
The development of its mining industry is of crucial
importance to the country's post-war reconstruction, the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said that his country is to pool two billion U.S.
dollars in developing a large-scale iron mine in its southern
province of Huila.
</P>
<P>
The iron mine, which needs an expected 3,000 workers, will
greatly improve the province's employment, when more people are
to work in its supporting facilities, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Samonda said that Angola welcomes foreign companies to invest
in the country's mining industry, saying that its government has
issued 21 licenses to its home companies, but all of them seem to
lack fund in developing the country's rich resources.

<HEADLINE> Commission Urges African Countries to Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Second General Assembly of
the African Population Commission today urged African countries to
adopt the best possible population policies.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations adopted at the end of the 4-day meeting
held here made the call, saying that it is possible for African
countries to adopt a viable population policy.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations pointed out: ''the best approach is to
integrate the population factor in their national development plans
and programs, so that the population variable is not considered in
isolation but is part and parcel and an integral part of the
development plan.''
</P>
<P>
The recommendations also called on African countries to
formulate, adopt and implement ''population and development policies
and strategies under circumstances peculiar to their respective
individual countries''.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations referred to the relationship between the
population and conflict in Africa and said ''although conflict
can be attributed to many factors, population is certainly one of
the major factors''.
</P>
<P>
On the south-south cooperation in the field of population and
development, the recommendations called on member countries of
the African Population Commission to ''support the south-south
cooperation in the field of population and development'' and
''establish networks at all levels to ensure the effective
implementation of the south-south programs''.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations referred to the issue of reproductive
health in sub-Sahara and said ''reproductive health is an
integral part of the overall health and human development'' and
''there is need for concerted efforts to undertake activities
involving education, at all levels, to clarify the concept,
formulate and implement policies, and monitor the reproductive
health policy implementation''.
</P>
<P>
The commission called on the OAU to ''ensure that the
population factor is given the requisite importance within its
structure and activities, particularly within the framework of
the African economic community and the mechanism for conflict
prevention, management and resolution''.
</P>
<P>
It also called on the OAU to provide the required services to
the commission.
</P>
<P>
Top policy makers from African countries and representatives
from the United Nations agencies and international organizations
attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The First General Assembly of the commission was held in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Complaint against Lebanon to Be Examined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon was officially informed
today of an Israeli complaint against it over a bombing attack
Wednesday in south Lebanon by Muslim guerrillas, which killed four
people.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Lebanese National News Agency (LNNA),
Israel filed the complaint to the five-nation Cease-fire
Monitoring Committee. It was then faxed to the Foreign Ministry in
Beirut by the international panel's Cyprus-based chairman,
U.S. diplomat David Greenlee.
</P>
<P>
The committee, formed by representatives from France, Israel,
Lebanon, Syria and the United States following an Israeli blitz in
south Lebanon last year, is to meet in the south Lebanese border
town of Naqoura next Monday to look into the Israeli complaint.
</P>
<P>
Israel claimed that the bombing taking place in the Israeli
self-carved "security zone" in south Lebanon was aimed at
civilians, thus violating the cease-fire understanding reached by
Lebanon and the Jewish state in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that all the six victims, four killed and two
wounded, were not military.
</P>
<P>
But the state-run LNNA quoted security sources as saying that
the persons killed in the operations were members of the
Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army (SLA) militia.
</P>
<P>
Claiming responsibility for the attacks, the Lebanese
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, issued in Beirut today a
statement elaborating details of the operation, but only
specifying two casualties.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim Shiite fundamentalist group said that its fighters
detonated a roadside bomb at 9:30 p.m. (1830 GMT) as a car driven
by two senior SLA officers approached.
</P>
<P>
The two men, identified as Claude Khalil, who was in charge of
the Bater crossing, and Nimr Nammour, the SLA's officer
responsible for security affairs in the Jezzine panhandle, were
killed, it said.
</P>
<P>
The bombing came only hours after an Israeli air raid at a
suspected guerrilla base in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, two Israeli warplanes fired four
air-to-surface missiles in two runs at an unknown target in the
Western Beqaa some 80 kilometers southeast of Beirut, causing no
casualties.

<HEADLINE> Mass Media Urged to Support African Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 19 (Xinhua) -- African information ministers today
urged the media to play an effective role in promoting political
stability and economic and social development in Africa.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued at the end of the eighth Conference of
African Information Ministers stressed the importance of the
recommendations issued by the 33rd African summit in Harare which
deals with several urgent crisis facing the continent.
</P>
<P>
It called upon African media to widely circulate the
declaration on the Libya-West crisis in order to "assert Africa's
support of the Libyan people" who have been suffering from the
five-year-old UN-imposed sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The Harare summit seconded the Libyan proposals on ending the
dispute over the trial of two Libyans suspected of involvement in
the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
Libya proposed the trial be conducted in any country other
than Britain and the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The communique also urged the African mass media to support
South Africa in its bid for holding the 2004 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The communique reiterated the importance of holding a meeting
between African information ministers and telecommunications
ministers in the future.
</P>
<P>
The conference also approved the resumption of privatization of
the financially-strapped Pan African News Agency, an affiliated
inter-governmental news service of the Organization of African
Unity, before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
It called on the secretariat general to follow up the
collection of the arrears by the various African states within a
month to ensure a smooth implementation of the restructure plan.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the meeting, Board of Directors
of the Dakar-based PANA has proposed selling 25 percent of its
capital to national news agencies of African countries and offer
the rest for private interests.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 African information ministers and delegates
attended the three-day meeting that began on June 17.
</P>
<P>
Egypt signed 15 protocols with 14 African countries on
media cooperation during the conference.

<HEADLINE> S. African Diplomats to Represent Tanzania Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 19 (Xinhua) -- South African diplomats
might soon have to represent Tanzania in countries where the east
African state has no foreign mission, Deputy President Thabo
Mbeki said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the first plenary meeting of the Southern African
Development Community's parliamentary forum in Cape Town, Mbeki
said the matter had been raised during his informal talks with
Tanzania's High Commissioner to South Africa, according to a
report by the local press.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said he had been informed by the Tanzanian diplomat that
the Tanzanian government could not afford to maintain all its
missions abroad.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat had asked him to look at the matter as it was
possible that Tanzania would ask South African diplomats to
represent it in countries where it had no foreign missions, said
Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki also said he had agreed, although he had not consulted
with Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo, noting this was yet
another manifestation of regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
South African diplomats would, therefore, be given
documentation and receive one to three-day workshops so that they
could learn about Tanzania and represent it properly, said the
report.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's Disaster
Prevention and Preparedness Commission today said the
international donors community's response toward its appeal for
assistance of food in 1997 was poor.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the commission said although
follow-up meetings to review the status of the response to the
appeal were conducted and representatives of the donor community
expressed their willingness to provide support, so far the level
of response was by and large disappointing.
</P>
<P>
The commission said although the total net requirement which
was disclosed in December, 1996 and the additional requirement
for mainly pastoral areas issued to February 1997 stood at
180,000 metric tons, only 88,900 metric tons has been pledged
this year.
</P>
<P>
"This leaves a gap of about 100,000 metric tons yet to be
fulfilled," the release said, adding that "the above amount does
not even include the requirements of the small rainy season
producing areas of the country."
</P>
<P>
The commission called on all concerned to take note of the
prevailing serious food shortage and come forward with the
required response before the situation deteriorates and develops
into a human suffering that could otherwise be prevented.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, Portugal Begin East Timor Talks at UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan today opened the first meeting in
nearly a year between the foreign ministers of Indonesia and
Portugal on the question of East Timor, a U.N. spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting will be limited to procedural questions in
hopes more talks can be scheduled for mid-July and momentum can be
kept going with subsequent sessions, sources close to the meeting
said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope nobody expects we will go immediately into the
substance. We have to lay the groundwork for the talks
themselves," Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Before calling on the U.N. chief, Alatas and Portuguese Foreign
Minister Jaime Gama met separately with U.S. Ambassador Bill
Richardson to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, which incorporated the territory in 1976 as its 27th
province, claims that East Timor is part of the island nation.
Portugal, which withdrew from the island after 400 years of
colonial rule, reportedly wants a referendum to determine the
territory's future.
</P>
<P>
Talks under U.N. auspices to find an internationally acceptable
solution to the situation were initiated in 1983 by the then U.N.
chief Javier Perez de Cuellar.
</P>
<P>
But the current meeting is the first under U.N. auspices since
Annan became U.N. secretary-general last January. U.N. officials
acknowledge the two sides are still far apart on the question.

<HEADLINE> New Budget Presented to Tanzanian Parliament for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has reviewed several taxes, widened the tax base and promised to
increase salaries in the civil service in the 1997/98 financial
year, but did not state new scales of the salaries.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here, Finance Minister Daniel
Yona told the National Assembly in Dodoma, central Tanzania today
that he was moving "a budget of co-operation and self-reliance"
designed to boost the country's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The minister announced reduction of tax bands on customs duty
and sales tax to simplify administration, but the budget saw
increased tax on petroleum products, imported vehicles, beer,
spirits and cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
The budget, however, implies that prices of many products are
likely to go up soon because taxes on petroleum product would
lead to increased fare and freight costs.
</P>
<P>
The maximum customs duty has been reduced to 30 percent from
40 percent, while sales tax on goods also went down to 25 percent
from 30 percent, but maximum sales tax on services went up from
15 to 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the government proposed to spend
975,639 million Tanzania Shillings (about 1,626 million US
Dollars) in the 1997/98 financial year.
</P>
<P>
He said 695,300 million T.Shs. (about 1,158 million Dollars)
would be realized from domestic revenue, while 340,034 million
T.Shs. (about 566 million Dollars) was expected in from external
sources such as loans, grants and aid.
</P>
<P>
Minister Yona said the government would not borrow from banks
in the 1997/98 financial year, but repay 59,695 million T.Shs.
(about 99 million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
He said domestic revenue and external finance projections gave
a gap of 64,042 million T.Shs. (about 106 million Dollars) which
was to be bridged by several new tax and non-tax measures,
including fees and licenses many of which have been lined up for
review.
</P>
<P>
He said all four-wheel drive station wagons vehicles would be
charged excise duty of 30 percent, while customs duty has been
increased to 30 percent from 20 percent, a move that was expected
to earn the government 4,542 million T.Shs. (about 7.57 million
Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The minister said adjustment of taxes on imported beer would
earn the government 2,510 million T.Shs. (about 4.18 million
Dollars), while new taxes on cigarettes would bring in extra
3,035 million T.Shs. (about 5.05 million Dollars) revenue and
adjustment on petroleum products are to earn 13,411 million
T.Shs. (about 22.3 million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
He said changes of taxes in imported textiles were expected to
bring in 3,712 million T.Shs. (about 6.2 million Dollars), while
the 25 percent sales tax introduced on bottled water would earn
the state 1,666 million T.Shs. (about 2.7 million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Also up for review, includes several fees and licenses charged
on government services, such as business licenses, birth and
death registration fees, company registration fees and court
fines.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would collect tax arrears on fraudulent
exemptions issued under the Investment Promotion Center (IPC),
where at least 4,400 million T.Shs. (about 7.3 million Dollars)
could be realized.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the government proposes to abolish
withholding tax on business insurance claims, excess profit tax
and single trade transaction tax.

<HEADLINE> Meguid: HK's Return Crowns China's Reunification Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel Meguid said today the return of Hong Kong to its motherland
crowns the relentless efforts of China toward reunification and
serves as a historic paragon in international relations.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with Cairo-based Chinese
correspondents, the Arab leader hailed the return of the
British-ruled territory to China in a peaceful manner as a "unique
model in the international relations."
</P>
<P>
"The return of Hong Kong crowns the relentless efforts China
has exerted and is still exerting to push the process of
reunification forward," said the Arab leader, who had visited
China four times and Hong Kong more than once.
</P>
<P>
Meguid expressed his confidence that China is keen to keep Hong
Kong an attractive economic, trading and tourist region after
recovering the territory from 155 years of British occupation.
</P>
<P>
"China will spare no effort to entrench the stability and
prosperity of Hong Kong and to tap its potentials as an economic
bustle," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meguid added that the handover of Hong Kong has proved that
conflicting parties may reach peaceful solutions that take into
consideration of each others' interests.
</P>
<P>
"It is different from previous unification models in history
such as Germany, for example... and sets an example to be followed
in today's world," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It also represents a path to pursue in resolving conflicts as
well as regional and international problems through peaceful and
cordial means," he added.
</P>
<P>
The AL chief also hailed the principle of "one country two
systems" put forth by late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping in a bid
to bring back Hong Kong and Taiwan to the embrace of the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
"It undoubtedly reflects China's strong will to maintain
international peace and security, its desire to uphold peaceful
coexistence and its decision not to squander any of its legitimate
rights," Meguid said.
</P>
<P>
He voiced the conviction that the accurate implementation of
what had been agreed upon would provide an example to be followed
with regard to the remaining problems.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Withdraws Some Troops from Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has started to withdraw
some parts of its troops from northern Iraq, the semi-official
Anatolia News Agency reported tonight.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that Turkey began to retreat some of its
security forces from the areas under the control of Iraq's
Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) led by Mesud Barzani in the
region.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 tanks and armored vehicles returned to Turkey
from northern Iraq over the past week after completing their
mission, the agency said, adding that the military operation is
continuing along the Iranian border in pursuit of the rebels of
the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Turkey has repeatedly accused Iran of supporting the PKK,
which has been fighting a separatist war for autonomy
in eastern and southeastern Turkey since August 1984.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani said Sunday in Istanbul,
the largest city of Turkey, that there were no rebels of the PKK
guerrillas on the Iranian territory.
</P>
<P>
Six government security forces were killed and five others
wounded late Wednesday night by PKK members in armed attacks in
Gorenoluk village in Eruh town of southeastern province of Siirt
on their way back from the cross-border military operation.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Committed to Enhance Economic Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Wang Jinyu)
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is
committed to enhancing economic reforms with a bid to speed up
economic development in the coming fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
In a budget speech for the fiscal year 1997/98 made here this
afternoon, Kenyan Finance Minister Musalia Mudavadi said that
"economic reforms were irreversible".
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan minister pointed out that in the coming year Kenya
would continue reforms in various economic sectors in order to
sustain a growth rate of 4 percent in 1997 by addressing new
issues and obstacles.
</P>
<P>
He put forward a proposal to the parliament that measures
should be taken to make it illegal for a person to bring goods
into Kenya, label or repack them and subsequently re-export such
goods as "Kenyan made".
</P>
<P>
Mudavadi noted that the consequences of transshipment of goods
which were disguised as exports originating from Kenya can be
"disastrous to Kenya's development efforts".
</P>
<P>
"Our textile industry has been a victim of this transshipment
problem, which made the United States impose quotas on Kenyan
textile exports."
</P>
<P>
The minister stated that Kenya's liberal trade policy had
resulted in increased imports and weakened the economy of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
In order to protect local industry, he said, Kenya will impose
additional duty "to the extent of dumping margins or subsidies
following appropriate investigations".
</P>
<P>
Referring to diversion of transit goods, Mudavadi said, the
sugar industry has suffered greatly as a result of such
diversion.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda had agreed to
harmonize tax procedures and administration in order to eliminate
diversion of transit goods.
</P>
<P>
In the coming year, the minister said, the three east African
countries are expected to adopt a common transit bond system
which will specify the address, physical abode of the importer
and a common anti-smuggling mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The minister also dealt with sectoral reforms including
finance, agriculture, co-operatives, tele-communications and
railways.
</P>
<P>
The coming fiscal year is the fourth year since Kenya embarked
on a comprehensive program of economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
During the past year, he noted, Kenya has made further
progress in structural reforms since the last budget day.
</P>
<P>
In total, the Kenyan government has divested its shareholdings
in 148 enterprises from the original 207, leaving only 59
enterprises to be divested, he added.
</P>
<P>
In 1997/98 fiscal year, the Kenyan government is committed to
accelerate privatization and commercialization.
</P>
<P>
As a result of implementation of economic reforms, the
minister pointed out, Kenya "has reversed the slide in production
and restored macro-economic stability".
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Kenya managed to achieve a growth of 4.6 percent
despite poor weather conditions and associated electric power
shortages.
</P>
<P>
Inflation had been brought down to 5.1 percent in 1995/96 from
49.4 percent in 1993/94, according to the budget speech.
</P>
<P>
The annual inflation rate in the first quarter of 1997 rose to
12.3 percent due to drought-induced food price increases and the
rate is expected to moderate in the coming months as the food
supply situation improves.
</P>
<P>
Gross official foreign exchange reserves increased to about
one billion U.S. Dollars or 4 months import cover in May, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit has been reduced from 8.4 percent of GDP
five years ago to 1.2 percent in 1996/97, the minister noted.

<HEADLINE> 2 Soldiers Killed by PKK in Southeastern Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Two soldiers were killed and four
others wounded today in armed attacks by the rebels of the
illegal Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in southeastern Turkey, the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported tonight.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that a group of the PKK rebels opened fire at
a convoy of troops on the way to support the security forces in
the military operations near Sarisaman village in Genc town of
Bingol province, killing two soldiers immediately.
</P>
<P>
The wounded soldiers were taken to Bingol and Elazig State
Hospitals for treatment, the agency added.
</P>
<P>
Late Wednesday night, the PKK rebels killed six government
security forces and wounded other five in Gorenoluk village in
Eruh town of Siirt province.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers were on their way back from the cross-border
military operations against the PKK in northern Iraq, which has
been fighting an almost 13-year-old separatist war for autonomy
in eastern and southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
About 50,000-strong Turkish government troops, backed by
artillery and air power, poured into northern Iraq on May 14 to
attack the PKK rebels, who allegedly constitute the most
dangerous threat to the Turkish security.
</P>
<P>
At least 2,500 PKK rebels were reportedly killed in the latest
Turkish cross-border military operation in northern Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Economic Growth to be Higher This Year in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania expects higher
economic growth and increased exports this year, according to a
report reaching here today from Dodoma, central Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State in the President Office, Nassor Malocho told
the National Assembly in Dodoma today that the economic growth
was forecast at 5.0 percent, up from 4.2 percent in 1996 and 4.0
percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The minister of state said exports projections for 1997 were
at 822.3 million US Dollars, up from 786.27 million US Dollars
last year and 682.92 million US Dollars in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Malocho described last year's economic performance as
"encouraging", despite being below the target set at 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the failure to achieve the target to poor
performance in communication and transport sectors due to
political crises and insecurity in neighboring Rwanda, Burundi
and Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The minister said drought which hit several parts of the
country between October last year and last March, affected
efforts to bring down inflation to a targeted 15 percent by the
end of this month.
</P>
<P>
He said inflation averaged 27.4 percent in 1995, it was
brought down to 21 percent in the following year and was at 13.5
percent in February this year.
</P>
<P>
"But drought pushed up prices of food, which accounts for 71.2
percent in the country's national consumer price index (NCPI),
and inflation reached 17.5 percent in March and 17.2 percent in
April.
</P>
<P>
"Food supply situation is expected to remain poor in many
parts of the country. We are therefore not likely to bring down
inflation to our target of 7.5 percent by June next year,"
Malocho said.
</P>
<P>
He, however, said "we hope to bring down inflation to 10
percent by June next year and reach 5.0 percent level in June,
1999."
</P>
<P>
The minister said the country had continued to register an
impressive balance of trade and payments, with deficits narrowing
significantly since 1995.
</P>
<P>
He said balance of payments deficit reached 223.91 million US
Dollars last year, down from 373.65 million US Dollars in 1995
and 446.7 million US Dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The minister attributed the trend to increased exports and
fall in imports. He said the country's exports last year,
accounted for 65 percent of the nation's import bill.
</P>
<P>
"In 1995 the exports accounted for 51 percent of the import
bill, compared to 28 percent in 1991," the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Malocho said that debt servicing was a burden to the economy,
eating up 30 percent of exports and 40 percent of the
government's recurrent revenue.
</P>
<P>
He said the country's external debt stood at 7.8 billion US
Dollars this year, down from 8 billion US Dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
The Minister said the government has adopted debt reduction
strategy, which includes promoting trade relations with various
countries and avoiding unnecessary credits.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would see to it that repayment was done
according to schedules to avoid arrears which tend to compound
the magnitude of the debt problem.
</P>
<P>
The minister said divestiture of parastatals was to be speeded
up in the 1997/98 financial year and would also involve public
firms in financial, energy, telecommunication and transport
sectors.
</P>
<P>
He said as of May this year 154 parastatals were divested by
the parastatal Sector Reform Commission (PSRC) and 20 placed
under the Loans and Advances Recovery Trust (LART) for
liquidation.
</P>
<P>
The minister said PSRC sold government stakes in 79 firms to
private buyers, 24 parastatals leased out, 32 liquidated, 14
disbanded and 5 entered into management performance agreements.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Urges no Use of Children as Combatants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) today called on all sides in Sierra Leone
to put an end to the use of children as combatants and to
incorporate provisions for their physical and emotional welfare in
a future peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
"Children should have no part in war," said Carol Bellamy,
UNICEF's Executive Director. "By making them agents of civil
conflict and depriving them of their childhood, the vicious cycle
of violence is perpetuated."
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone has one of the world's worst records for
recruiting child soldiers. Between 1992 and 1996, in the previous
period of civil unrest between the government and the
Revolutionary United Front, an estimated 4,500 children were
forced to fight on both sides.
</P>
<P>
Since May 25, when the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council took
power in a coup, witnesses have reported seeing hundreds of armed
children in the streets of the capital, Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy called for the immediate demobilization of all child
soldiers. The proposals outlined in the 1996 Report on the Impact
of Armed Conflict on Children by Graca Machel should be urgently
implemented, she added.

<HEADLINE> Ireland's Economic Boom Likely to Gather Momentum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Ireland's economists said in Dublin
today that the forecasts for the country's 1997 economic growth
rate will probably be revised upwards as official figures have
confirmed the country's booming economic growth rate in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Official figures released early today by the country's Central
Statistics Office revealed that the gross domestic product grew by
7.8 percent in 1996 and gross national product was up by 6.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Central Statistics Office said in a statement that the
buoyant consumer spending, which rose by 6.3 percent in volume
terms over 1995, contributed to the rise in the 1996 aggregates.
</P>
<P>
The Riada stockbrokers economist Dan McLaughlin was quoted by
press reports from Dublin as saying today: "These numbers show
that the extent of the boom we have had is unprecedented in Irish
economic history. Ireland has had 25 percent growth in three
years."
</P>
<P>
McLaughlin pointed out that he would expect to revise his
forecasts for 1997 up from 6 percent to about 7.5 percent, based on
the strength of the 1996 outturn.
</P>
<P>
"If our revised forecasts for 1997 are right at around 7.5
percent GNP growth, then the economy will have expanded by a third
in four years, which is absolutely incredible," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bank of Ireland Group Treasury economist Jim Power
said the official figures indicated that there was obviously more
momentum in the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
"The figures confirm the very strong economy we had last year
and which is carrying over into this year. I had forecast GNP of
6.0 percent for 1997. Now I think a growth rate of 6.5 percent
should be easily achievable and I expect I will revise 1997 GDP
growth up to about 7.0 percent from 6.4 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think the consumer growth is going to be stronger than I
would have anticipated and investment is also likely to be
stronger. There is obviously more momentum in there than I
thought," he added.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Britain Urges U.N. to Take Tough Steps against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The State Department said on
Thursday that the United States, collaborated with Britain, had
prepared a draft resolution urging U.N. Security Council to take
"tough Steps" against Iraq for its lack of compliance with U.N.
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman John Dinger said the United States
and Britain submitted the draft resolution as Iraq had recently
attempted to block inspections by the U.N. commission at three
sites. The U.N. commission is known as UNSCOM, responsible for
monitoring Iraqi compliance with the U.N. resolution to eliminate
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Dinger said the draft resolution recommended "appropriately
tough steps to show the council's full support for UNSCOM and to
demonstrate to Iraq in no uncertain terms that it simply cannot
defy the will of the council without penalty."
</P>
<P>
Iraq has reportedly said it had the right to restrict access to
sensitive sites that affect national security and the safety of
President Saddam Hussein. And it accused the United States of
using the U.N. inspectors as a cover for gathering intelligence.
</P>
<P>
Dinger said the draft resolution being circulated by U.S.
and British officials at the United Nations contained specific
ideas to punish Iraq, but he declined to elaborate.

John Hinckley Jr.'s request to get one day of unsupervised freedom

Hinckley, 42, shot at former president Ronald Reagan outside a

Hinckley was found innocent by reason of insanity in 1982, but

tried to kill the president to impress actress Jodie Foster.
</P>

Hinckley's parents had sought to get 14 hours of unsupervised

<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The China Council for the
Promotion of Peaceful Reunification held a forum today at the
Great Hall of the People with the theme of greeting Hong Kong's
return and promoting the reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Wang Guangying, chairman of the council and vice-chairman of
the National People's Congress Standing Committee, said at the
meeting that Hong Kong's return to the motherland will have a
great impact on Macao's smooth return and the final resolution of
the Taiwan question.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the reunification of the motherland is the
common historical mission of all Chinese people including those in
Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macao and other overseas areas, and that the
council is ready to work with people both at home and abroad to
achieve the goal.
</P>
<P>
Wan Guoquan, another chairman of the council and vice-chairman
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
National Committee, said today that leading Taiwan authorities
refuse to hold talks between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits
on the "One-China" principle and have gone farther down the road
of splittism.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the practice of "one country, two
systems" will help the Taiwanese people and Taiwan authorities
have a better understanding of the principle.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Tinghan, deputy head of the United Front Work Department
of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, said that the
Taiwan question is a matter related to China's sovereignty and
territorial integrity, and his department will work harder to
fight against splittist activities in Taiwan and promote the
peaceful reunification of the motherland.

Consultants and members of the council, representatives of
non-Communist parties, public organizations, and compatriots from
Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan were present at the forum.

<P>
Yimaz, who leads the second largest party in the Turkish

trying to slowly dissolve the secularist system of Turkey, which
is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and
create an Islamic state similar to Iran.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Erbakan, also Welfare Party (RP) leader,
submitted his resignation to Demirel and asked him to appoint
center-right True Path Party (DYP) Chairwoman Tansu Ciller to
form the new government with the RP and with the support of the
the Grand Unity Party (BBP).
</P>

<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- As the day when the government of
the People's Republic of China resumes its exercise of sovereignty
over Hong Kong is fast approaching, issues concerning Hong Kong's
consular affairs are attracting considerable attention from Hong
Kong residents and the international community.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Cui Tiankai today issued a
notice to explain the facts of consular-related matters, saying
that:
</P>
<P>
1. As of June 23, 1997, Chinese embassies and consulates in

available as of July 1.
</P>
<P>
2. As of June 23, 1997, Chinese embassies and consulates in

HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
3. With regard to any visa for entry into Hong Kong issued by

other countries before June 30, transitional arrangements have
been made which stipulate the following:
</P>
<P>
-- The visas issued by the Immigration Department of the
British HK authorities before June 30 can be used until their

Kong and provide convenience for their entry.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Poises Strong Economy Among G-7 Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy is back at the
front of the most advanced countries, according to a report of the
USA Today.
</P>
<P>
The paper made comparisons between the nations of seven leading
industrial powers, whose leaders are now in Denver, the U.S., for
their annual summit.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has by far the fastest economic growth rate of any of
the G-7 countries, a group which also includes Japan, Germany,
France, Italy, Britain and Canada, the paper said. It has a 4.8
percent unemployment rate, the lowest except for Japan, which had
a 3.3 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
The country also has the smallest government budget deficit
(relative to the size of its economy) except for Canada. The U.S.
budget deficit as a percentage of GDP is estimated to be 1.5
percent this year, while Canada will only have a 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
While its economy is growing stronger, the U.S. is applying
pressure on others, according to the report. President Clinton
made it clear he expects Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
to follow through on his proposals to deregulate Japan's economy.
</P>
<P>
And U.S. officials also are expected to privately urge the
European G-7 countries to move more quickly to expand the
15-member European Union (EU) to include the former Soviet block.

<HEADLINE> Top Macao Businessman Calls HK Return Encouraging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A top Macao businessman said here
today that Hong Kong's return to the motherland in 10 days' time
will be an encouragement to Macao in handling its transitional
affairs before its own return to China in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Ma Man Kei, president of the Macao Chamber of Commerce, said in
a speech at a reception marking Hong kong's return that Macao
people will be encouraged by the historic event and do their best
to deal with the transitional affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Macao residents will be inspired and encouraged by the
successful return of Hong Kong," he said. "They will take a more
active part in all transitional affairs in Macao."
</P>
<P>
The three leading issues of the transition -- the localization
of the civil service, the localization of law and the use of
Chinese as an official language -- should be quickened under the
joint efforts of all parties involved, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, Macao people should help expand Macao's
economic growth, maintain a good social order and continue
promoting the Macao Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Ma expressed his optimism about the future of
Hong Kong after the handover, saying Hong Kong will surely
continue to be stable, prosperous and growing.
</P>
<P>
"Under the joint efforts of the six million Hong Kong residents
and with the support of an ever-stronger motherland, it is certain
that Hong Kong will maintain its stability, prosperity and
growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
He attributed Hong Kong's smooth transition to Deng Xiaoping's
concept of "one country, two systems."
</P>
<P>
Today's reception, hosted by the Macao Chamber of Commerce, was
attended by more than 300 people including Wang Qiren, director of
the Xinhua News Agency Macao Branch, and other celebrities in the
territory.

<HEADLINE> Kissinger: U.S.-China Ties Key to Stability, Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S.-China relations are the key
to "stability, peace and progress in all regions, as well as to
the economy in Hong Kong," former U.S. Secretary of State Henry
Kissinger said here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a house-full of local audience at a banquet hosted
by the Asia Society Hong Kong Center tonight, Kissinger said, "I
advocate friendly relations and dialogue (between the two
countries), and am opposed to this drive towards confrontation."
</P>
<P>
"I support basic directions of the U.S. foreign policy," he
said, adding, "The U.S. and China may discover a new cooperative
basis."
</P>
<P>
He said, "I'm optimistic of the future (of relations between
the two nations)."
</P>
<P>
"I like the Chinese people and the Chinese culture. My attitude
to China is not based on sentiment but on my assessment of
national interests," Kissinger said.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger said many people in the United States believe in
close relations with China, which he held will be beneficial to
both countries.
</P>
<P>
"It is unreasonable for the foreign policy of China to exclude
the most developed capitalist country, nor the foreign policy of
the U.S. to exclude the most populous country," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China is a country which has survived for more
than 5,000 years, without advice from the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger urged the U.S. not to try to reduce the influence of
China, nor China try to reduce the influence of the U.S.
</P>
<P>
He held that China is becoming increasingly "powerful and
influential," but "it would not or could not attack the U.S. in
the way that the former Soviet Union could."
</P>
<P>
Kissinger arrived here earlier today from Beijing, and is
scheduled to leave here for the U.S. Saturday.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The preparatory work for the
government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
has been operating smoothly, Tung Chee Hwa said here today.
</P>
<P>
The three-tier executive, legislative and judicial structures
have been completed, and will go into official operation on July
1, he said at an evening party, titled "Singing Merrily and

Recently, he was busy considering the work for grand ceremonies
and studying the matters relating to the election of the First
Legislative Counciil, he noted.
But, he added, he was happy with his work and everything goes
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
"That is attributed to the trust Hong Kong residents and the
central government have put in me," Tung said. Moreover, he
expressed his conviction that Hong Kong will be still better in
five years, 10 years, or 50 years than what it is today.
</P>
<P>
Lo Man Tuen, president of the Hong Kong Industrial Districts
Industry and Commerce Associations Ltd., which sponsored the

economy in China's interior are complementary and mutually
beneficial to each other, and that Hong Kong's present stability
and prosperity are inseparable from the support rendered by the
interior areas.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will return to the embrace of the motherland in just
10 days, and this will provided it with new opportunities for
further development, Lo said.

HONG KONG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- China's world champion and
Olympic gold-medalist Lin Li arrived here on Friday after
accepting an offer to coach in the Hong Kong Sports Institute
(HKSI).
</P>
<P>
Lin has been China's most decorated woman swimmer, with titles
ranging from Asian Games, the world championships to the Olympic
Games. She retired after the Atlanta Olympics last year.
</P>
<P>
Lin is the second former member of the Chinese national
swimming team to be coaching in the HKSI, following Wang Dali, a
freestyle specialist in China's national men's team.
</P>
<P>
Chan Yiu-hai, HKSI's head swimming coach, had decided two years
ago to invite Lin, for her experience as a swimmer and as a
coach. Lin had been a coach in Taiwan for five months till
January 1996.
</P>
<P>
But Chan's plan had to be shelved as Lin was at that time
preparing for the Atlanta Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Lin retired after the Games and had been assisting Zhang Xiong,
the deputy head coach of the national swimming team and her
personal coach.
</P>
<P>
Lin will start to work in a trial period of three months from
now, training a group of young swimmers.
</P>
<P>
She will make her final decision after that period on whether
to stay in the Institute for longer terms.

<HEADLINE> Offshore Oil Industry Should Focus on Efficiency, Profit: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-premier Wu Bangguo
said here today China's offshore oil industry should focus on
efficiency and profit so as to be up to the world's advanced
standards.
</P>
<P>
Wu gave the instruction in a letter to a national conference on
reform and development of China's off-shore oil industry held by
the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC).
</P>
<P>
Wu said that oil production holds an important position in the
nation's economic development; Since the 1980s, China has sought
out foreign cooperation for the exploration of offshore oil
resources, intending to speed up the oil industry development.
</P>
<P>
Since its founding 15 years ago, the CNOOC has used more than
five billion US dollars of foreign funds; its annual production of
crude oil jumped from the original 100,000 tons to 18 million tons
in 1996, including three million tons of gas, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
"It has been proved correct for the offshore oil industry to
make use of foreign funds, and this practice must be continued,"
Wu said.
</P>
<P>
The corporation should work in the future to explore more
offshore oil resources and increase its reserve, strengthen its
management and better adapt to the market, Wu urged.
</P>
<P>
CNOOC General Manager Wang Yan said in the meeting that he is
optimistic over the prospect of China's offshore oil industry.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that the country's annual output of crude oil will
reach 16 million tons, in addition to 8.5 to 10 billion cubic
meters of natural gas. The overall oil production in 2010 is
expected to hit 40 to 50 million tons, he said.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 officials from the central government departments
and experts attended the meeting.

<P>
DHAKA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's export earnings from
jute and jute goods during the first 10 months of the current
fiscal year fell by over 10 percent against the targets.
</P>
<P>
The earning from jute goods alone during 1996-97 fiscal year
(July -April) declined by about 19 percent against the target,
according to the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB).
</P>
<P>
However, the export earnings during the same period showed an

corresponding period of the last fiscal (1995-96).
</P>
<P>
Dhaka exported jute and jute goods worth 366.36 million U.S.
dollars in the first 10 months of the current fiscal while the
target was fixed at 408.83 million dollars, said the EPB.
</P>
<P>
Of the total exported jute goods, 4.44 million US dollars were
earned from carpet. The major exported items of jute goods were
hessian, sacking, jute carpet backing cloth, and jute twine.
</P>
<P>
Over the same period, a total of about 1.45 million bales of
raw jute and 0.42 million tons of jute goods were exported against
1.07 million bales and 0.44 million tons in the corresponding
period of 1995-96.
</P>

The EPB said that the price of jute goods increased to 631.05
dollars per ton from 585 dollars while the price of raw jute stood
at 66.14 dollars from 60.16 dollars per bale in the international
market during the first 10 months of the current fiscal.
</P>
<P>
However, the productions of jute goods in both public and
private sector mills in Bangladesh are showing a downward trend
for the last two fiscal years, the EPB added.

<HEADLINE> 5th Anniversary of Shanghai Newspaper for Overseas Chinese Marked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A Shanghai newspaper designed for
overseas Chinese readers, named "Shanghai Qiao Bao" in Chinese,
celebrated the fifth anniversary of its founding here today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper was first printed in Shanghai, soon after late
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping's south China tour in early 1992. The
newspaper aims at reporting on the latest development progress of
Shanghai -- the city considered to be the first frontier of
China's reform and opening up drive.
</P>
<P>
The weekly four-page newspaper has been circulated in overseas
Chinese societies, chambers of commerce, Chinese embassies or
consulates, and overseas Chinese communities in 64 countries and
regions.
</P>
<P>
"The newspaper has become a bridge between Shanghai and
overseas Chinese which provides business opportunities and
attracts overseas investment to Shanghai," said Yuan Cai, director
of Office of Overseas Chinese Affairs of Shanghai and head of the
newspaper, at today's cocktail party.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that about 70 percent of Shanghai's 16,000
overseas-funded projects, which have a total contractual volume of
investment of 50 billion US dollars, were brought by Chinese in
foreign countries and business people from Hong Kong, Macao, and
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Of Shanghai's 87 newspapers, Shanghai Qiao Bao is the only
publication that focuses on overseas Chinese affairs.

UNITED NATIONS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Iraq Sanctions
Committee under the UN Security Council said here Thursday that
issues relating to Iraq's debts should be settled according to the

Recently, the Security Council Committee established by

states requesting the Committee's approval to settle commercial
debts, incurred by Iraq prior to the Persian Gulf crisis through
importation of Iraqi goods.
</P>
<P>
The Committee was not able to accede to such requests on
grounds that such transactions were inconsistent with provisions
in relevant Security Council resolutions, in particular Security
Council resolution 661.
</P>
<P>
The Committee advised that while the sanctions regime did not
exonerate Iraq from its debts and obligations incurred prior to
the Persian Gulf crisis, issues relating to Iraq's debts should be
settled in a way consistent with relevant Security Council
resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Clashes Continue in Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian protesters clashed
with Israeli soldiers for the seventh consecutive day today in
the West Bank town of Hebron, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Fire bombs and stones were reportedly thrown at Israeli
security forces who fired tear gas and rubber bullets at
Palestinian demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
At least 20 Palestinians and one Israeli soldier were injured
during the clashes along the line between Jewish neighborhoods
and Palestinian areas in the disputed city.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security sources claimed that many of the
demonstrators were brought in from outside Hebron, arguing that
the confrontations were being organized from behind the scene.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been accusing the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) of "encouraging" the current clashes between the two sides,
while Palestinians categorically denied the allegation.
</P>
<P>
Violent confrontations erupted in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, following last week's United States Congress resolution
to recognize united Jerusalem as Israel's capital.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 406-17
to recognize Jerusalem as the undivided capital of Israel,
despite opposition by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
The house also voted to provide 100 million U.S. dollars
for moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to
Jerusalem in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians, who see East Jerusalem as the capital of
a future Palestinian State, sharply criticized the resolution,
which they said would hurt the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, PNA President Yasser Arafat stressed in Gaza
that the Jerusalem issue would not be decided by the U.S.
congress, reiterating East Jerusalem will be the capital of
the Palestinian State.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the PNA cabinet issued a statement, blaming the
U.S., the Israeli soldiers, and Jewish settlers for what it
said was an "explosive situation everywhere because of Israeli
settlement aggression."
</P>
<P>
PNA chief Jerusalem representative Faisal Husseini warned that
if the U.S. approves the resolution, "the whole peace process
will be lost."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. congressional resolution about Jerusalem was taken by
Palestinians as implicit U.S. support for Israel's stand for
creating facts on the ground prior to final status
negotiations which include Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians have been
stalled since March when Israel started to build a
controversial new Jewish neighborhood at Har Homa (Jabal Abu
Ghneim) on the southeastern outskirts of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians have said that Israel must stop the construction
before talks can resume, while, Israel is insisting that the
PNA must crack down on terror and reestablish full security
cooperation.

Dhaka, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Very little progress has been made
so far in the effort to extinguish the fire which started early on
Sunday at the Magurchhara gas field during exploration for gas,
concerned sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The American company, Occidental, which is in charge of
drilling on the gas field, is making hectic preparations to battle
the fire. But a government source said it would be impossible to
put out the fire in one month if its intensity was not reduced.
</P>
<P>
The fire, the biggest one in Bangladesh, started when a rig hit
a "gas trap" about 840 meters below the surface, causing an
explosion.
</P>
<P>
During the last few days, the fire spread horizontally from 150
feet (about 50 meters) to 300 feet (about 100 meters), but it came
down vertically from 500 feet (about 160 meters) to around 100
feet (about 33 meters).
</P>
<P>
Energy Minister Nooruddin Khan said on Thursday that foreign
experts might take about a month to extinguish the blaze though it
all depends on the method they would use.
</P>
<P>
He hinted that immediately after ending the fire-fighting
mission, Occidental would resume its exploration at other places
in the block.
</P>
<P>
An Occidental official said their rig would be at the place by
the middle of July and they would begin exploration by the end of
next month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former Finance Minister Saifur Rahman visited the
area on Thursday. He said the Occidental was responsible for the
whole operation and criticized the energy minister for his "unwise
remarks."

<HEADLINE> British HMY Britannia Arrives in HK Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The British Her Majesty's Yacht
Britannia, which will withdraw British VIPs from Hong Kong for
home immediately after the historic handover at midnight of June
30, will arrive here on June 23, a British military spokesman said
today.
</P>
<P>
John Hering, spokesman for the Headquarters of the British
Forces in Hong Kong, told reporters here that the VIPs will
include Prince of Wales and Governor of Hong Kong Christopher
Patten, and that the Britannia will be berthed in Victoria Harbor
here until after the handover.
</P>
<P>
The yacht, which has served as an official and private
residence for the British Queen and other royal family members
when they are engaged on overseas visits or voyaging in home
waters, is due to be decommissioned in late 1997 after a 44-year
service.
</P>
<P>
After the handover ceremony, other senior officers of the
British Forces in Hong Kong will leave aboard the HMS Chatham
Frigate, which arrived here earlier this month and is berthed in
Victoria Harbor near the headquarters of the British Forces in
Hong Kong, or the Prince of Wales Barracks on the harbor
waterfront near Central District, a press service officer of the
headquarters said.
</P>
<P>
According to the officer, together with the two ships to depart
will be a supply ship, RFA Sir Percivale, which is assigned to
carry the military equipment including transmitter-receiver
systems.
</P>
<P>
The officer said that the British Forces have also chartered
two British Airways planes for carrying the leaving servicemen and
their families.
</P>
<P>
Britain has had a military presence in Hong Kong since 1841,
when the British flag was first raised on Hong Kong Island
following its military occupation of the island.
</P>
<P>
The British forces in Hong Kong consist of military personnel
from the Royal Navy, Army and Air Force, as well as civilian
staff. In the early 1990s, the forces had about 9,500 personnel,
but their number was reduced to about 3,250 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Now there are over 1,200 personnel including the Black Watch
Regiment's First Battalion of about 550 servicemen, who came here
in February as the last resident infantry battalion in Hong Kong
and will be withdrawn by June 30.

<HEADLINE> Central Military Commission on Hong Kong's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior military official said
here today that in the 100-plus year period since Hong Kong was
ceded to Britain, history has proved that a weak and poor nation
is doomed for humiliation and the forfeit of its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Only a strong and prosperous country can safeguard its dignity,
said Zhang Zhen, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission
(CMC), during a CMC-sponsored discussion on Hong Kong's return to
the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Zhang noted that Hong Kong's return would inspire patriotism
among the Chinese people. China's entire military must carry out
the gist of CMC chairman Jiang Zemin's instructions to strengthen
education in patriotism, and officers and soldiers should transform
their patriotism into action by defending the motherland.
</P>
<P>
That the People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops will commence
defense duties in Hong Kong from zero hour of July 1 is an
important symbol of China's resumption of the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong, Zhang said. The CPC Central Committee
and CMC have placed great emphasis on the organization of the PLA
troops to be stationed in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Officers and soldiers have been well prepared for their
stationing in Hong Kong, said Zhang, who believes that the troops
will faithfully carry out their responsibilities as stipulated in
the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR), and the Garrison Law of the PLA Troops Stationed in the
SAR of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said PLA troops to be stationed in Hong Kong should
demonstrate through their actions that the PLA is well-trained,
powerful and professional in all its operations.
</P>
<P>
He asked all officers and soldiers to study Deng Xiaoping's
important thoughts on Hong Kong, and also the guidelines and
policies made by the Party and set out in the Basic Law so as to
guarantee the smooth transition and long-term prosperity of Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Some 350 people from the Headquarters of the General Staff, the
General Logistics Department and the General Political Department,
of the PLA, and the Chinese People's Armed Police Force attended
today's discussion.
</P>
<P>
Liu Huaqing, member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China
(CPC), and CMC vice-chairman also took part in the discussions.

<HEADLINE> Ulster Police Chief Warns "Dangerous Times" Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's police chief
Ronnie Flannagan today warned that it had come to dangerous times
in the UK's divided province in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in the provincial capital Belfast, Chief
Constable Flannagan of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) said,
"We are in very dangerous times" because the IRA guerrilla renewed
their attacks and because the Protestant marching season" were
only two weeks away.
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt that there are people on both sides who would
want to stoke up trouble in coming weeks and it behoves us all to
isolate these people," local media reports quoted the police chief
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Irish Republican Army (IRA) gunmen shot and killed two
police officers in Lurgan early this week, causing tension high in
the area and prompting the government to break off official
contacts with IRA's political wing Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
The pro-British Protestants would hold an annual parade from a
church at Drumcree on July 6 to commemorate British deaths in the
World War I Battle of the Somme. But the Catholic residents of
the Garvaghy Road area of the nearby town of Portadown are
strongly against such marches for showing triumph and intimidation.
</P>
<P>
The marches held last year led to the worst civil unrest in
decades between the Protestants and the Roman Catholics.
</P>
<P>
Flannagan said he would try to avoid a repeat of last year's
handling of the parade. But he added he felt pity that the two
rival communities had failed to reach agreement in their
face-to-face talks because of mutual suspicion.
</P>
<P>
"I wish it would happen. But I can't force people to sit down
and negotiate face to face," he said.
</P>
<P>
Flannagan also dismissed media reports that the IRA would call
a new ceasefire to get a ban lifted on Sinn Fein's participation
in year-old Belfast peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"I can say on the basis of intelligence we have that such a
cessation is not imminent," he said.

<HEADLINE> HK Determined to Maintain Clean Society: Lily Yam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- "Hong Kong is determined to
maintain a clean society, and I will commit myself to the fight
against corruption," Lily Yam Kwan Pui-ying, Commissioner of the
Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) of the current
and future Hong Kong governments, told Xinhua in a recent
interview.
</P>
<P>
Yam will retain her post in the government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), which will be established
on July 1 after Hong Kong returns to China.
</P>
<P>
She was nominated by Tung Chee Hwa, Chief Executive of the
HKSAR, and appointed by the Central People's Government in
February this year.
</P>
<P>
"It is the duty of the ICAC to maintain the cleanness of the
Hong Kong society, which is of vital importance to Hong Kong's
stability and prosperity," said the 50-year-old Yam.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that corruption in the civil service contingent
would not only reduce the efficiency of the civil service, but
also adversely affect the citizens' confidence in the government.
</P>
<P>
She said that since the establishment of the ICAC in early
1974, the anti-corruption awareness of the citizens has improved
substantially.
</P>
<P>
"Over twenty years ago, some people believed that corruption
had become an incurable disease of the Hong Kong society. Now,
most Hong Kong people regard bribery and corruption as absolutely
intolerable," she said.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that whether Hong Kong's anti-corruption
efforts will continue to be successful will depend on three
factors -- the performance of the ICAC, the determination of the
SAR government, and the support of all citizens.
</P>
<P>
"The 'one country, two systems' principle has made sure that no
change will take place in Hong Kong's judicial system and the
operation of the ICAC," she said.
</P>
<P>
She added that apart from a competent and efficient contingent
of investigating officers who can probe into any corruption case
with impartiality, the ICAC also has special staff giving advise
on how to modify government practices and procedures that will
lead to corruption, and educating the public against corruption.
</P>
<P>
At present, she said, the ICAC is making internal changes to
make sure that its investigating department has sufficient human
resources and financial support, and is planning to take a series
of measures to strengthen anti-corruption education among the
citizens.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong people are hard-working and adaptable. I am fully
confident that Hong Kong will become more prosperous and enjoy
greater stability if we implement the 'one country, two systems'
policy," she said.
</P>
<P>
Since joining the government in 1969, Yam has been working in
the civil service for nearly 30 years and has spent many years
with the ICAC. She served as Commissioner for Transport before
assuming the current post on April 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
She is fond of reading and playing tennis, and enjoys classic
music. She also loves indoor plants, with five pots of flowers and
miniature trees in her office.
</P>
<P>
But what she loves most is her job. "I am proud to be a member
of the civil service. You do this not for money, but to serve the
public."

<HEADLINE> China's Springtime Crackdown on Crime Pays Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- China's newest crackldown on
crimes which started in March has produced remarkable results, the
Ministry of Public Security said in a news release today.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, in the "Spring Rectification Mission"
of the "Strike Hard" fight against crime, police departments
nationwide solved 440,000 criminal cases, of which 170,000 were
considered "major."
</P>
<P>
During the same period, over 59,000 criminal gangs were
discovered, 131 of which had Mafia-like characteristics, the
figures show.
</P>
<P>
Police also have caught more than 23,000 escaped prisoners,
closed some 14,000 illegally-operating dance halls and video-game
centers, and sauna and massage parlors engaged in prostitution,
the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, more than 119,000 illegal guns were confiscated in
the drive and property and money worth 160 million yuan were
recovered.
</P>
<P>
The current "Strike Hard" campaign, created to rein in the
country's rising crime rate, started in April last year. After the
completion of a series of actions such as the "Joint Mission,"
the "Winter Mission" and the "Spring Rectification Mission,"
China's police are currently targeting crimes involving drugs.
</P>
<P>
As part of the "Spring Mission," public security bodies have
organized crime prevention networks and increased crackdowns, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Police departments in south China's Guangdong Province have
focused on strengthening control over areas bordering Hong Kong,
and fighting against smugglers in an effort to safeguard the
smooth transfer of power for Hong Kong, said the news release.
</P>
<P>
Beijing police have intensified their battle against drugs and
illegal weapons while tightening their control over the
registration of the apartments rented to migrant workers, it
added. In the Chinese capital, the case of a major bank robbery
which occurred on May 21 was solved in seven days, with more than
160,000 yuan seized.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Security issued a circular recently to
order all the policemen in the country to "maintain an
enthusiastic fighting spirit" to do a good job of ensuring safety
and security for the return of Hong Kong and convening of the 15th
National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party this year.

<HEADLINE> 22 PKK Rebels Killed in Southeastern Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-two rebels of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) were killed in the six-day military
operations of government troops in southeastern Turkey linking
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported today that the
Turkish security forces seriously clashed with the PKK militants,
who escaped to Cudi Mountain in Sirnak province on June 15 from
the Turkish cross-border military operation in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five PKK members including 10 women, who sheltered
themselves in the mountain, surrendered to the Turkish security
forces during the conflicts, said the agency, adding that four
of the 25 PKK guerrillas were wounded in the clashes with
the security forces.
</P>
<P>
About 50,000-strong Turkish government troops, backed by air
power and artillery, poured into northern Iraq on May 14 to
sweep the PKK rebels out of the region.
</P>
<P>
At least 2,500 PKK members were reportedly killed in the
latest Turkish cross-border military operations in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
More than 23,000 people, including PKK rebels, civilians and
government troops, have been killed in conflicts since August
1984 when the PKK started a separatist war for autonomy in
eastern and southeastern Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Opium War Heroes Memorialized by East China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHOUSHAN (Zhejiang), June 20 (Xinhua) -- A public memorial
ceremony was held today for over 5,000 officers and men who died
in the Opium War (1840--1842) in east China's Zhejiang province.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,000 soldiers and local people gathered for the service,
which was held at the ancient battlefield of Dinghai. The occasion
was also regarded as a time for marking Hong Kong's return
to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The Dinghai Battle, from September 26 to October 1, 1841, is
considered by historians as the bloodiest of the Opium War,
launched by Britain to protect its opium trade in China.
</P>
<P>
The fight was launched by three high-ranking officers, Ge
Yunfei, Wang Xipeng, and Zheng Guohong, who led 5,800 soldiers to
defend Dinghai when 29 British ships attempted to capture the
stronghold. The battle lasted for six days and nights ended with
failure of the Chinese, Ge, Wang and Zheng all died on October 1,
1841.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa, the first chief executive of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region, sent a telegram of congratulations
Wednesday to Zhoushan, his hometown, saying that he was glad to
learn that the memorial ceremony would be given in honor of the
return of Hong Kong and the three high-ranking officers. Tung also
expressed good wishes for his hometown's prosperity and future.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 10 Kidnappers Killed in Philippines: Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 kidnappers have been
killed by the government anti-kidnapping task force in Mindanao,
the southern Philippines, during the past two months, a senior
military officer said today.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen other kidnappers were arrested during the period, said
Maj. Gen. Romeo Padiernos, chief of the Army's Southern Command
(Southcom) based in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
But Padiernos said the military could not say the intensified
operations against kidnapping are a success since they are yet to
fully neutralize the nine identified kidnap-for-ransom syndicates
operating in the region.
</P>
<P>
"We have barely scratch the surface ... We cannot yet claim
success because the kidnappers are still operating," Padiernos
said.
</P>
<P>
The Southcom chief said the anti-kidnapping task force had set
up checkpoints in areas where the kidnappers are believed
operating and in their known escape routes.
</P>
<P>
Padiernos said the task force will soon acquire modern arms and
communication equipment to further improve its capability in
running after the kidnapping groups which are reported to be fully
armed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Renato de Villa called for an
intensified military operation against Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF) rebels believed to be behind many kidnapping cases.
</P>
<P>
He said he has given orders for the military in the Southern
Command "to go all out against them in the ground."
</P>
<P>
Kidnapping syndicates have been running rampant in the country,
especially in Mindanao, for years. According to the military, at
least 39 people have already been captured by kidnappers since
January this year in the southern Philippines.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is very small -- it's
only a dot on a map of the world, in the estuary of south China's
Pearl River.
</P>
<P>
It only has an area of slightly more than 1,000 square
kilometers, less than one 100,000th of the global area. Its
population is 6.3 million, one thousandth of the world's.
</P>
<P>
The small Hong Kong, however, enjoys big fame across the world.
Reputed as an international financial, trading, shipping,
information and tourism center, it is the world champion in a
dozen fields.
</P>
<P>
Every one minute a ship enters or leaves the Victoria Harbor of
Hong Kong, which can simultaneously berth 150 big ships, of 10,000
dwt and more.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Hong Kong handled 13.3 million standard containers,
retaining the title of "the world's No.1 container port" for the
fifth year in succession.
</P>
<P>
If containers handled in Hong Kong each year line up one by
one, they can encircle the earth five times.
</P>
<P>
A plane takes off or lands at the Kai Tak International Airport
of Hong Kong every three minutes.
</P>
<P>
In terms of passenger flow, the Kai Tak Airport is one of the

<P>
Hong Kong is the world's eighth largest trader, with a trade
volume of 380 billion US dollars in 1996; and the ninth largest
garment exporter, with an annual export volume of 37.4 billion US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese mainland is the biggest market for both Hong Kong's
imports and exports, and rapid economic development in China's
inland areas has helped Hong Kong maintain one of the highest
economic growth rates in the world.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Chinese Customs show that trade volume
between Hong Kong and China's inland areas in 1996 reached 40.7
billion US dollars, accounting for 14 percent of the total trade
volume of the latter. Statistics from the Hong Kong government
show that trade volume between the two sides expanded 100 folds
from 1978 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese mainland is also the largest market for Hong Kong's
entrepot trade and the top source of re-export goods, and Hong
Kong earns over 120 billion HK dollars a year from entrepot trade
with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The "China factor" has also revitalized Hong Kong's
manufacturing industry. Incomplete statistics show that 90 percent
of its electronics industry, 80 percent of its garment industry,
and 70 percent of its shoe and toy industries have shifted their
production bases to China's interior areas.
</P>
<P>
Due to general optimism for Hong Kong's future, Hong Kong has
been rated as the best business city globe-wide. In 1996, 4,604
foreign companies came to register in Hong Kong, 287 more than in
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The facts and figures show that the "China factor" will make
Hong Kong even better in the future.

<HEADLINE> CPC Commends 18 Model Party Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Communist Party (CPC)
has commended 18 party members as "national outstanding members of
the Communist Party of China" and called for the rest of the
membership to learn from them.
</P>
<P>
The Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee made
the decision today, which is just ten days before the 76th
anniversary of the founding of the CPC and before the convention of
the 15th National Party Congress later this year, to inspire morale
among Party members.
</P>
<P>
Those receiving recognition are household names in China,
including the Beijing bus conductor Li Suli, a policeman in
Jiangxi Province named Qiu Erguo, and Jiang Shuqin, a government
employee who promotes family planning in rural areas in north
China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
The CPC Organization Department said in a circular that all
these people work in grassroots units, but act strictly in
accordance with Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics, devote themselves to the service of the
people, and have displayed their lifelong dedication to the Party
and the people.
</P>
<P>
The department said that now is a crucial time for China to
usher in a new era of reform, opening up and modernization drive,
and it is a sacred mission for the CPC members to lead the people
of all ethnic groups to carry on the socialist cause into the next
century while holding high the banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
It hoped all the CPC members will follow the example of these
models of behavior to rally more closely around the Party central
committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core and contribute to
the country's trans-century goals.

<HEADLINE> Iraq, Iran Willing to Improve Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Iraq and Iran are willing to
improve their relations at all levels, ministers of the two
countries was quoted by Iraqi official News Agency (INA) today.
</P>
<P>
At their meeting on Thursday night, both Iraqi Foreign
Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf and the visiting Iranian
Health Minister Dr. Ali Reza Marandi expressed the willingness
to "normalize the bilateral relations at all levels," said the
INA.
</P>
<P>
Marandi, who arrived in Baghdad Thursday, is the first
Iranian high-ranking official visiting Baghdad in the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
Marandi's visit came after U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen's recent Gulf tour and the Iranian parliamentary election
during which the moderate clergyman Mohammad Khatami was elected
Iran's new president late last month.
</P>
<P>
During his Gulf tour, Cohen reiterated that Iran and Iraq still
pose threats to the regional security and that the U.S.
"dual-containment" policy towards the two countries will not
change.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Iran, long-time foes in the Gulf region, fought an
eight-year war from 1980-88 and neither of them proved to be the
winner. However, their diplomatic ties were resumed in 1990 at
the height of the Gulf crisis, which was triggered by Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Observers here say that it is difficult for the two neighbors
to have normal ties in view of the two pending issues: the
exchange of POWs of the eight-year war and the return of Iraqi
airplanes which flew to Iran during the 1991 Gulf War to avoid
the attack by the U.S.-led allied forces.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A steady growth has been
reported in the number of Hong Kong emigrants who have returned
home on the eve of Hong Kong's return to its motherland.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the Hong Kong government show that at
least 12 percent of those who emigrated overseas during the decade
before 1994 have come back to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Hong Kong's population rose 2.4 percent over the
previous year, compared with an average annual growth of 1.4
percent in the preceding decade. The number of people coming to
Hong Kong in 1996 was 118,500 more than that of those who left, a
considerable part of the former being returnees.
</P>
<P>
This shows that Hong Kong residents' confidence in the city's
future after its return to China has been growing.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the number of emigrating Hong
Kongers has kept falling while that of returnees has been kept
rising steadily.

<HEADLINE> Forum Held to Mark 76th Anniversary of Chinese Communist Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A forum to mark the 76th
anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
was held here this morning, during which senior Party official Hu
Jintao urged Party members and organizations to take a pioneering
role in pushing forward Party building and the country's
cross-century undertakings.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, 18 people were named national outstanding
Communist Party members. Hu, a member of the Standing Committee of
the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and also a
member of the secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, presented
the group with medals and certificates.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the background of the Communist Party, Hu said that
the success of the Party's efforts has resulted not only from the
adherence to Marxism throughout history, but also from the
groundbreaking role of the Party.
</P>
<P>
In the modern-day world, all Party members should on one hand
grasp the general trend of the historical development of human
society, and on the other hand go all out to build socialism with
Chinese characteristics, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hu urged Party members to study and follow Deng Xiaoping's
theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics, so as
to raise their capability for resolving various practical problems
in the process of the country's reform and economic construction.
</P>
<P>
Party members must stand at the front of China's reform,
opening-up and modernization drive, working hard at their
positions to make achievements which are fitting for Communist
Party members, Hu noted.
</P>
<P>
Under any and all circumstances, Party members must establish
close relations with the public and serve the people heart and
soul, learning from the people, showing concern for their life and
protecting their interests, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Party members must guard against the erosion of
decadent ideology, and take the lead in carrying on socialist
ethics, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hu also called on Party members to rally around the CPC Central
Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core, push forward
socialist undertakings, and greet the Party's 15th National
Congress with extraordinary achievements.
</P>
<P>
Ding Guangen, member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central
Committee, was among the senior Chinese officials present at the
forum, which was presided over by Zhang Quanjing, head of the
Organizational Department of the CPC Central Committee.

<HEADLINE> Germany to Suffer Record Jobless Cost in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Double-digit unemployment will cost
the German government about 180 billion marks (104 billion
U.S. dollars) this year, the highest since the German
reunification in 1990, a federal labor institute said today.
</P>
<P>
The costs, 13 percent up from the 159 billion marks (92 billion
dollars) last year, translates to over 40,000 marks for each
jobless, the labour market research institute in Nuremburg said.
</P>
<P>
Official figures put unemployment at 4.23 million in May, or a
rate of 11.1 percent. The IFO Institute for Economic Studies in
Munich estimated the country's people out of work will top 4.3
million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The costs, including the pension and the insurance premium for
the unemployed and the tax shortfall thus incurred, have weighed
greatly on the government as it is struggling to reduce a widening
budget deficit to meet the budgetary and fiscal requirements for
joining the future single European currency.
</P>
<P>
The IFO institute said in a special report issued on Wednesday
that the government's aim to cut unemployment by half by 2000 was
unrealistic, as it would require an annual economic growth of 5.75
percent in the next three years, a level of expansion far out of
reach.
</P>
<P>
The economy grew at a rate of just 1.4 percent in the first
quarter of 1997, and the official forecast for the year is 2.5
percent.

</P>
<P>
Joint Secretary Alok Prasad said the treaty will be signed by
Minister of State for External Affairs Salim Shervani on behalf of

</P>
<P>

extremists' activities has been surprisingly good for quite some
time, he said.

<HEADLINE> First Day Indo-Pak Talks "Cordial and Constructive": </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Foreign Secretaries of
Pakistan and India exchanged views here today in their first day
of talks in a "cordial and constructive atmosphere", a Foreign
Office spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The two sides met from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. in a cordial and
constructive atmosphere," said spokesman Shaheed Shalim flanked by
Indian Foreign Secretary Salman Haider and his Pakistani
counterpart Shamshad Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
The two sides first "stated their respective positions on the
outstanding issues between the two countries", Shalim said.
</P>
<P>
"They also exchanged views on constructive approaches towards
resolution of their differences", he added.
</P>
<P>
Shalim said that the two sides also devoted some time to
"identify outstanding issues and evolve a mechanism to address
these issues in a purposeful manner".
</P>
<P>
"The two sides will continue their talks tomorrow," he said.
</P>
<P>
India holds a "positive attitude" towards the current round of
talks, said Indian Foreign Secretary Salman Haider, who came here
late Thursday, in a brief meeting with the press before the start
of talks, which is scheduled to conclude Monday.
</P>
<P>
India has a "constructive approach" towards the current round
of dialogue as it did in the past, said Haidere, who heads a
six-member delegation.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India resumed in late March in New Delhi the
foreign secretary-level talks after a suspension of more than
three years. The two sides have made no headway in the New Delhi
talks but decided to continue their negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The decision to hold the current round of talks was made by the
prime ministers of Pakistan and India in their meeting in the
Maldives last month on the sidelines of a regional summit.

<HEADLINE> EU's Peace Envoy Holds Talks in Beirut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Miguel Angel Moratinos, the
European Union's Middle East peace envoy, said here today that EU
has economic, political and cultural means to play a role in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos, who arrived in Beirut from Damascus earlier today,
held a two-hour meeting with Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz and is due to meet Lebanese President Elias Hrawi this
evening.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, the envoy told reporters that he will
present a report to a conference of 15 European foreign ministers
in Istanbul next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the report will contain proposals on advancing the
peace process in light of the outcomes of his consultations with
the region's leaders.

"The EU has economic, political and cultural means which
enable it to play a role in the region," Moratinos added.
</P>

<P>
HONG KONG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Media people from around the
world to cover Hong Kong's return to China have a packed schedule
arranged for them for the historic occasion.
</P>
<P>
Government and non-government organizations in Hong Kong have
invited some 8,000 reporters from all over the world to various
kinds of activities, including briefings, meetings, seminars and
tours. The scheduled program will last from June 17 to July 5.
</P>
<P>
S.Y. Tam, an assistant director of the Information Services
Department cited the upcoming event as a good opportunity of
promoting the image of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The tours and seminars will help those who do not know much
about Hong Kong to increase their understanding of Hong Kong in a
systematic way, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Better Hong Kong Foundation, a local organization to
promote the exchanges between Hong Kong and overseas, has invited
executive council members of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region and financial experts of the Stock Exchanges of Hong Kong
to address four seminars. More seminars are expected to be held in
future.
</P>
<P>
Fong Wong Kut-man, executive chairman of the foundation, said,
"The seminars will provide an opportunity for those reporters who
want to interview ranking officials in Hong Kong, since it is
difficult to arrange separate interviews for each of them at the
moment."
</P>
<P>
As of this week, the foundation will invite three noted public
figures daily to discussions on issues of top concern. So far,
Tsang Yok-Chung, chairman of the Democratic Alliance for the
Betterment of Hong Kong, and Rita Fan, president of the
Provisional Legislative Council, have joined such discussions.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said here
this afternoon during a meeting with Najib Tun Razak, Malaysian
minister of education, that the cooperation between China and
Malaysia in the field of education is of great importance to both
sides.
</P>
<P>
Describing Razak as an "old friend" of the Chinese people,
Li noted that diplomatic relations have existed between China and
Malaysia since the days when Razak's father was the Malaysian
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Razak has visited China several times, Li said, and the fact
that Razak's wife and children accompanied him on this trip
demonstrates his family's dedication to bilateral friendship.
</P>
<P>
Li said he is pleased with the signing of the memorandum of
understanding of exchanges and cooperation in education between
China and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Education is an important field, directly connected with the
improvement of the overall quality of a nation as well as its
science and technology, Li added.
</P>
<P>
China and Malaysia are friendly countries and bilateral
relations have developed smoothly, Li said, adding that the two
sides understand and support each other in the international
arena and have a wide range of common views.
</P>
<P>
There is a broad prospect for cooperation between the two
countries, Li noted, saying that China admires the continuous
economic development of Malaysia under the leadership of its prime
minister Mahathir Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
Razak conveyed Mahathir's regards to Li, and said that Mahathir
expects Li's official visit to Malaysia later this summer or early
this Autumn, will further promote bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Malaysian government, Razak offered
congratulations for Hong Kong's upcoming return to its motherland.
</P>
<P>
Razak noted that Hong Kong's return is not only a great event
worthy of national pride, but also deserves the congratulations of
people of all countries in southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Razak is convinced that Hong Kong will make even more progress
after its return, and Li thanked him for the support.
</P>
<P>
Li said he is looking forward to exchanging views with Mahathir
on the improvement of bilateral ties and other issues of common
concern.
</P>
<P>
This morning, Zhu Kaixuan, minister in charge of the State
Education Commission, and Razak signed the memorandum of
understanding of exchanges and cooperation in education between
China and Malaysia and cut the ribbon for the new Malay Language
Teaching Center at Beijing Foreign Studies University.
</P>
<P>

<P>
TOKYO, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihito
Ikeda said today that Hong Kong will continue to play its
important role as an economic and financial hub of Asia after its
return to the motherland on July 1.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's return is of historic significance, Ikeda said in a
written statement released to Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He said he sincerely congratulates China on the return of Hong
Kong and the idea of "one country two systems" is unique and
practical.
</P>
<P>
Under the principle of "one country two systems," he said, Hong
Kong will continue to play its important role as Asia's economic
and financial hub.
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong's stability and prosperity will be important
not only to China, but also to the prosperity and development of
the Asia-Pacific region including Japan.
</P>
<P>
He said Japan, which has close economic links with Hong Kong,
cares much about Hong Kong's future.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong was placed under British colonial rule after the
Opium War in the early 1840s. China will resume the exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Japanese Dietmen's Delegation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin met
here this afternoon with a Japanese delegation of members of the
Diet from the New Frontier Party (NFP) of Japan, saying that
present-day Sino-Japanese relations have not come easily and
future generations have the responsibility of carrying forward the
Sino-Japanese friendship.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he hopes that young Japanese members of the Diet,
the Japanese congress, can learn more about China and make more
contributions to the development of the friendship.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Jiang welcomed the delegation led by
Takeshi Noda, head of the NFP's Policy-Making Division.
</P>
<P>
He noted that elder statesmen of the two countries had worked
hard to boost bilateral relations and made outstanding
contributions to this end.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that this year is the 25th anniversary of the
normalization of Sino-Japanese diplomatic ties and next year will
be the 20th anniversary of the signing of the bilateral treaty of
peace and friendship.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that statesmen from both China and Japan will
see the future with a long-term strategic view, and bring a
healthy and stable Sino-Japanese relationship into the next
century while adhering to the bilateral joint statement and the
treaty of peace and friendship.
</P>
<P>
To correctly understand and treat the unfortunate past
relations between the two countries is very important for the
realization of the friendship from generation to generation
between the two peoples, Jiang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the Japanese militarists' invasion of
China caused both the Chinese and Japanese peoples to suffer
deeply, adding that an historical lesson should be learned from
this.
</P>
<P>
Quoting the sayings that "past experience, if not forgotten, is
a guide for the future" and "the overturned cart ahead is a
warning to the carts behind," Jiang emphasized that it is
necessary for both sides to strengthen their education of the
younger generation and enable them to correctly understand that
period in history.
</P>
<P>
"Only in this way, can both sides look forward and really make
the friendship to develop from generation to generation between
the two peoples," Jiang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also briefed the visitors on China's domestic situation.
</P>
<P>
Noda, who is also a representative of Japan, said he will
always remember Jiang's words and will make his own contribution
to the development of bilateral relations and the peace in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Noda also expressed his congratulations for China's coming
resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
President of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship
with Foreign Countries Qi Huaiyuan and Vice-Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan were present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, which includes 10 representatives and four
councillors, is here at the invitation of the China-Japan
Friendship Association.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Approves Issuance of Yankee Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Central Bank
announced today it has finally approved the offering of 500
million U.S. dollars worth of dollar-dominated bonds in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson said the inaugural Yankee
bonds will be issued in tranches of 400 million dollars with a
30-year tenor and 100 million dollars with a 100-year tenor.
</P>
<P>
Singson said these bonds are priced, respectively, at 185 basis
points spread for the 30-year tranche and at 197.5 basis points
spread for the 100-year tranche over the bellwether 30-year U.S.
Treasury.
</P>
<P>
The bank had planned to launch the Yankee bonds in April this
year to set a benchmark for future issues from the Philippines.
But the flotation was postponed due to unfavorable market
conditions including a higher interest rate of the 30-year U.S.
Treasury.
</P>
<P>
Singson expected the flotation of the bonds will open the door
to the huge long-dated fixed income investors in the United States
market.
</P>
<P>
The Standards and Poor's Corp., an international credit rating
agency based in the United States, has rated the Philippines at
BB+.
</P>
<P>
Salomon Brothers, a U.S. investment agency, was tapped as the
lead manager for the Yankee bond offering after it won the bidding
in June last year.

<HEADLINE> Civil Servants to Keep to their Posts for Hong Kong's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's civil servants will
stand fast at their posts as their contribution to the region's
return to its motherland, leaders of civil servants' organizations
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Hui Kwok Hung, president of the Senior Non-Expatriate Officers'
Association, said Hong Kong's return on July 1 makes people both
excited and proud.
</P>
<P>
With Hong Kong's return to the motherland, local residents will
become masters of their own destiny and be able to make
contributions to their motherland, he said.
</P>
<P>
During this critical period, he said, civil servants should
stand fast at their respective posts and provide services to the
society. "This is both our responsibility and our pride," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wong Hyo, president of the Hong Kong Chinese Civil Servants'
Association, said that, as of July 1, all civil servants should be
united and dedicated to working for the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region. He felt relieved that civil servants will
from then on be out of the dilemma caused by Hong Kong Governor
Chris Patten's uncooperative attitude in recent years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cheung Kwok Biu, president of the Hong Kong Civil Servants'
General Union, said that every public servant is proud of Hong
Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
The civil servants, as a major pillar of the society, should be
dedicated to their duties to ensure the smooth operation of
government and stability in Hong Kong, he said.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Chung Wai, president of the Government Employees'
Association, said it is inconvenient for civil servants, due to
their special status, to hold frequent or large-scale celebration
activities.
</P>
<P>
But major organizations of Hong Kong's civil service have
jointly planned to hold gala celebrations to express their joy
over Hong Kong's return to China, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said his association has already co-sponsored various
activities to mark Hong Kong's return.

<P>
HONG KONG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong remains to be the most
politically and economically stable place in the world, according
to Fung Chi Kin of Bank of China Group Securities Ltd(BCGS).
</P>
<P>
Fung, vice chairman and chief executive officer of BCGS, told a
seminar yesterday that, with a perfect financial structure and a
stable currency, Hong Kong will continue to attract capital from
the rest of China and from overseas after its return to the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
"With steady economic growth in China, it is expected that an
increasing number of Hong Kong-registered Chinese enterprises and
enterprises from the rest of China will raise funds in Hong Kong,
making the city a major source of international capital for
China."
</P>
<P>
Another good sign is that the P/E (prices/ earnings) ratio of
the stock market in Hong Kong stands today at 16.3 times, showing
that the Hong Kong stock market has attraction for investors, Fung
said.
</P>
<P>
Ken Chan, a senior economist with Nikko Securities (Asia),
pointed out at the seminar sponsored by Hong Kong China
Enterprises Association that over the past few months prior to
Hong Kong's return to China, Hong Kong's economic environment has
become better than ever.
</P>
<P>
This is attributable to economic-cycle and "return-to-China"
factors, he said.
</P>
<P>
After the economic adjustment of 1995 and 1996 when Hong Kong's
GDP growth dropped to 4.8 and 4.7 percent, the growth rate picked
up to six percent in the first quarter of this year and is
anticipated to reach 5.6 percent or so for the whole year, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The impact of Hong Kong's return to China on the region's
economic performance is multiple, the senior economist said.
</P>
<P>
First, implementation of the "one country, two systems" policy
and closer economic links between Hong Kong and the rest of China
after the handover will enhance Hong Kong's competitive edge on
the international market.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, political and economic developments since last year
including the formation of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region government, and various arrangements ensuring a smooth
transition have substantially enhanced the confidence of overseas
investors in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, the return to Hong Kong of many Hong Kongers who left
the place in the past few years, the influx of capital from
China's interior areas, and the impressive performance of red-chip
stocks are also contributing to Hong Kong's economic growth, he
noted.

<P>
The successful issue reflected international investors'
confidence in China's political stability and economic development
as well as in the future prosperity of Hong Kong after its return
to the motherland on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The five-year Deutsche Mark Eurobonds with a face yield of five
percent a year had been greatly over-subscribed and sold out
immediately after its launching in Frankfurt Thursday evening,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
It was another successful issue of Chinese bonds in
international capital markets after the issue of the U.S. Dollar
Global Bonds in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Among the investors, 32 percent were from Germany, 21 percent
from Britain, 10 percent from Italy and 9 percent from
Switzerland, the officials said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Philippine Stock Market to Experience </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine stock market is
expected to experience a longer period of consolidation after it
failed today to expand the grounds it gained Thursday, with its
30-share composite index (Phisix) dipping 24.24 points or 0.83
percent to close at 2,881.73.
</P>
<P>
The Phisix, the main index for the Philippine Stock Exchange,
had been on the rise since Tuesday. It jumped 82.62 points or 2.93
percent at 2,905.97 Thursday, thanks to a big rise of 75.52 points
or 5.31 percent in the recovering property sector.
</P>
<P>
But the market failed to continue the uptrend to approach
another resistance level of 2,950 points as expected by some
optimistic traders, who predicted the rally of the property sector
would sustain the uptrend.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the market today dropped slightly after the mining
sector plummeted by 104.56 points. But fortunately, the rallying
property sector declined only 19.98 points.
</P>
<P>
Many market analysts believed that the local bourse remains in
the consolidation period which began in late last month after the
market reversed its more than one-month downtrend and started to
rebound.
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by the strong showing of the country's economy in 1996,
the Phisix soared to an all-time high of 3,447.60 points on
February 3.
</P>
<P>
But it began to slump in late April on fears that the economy
was on a serious downturn and would soon follow the fate of
Thailand, where a property crash, a battered currency and a
general economic slowdown led to a serious financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Such fears prompted investors, mostly foreigners, to flee the
market, hitting hard the property and banking issues. In early
May, the Phisix nose-dived to a 17 month low of below 2,500 points
before beginning a slow recovery in the last week of that month.
</P>
<P>
The Phisix further recovered and surpassed the level of 2,800
points on June 2 after the government announced strong economic
growth for the first quarter of this year and other sound
macro-economic fundamentals for the period.
</P>
<P>
Now, most analysts foresee further consolidation in the local
securities market, due to several concerns -- possible new rises
in interest rates in the United States, fears of poor
second-quarter corporate performance and the impact of the
depreciation of Thai baht.
</P>
<P>
"I am not too bullish over the market's near-term prospects
because developments abroad could trigger another round of
selloffs," said Alex Dauz, dealer at DBP-Daiwa Securities.
</P>
<P>
He said the devaluation of Thai baht and the resignation of
Thailand's finance minister could revive fading fears the
Philippines might do a Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"If I were a foreign fund manager, I would reduce my risk and
limit my exposure in the Asian markets," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said second-quarter corporate earnings may remain flat
and with the absence of significant news to spark buying, a
further consolidation between the 2,800 and 2,900 levels was
highly possible.
</P>
<P>
Cristina Conde, trader at UOB Securities (Phils.), said today's
slight drop was expected since investors might soon take profits.
</P>
<P>
Although the market sentiment has considerably improved now,
several concerns would continue to weigh down the market, she
predicted.
</P>
<P>
"Another FOMC (the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee) meeting
plus expectations of weak second quarter earnings would both be
dampeners for the near term," Conde said.
</P>
<P>
But some other analysts were more optimistic about the
short-term prospects of the market.
</P>
<P>
They said that with the recent performance of the local
property counter, the property glut fears have been allayed
considerably and the entire market could return to the course of
rise due to renewed confidence in the property sector.
</P>
<P>
"We all know it was the property sector that depressed the
market and after their rise Thursday, people may have realized
that their worries may be all over," said Teresa Lee, vice
president at Asianmerit Securities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the analysts said the announcement Thursday of the
resignations of Thailand's finance and economic ministers, which
sent the Thai bourse to an 12-year low that day, may actually
benefit the markets in neighboring countries from a long-term
point of view.
</P>
<P>
They said foreign investors may finally shift their investment
portfolios to neighboring markets like the Philippines, whose
fundamentals are more healthy than those of the Thai market.
</P>
<P>
There might be some profit-taking as investors may be tempted
to adopt a sell-on-news strategy, but after the temporary
profit-taking the market will be on a sustainable rise, they said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Among World's 50 Poorest Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has consistently moved from
an average income country to one of the world's 50 poorest
countries as its per capita income declined steadily from a peak
of about 1,000 U.S. dollars in 1980 to 260 dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The degradation, according to Chief Ernest Shonekan, ex-head
of state and chairman of Vision 2010 Committee in charge of
long-term socio-economic planning, can be attributed to the
susceptibility of the national economy to external sector shocks.
</P>
<P>
Over-dependence of oil, which once brought an economic boom in
the country during late 1970s and early 1980s, has resulted in a
fragile economic structure vulnerable to price changes in the
world market.
</P>
<P>
As Shonekan pointed out, the continuous price decline at the
world oil market has placed the country in a situation in which
total export earnings are just a fraction of what it was in the
early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
As the world's sixth largest oil producers, noted Nigerian
officials#,oil income accounts for more than two-thirds of the
country's foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
Describing Nigeria as a weak and insignificant player in the
global economy, Shonekan highlighted faulty domestic policies,
including inefficient public sector investment programs and
infrastructural bottlenecks as major factors for the dismal state
of the economy.
</P>
<P>
However, the situation only means a unique chance of turning
the national economy from one of a "faded or sleeping giant" to
one that will once more become an important contributor to global
prosperity, he told local industrialists on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At the 31th meeting and conference of the Nigerian Association
of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture,
Shonekan pinned the national growth on sound education meant to
produce first-rate scientists and engineers.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the government to implement the ideas
packaged by his Vision 2010 Committee, which envisages an
improved standard of living by the year 2010 with the nation's
per capita income rising to between 900 to 1,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The committee, initiated by Nigeria's head of state General
Sani Abacha last September, is expected to submit its final
report on the country's long-term development programs to the
government later this year.

<HEADLINE> Indo-Pak Foreign Secretary-Level Talks Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and India began a new
round of foreign secretary-level talks here today, informed
sources said.
</P>
<P>
India holds a "positive attitude" towards this round of talks,
said Indian Foreign Secretary Salman Haider, who came here late
Thursday, in a brief meeting with the press before the start of
the talks.
</P>
<P>
India has a "constructive approach" towards the current round
of dialogue as it did in the past, said Haider, who heads a
six-member Indian delegation, when asked whether India expects any
positive outcome from the talks scheduled to conclude Monday.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad Ahmed, Pakistan's foreign secretary who leads the
Pakistani team at the talks, said on Thursday that Pakistan will
focus on solutions to the Kashmir issue which is at the heart of
all problems facing the region.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India resumed their foreign secretary-level talks
in late March in New Delhi after a suspension of more than three
years. The two sides made no headway in the New Delhi talks but
decided to continue their negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The decision to hold the current round of talks was made by the
prime ministers of Pakistan and India in their meeting in the
Maldives last month on the sidelines of a regional summit.

<HEADLINE> More Grain, Cotton Bases in Yellow River Delta Set up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- China will build 670,000 hectares of
grain and cotton production bases in the delta of Yellow River in
the coming decade.
</P>
<P>
The development program will cover the whole of Dongying City
and Binzhou Prefecture of Shandong Province, as well as five
neighboring counties and cities, with the total population of 6.78
million, according to a local agricultural official.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, efforts will be made to improve low-yield
arable land, reclaim wasteland for farming, grow more trees, and
cultivate fresh-water and sea-water breeding, said the official.
</P>
<P>
The official hoped that they would be able to produce 2.5
billion kg of grain, 75 million kg of cotton, 100,000 tons of
meat, eggs and milk, 600,000 tons of aquatic products, and a
certain amount of timber through such development projects.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, more water control facilities will be
constructed in these areas, including the construction of a group
of large and medium-sized reservoirs, to improve water conservancy
conditions in the region.
</P>
<P>
A group of major enterprises engaged in processing farm produce
will be supported, he said.
</P>
<P>
The entire program is estimated to cost 15 billion yuan. By the
year 2010 when the program is finished, the areas will have added
20 billion yuan in output value from production of major farm
produce and related processing services.
</P>
<P>
The official said that his province hopes more overseas
investors would take an interest in the area.
</P>
<P>
Yellow River Delta is the most fertile land for reserve
resources on the east Chinese coast. It mainly consists of the
northeastern part of Shandong, one of the country's major grain
producers.
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, Yellow River Delta has been listed by the state as
one of the major agricultural development areas on the vast plain
formed by Yellow River, Huaihe, and Haihe rivers, an area to pilot
comprehensive agricultural development.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Ready to Develop Economic Ties With Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz has expressed his country's willingness to develop economic
relations with Syria as a first step towards political
rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Iraqi News Agency (INA) today, Aziz
voiced his country's intention in a press statement Thursday after
his talks with Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Salam Majali.
</P>
<P>
Aziz assured Majali that the political rapprochement between
Baghdad and Damascus could in no way negatively affect Iraq's
relations with Jordan, saying that their trade ties would not
change.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Syria are ruled by rival branches of the Baath
Party. Baghdad severed its diplomatic ties with Damascus in 1980
after the eight-year Iraq-Iran War broke out, because Syria sided
with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Their relations further worsened after the Syrian troops joined
in the Gulf War in 1990 to drive Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the two countries exchanged trade delegations and
began to take measures to resume their trade links.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, a Syrian trade and industrial delegation, the
first in the past 17 years, visited Iraq and met with seven
ministers during the three-day stay. Last week, an Iraqi trade
delegation arrived Damascus on a return visit.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has signed several contracts with Syrian companies to
import food and other daily necessities under the "oil-for-food"
deal, which allows Iraq to raise cash for its purchase of
humanitarian goods.
</P>
<P>
It also declared that its customs offices on the border with
Syria will soon be reopened and it has asked for the
U.N. permission to open a crossing on the Iraq-Syria border for
transporting humanitarian goods bought by Baghdad under the
"oil-for-food" deal.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Residents' Financial Awareness Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A survey, conducted by the
People's Bank of China Shanghai Branch, shows that the growth rate
of Shanghai residents' income from savings deposits has slowed
down. Only a fifth of the depositors think that their income has
increased. The figure is smaller than several previous surveys.
</P>
<P>
Money is increasingly pouring into the security market,
according to the survey. When asked how to deal with their money
if deposit interest keeps stable, about 45 percent of the
depositors say they would choose to buy securities, while 32
percent would choose to put money into the bank.
</P>
<P>
If prices keep rising with a rapid speed, nearly 36 percent of
the depositors would choose to buy securities, and nearly 33
percent would choose to buy commodities.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the survey shows that Shanghai residents'
financial awareness has seen further improvement, as people begin
to seek safety, liquidity, and benefits at the same time.

<HEADLINE> Blair to Ask U.S. Support on Northern Ireland Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
will ask backing from U.S. President Bill Clinton to push forward
the Northern Ireland peace process, government officials said
today.
</P>
<P>
In remarks released by the local media, government officials
said Blair would discuss Northern Ireland issue with Clinton on
Saturday on the sideline of the G-7 summit in Denver, Colorado of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Ireland peace process was dealt a heavy blow early
this week after two police officers were killed in the street in
Northern Ireland by IRA gunmen. British government has decided to
broke off contacts with Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish
Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has given strong backing in the past to the peace
process and that's why Blair would ask Clinton to use his
influence to impress upon the IRA and Sinn Fein to back to peace
talks instead of violence, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
They said that despite the setback by the recent murder, Blair
was "determined that a way has to be found of going forward" and
put the peace process back on track.
</P>
<P>
"We are very pleased with the messages that have come through
both publicly and privately from President Clinton," the local

<HEADLINE> More Efforts Urged for Law Enforcement of Product Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 20 (Xinhua) -- An inspection group of China's
top legislature has said that product quality has significantly
improved since the relevant laws and rules were enforced, but
enforcement needs to be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Li Hao, member of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC), told a meeting here Thursday that the
product quality in Guangdong has improved over the years thanks to
enforcement of the Law on Product Quality.
</P>
<P>
From June 9 to 18, an inspection group sent by the NPC Standing
Committee to Guangdong scrutinized local enforcement of the Law on
Product Quality in 14 enterprises of the province's seven coastal
booming cities, including Guangzhou, Zhuhai, Shenzhen, Shantou,
and Chaoyang.
</P>
<P>
Despite the achievements made in law enforcement for product
quality in the past few years, Li said, more attention should be
paid to cracking down on fake products both in production and
circulation areas since fake and low quality products are still
rampant in some places.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the Provincial People's Congress, some
630,000 officials and technical personnel were sent to examine at
least 1.8 million marketplaces, shops, and factories. A total
3,375 fake product factories and workshops were shut down.

<HEADLINE> Iran Protests U.S. Congress Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Iranian students
staged a demonstration here today to protest U.S. recognition of
Jerusalem as Israel's "undivided capital."
</P>
<P>
The students chanted slogans condemning the U.S. Congress
resolution on Jerusalem and calling for the liberation of the holy
city consecrated by Christianity, Islam and Judaism.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives passed a non-binding
resolution on June 10 recognizing Jerusalem as Israel's "undivided
capital" and setting aside 100 million U.S. dollars to move
U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Today's rally was organized by the Islamic Association of
Tehran University Students and the Islamic Propagation
Organization.
</P>
<P>
The organizers said in a statement that the plot to recognize
Jerusalem as the "capital of the cancerous tumor of the region
has met the angry reaction of world Muslims."
</P>
<P>
On June 14, Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said
"the impudent move" to shift the American embassy to Jerusalem
indicated Washington's disregard for the world of Islam and Arab
states."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the United States has made the move at a time
when its influence in the Middle East is at a low ebb.
</P>
<P>
Today's Friday prayer leader Ayatollah Mohammad Emani Kashani
told a massive gathering on the campus of Tehran University that
the Middle East peace process is dead.
</P>
<P>
"The birth certificate for the peace negotiation has been
canceled," he said, adding what U.S. has done is opposed by the
whole Muslim world.

preparations on the basis of maximum retail prices from July 1
this year.
</P>
<P>
A notification to the effect was issued on Thursday and the
excise would be applied to all cosmetics and toiletries, an
official press release said.
</P>
<P>
The scheme was originally proposed during the presentation of
the 1997-98 budget by Finance Minister P. Chidambaram on February
28 this year.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, excise duty would be calculated at 50 percent
of the maximum retail prices declared on the notified cosmetics
and toilet preparations.

<HEADLINE> 3,500-year-old Site Excavated in Shaanxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- A large site dating back some 3,500
years ago has been excavated in Shangzhou city in northwest
China's Shaanxi province.
</P>
<P>
Much pottery and some stone and bone ware, including oracle
bones, have been unearthed from this site near the Danjiang River.
</P>
<P>
The pottery was mainly made of fine clay and sand-inserted
black and grey clay, in such shapes as tripod, wide-mouth cup,
jar, bowls. Designs of rope, circle, and square were popular.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists say that some of the ware look similar
to those found in a site in the neighboring Henan province which
dates back to the late Xia Dynasty (21-16th Century BC), while
some others similar to those found in another site in Henan which
dates back to the early Shang Dynasty (16-11th Century BC).
</P>
<P>
They thus determined that the newly-excavated site was from the
late Xia and the early Shang dynasties.

NAIROBI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government raised
education expenditure in the 1997-1998 financial year to 32.6
billion Shillings (603.7 million US Dollars) from 30.4 billion
Shillings in the previous year, registering a seven percent

<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Ningxia Hui (Muslim)
Autonomous Region collected 107 million yuan (about 12.8 million
US dollars) in taxes from overseas companies in the first five
months of this year, up 77 percent on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
In recent years Ningxia's revenues from overseas companies have
been growing annually nearly 23 percentage points faster than tax
revenues on the whole, a provincial tax official said.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for this, he said, is the rapid development of
overseas-funded enterprises. Official data show that the number of
overseas-funded enterprises in Ningxia, one of China's
less-developed ethnic minorities regions, in the northwest, has
grown to 419 from 22 in 1991, with overseas investors coming from
26 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, overseas-funded enterprises accounted
for nearly ten percent of Ningxia's annual tax revenues.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Economic Growth Rate Slightly Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Economic growth in Kenya slowed
slightly to 4.6 percent in 1996 from 4.8 percent in 1995 on
account of inadequate rainfall, shortage of electricity and
continued high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The government is predicting the future economic growth rates
averaging six percent, but there will be no significant
improvement against unemployment and poverty in the near future,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural and manufacturing sectors continued to be the
main drivers of the economy during the year, accounting for a
combined total of 40 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
Agriculture grew at a rate of 4.4 percent last year, a robust
performance given the unfavorable weather conditions. Output of
major cash crops -- coffee, tea, sugarcane and horticulture
increased.
</P>
<P>
Tea production jumped by 22 percent and horticultural exports
by 18 percent last year. Kenya became the world's largest tea
exporter in 1996, surpassing Sri Lanka and India.
</P>
<P>
Coffee's mounted yield was offset by 12.8-percent lower prices
from the heady levels of 1995, leading to a fall in the value of
output of six percent.
</P>
<P>
Production of maize, beans and milk fell due to weather
factors.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing grew at 3.7 percent in 1996 compared to 3.9
percent in 1995 following the sharp reduction of the beverages
and tobacco sector by 11.5 percent and the mere increase of 1.5
percent in food manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
However, non-electrical machinery, paper and paper products,
as well as clay and glass products showed very positive growth
rates -- reaching 39.2, 19,3 and 14 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure constraints in transport, communications and
power continue to impact negatively on manufacturing output by
reducing efficiency levels and increasing costs, say local
experts.
</P>
<P>
High real interest rates, which go up to 25 percent, continue
to constrain local investment, they say.
</P>
<P>
Tourism, with the total visitors arrivals up by 3.9 percent
last year, remains the second highest foreign exchange earner for
the eastern African country.

HARARE, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
will leave here tonight for New York to attend a special session
of the U.N. General Assembly to review the implementation of "agenda
21", a blueprint for sustainable and environmentally sound
development.
</P>
<P>
A statement from Zimbabwean Foreign Affairs Ministry said
that the session, from June 23 to 27, will attract about 70 world
leaders who will assess how far commitments made at the Rio De
Janeiro summit which adopted the "agenda 21", have been
implemented.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe,also in his capacity of the current Organization of
African Unity Chairman and World Solar Commission President will
attend the meeting in the company of Foreign Affairs Minister
Stan Mudenge and Environment and Tourism Minister Chen
Chimutengwende.
</P>
<P>
The world leaders at the meeting are expected to ''identify
obstacles to effective implementation of agenda 21 and recommend
measures of redress'', the statement said.
</P>
<P>
In june 1992, leaders from more than 100 nations took part in
a historic U.N. conference on environment and development in Rio
De Janeiro and adopted a comprehensive Program of Action to be
implemented by governments, development agencies and U.N.
organisations.
</P>
<P>
" Agenda 21" promises to take actions to combat poverty,
change consumption patterns, provide clean water and health care,
protect the atmosphere, forests, rivers and oceans, combat
desertification, as well as make new and additional resources
available for these tasks.
</P>
<P>
For Africa, the stateement noted, the special session is
convening at a time when " soaring levels of unemployment, the
fast deteriorating standards of living and the ever deepening
cycle of poverty, have contributed to greater degradation of the
environment."

<HEADLINE> Scientists Find Dinosaur "Smarter" Than People Imagine (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The gigantic and ostensibly stupid
dinosaur was much smarter than people have imagined, said Chinese
scientists who research how dinosaurs laid their eggs.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Zikui, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of Sciences,
points out that dinosaurs displayed a comparatively high
intelligence in protecting their breeding territory.
</P>
<P>
"A dinosaur never laid its eggs randomly, but always paid
special attention on the angles of its eggs while laying them on
the sandy soil, in case they might be crushed by external force
from inappropriate placement," said Zhao.
</P>
<P>
Zhao, a member of the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology And
Paleoanthropology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, set up a
research group three years ago with Ma Zhonghe, a professor with
the Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, and a
couple of other scientists.
</P>
<P>
The scientific achievement of the group has recently been
published on the Vertebrata Palasiatica, China's most
authoritative journal in the field.
</P>
<P>
The incubation period of dinosaur eggs, like those of most
reptiles, surpasses two months, hence, for a mother dinosaur,
protecting its eggs from being crushed by external force in that
period is of great importance to reproduction, according to Zhao.
</P>
<P>
The research on the question of how dinosaur eggs could most
effectively withstand external force helped Zhao and his group
find the regular pattern of the dinosaurs' egg-laying method.
</P>
<P>
"It's the first time for us to bring the concept of mechanics
into the research on dinosaur eggs," he noted, "and we are making
a new attempt by involving more sciences in the study of
paleontology."

<P>
The group chose five dinosaur eggs, aged between 65 million to
80 million years old, as its research objects, two of which had
been unearthed in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
and Shandong Province and the other three came from Guangdong
Province in south China.
</P>
<P>
Those five eggs are two to four times, respectively, as big as
an ordinary goose egg, and the thickness of their eggshells vary
from 0.7 millimeter to 2.6 millimeters.
</P>
<P>
"The eggshells of different thickness and shape have different
compressive strength when placed at different angles," Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
The compressive strength of a 0.8-millimeters-thick eggshell is
four times greater when it is placed vertically instead of placed
horizontally, and the compressive strength of a
1.8-millimeters-thick eggshell increase by four to five times when
placed at a certain angle than placed horizontally.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhao added, "the compressive strength of the eggshell
whose thickness is beyond 2.5 millimeters is not affected much by
the position it is placed."
</P>
<P>
"It's funny to find that the reasonable positions we designed
for dinosaur eggs according to the maximum compressive strength
basically coincides with the positions when they were unearthed,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
According to reliable sources, among over 60 kinds of dinosaur
eggs unearthed across the world, more than 50 sorts have already
been found in China, and the positions those five eggs are laid
are highly representative.
</P>
<P>
"People used to believe that dinosaur, compared with mammal,
was weaker in adapting itself to the circumstance, it's high time
to change the view," Zhao said.

<HEADLINE> IFP Leader Not to Be Offered Post of Deputy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki has quashed speculation that Inkatha
Freedom Party Leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi would be offered the
post of deputy president, local daily the Citizen reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a television interview, Mbeki initialy avoided answering a
question on whether Buthelezi, also Minister of Home Affairs,
would be offered the post. When pressed, he said " No, I don't
think it is a matter of particular titles."
</P>
<P>
While describing Buthelezi as "an important leader" of the
South African people, Mbeki said that "as African National
Congress (ANC) we might differ with him whatever, and indeed when
he addresses public meetings he's always attacking the ANC."
</P>
<P>
The ruling ANC and the IFP had cooperation when the two black
parties tried every effort to fight against apartheid. However,
due to many political differences, the latter turned to be the
biggest black oppostion party in South Africa after the first
non-racial national elections in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki said that there were some matters fundamental to South
Africa's future that were better addressed on a non-partisan
basis. "Buthelezi has a very important role in that kind of
context," he added.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the two parties continue to work together for peace
in Kwazulu Natal Province where the IFP is based.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi has been appointed acting president for at least
three times when President Nelson Mandela paid visits abroad
together with Mebeki earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> China Increases Efforts at Water Supply in Huaihe River Valley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- About 150 million people live in
the Huaihe River valley. Many use the river as their source of
drinking water. Water pollution in the area has increased over the
past few years, and more people have had drinking water problems,
especially in east China's Anhui and Jiangsu provinces.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, Jiangsu spent 19.5 million yuan (about
2.4 million US dollars) in drilling 138 wells and another 21
million yuan in a waterworks with a capacity of supplying 25,000
tons of water every day. The two projects have settled the water
problem of 350,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Anhui spent 31 million yuan last June on a water supply project
and guaranteed the drinking water demand of 700,000 people in the
three most needy months.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Ministry of Finance say that the ministry
plans to allocate 50 million yuan during the 1995-2000 period to
water supply projects in the river valley.

KUALA LUMPUR, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Foreign Minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi announced today his country would contribute
12 million U.S. dollars to the Bosnia-Herzegovina redevelopment

KUNMING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The government of southwest

in order to build Yunnan University into one of leading academies

The university will be able to take the lead domestically, and
even have certain influences internationally, in the fields of
ethnological research, and research of plateau and mountain
ecological and biological resources.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan University has a history of some 70 years, and more than
60,000 students have graduated from it.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar finished
stronger today, after drifting up in thin, quiet dealings
following some buyings by US names during the offshore overnight
session.
</P>
<P>
Today's local session proved dull with the unit languishing in
an extremely narrow range due to a disinterested end-of-week
market.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed in Sydney at 75.16 US cents, up
from 74.80 US cents at the previously session close. During the
day it marked a low of 75.03 US cents and a late high of 75.18 US
cents.
</P>
<P>
The local currency lacks firm directional cues, with no major
domestic economic data due until early July.
</P>
<P>
As well, it has become increasingly concerned about the
prospect of a narrowing of interest rate differentials between
Australia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
So, the previous couple of sessions have shown the Australian
dollar market to be unconfident about which direction it should
travel, with players contenting themselves with testing one side
of the range and then the other in search for some momentum.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the unit has see-sawed over the past few days
between 74.75 US cents and 75.15 US cents.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was at 86.16 Japanese yen from 84.81 yen,
and at 1.2974 German marks, from 1.2956 marks in Sydney at the
previously session close.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Netanyahu's Coalition in Deepened Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The crisis in the Israeli
coalition government has deepened, as two ministers are to
boycott today's cabinet meeting and the oppositions trying to
secure a vote of no confidence in the Netanyahu government.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Minister Natan Sharansky declared he would
boycott today's cabinet meeting for the second week in a row,
joined by Immigration and Absorption Minister Yuli Edelstein, both
from the Russian immigrants' Yisrael Ba'aliya Party, in protest at
the government's failure to honor its coalition agreement.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Dan Meridor of the Likud Party resigned
Wednesday after an overnight seven-hour cabinet meeting on
currency reforms, saying that he had lost confidence in Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
All these coincide with the opposition effort to bring down
the coalition government. A parliamentary vote of no confidence
has been called by the opposition parties of Labor, Meretz, Hadash
and the Democratic Arab Party and was scheduled next week.
</P>
<P>
At a Labor Party meeting Thursday, new leader Ehud Barak said
the recent political developments require the party to make
special preparations, though he does not believe next Tuesday's
no-confidence motion will lead to the fall of the government.
</P>
<P>
Barak has also decided, after consulting with Labor's 11 other
members of Knesset (parliament) including former party chairman
Shimon Peres, that his party will not join a Netanyahu government
under any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Labor faction chairman Ra'anan Cohen is initiating meetings
with members of the Yisrael Ba'aliya and centrist Third Way, both
coalition members, to try to persuade them to vote against the
government in the no-confidence vote.
</P>
<P>
The opposition must win 61 votes in the 120-seat parliament to
bring down the government. Yisrael Ba'aliya holds seven of the
coalition's 66 seats in the parliament, and the Third Way has four.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties called lawmakers back from abroad for
the vote. Coalition chairman Michael Eitan, also Likud faction
leader, has also canceled all leaves for legislators ahead of the
vote.
</P>
<P>
Meretz faction chairman Haim Oron said he will monitor the
no-confidence vote to decide whether to go ahead with a Meretz
bill calling for the dissolution of the Knesset and early
elections.
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most worrisome development for Netanyahu was the
fact that his Likud Party lawmaker David Re'em announced Thursday
he was launching a campaign called "Yes to the Likud, no to Bibi
(Netanyahu's nickname)."
</P>
<P>
Re'em said that "should the opportunity arise to bring down the
government and call early elections, I would vote against the
government, and I am sure that with a new leader the Likud would
win the elections."
</P>
<P>
However, he refused to undertake that he would indeed vote
against the government in the no-confidence vote before the
Knesset next week.
</P>
<P>
Some 20 no-confidence motions have been defeated since the
government took office last year.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Remains to Be Shipping Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's status as a cargo
shipping hub will remain unchanged after it returns to the
motherland on July 1, thanks to continuous inflow of overseas
capital to Hong Kong and the interior area.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Zhang Dachun, vice-chairman of the board of
directors of the Hongkong-based China Ocean-shipping Corporation
(COSCO).
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will continue to be an ideal and attractive port for
its unique geographical position, sound infrastructure, high
efficiency and fast delivery.
</P>
<P>
Each year, 70 percent of the freight volume of China's 300
billion US dollar-worth foreign trade to and from other countries
and regions is shipped via Hong Kong. This will reinforce Hong
Kong's central status as an international shipping center, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Though the direct shipping across the Taiwan Straits will
possibly exert an unfavorable impact on Hong Kong, it does not
affect it much because containerized shipping across the straits
only makes up seven percent of its total containerized tonnage, at
estimated one million tons this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
As China's foreign trade keeps a rising momentum, he noted,
Hong Kong will certainly have a bright and splendid future as an
international shipping center.
</P>
<P>
To date, China-funded shipping fleet accounts for a quarter of
Hong Kong's shipping fleets. COSCO owns the top-rated bulk cargo
shipping fleet and the fourth largest containerized fleet in the
world.

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Buy Houses with Borrowed Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of residents
in China's economic center of Shanghai are buying houses with
loans from banks, official figures show.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of urban residents have applied for loans
from the local branch of the China Construction Bank (CCB) in the
first five months of this year. More than 15,000 of the applicants
have been granted loans totalling 1.6 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
A bank official said that currently two types of loans --
mortgage loans and commercial loans -- are available to potential
house buyers, who often pay in instalments. The two loans were 880
million yuan and 750 million yuan between January and May.
</P>
<P>
Many banks in Shanghai, where mortgage loans for buying houses
were first offered in 1992, have ventured into the relatively new
business to meet increasing demands of the city residents.
</P>
<P>
CCB is one of China's big four state-owned banks and the
leading bank offering loans for fixed-asset investments.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Two Manchurian tiger cubs whose
mother refused to feed them have acquired a dog as their wet nurse.
</P>
<P>
The month-old cubs have obviously adjusted to the strange life
with the dog family and are looking healthier, one of the Harbin
Zoo's keepers reports, from Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
The mother tiger, named "Linda", had difficulties giving birth
to the cubs, and afterwards refused to eat for three days, and was
unable to feed them.
</P>
<P>
Dong Fengyou, an engineer in the zoo, found a female dog that
had just had puppies a month before and let her play the role of
surrogate mother. The dog was, quite understandably, hostile to
these strangers at first, Dong said. But she gradually came to
accept them as family members after zoo workers rubbed the dog's
urine on the little tigers to give them a scent similar to puppies.
</P>
<P>
Dong says the zoo will show the tigers -- and the mother dog --
to the public soon.
</P>
<P>
The Manchurian tiger is one of the rarest animals receiving
state protection in China.

<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Industrial and Commercial Bank
of China (ICBC), the country's largest bank, experienced general
growth in the first five months of this year, the bank said today.
</P>
<P>
Between January and May, bank credits were well used, deposits
increased steadily, loans were extended appropriately, and cash
withdrawal was satisfactory, the bank said in a press release.
</P>

Deposits at ICBC rose more than 140 billion yuan (about 16.8
billion US dollars), or 7.3 percent in the first five months,
raising the total to 2.05 trillion yuan by the end of last
month. It is the first time that a Chinese bank reported an
outstanding deposit volume above two trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The release said that ICBC strictly observed the country's
moderately tight monetary policy in the first five months, giving
loan priorities to the reform of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that ICBC's loans outstanding by May totaled
1.83 trillion yuan, 37.7 billion yuan more than at the beginning
of this year.
</P>
<P>
The ICBC has since this year made a great effort to optimize
the distribution of bank credits to guarantee payment needs of
various types, the release said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bank has taken serious measures to control cash
supply. It reported a net cash withdrawal of 39 billion yuan
between January and May, according to the release.

<P>
SHANGHAI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- An Indonesian Chinese, who has
been suffering from a chronic obstructive disease of the lung, is
doing well after receiving lung volume reduction surgery from
Chinese doctors.
</P>
<P>
The operation, conducted by doctors at the Shanghai No.1
Hospital of Pulmonary Diseases, has helped the 56-year-old patient
breathe freely and walk by himself.
</P>
<P>
Severe emphysema of lung and the declining of the pulmonary
functions had caused chest distress and short breathing in the
man, who was confined to bed and inhaling oxygen, before he came
to China for treatment earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
After careful examinations, doctors Ding Jia'an and Jiang
Geshou at the Chest Surgery Department of the hospital decided to
reduce the lung volume of the patient by cutting off parts of both
lungs, which is still a pioneer technique in this country.
</P>
<P>
They cut 30 percent of the right lung and 20 percent of the
left lung from the edges to the inside.
</P>
<P>
The patient was able to breathe freely and walk by himself
several weeks after the operation. The patient has since been
discharged from the hospital.

<HEADLINE> HK Better with More Diversified Economy: Noted Figure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will be better with a
more diversified economy after the July 1 handover, a noted local
figure told a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
Allen lee, chairman of the local Liberal Party and member of
the
Provisional Legislature Council, told more than 40 foreign and
local reporters that Hong Kong should implement a sound economic
policy with focus on "hi-tech industries," as the current
government fails to have an industrial policy.
</P>
<P>
After the handover, Hong Kong should "get down to real life
issues, and continue to maintain its strategic position" in the
financing, navigation, trade and communications sectors, he added.
</P>
<P>
The mainland may help a lot in this regard with its rich
resources and talents, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
"This diversified economy in Hong Kong will help solve the
employment problem and provide opportunities to the young people,"

Lee said.
</P>
<P>
He elaborated that Hong Kong should also expand its market
representation, and the government should encourage more mainland
companies to be listed on the stock exchange, he said.
</P>
<P>
Giving high comment on Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa of the HK
Special Administrative Region, Lee said, Tung "well understands
Hong Kong and understands business, and he is an honest man."
</P>
<P>
Lee disclosed that his party is preparing to "take part" in the
election of HK deputies to the Chinese National People's Congress
(NPC) this October.
</P>
<P>
NPC is China's powerful legislature, he said, "We are galled,
and it is right for Hong Kong, to participate in the law-making
process."
</P>
<P>
Touching upon the Sino-British ties after the handover, Lee
said
that the bilateral relations will become "better," because the
final
solution of the Hong Kong issue has offered a "constructive basis
" for the development of the bilateral ties.

China have drawn a growing number of readers in the region prior
to its upcoming return on July 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
Many bookstores have set up social counters for books with
themes relating to Hong Kong's return, since these books have
become increasingly popular.

for the accomplishment of China's reunification," read a poster of
the Joint Publishing (Hong Kong) Co. Ltd. in Central.
</P>
<P>
Inside the bookstore of the publishing company, books such as
the ABC of the Basic Law (of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region of the People's Republic of China), the ABC of the "One
Country, Two Systems" Policy, and Chinese Leaders on the Hong Kong
Issue, were packed on the shelves.
</P>

Readings, and the third category of books are those on Hong Kong's
future, such as Major Trends in Hong Kong, she said.
</P>
<P>
At the Causeway Bay, the Commercial Press (Hong Kong) Ltd.
sponsored a '97 Special Show for Books on Hong Kong. A bank clerk
surnamed Li, who bought from the show a copy of the New Edition of
Hong Kong History and a copy of Hong Kong in the 20th Century,
said such books have enabled him to know more about Hong Kong's
past and future development.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Bin, vice-president of the United Publishing (Hong Kong)
Ltd., said that with more books available on China's culture,
politics and economy in the region over recent years, Hong Kong
residents have acquired a better understanding of China's national
culture.

of books from the interior area last year.

<HEADLINE> China Tightens Management of Rural Credit Cooperatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Rural credit cooperatives should
be made truly cooperative organizations and be operated as such
according to the principle of cooperatives, said the People's Bank
of China, the central bank, in a circular designed to correct some
errors that have occurred during the course of reform.
</P>
<P>
The bank urged all rural credit cooperatives to standardize
their stock right mix, democratic management and orientation of
service according to the new management regulations and
demonstrative constitutions.
</P>
<P>
While attracting individual peasants, especially specialized
households, as shareholders, the rural credit cooperatives should
encourage rural collective economic entities to pool their funds as
collective shares and distribute their dividends according to the
number of shares instead of the practice of retaining interests on
stock capital.
</P>
<P>
The cooperatives should establish the systems of representative
meeting, board of directors and board of supervisors so as to
make the management more democratic.
</P>
<P>
The rural credit cooperatives should serve mainly their
shareholders, with the loans extended to shareholders exceeding
more than 50 percent of the total. They should introduce the
system of asset/liability ratio control and risk management and
establish a perfect labor and wage, accounting and distribution
systems.
</P>
<P>
The credit cooperatives should also follow strictly the
regulations on deposit-to-loans ratio and risk management to
enhance the liquidity and safety of funds and ensure to pay back
debts due.
</P>
<P>
The central bank called on departments concerned to support
rural credit cooperatives with regard to funds, taxation, interest
rates and settlement, heping them solve management problems,
prevent and control financial risks.
</P>
<P>
A special office is being planned in the central bank to better
supervise and manage the country's rural credit cooperatives,
according to the bank.

<HEADLINE> Lu Ping on Principles to Solve HK Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The issue of sovereignty has been
China' primary concern in working out principles regarding the
settlement of the question of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
All the contradictions and conflicts between China and Britain
over the past ten years and more have centered on the sovereignty
issue, said Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs
Office under the State Council, in an article in today's People's
Daily.
</P>
<P>
The article noted the reason that China and Britain finally
reached agreement on solving the Hong Kong issue and signed the
Joint Declaration is because the latter had accepted the concept
that Hong Kong's sovereignty resides in China and what it is to do
is to hand the territory over to China.
</P>
<P>
However, the article went on, the British side has attempted to
infringe upon our sovereignty by introducing many unreasonable
practices, including advocating "trading sovereignty for the right
to administration" and introducing a "constitutional package".
</P>
<P>
At present, Britain still makes indiscreet criticisms on and
tries to intervene in the issues like setting up the provisional
legislature, law, legality, and the handover of the Hong Kong
government's assets, documents and files. It even tried to make
use of other forces in the world to add pressure on China.
</P>
<P>
"China has insisted on its sovereignty over Hong Kong on all
these important issues," said the article. "Giving up the
sovereignty, there would have been no "one country, two systems"
concept, let alone the prospective takeover."
</P>
<P>
The high degree of autonomy of the HKSAR means "Hong Kong
people governing Hong Kong", the article went on. To that end, the
central government has taken many measures which created
opportunities to encourage Hong Kong people to participate in the
preparation for SAR's establishment.
</P>
<P>
In all the committees including those drafting the Basic Law,
the Preliminary Working Committee of the Preparatory Committee,
and the Preparatory Committee, the number of people from Hong Kong
has been on the rise.
</P>
<P>
The committee to select the candidates for the first HKSAR
Chief Executive and the committee in charge of celebrating the
establishment of HKSAR are all staffed by local people whose
opinions are often sought by the central government, said the
article.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the focal point to maintain Hong Kong's
prosperity and stability is to keep its current status as an
international trade and financial center.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's value lies in its economic importance. Therefore,
all the policies, either by the central government or by future
HKSAR, should and will be formulated to serve the purpose," the
article concluded.

<HEADLINE> Preparations Near Completion For Hong Kong PLA Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Preparations are basically
completed for the troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
(PLA) that will be stationed in the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, according to Major General Liu Zhenwu,
commander of the PLA Hong Kong troops.
</P>
<P>
Liu told Xinhua in a recent interview that his troops are now
checking their vehicles and weapons and are being issued new
uniforms. Vehicles used by the PLA Hong Kong troops, he explained,
are right-hand drive vehicles instead of left-hand drive as used
in the inland areas of China and are specially designed to meet
Hong Kong's traffic regulations. Although the drivers are familiar
with Hong Kong traffic signs, they are still working hard to
improve their driving skills, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The naval forces have adopted an international signal system
and the officers and enlisted men have mastered this new
"language".
</P>
<P>
The air forces have completed all their training courses and
most of them have acquired the flying skills needed for the
exceedingly difficult conditions and the 22 new crew commanders
have instrument ratings for flying in any weather.
</P>
<P>
To see to the Hong Kong PLA troops' supplies, a large farm with
a 13-hectare vegetable garden, a 10-hectare fish pond, and a
modern pig farm has been set up at the rear of the PLA base. Their
food will come from this base.
</P>
<P>
According to the Basic Law of the HKSAR, the cost of stationing
the troops in Hong Kong will be covered by the central government.
</P>
<P>
"The closer we get to the return of Hong Kong, the harder we
study military discipline and the laws," said Major General Xiong
Ziren, political commissar of the PLA Hong Kong troops.
</P>
<P>
According to Xiong, the troops have set up a legal affairs
office, the first of its kind for similar military units, staffed
with people with Ph.D. degrees, and designed to increase legal
awareness of the officers and men. More than a thousand officers
and enlisted men of the PLA Hong Kong troops have taken
correspondence courses on the law.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scholars Concerned about Media's Impact on Youngsters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The creation of China's first
research center on children's media here today might help fill the
gap of deep study of the effect of new media as more Chinese
teenagers become obsessed with electronic games, computers and the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the reasons why we have created the Research
Center of Media and Children," said Bu Wei, director of the center
at the prestigious Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS).
</P>
<P>
The wide acceptance of the new media, especially electronic
media, has formed a "culture of the young people", which is
unfamiliar to their parents, Bu said, adding that the trend has
been greatly changing Chinese family's traditional values and
challenging society.
</P>
<P>
Researchers revealed that the most popular media used by
Chinese urban children include television sets and compact
discs. And many children have chosen to surf on the Internet,
playing electronic games, and chatting with distant others.
</P>
<P>
"The new media are posing greater impact on our children. We do
not know what will happen if the trend continues," said Yu Quanyu,
director of the Mass Communications and Journalism Institute of
the CASS.
</P>
<P>
Bu said that the new media have helped form a new generation of
young people who are quite different from their parents: more
personal, modern, and international.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that Chinese media have been playing a role in
cultivating youngsters with high moral standards, however, some
media are still providing them with inappropriate adult contents,
including pornographic and violent materials.
</P>
<P>
And the number of children-oriented media is not enough when
the whole country is taken into consideration, and the development
of media is not balanced in different regions. Bu said that there
are few media designed for rural children.
</P>
<P>
"The creation of the center will benefit the country's ethical
and cultural progress," said Zhou Qiang, a member of the
Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist
Youth League.
</P>
<P>
The center is backed up by the league and some government
departments, including the Ministry of Culture.
</P>
<P>
Researchers will set up a data base at the center, study
strategies for the development of children's media, and do
research into negative and positive influences of the media on
children, Bu said.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- South African fishing industry is
set to enter a new era following the launch of government's white
paper on marine fisheries tabled in parliament yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The document advocates a system whereby fishemen are invited to bid
for and obtain real,long-term rights to catch quata species such as
Hake,Rock Lobster and Abalone.
</P>
<P>
These rights will be transferable and entailable, and attempts will
be made to extend such rights to species not managed by a quata
system, such as Squid and Linefish.
</P>
<P>
The new policy favors small to medium sized enterprises and, in
some cases, less sophisticated or more affordable fishing methods.
</P>
<P>
The new fishieries act will be enacted by the end of the year.

BRASILIA, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Brazil disappointed their fans
when they used defensive tactics to beat Colombia 2-0 in their
final Copa America group game on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Colombia enjoyed long periods of possession but had trouble
breaking down a Brazil side that retreated into their own half
every time their opponents had the ball.
</P>
<P>
Coach Mario Zagallo admitted after the game that he had imposed
a more cautious system upon his team.
</P>
<P>
Goals by Dunga and Edmundo in each half made sure that Brazil
finished top of group C with maximum points.
</P>
<P>
Mexico finished second and Colombia third, but the Colombians
still went through as the second of the third-placed teams after
finishing with more goals scored than Uruguay, which was third in
group B.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's results meant that Brazil now face a tough
quarter-final with Paraguay, led by volatile goalkeeper Jose Luis

<HEADLINE> India's Economy Witnesses Slow Down in 1996-97 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Governor of the Reserve Bank of
India (RBI) Chakravarty Rangarajan said that the country's economy
had witnessed a major slow down in industrial growth in 1996-97
which resulted in a decline in real GDP growth rate from the
expected growth rate of around 6.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the United News of India (UNI),
which released it here today, the governor said that industrial
growth, which touched a peak of 11.6 percent in 1995-96, was at 7
percent in February, 1997. The major contributory factors in the
fall were the deceleration in manufacturing sector at 8.6 percent
in February this year as against 13 percent in February last year.
</P>
<P>
Besides slackness in the growth of infrastructural projects,
the consumer goods sector declined considerably to 4.6 percent in
February, 1997 as compared to the growth of 12 percent in the
previous year. Similarly, the growth of consumer durables fell
sharply to only 5 percent in February as against 35.4 percent
growth in the same month of the previous year, he said.
</P>
<P>
All these factors were further aided by a decline in world
trade volume from 9.7 percent to 5.4 percent in 1996, which
resulted in a drop in export growth to 4 percent in US dollar
terms in 1996-97 from 21.4 percent in the previous year, he
further said.
</P>
<P>
Anticipating a bounce-back in industrial production in the
current fiscal year to the levels that were seen in 1994-95 and
1995-96, the governor said that the first couple of months of the
current year had shown an improvement in the credit offtake,
mainly by the industrial sector which was gradually responding to
the challenges in the new economic environment, he added.

<P>
NINGBO, June 20 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province is
planning a park that features the 7,000-year-old Hemudu Culture.
</P>
<P>
Hemudu Ruins were unearthed in 1973 in the province's Yuyao
City, which were found to be the most complete and earliest ruins

<HEADLINE> Coolest Summer Days Recorded in South China City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The southern Chinese city of
Guangzhou has reported temperatures that are a 50-year low in
June.
</P>
<P>
The low on Monday of 21.8 degrees c. was quite unlike the
30-some-degree centigrade temperatures that are normal for this
time of the year, according to the Guangzhou Central
Meteorological Station.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that a cold front moving in from the
Tibet-Qinghai Plateau over the past week brought excessive
rainfall to the southern part of China. They forecast torrential
rains for western Guangdong and the Pearl River Delta
area over the next two or three days.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, average temperatures in north and northeast China
were four to six degrees c. higher than usual during the first
half of the month. Some places even reported 30-year record highs.
</P>
<P>
Experts with China's Central Meteorological Station say the
major cause of the abnormal weather was a warm air front which has
remained in the areas for several days.

<HEADLINE> India Plans to Boost Electronics Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- India's electronics sector needs
an investment of 384,000 million rupees (10.8 billion US dollars)
to achieve a production target of 1,353,500 million rupees (38.1
billion dollars) by the end of the ninth five-year plan
(1998-2002).
</P>
<P>
These are the projections made by a working group set up by the
Department of Electronics on electronics industry in the country
for the next five years. The electronic industry is slated to have
a growth rate of over 37 percent during the ninth five-year plan
period, which will be 2 percent of the world's electronics
production as against the present production of 0.7 percent of the
world's electronic production.
</P>
<P>
The sectors which will require a major share of the investments
include computer systems, software components, and communication
and broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
The share of the public sector in electronic industry is going
to decline from 22 percent to 14 percent by the end of the ninth
five-year plan period.
</P>
<P>
Export target for software has been set at 350,000 rupees (9.9
billion US dollars) with a growth rate of 58 percent and domestic
software too is expected to grow at a rate of 50 percent. Export
target for electronic industry by the end of the ninth five-year
plan is 489,300 million rupees (13.8 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The working group has suggested that as electronics and
information technology is fast becoming the largest sector for
increasing productivity, electronics and information technology
industry should be classified as a basic growth "infrastructure"
industry and thereby special status should be accorded to this
sector.

<HEADLINE> Northeast China Province Encouraging People To Develop Township Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province plans to train more personnel for its booming township
enterprises to improve their competitive skills and overall
quality.
</P>
<P>
Xu Wencai, deputy governor of the province, made this
announcement recently.
</P>
<P>
He said that Liaoning wanted to encourage more college
graduates to work in township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning is one of China's key industrial bases, with about a
tenth of the country's large and medium-sized state-owned
enterprises. But local state-owned enterprises have been losing
money over the past few years, while local township enterprises
funded by farmers have been booming and getting better results.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say that the township enterprises employ five
million farmers, accounting for half of the province's rural labor.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, the Liaoning government decided that some of the local
colleges and universities could train people who work in township
enterprises and who will return to their employer after graduation.
</P>
<P>
So far, about 6,400 such employees have graduated from the
colleges, and about 700 have returned to the township enterprises
where they used to work.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the move is to have more high level technical
personnel in local township enterprises, and they will have a
promising future," Xu said.

<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, June 20 (Xinhua) - 21,000 Sierra Leone government
workers are to receive their salaries for May within the next few
days, Junta Leader Johnny Paul Koroma said Thursday at the
end of a two-day talks with Labour Congress.
</P>
<P>
Koroma appealed to the Congress to ensure that their workers
return to work "to get the industrial machine to start turning".
</P>
<P>
A campaign of civil disobedience called by the Congress has
kept many workers off their jobs since the May 25 coup.
</P>
<P>
The Congress had criticised the coup and called on the junta
to return power to the ousted civilian government.
</P>
<P>
In a 10-point communique issued by Congress and presented to
Koroma, 21 affiliated trade unions urged the military government
"to resolve the current political stalemate through a negotiated
diplomatic settlement to avert a Nigerian-led ECOMOG (a west
African Peacekeeping Force ) intervention in Sierra Leone."
</P>
<P>
The Congress said the peace accord signed in the Ivory Coast
last November "should be vigorously pursued to reached an
amicable settlement with the revolutionary United Front."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the central bank opened its doors on Wednesday,
clearing the way for the six commercial banks including Barclays
and Standard Chartered banks to reopen by the weekend.

<HEADLINE> hkhk-Establishing HKPLC: Guarantee for HK's Smooth Transition (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The absence of a legislature will make it impossible to
implement many stipulations of the Basic Law. It is, therefore,
imperative to have a provisional legislative council in order to
ensure HK's smooth transition and the normal operation of the
HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
In view of this, the Political Panel and the Legal Panel of the
Preliminary Working Committee (PWC) of the Preparatory Committee
(PC) for the HKSAR proposed to the fourth plenary meeting of the
PWC that a provisional legislative council of the HKSAR be
established. The PLC of the HKSAR, which will be in existence for
one year, will exercise legislative power prior to the
establishment of the first Legislative Council of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
After the establishment of the Preparatory Committee of the
HKSAR in January 1996, the work to form the PLC began at an
accelerated pace. A resolution on the establishment of the PLC of
the HKSAR was adopted by the second plenary meeting of the
Preparatory Committee.
</P>
<P>
According to the resolution, the main task of the PLC is to
formulate, in accordance with the Basic Law, laws indispensable to
ensuring the normal operation of the HKSAR, and to revise and
abolish laws according to needs. The tasks of the PLC also include
examining and approving government budgets; approving taxation and
public expenditures; hearing and debating on the policy address of
the chief executive and approving the appointment of chief judges
of the Court of Final Appeal and the High Court. The chairman of
PLC will participate in the nomination of the six Hong Kong
members of the HKSAR Basic Law Committee of the Standing Committee
of the National People's Congress. The PLC will also handle
matters that it must do prior to the formation of the first
legislative council of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
The election of PLC in an open, fair and just manner has won
strong support from people from all walks of life in Hong Kong.
The 60 elected members of the PLC come from business, labor and
political communities, including eleven professionals and those
who have the right of abode in foreign countries and who have made
contributions to the prosperity of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The PLC has been working to formulate the necessary laws for
the HKSAR so that at midnight of July 1, the Chief Executive will
sign these laws.
</P>
<P>
However, while making preparations for the legislation of the
HKSAR before July 1, the PLC will not interfere in the affairs of
the Legislative Council of the British Hong Kong government.
</P>
<P>
There will be no overlapping of the duty and time of the work
done by the PLC, which will officially exercise its power on July
1, and by the existing Legislative Council, which will terminate
on June 30.
</P>
<P>
The PLC has won support from more and more Hong Kong people.
Local public opinion has highly praised the central government for
its decision on the PLC.
</P>
<P>
More and more Hong Kong people pin high hopes on the PLC and
are making suggestions on its work through a variety of channels.

<HEADLINE> EDS: More to follow hkhk-Establishing HKPLC: Guarantee for HK's Smooth Transition (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hong Kong, June 20 (Xinhua) -- At the fourth plenary meeting of
the Selection Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR) Government held last December, 400 celebrities from
all walks of life in Hong Kong (HK), with expectations of the
motherland and the HK people, elected by secrete ballot 60 members
of the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC).
</P>
<P>
This represented a major step taken by the Chinese Government
to safeguard the Sino-British Joint Declaration and ensure HK's
smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the PLC is an absolutely necessary action
taken by the Chinese Government to avoid a "legislative vacuum"
and to ensure the normal operation of the HKSAR government, after
the British Hong Kong government obstinately worked out the
"Constitutional Package" in violation of the Sino-British Joint
Declaration, the Basic Law and understandings and agreements
reached between the Chinese and British governments, thus
sabotaging the "through train" arrangement.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will resume the exercise of sovereignty
over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997. Considering that cooperation
between China and Britain is conducive to the smooth transition of
HK and the transfer of power, in the course of drafting the Basic
Law, the Chinese government held consultations with the British
government.
</P>
<P>
In early 1990, the Chinese foreign minister and British foreign
secretary exchanged seven letters and reached an agreement on how
to form the first legislative council of the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
On April, 4, the same year, the Third Plenary Session of the
National People's Congress (NPC) adopted the "Decision of the NPC
on the Method for the Formation of the First HKSAR government and
the First Legislative Council of the HKSAR".
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the Decision, if the formation of the last
HK Legislative Council of the British Hong Kong government
complies with the relevant provisions of the NPC decision and the
Basic Law, and if the legislators uphold the Basic Law and are
willing to be loyal to the HKSAR and meet the requirements as
prescribed in the Basic law, these legislators may become members
of the first Legislative Council of the HKSAR, following
verification and approval by the Preparatory Committee for the
HKSAR. This is commonly known as the "through train" arrangement.
</P>
<P>
However, in October 1992, immediately after becoming the HK
Governor, Chris Patten announced a "constitutional package" which
brazenly violates the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the
principle on dovetailing the Basic Law, and understandings and
agreements reached by the Chinese and British foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
During the 17th round of talks between the Chinese and British
governments on HK's 1994/1995 election arrangements held in the
following year, despite the consistent sincerity of the Chinese
side and its maximum efforts to reach an agreement, the British
side obstinately went its own way and forced through the
"constitutional package" and unilaterally declared the suspension
of the talks.
</P>
<P>
On such an issue of principle, the Standing Committee of the
Eighth NPC adopted in August 1994 a resolution on the termination
of the last legislative council of the British Hong Kong
government on June 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
As the "through train" arrangement could not be implemented, it
is impossible for the first legislature of the HKSAR to be formed
on July 1, 1997, in accordance with the NPC Decision.
</P>
<P>
But the legislative council constitutes an important component
of the political system of the HKSAR and the relevant stipulations
of the Basic Law are based on the fact that there will be a
legislature on July 1, 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's total trade
increased by 3.3 percent in May on a three-month moving average
basis at current prices, with non-oil domestic exports growing
marginally by 0.8 percent after nine consecutive months of
decline, the Singapore Trade Development Board (TDB) said today.
</P>
<P>
However, on a monthly basis, non-oil domestic exports fell by
one percent, after a 5.9 percent expansion in April, the TDB said,
noting that the decline in May was less severe than the 4.1
percent contraction in the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, April and May data taken together showed that non-oil
domestic exports increased by 2.4 percent as compared to the
corresponding two months of last year", it said.
</P>
<P>
Re-exports grew by 9.4 percent in May on a monthly basis,
reflecting strong growth in electronics products, in particular
re-exports of integrated circuits to the European Union (EU),
Japan and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Imports grew by 3.6 percent to 16.3 billion Singapore dollars
(about 11.4 billion US dollars) in May. The TDB said that the
increases were reflected in imports of integrated circuits,
computer parts and peripherals, parts of color television sets and
radios, and other electronics products.
</P>
<P>
With a 0.8 percent increase, non-oil domestic exports reached a
level of 7.4 billion Singapore dollars (about 5.17 billion US
dollars) in May. Non-oil domestic exports to the EU remained
strong at 8.4 percent in the month, while that to Malaysia and
Hong Kong also recorded positive growth rates of 10.5 percent and
four percent respectively. However, non-oil domestic exports to
the United States declined by 2.6 percent, though it was more
moderate as compared to the 5.4 percent fall in April.
</P>
<P>
Oil domestic exports fell by 5.9 percent in May, less severe

<HEADLINE> Australia's Wool Market Indicator Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Wool prices were expected to
continue to climb after soaring this week to an almost two-year
high, analysts said today.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Council of Wool Exporters (ACWE) said the
eastern market indicator closed 27 Australian cents up for the
week at 753 Australian cents (563 US cents) per kg clean.
</P>
<P>
ACWE said prices increased on average by further four percent
at sales in Sydney, Adelaide and Fremantle, with a limited
offering of 71,796 bales.
</P>
<P>
The council said the continuing devaluation of the Australian
dollar against major overseas currencies had helped cushion the
effect of higher auction prices for overseas buyers.
</P>
<P>
The Wool Council of Australia said the positive signals were
expected to continue.
</P>
<P>
The council said the price rise followed limited offerings and
renewed interest from China, Australia's largest buyer, along with
the main factor of the devaluation of the dollar.
</P>
<P>
It said in the short term the wool market would continue to be
supply-driven, with processors mindful that quality fresh wool may
be in short supply due to predictions of dry weather caused by a
continuing El Nino effect.
</P>
<P>
"Added to this is the rapidly reducing stockpile, which this
week dropped below 1.6 million bales," it said.
</P>
<P>
Sales resume next week in Sydney and Melbourne, with 72,000
bales rostered for sale.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African Development
Community (SADC) is expected to suffer a maize shortage because of
unfavorable weather ranging from excessive rains to serious drought in
some areas of the region.
</P>
<P>
The regional deficit in maize amounts to 1,289,000 tons but South
Africa and Zimbabwe are the only two countries that are expected to
have surpluses of 587,000 tons and 406,000 tons respectively,
according to the latest issue of the SADC food security bulletin.
</P>
<P>
The bulletin indicated that Tanzania has the highest shortfall of
about 750,000 tons followed by Malawi and Angola with 506,000 tons
and 410,000 tons respectively. Zambia and Lesotho have deficit
projections of around 220,000 tons each. Botswana's shortfall is
134,000 tons, Namibia 39,000 tons and Swaziland 4,000 tons.
Mozambique is expected to have only enough stocks to barely cover
the national requirements.
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent of the regional maize deficit will have to be
sourced from outside the region while only 30 percent is expected to
be met through cross border substitution with other cereals,
according to the bulletin.
</P>
<P>
The SADC food security bulletin said that the total regional
cereal deficit during this year is expected to be about 2,820,000
tons.

ratio of contribution of the application of science and technology
to economic growth from the current 30 percent to 60 when the
technical upgrading is finished.
</P>
<P>
According to Du, the conglomerate will import advanced
technologies and equipment from a dozen countries and regions for
its eight projects, involving 27 kinds of products, during the
Ninth Five-Year-Plan period (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
The company group, based in Shandong Province on the east
coast, is considered as China's biggest production and export base
of oceanic chemical products.
</P>
<P>
It will gain an annual production capacity of 1.4 million tons
of caustic soda, 2.2 million tons of raw salt, and will score up
10 billion yuan in assets and in annual sales, respectively, and
earn 200 million U.S. dollars from exports by the year 2000,
according to a new goal drafted by the company group recently.
</P>
<P>
The conglomerate now produces more than 40 kinds of products
and is placed higher up among enterprises engaged in the same
industry for production scale and market penetration of caustic
soda, raw salt, and bromide. It now produces 800,000 tons of soda
ash, ranking first for production of synthetic soda in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, the company group has expanded its
business overseas and opened representative offices or started
firms in France, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and southeast Asian
countries and regions.

<HEADLINE> Improving Pollution Controls on China's Huaihe River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Nineteen major polluters along the
Huaihe River in Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu and Shandong provinces have
made some progress in controlling pollution and are likely to meet
state discharge standards by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The nineteen factories spew out more than 130,000 tons of waste
water every day and account for nearly 20 percent of the
pollutants in the river valley.
</P>
<P>
The Zhoukou Gourmet Powder Plant in Henan has spent more than
80 million yuan (nearly 10 million US dollars) on three waste
water treatment plants in the past several years. Other pollution
sources in the provinces have also increased spending on pollution
controls.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the State Bureau of Environmental Protection say
that the factories' pollution control efforts have played a role
in improving the Huaihe River so far this year, and they have set
a good example for other polluters in the river valley.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Hong Kong's Return to China Benefits World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Hong's return to China will
be an event of great significance for world peace and prosperity,
says the head of the Sri Lanka and China Youth Friendship
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
Indrananda Abeysekera, general secretary of the foundation,
told Xinhua in a recent interview that Hong Kong's return to China
is a joyful event and it is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has been part of China since ancient times and
legally speaking it was never a "British Colony," Abeysekera
pointed out. The Chinese people would never accept these unequal
treaties foisted on the Qing Dynasty by the British, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the
Chinese government has made its position on Hong Kong quite clear
-- Hong Kong is a part of China and the treaties are null and
void, he said.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong to China is an "achievement which has
been internationally acclaimed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Everything has been prepared for Hong Kong to function
according to the principle of "one country, two systems," he
said.
</P>
<P>
As a key shipping center and an international banking and
financial hub, Hong Kong is considered a window to China. It also
serves as a bridge between the world and China's inland areas.
</P>
<P>
It can be expected that development in Hong Kong's various
fields will be further expanded as time goes on, he concluded.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Probe Israeli Allegation against Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States is to question
Israeli deputy Education Minister Moshe Peled to investigate his
allegation that Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was linked to
the 1993 bombing of New York's World Trade Center, a report said
today.
</P>
<P>
The English daily The Jerusalem Post quoted Israeli sources as
saying that the U.S. request for an urgent meeting with Peled had
gained approval from Israeli Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Jerusalem Post in March, Peled
charged that Arafat was privy to the attempt to blow up New York's
World Trade Center, in which six people were killed.
</P>
<P>
He said Israeli intelligence had evidence that Arafat arrived
in the Sudanese capital Khartoum several days before the New York
bombing and attended the discussions of the plot held by Sudanese
leaders and Islamic terrorist operatives.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. Justice Department announced later that it was unaware
of Arafat's involvement in the bombing, adding that Israeli
authorities had also denied the accuracy of Peled's remarks.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Peled's assertion sparked calls in the
U.S. Congress for an investigation into Arafat's role in the
bombing. On April 1, former chairman of the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence, sent a letter to Attorney-General
Janet Reno asking for an investigation.
</P>
<P>
Under the pressure from the Congress, Reno finally decided to
investigate Peled's claim about Arafat's link to the bombing, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli sources believed that the U.S. Congress intended to
use this information as the smoking gun to stop all U.S. aid to
the Palestinian Authority (PA) led by Arafat.
</P>
<P>
A source in the Prime Minister's Office was quoted as saying
that Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu was not involved in the
contacts between Israel and the U.S. regarding Peled's allegation.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to prevent the incident from causing further
deterioration in the already tense Israeli-Palestinian relations,
the source stressed that the U.S. investigation should not be
construed as an attempt by the Netanyahu government to damage
Arafat or try to stop the U.S, aid to the PA.

<HEADLINE> Luxembourg's PM Confident of Hong Kong's Smooth Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Luxembourg's Prime Minister
Jean-Claude Juncker is confident of a smooth transfer of power
over Hong Kong on July 1 between Britain and China.
</P>
<P>
In a interview with Xinhua today, Juncker said he believed
that "everything will be done very smoothly without any
difficulties".
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong's return to its motherland after more than
150 years of British rule was a "natural historical event", which
he said "was settled not by force but through negotiation".
</P>
<P>
Juncker hailed China's "one country, two systems" principle as
not only of great significance to China, but also a contribution
to solving regional problems of a similar nature.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also briefed Xinhua on the European Union's
Amsterdam Summit on June 16-17, saying "great progress" had been
made at the meeting, mainly in formulating common policies for
foreign relations and security and in jointly fighting
international crime and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Juncker said the main task for Luxemburg after it takes over
the EU's rotating presidency on July 1 from the Netherlands will
be to pave the way for the 15-nation bloc to move toward eastward
enlargement.
</P>
<P>
He said the EU's next summit in December in Luxembourg was
expected to make a decision on the mechanism of the Union's
expansion.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the European Economic Monetary Union (EMU) could be
started as planned on January 1, 1999, he said he was confident
that the single currency, the euro, could be put into circulation
on time.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Japanese leaders on Japan's Deregulation Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DENVER, June 19 (xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said
today that the agreement reached between the United States and
Japan on Japan's deregulation would help improve relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
But Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said that
although advice from the U.S. was helpful, deregulation as a task
the country had to undertake itself and had no intention of being
supervised.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders were speaking at a press conference to announce
a new initiative on deregulation of the Japanese economy,
aiming to increase market access for foreign producers of goods
and services and benefiting consumers in Japan with greater choice
and lower costs.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton said the agreement, which would involve the
United States in the deregulation process with Japan, would
evaluate Japan's deregulation initiative in several areas "in
terms of how it might affect our bilateral relations."
</P>
<P>
"So we're moving in the right direction and I'm hopeful we can
make some progress," he said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. government officials said that the agreement would
eventually lead to the opening of Japanese markets to U.S. exports
like telecommunications. The United States has a large trade
deficit with Japan.

<HEADLINE> China's Human Rights Group Visits Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Italy's Vice President of the Chamber
of Deputies (lower house) Clemente Mastella and a visiting Chinese
human rights delegation discussed issues of human rights, ethnic
minorities and relations between central and local authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation, headed by Zhu Muzhi, president of the
Human Rights Society of China, arrived here Thursday on its third
leg of a European tour to Norway, Sweden, Italy and Spain.
</P>
<P>
It is the first visit by a delegation from the Chinese Human
Rights Society to West European countries.
</P>
<P>
Mastella gave a warm welcome to the delegation. He said the
visit showed the Chinese government's resolution on seeking a way
out of the question of human rights, instead of evading it.
</P>
<P>
Mastella said China and Italy shared common views about many
major international issues.
</P>
<P>
As for the differences, Mastella said, the only way to resolve
them was through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
Zhu agreed, saying differences in the concepts of human rights
and other values were only natural and normal since situations in
different countries varied.
</P>
<P>
He said his visit was aimed at enhancing understanding and
narrowing misunderstanding between the European countries and
China over the issue so as to give Europe, as well as the rest of
the world, a correct understanding of China.
</P>
<P>
Zhu expressed thanks for Italy's support for China at the 53rd
session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, in
Geneva in March.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also met today with members of the parliament committee of
foreign affairs.

<HEADLINE> Italy Backs Slovenia's Bid for NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Italy fully backs Slovenia's bid to
become one in the first batch of countries to be invited to join
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) this summer, Italian
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said today.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry communique stressed Italy's "full support
and enduring commitment that the coming NATO summit in Madrid
should include Slovenia among the countries to be invited to
join." The statement was released after Dini's talks with his
visiting Slovenian counterpart, Zoran Thaler.
</P>
<P>
The United States insist that the first wave of former East
Bloc countries to join NATO should be no more than three,
probably Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
But Italy and France want Slovenia and Romania also to be in at
the start.
</P>
<P>
The communique said Slovenia met all the requirements from a
political, military and strategic standpoint for becoming a member
of the alliance "from today".
</P>
<P>
It said Dini also expressed satisfaction with the Slovenian
government's pledge to ratify an accord with the European Union
soon to open the property market to Italians.
</P>
<P>
Dini also met Yugoslavian Foreign Minister Milan Milutinovic
today, and called for a full compliance with the Dayton peace
accord in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Dini urged "a rapid application of the freedom of movement for
persons and things throughout Bosnian territory, the re-entry of
refugees and, in general, the liberalization of the political and
economic system."

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pak, India Start New Round of Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 20 (Xinhua) -- After nearly three months,
Pakistan and India start their new round of foreign
secretary-level talks here today in a bid to improve bilateral
relations and evolve mechanism for future dialogue.
</P>
<P>
A positive tone for the talks has been set by the prime
ministers of the two South Asian nations as they energized the
long-dead telephone hotline between them.
</P>
<P>
As a good-will gesture on the eve of the new round of talks
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his Indian counterpart
Inder Kumar Gujral held their first conversation on the telephone
hotline.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from Pakistan's Foreign Ministry Gujral
wished success for the talks. He also expressed his resolve to
continue efforts for the promotion of Indo-Pak good-neighborly
relations.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, however, reiterated Pakistan's commitment to working
for the resolution of all outstanding issues between the two
countries including the core issue of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The decision to hold the new round of foreign secretary-level
talks was taken last month by Sharif and Gujral at their meeting
in Male during the Summit of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC).
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India held their previous round of foreign
secretary-level talks in New Delhi in March this year after more
than three years of suspension due to an increased tension between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
As agreed upon by the two prime ministers during the Male
Summit last month, Indian Foreign Secretary Salman Haider and his
Pakistani counterpart Shamshad Ahmed this time will discuss the
possibility of forming working groups on all outstanding issues,
including the Kashmir issue.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said that during the talks the Pakistani side
is to raise the issue of the reported deployment of medium-range
ballistic Prithvi missiles by India near its border with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The issue has been a major focus of attention on the local
media for the last few weeks. Pakistan has taken strong exception
to the reported deployment, warning that it could spark a new
round of arms race in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
However, India has denied the deployment of the missiles, only
confirming its stocks near the Indo-Pak border.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the new round of foreign secretary-level talks,
Shamshad Ahmed, who will lead the Pakistani delegation to the
four-day talks, reiterated that Pakistan was committed to finding
solutions to all outstanding issues with India "through dialogue".
</P>
<P>
"We think structured and synchronized discussions are a must
for achieving real progress on all issues," he said during an
interview with the Associated Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He said that efforts would be made to evolve a mechanism which
could ensure sustained progress on all matters between Pakistan
and India including the core issue of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"The solution to Kashmir problem is indispensable for a durable
peace and for diverting the energies to poverty alleviation in the
region," said Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that Pakistan realized that solutions of all
outstanding issues between India and Pakistan are not possible in
"quick fix".
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that it may be unrealistic to predict that
a major breakthrough in the new round of foreign secretary-level
talks would be made.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the basic purpose of the new round of talks
is to prepare an agenda for the prime ministerial summit between
the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Everything Remains Unchanged in HK after July 1: Japanese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- "I am one hundred percent
optimistic about Hong Kong's prospects," Nagoya Yokoyama,
president of the Hong Kong Japanese Chamber of Commerce &AMP;
Industry, told Xinhua in an exclusive interview recently.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the view that after Hong Kong's return to China,
the economic and trade relationship between Japan and Hong Kong
would be further strengthened.
</P>
<P>
In spite of his only one-month stay here as the president of
the Japanese chamber, Yokoyama is well acquainted with Hong Kong's
free trade and financial systems and its status as a free port
since he is a frequent visitor who had made 33 trips here in the
past, and Hong Kong's trade and banking policies and its status as
a free trade port has left him a deep impression.
</P>
<P>
"The business community in Japan is restricted by a host of
government regulations, whereas in Hong Kong, there's no
government control on economic matters and foreign business people
can afford to do anything they want," he said, adding that the
investment environment is also very good.
</P>
<P>
Japan is the third largest investor in Hong Kong, with a direct
investment of approximately 1.5 billion US dollars between April
1996 and March 1997.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Japan invested 2.5 billion US dollars in China's
interior area, or 5.2 percent of the country's total overseas
investment.
</P>
<P>
In term of economic growth rate, Yokoyama said, the economy in
Asia enjoys the highest growth rate in the world, and the
economic growth rate for both Hong Kong and China's interior area
has far exceeded that of Japan.
</P>
<P>
While Japan is expecting a 2 or 2.5 percent growth rate this
year, he noted, Hong Kong's economy rose six percent in the first
quarter and this growth momentum will be maintained during the
second, third and fourth quarters. The economy in China's interior
area is expected to grow by 10 percent or so, he added.
</P>
<P>
"From the geographical point of view, Hong Kong is situated at
the center of Asia, so I hold that this position of Hong Kong will
become increasingly important in the future," he predicted.
</P>
<P>
He went on say that Japan is Hong Kong's third largest trade
partner, and that Hong Kong is the sixth trade partner for Japan.
"Japan has the largest number of banks in Hong Kong, with 43 of
the 182 foreign banks here being Japanese," he noted.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 2,000 Japanese firms and some 25,000
Japanese residents in Hong Kong, and 747 companies are full
members of the Hong Kong Japanese Chamber of Commerce and
Industry, Yokoyama said.
</P>
<P>
He added that a record 2.38 million tourists from Japan visited
Hong Kong in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The return of Hong Kong will be a very historical event, and
we wish to extend our sincere and heartfelt congratulations to the
Chinese people," he said. He expressed his admiration to the
Chinese government for its policy to keep the political and
economic systems in Hong Kong for another 50 years.
</P>
<P>
After July 1, the economic and trade relationship between Japan
and Hong Kong will continue to develop, and the trade volume
between them will further increase, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the post-1997 period, he acknowledged, "we will have still
more and closer contacts with the government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region and with semi-official bodies such
as the Hong Kong Trade Development Council."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, the Japanese chamber will also continue
expanding the friendly ties it has forged with other foreign
chambers of commerce and business associations in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"I think that 98 percent, or even 99 percent of the members of
our chamber share my view and are optimistic about Hong Kong's
future, for they are convinced that everything will remain
unchanged here after its return to China," Yokoyama said.

year.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the United News of India (UNI),
which was released here today, RBI Governor Chakravarty Rangarajan
said, "It is feasible to take some measures towards CAC if the
inflation rate continued to hover around the present six percent
and the fiscal deficit restricted to around 4.5 percent during the
year."
</P>
<P>
"We are looking into the interactive process between the
liberalization of capital transactions and the crucial
preconditions so that certain transactions related to capital
account can be identified for relaxation under the present
economic environment," he added.
</P>
<P>
Without making any commitment on the timeframe of implementing
CAC, the governor said that the signposts (preconditions) for CAC
are essential to facilitate gradual relaxation of the capital
account transactions without causing shock to the existing
economic system.
</P>
<P>
The governor has expressed confidence over robust recovery in
industrial production during the current fiscal year following
easy availability of finances at lower interest rate, better
agricultural production, expectation of another good monsoon year
and growing business volume in world trade.

<HEADLINE> hkhk - Helicopters in Rescue Operations May Put Lives at Risk: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Helicopters will be kept away
from city-center blazes after an investigation into a fierce fire
in a Hong Kong commercial building last year found they might have
put the lives of those trapped inside at risk.
</P>
<P>
Justice Woo Kwok-hing, who headed the inquiry, said that the
down draught generated by the two helicopters pushed smoke back
into the offices where people were gasping for breath, according
to local English-language newspaper South China Morning Post here
today.
</P>
<P>
"Some occupants trapped in the office even called 999 to ask
the helicopters to leave," he said after releasing the interim
report on Thursday of the November 20 inferno in the Garley
Building in Kowloon which killed 40 people and injured 81.
</P>
<P>
During the helicopter rescue operation, four people trapped on
the building's rooftop were winched to safety.
</P>
<P>
But Woo said in his report that the helicopters from the
Government Flying Services (GFS) had also obstructed the fire
fighting and rescue operation. "The down wash might have driven
fresh air into the building and thus further fueled the fire," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
"It had also affected the operation of an aerial ladder, which
did not only delay the operation but might have endangered lives."
</P>
<P>
It said the GFS had also admitted that the noise generated by
the helicopters had disrupted firemen's radio communications.
</P>
<P>
GFS operations manager Captain Rick Howell said helicopters
would only be used in built-up areas as a last resort.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the helicopters might have obstructed the fire
fighting operation but said there was no other choice. "If we
hadn't winched up the trapped people, they would have had no
alternative but to jump," he said.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary hearing will be held here on Monday to decide
whether the second part of the inquiry should be open or not.

COLOMBO, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka is to adopt a new
teacher education development project with assistance from the
World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, according to Education
Ministry sources.
</P>

BANGKOK, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh has reiterated that his coalition is still intact and
in harmony and denied that Deputy Prime Minister and Finance
Minister Amnuay Virawan resigned under pressure from coalition
parties.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by the Government House on Thursday,
Chavalit said that his 49-member cabinet was the best he had ever
worked together with and it always held the national interest as
its priority.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay frequently met him over the past week before his
resignation and told him that he did not want to cause any trouble
for the government.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay was under pressure because he could not solve the
economic problems in the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
Despite Amnuay's departure, the government would carry on with
Amnuay's economic policies which will show results in the near
future, Chavalit said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the baht would not be devalued.
</P>

<HEADLINE> East China's Summer Grain Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Jiangsu Province, one of the major
grain producers in east China, is expected to have a record
per-unit output of summer grain harvest.
</P>
<P>
The summer grain output is estimated at 12.24 million tons, a
year-on-year increase of 230,000 tons, with a per-ha yield of
4,500 kg, according to the provincial Agriculture and Forestry
Department.
</P>
<P>
Huankou Township in Fengxian County is even hoping for a 7,500
kg per-ha grain production.
</P>
<P>
The department attributes this to an increased growing area,
which was at about 2.72 million ha this year, an increase of
nearly 34,000 ha.
</P>
<P>
High-yield cultivation techniques are another favorable
aspect. Better seeds were used on nearly 90 percent of the
farmland in major production areas.
</P>
<P>
A more balanced application of chemical fertilizers has also
contributed to the harvest.

<HEADLINE> Chinese SEZ Expects More Extensive Cooperation With Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zhuhai, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The return of Hong Kong will
open up new prospects for development in the economic cooperation
between Zhuhai and Hong Kong, said Liang Guangda, secretary of the
Communist Party Committee of Zhuhai, a special economic zone in
Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's position as an international financial,
trading, transportation and information centers will radiate more
strongly to inland areas like Zhuhai," he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two decades, the Pearl River Delta, which was in
the van of China's opening to the outside world, attracted a
large amount of investment from Hong Kong, bringing its GDP up to
60 percent of the whole province although the delta has only
a third of the Province's people and a fourth of its land.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong, Liang says, will make it possible for
the two places to better coordinate their steps and optimize their
industrial structures and the allocation of production factors and
that will enhance the comprehensive economic strength of both
sides, thus making the region most competitive in the world.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Zhuhai's infrastructure and economic
potential will facilitate this, and "Zhuhai has both the hardware
and software to develop modern industries."
</P>
<P>
In the past 17 years, Zhuhai has built a large international
airport, 20,000 to 80,000-dwt class freight wharves and oil and
gas terminals, a railway network, ample power supplies, and a
sophisticated highway and an advanced telecommunications system.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has recently designated a
400-sq.km. industrial park in Zhuhai as one of the province's main
areas for investment in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Liang says this industrial park is especially convenient for
developing warehousing and trans-shipment services, a sector that
is comparatively insufficient in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 17 years, Zhuhai has drawn several billion
US dollars of outside investment, over half of which came
from Hong Kong.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, June 19 (Xinhua) - Mexico qualified for the Copa
America soccer tournament quarter-finals despite struggling to a
1-1 draw against underdogs Costa Rica on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mexico were outplayed by their Central American rivals and
needed a controversial penalty for their goal in the group C game.
</P>
<P>
The penalty, awarded for an alleged handball, was converted by
Luis Hernandez in the 15th minute for his fifth goal of the
competition. It was also the 2,000th goal in the tournament's
history.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica completely dominated after the goal and deservedly
equalised in the 60th minute through striker Hernan Medford, who
scored with a drive from 25 meters.
</P>
<P>
Mexico, despite finishing third in their group with four
points, will still advance as one of the two best third-placed
teams.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica, in their first appearance in the competition,
went home finishing bottom with one point.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine's President Appoints Acting PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
removed Prime Minister Pavel Lazarenko by decree today due to
illness and appointed First Deputy Prime Minister Vasily Durdynets
as acting prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The presidential office quoted the decree as saying that
Durdynets would be acting prime minister "for the time of Prime
Minister Pavel Lazarenko's illness".
</P>
<P>
Lazarenko did not attend today's parliamentary session during
which deputies discussed this year's long-delayed
budget. Parliamentary Speaker Alexander Moroz said Lazarenko was
ill.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time since Ukraine declared independence in
1991 that the president has issued a decree to appoint an acting
prime minister to replace the prime minister who is unable to
carry out his duties for health reasons.
</P>
<P>
Lazarenko's position has weakened since last week as the
pro-Kuchma People's Democratic Party and several groups in
parliament have urged the president to sack him.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma has repeatedly criticized Lazarenko and his government
in public for failing to get this year's budget and tax reforms
approved by parliament.

<HEADLINE> China to Seek More "Hygienic Cities" Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 20 (Xinhua) -- China will launch another
nation-wide competition to find the country's cleanest cities from
next autumn, according to a report in today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The urban hygiene drive aims to ensure a sanitary environment
for some 400 million urban dwellers living in 600-odd cities, or
more than 30 percent of China's total population.
</P>
<P>
The National Commission for Patriotic Health Campaign (NCPHC),
the goer of the drive, will check on environmental sanitation,
public health publicity and quality of drinking water in public
places like railway stations and restaurants, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Cities that have met the requirements set by the NCPHC will be
named "Hygienic Cities", and the title of "National Hygienic City"
will be given to those whose achievements are judged excellent in
all aspects, it said.
</P>
<P>
"The commission will stress health education and publicity
among local residents as well as environmental sanitation in small
neighborhoods," the report quoted NCPHC's official Xu Dongfang as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Xu said a number of cities are facing serious environmental and
health problems, such as unlicensed food sales and unsanitary free
markets.
</P>
<P>
Of the 138 major rivers coursing through cities, only 32 meet
national hygienic standards. Water from underground aquifers is
overused and about two-thirds of all urban districts are plagued
by excessive noise.
</P>
<P>
Since the "Hygienic City" drive originated seven years ago, 27
cities including Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang Province, Luzhou in
Sichuan Province and Shenzhen in Guangdong Province have won the
"National Hygienic City" title.
</P>
<P>
Another 155 cities were named hygienic cities in the 1995
competition, including Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
will not take part in the NATO summit in Madrid next month,
because Russians would feel uncomfortable at his presence, the
presidential press service said today.
</P>
<P>
But Yeltsin said his decision would not result in negative
consequences in Russia's relations with other states.
</P>
<P>
The NATO summit is expected to formally announce the first wave
of countries from eastern Europe to be invited to join the
military alliance as part of its eastward expansion plan.
</P>
<P>
Russia has strongly opposed the plan, saying it would harm its
security interests. But last month, Russia and NATO signed a
treaty on relations between the two sides, designed to ease
Russian concerns and pave the way for the expansion.
</P>
<P>
In a television interview aired on Russian television tonight,
Yeltsin said "We had a special group working (on this matter) and
we have decided that we need a little pause after the signing of
the Founding Act (on Russia-NATO relations)."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin left Moscow for the U.S. on Thursday night to attend a
summit meeting with leaders of the Group of Seven industrialized
nations in Denver.
</P>
<P>
He said the summit "would be very significant for Russia if the
status of the eight industrialized nations is decided."
</P>
<P>
During the summit, he will also hold talks with Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto on the issue of the four disputed
islands off Japan's northernmost main island of Hokkaido.

<HEADLINE> Interview:  HK's Return to China, Major Event in Century: German </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's return to China
signifies one of the greatest historical events in this century,
said Wolfgang Gottelmann, German Consul-General in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Gottelmann said Hong Kong's return
will produce a huge political and economic impact on China's
development.
</P>
<P>
He said, "Politically, the event represents one significant
step forward in the process of China's reunification."
</P>
<P>
From economic aspect, he added, Hong Kong's return to China
will enhance the economic ties between Hong Kong and the interior
area.
</P>
<P>
"As a window of China and a capital market and service center
in Asia-Pacific Region, Hong Kong is expected to play a still more
important role in China's economic development," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Either the German government or German business associations in
Hong Kong are very optimistic about Hong Kong's future," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Gottelmann, a recent survey conducted among the
German business companies in Hong Kong shows that 80 percent of
the firms see no reason to change their company strategies and
plans of activities.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, he noted, "the great majority of the firms
want to expand their activities here after 1997."
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is very important to Germany, and there are about
500 German companies in Hong Kong, which form the largest German
business community outside Germany."
</P>
<P>
"Many of them set up regional headquarters here, which are
responsible for their business not only in Hong Kong, but also
elsewhere in China and Japan," he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the total trade volume between Germany and Hong Kong
was 92.5 billion HK dollars (11.94 billion US dollars), an
increase of 2.9 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's export value to Germany reached 58.6 billion HK
dollars (7.56 billion US dollars) last year, while Germany's
export value to Hong Kong amounted to 33.9 billion HK dollars
(4.37 billion US dollars), up 1.2 and 5.9 percent over 1995
respectively.
</P>
<P>
For years, Germany and Hong Kong have enjoyed a strong and
stable economic partnership. "Hong Kong is a perfect business
location for us and we are confident in Hong Kong's political
situation and economic growth after 1997 that will remain to be
stable and predictable," he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his belief that the Sino-British Joint Declaration
on the Question of Hong Kong and the Basic Law will be fully
implemented.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, "It is our mutual interest to see Hong Kong
prosper after 1997 and we want to continue strengthening our
cooperation with Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
Gottelmann likes to play golf, but in recent months "I cannot
spare time to afford it, for the game will consume me much more
time," he said.
</P>
<P>
As the economic and cultural exchanges between Germany and Hong
Kong on rise, Gottelmann has been preoccupied with meetings with
business people, artists, German visitors and officials of the
Hong Kong government and future HKSAR government.
</P>
<P>
With a diplomatic career of some 30 years, Gottelmamn has
worked as an envoy to many countries or international
organizations in the world, including a stint in the United
Nations in New York as well as some European and African
countries.
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I feel that Hong Kong is a very exciting place,
even more hectic and attractive than New York," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, Hong Kong is somewhat weaker in cultural
development as compared with its economic growth momentum.
</P>
<P>
He said he expected that cultural and artist exchanges will be
further promoted between Hong Kong and other countries and regions
so that more art performances and exhibitions will be held for
Hong Kong residents in future.
</P>
<P>
Gottelmann came to Hong Kong in October 1992. And he described
his stay in Hong Kong longer than he had expected.
</P>
<P>
"But I never regret my tenure here and I am lucky that I can
witness the whole process of Hong Kong's smooth transition,"
Consul-General Gottelmann said.

<HEADLINE> More Overseas Investment for North China Port City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The director of the Banque
National de Paris Tianjin office, brought his cat with him when he
first arrived in Tianjin in north China, bringing some troubles to
the hotel where he was staying.
</P>
<P>
"No pets are permitted in guests' rooms," the hotel told him,
leaving him with the problem of what to do with the cat. Finally,
the French banker turned to the Tianjin Overseas Investment
Service Center for help.
</P>
<P>
The service center is a special non-profit institution created
in 1987 to provide services for overseas investors in getting
government approval for their projects. Soon he was able to find a
room where he could live with his cat.
</P>
<P>
"I feel happy that the center helped me find a comfortable room
for me and my cat to live in," he said, admitting at the same time
that his appeal for his cat to live with him was a bit unfair to
the service center.
</P>
<P>
But, taking patience to deal with overseas investors has
allowed the center to succeed in helping local enterprises get
overseas investment. And overseas investors have put 17 billion US
dollars into Tianjin. There are about 190 of the 500 leading
multinationals that have joint ventures in the city.
</P>
<P>
The center has also taken steps to simplify its procedures, and
overseas investors have been able to get their applications
approved within 10 days since 1993. It has also set up a new
industrial park in Tianjin, which will attract even more
investment, said Hu Qiajing, deputy director of the center.

<HEADLINE> Primitive Ruin Found in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, June 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
discovered a site of primitive culture in Anren County of Central
China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
Covering about 4,000 square meters, the site lies on the
southern slope of a small east-west hill, ten kilometers southwest
of Anren County town.
</P>
<P>
The layer of culture is clearly visible, with part of it as
deep as 1.5 meters. Collected from the ground and the
cross-section of part of the layer of culture are such stone
subjects as axes and knives, and potteries which are mostly in the
shape of axe. The stone implements are hard and smoothly
polished. They have been identified as tools for use in production
and daily life.
</P>
<P>
Experts have determined that cultural site belongs to the
middle and late new stone age about 5,000 years ago. It is
regarded as having great value in studying the attribute of the
ancient culture in South China and in revealing the primitive
culture of Chengzhou in Hunan.

SHANGHAI, June 20 (Xinhua) -- For local residents in Shanghai,
the telephone isn't just a means of communication, it is also a
handy form of entertainment and gives on-the-spot advice.
</P>
<P>
With the fledgling telephone information services that are now
the rage in China's largest city, local residents can dial a phone
to enjoy their favorite songs, music and stories, monitor the
latest changes in the stock market, and learn about laws and other
matters related to everyday life in China.
</P>
<P>
There are currently four phone services, each able to provide
thousands of informative tidbits to callers.
</P>
<P>
Owners of these "invisible advisor" services are working to be
more listener-friendly: some have lowered calling fees and offered
a more creative variety of selections, such as the "phone flea
market" and hotlines on education and tourism.
</P>
<P>
The phone services have become so popular among local people
that the city's oldest information line -- 168 -- received 4.75
million calls in March alone.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the lucrative industry has beguiled more and more
businessmen, and a dozen newcomers have received approval from the
authorities to open for business.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 20 (Xinhua) -- The peace talks on Papua New
Guinea's island of Bougainville might move to New Zealand, a NZ
Press Association report said today.
</P>
<P>
It quoted a Bougainville rebel official as saying that the
rebels might soon attend the talks in New Zealand on peace in the
civil war in PNG. The rebels have been fighting for the
independence of Bougainville since 1989.
</P>
<P>
"The talks are likely to happen soon," rebel Bougainville
Interim Government vice-chairman Joseph Kabui was reported as
saying.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for NZ Foreign Minister Don McKinnon said that NZ
had not been asked to stage talks but would consider any such
request.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Solomon Islands tried to broker talks between
the rebels and the PNG-backed Bougainville transitional
government. But transitional government officials failed to turn
up.
</P>
<P>
Kabui said there were other problems with holding talks in the
Solomon Islands. "The venue have changed from the Solomon Islands
to New Zealand," he announced.

<P>
ROME, June 19 (Xinhua) -- Italian clubs will soon be able to
sign five non-European Union nationals, but field only three of
them in a match, football chiefs decided here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The compromise, decided at a council meeting here of the
Italian football federation (FIGC), will take effect for the
coming season.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Serie A clubs can sign and field only three
non-EU players.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's compromise also promises more money from the
Football League for youth development.
</P>
<P>
Clubs who sign more than three non-EU nationals will be made to
contribute to a special youth fund, and bonuses will be introduced
for Serie B and C clubs who field players at senior level who have
come up through their own junior teams.
</P>
<P>
However the Italian players union and the national coaches
association had both called for the current limit to remain
unchanged, arguing that the arrival of foreigners can only
jeopardise the development of young Italian talent in the lower
divisions.

<P>
SARAJEVO, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The international community's new
High Representative Carlos Westendorp said on Thursday that the
aim of his mission is to make a lasting peace in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
During his press conference in Sarajevo, the former Spanish
foreign minister said that he was aware that his job was "very
very difficult", but the reason for him coming to Sarajevo was "to
make peace irreversible in this country".
</P>
<P>
Westendorp succeeded Carl Bildt as the top foregin official in
charge of the implementation of the Dayton peace accords. Bildt is
returning to Sweden for the country's next general elections.
</P>
<P>
"Our common goal is to reach a durable situation in which war
is not going to come back, and for that we have a huge task ahead
of us," Westendorp said, listing a wide range of issues from the
donors conference to the return of refugees.
</P>
<P>
Asked about arresting persons indicted for war crimes by an
international court, Westendorp said that unless the issue of war
is solved as soon as possible, the country would not for political
and moral purposes have a "situation of normality".
</P>
<P>
But he called on the Bosnian parties to hand in those indicted
persons as they are obliged by the Dayton agreement, saying that
"the main responsibilities lie on the parties".
</P>
<P>
"I prefer to believe that it (that) comes from within a country
is much better than a solution imposed from outside," Westendorp
said.

DENVER, June 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton today
stressed that the U.S. should maintain normal trade relations with
China by giving the country the most-favored-nation (MFN) status.

<P>
Clinton made the statement when addressing at the National

"We should not attenuate normal trade relations with a country

Cutting off normal trading relations will imperil 170,000

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The State Department insisted
on Thursday that Egypt should continue to enjoy more than two
billion U.S. dollars economic and military aid.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman John Dinger made the statement after
the Senate Appropriations subcommittee, displeased with Egypt's
"emerging ties" with Libya, approved a foreign aid package on
Wednesday with no money set aside for Cairo.
</P>
<P>
"Our position is quite clear and on the record as to how we
should approach aid to Egypt," Dinger told reporters at a
briefing.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to President Bill Clinton's request this year to
provide Egypt in 1998 with 2.1 billion dollars in economic and
military assistance.
</P>
<P>
Dinger did not take the issue directly with the subcommittee,
nor suggested that the subcommittee's bill might send a negative
signal at a time when the U.S.-brokered Middle East peace process
is in serious crisis.
</P>
<P>
He only said the bill is "a long way from being enacted so I
don't want to get into too much detail." The Clinton
administration expects the Senate panel's aid package will be
amended during the legislative process.

<HEADLINE> Jospin Wins Parliamentary Confidence Vote for Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
today won a parliamentary confidence vote for his centrist policy
which he announced this afternoon before the newly elected
National Assembly dominated by a leftwing coalition.
</P>
<P>
The parliament adopted the confidence vote with 297 votes for
and 252 votes against the policy of Jospin, who promised to
maintain the engagements he made during the legislative election
campaign but appeared prudent over budget spending and
privatization.
</P>
<P>
Jospin promised to raise the guaranteed minimum salary, or SMIC,
by 4 percent on July 1, and launched a program to rehabilitate one
million housing units, 100,000 of which will be completed this
year.
</P>
<P>
But he was vague on what action he would take to meet his
promise to create 700,000 jobs for young people, and only asked
the Minister of Employment Martine Aubry to study the project and
present its primary results in the Autumn.
</P>
<P>
Jospin also failed to make clear what his policy would be
toward privatization programs, such as those of France Telecom
and Air Francais, and spoke in favor of merger of France's defense
industry, including the state-owned Thomson CSF
defense-electronics giant.
</P>
<P>
He announced an end to the plan to lay off public employees,
raise scholarship awards for the students who return to schools,
and a five-year plan to reduce work week hours from 39 hours to 35
hours without lowering pay.
</P>
<P>
Jospin also promised to "gradually move ahead" the process of
European integration, and reaffirmed France's will to enter the
European monetary union on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile he stressed that he would implement the resolution
adopted by the European Union countries in Amsterdam early this
week on job and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the government adopt a tax policy which
encourages work income and consumption, and consider cutting the
20.6 percent high sales tax imposed by former government of Prime
Minister Alain Juppe.
</P>
<P>
After Jospin made his declaration of general policy, the French
employers' organization, the CNPF, warned the government against
an "economic regression" in France.
</P>
<P>
Former parliament speaker Philippe Seguin of the Gaullist Rally
for the Republic said that the center-right would be a
"constructive opposition." He called on Jospin to "choose
between your electoral voters and our European partners."
</P>
<P>
Francois Bayrou, former minister and president of the centrist
Union for French Democracy parliament group, said that Jospin would
have to renounce some of his campaign promises in order to meet
the criteria to join the European single currency euro.

UNITED NATIONS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council,
with 14 votes in favor and one abstention from China, decided
today to renew the mandate of the multinational protection forces
in Albania for 45 days beginning on June 28.
</P>
<P>
Expressing its concern over the situation in Albania, the
Security Council underlined the need for all concerned to refrain
from hostilities and acts of violence and called on the parties
involved to continue political dialogues and pave the way for
electoral process.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting of the Security Council, Chinese Deputy
Permanent Representative to the United Nations Wang Xuexian said
following the Charter of the United Nations, the organization
should not interfere with the internal affairs of a country.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Albania was its internal affairs and the Security
Council should be careful in dealing with the issue, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Wang pointed out China did not agree with sending multinational
protection forces to Albania nor expanding the autorization of the
multinational protection forces.
</P>
<P>
Deploying the Multinational protection forces in Albania was a
measure adopted in a special situation, said Wang, adding that
with the improvement of the situation in Albania, the forces
should be pulled out in time.
</P>
<P>
Wang reiterated that the final solution to the Albanian issue
depended on Albanians themselves and he hoped the Government of
Albania and its people would make their best efforts to restore
stability as soon as possible.

The farce staged by Koroma's ruling Armed Forces Revolutionary
Council (AFRC), however, has not received anything but a silence
from the international community. And there is no sign of any
alleviation of the hardship the military leadership has been
suffering since the widely-condemned coup.
</P>
<P>
What's more, the coup makers' sense of hard time is becoming
acute under international pressure, particularly the effective
blockade by the west African peacekeeping force, known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
Troops of the sub-regional force were sent to Sierra Leone in
the wake of the coup in an effort to restore the toppled civilian
government led by ousted president Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
At present, ECOMOG has controlled major strategic positions in
the capital Freetown, such as Lungi International Airport and
seaports, while its troops have been deployed along the borders
with Guinea and Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The blockade, as AFRC's Army Chief of Defense Staff Brigadier
Samuel Koroma complained, has brought the looted economy of the
country to a halt.
</P>
<P>
To extricate itself from the predicament, according to him,
the military regime, apart from trying to dislodge ECOMOG forces
from the strategic positions, has been discussing with foreign
airlines and shipping firms so that they can begin to ply the
route.
</P>
<P>
But the firms said emphatically that much as they were willing
to do business, the presence of ECOMOG troops makes it unsafe for
them, admitted Brigadier Koroma, who is reported to be elder
brother of Major Koroma.
</P>
<P>
The direct result of the blockade is the current acute
shortage of food supply and provisions in the tiny west African
country as ships carrying goods have turned to neighboring Guinea
after the coup.
</P>
<P>
The few grocery shops that opened for business since the June
2 battle between ECOMOG and Sierra Leonean soldiers witnessed
long queues of people who competed to buy the limited goods to
keep at home. Many were reported to be disappointed at the
insufficient goods.
</P>
<P>
According to Brigadier Koroma, the efforts of the military
regime to hold talks with ECOMOG commanders towards easing the
hardships have been rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
Also rebuffed were the military leadership's appeal for such
west African countries as Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire not to support
the multinational military intervention.
</P>
<P>
In far away north Africa, Libya's Colonel Mummar Gaddafi has
denied his alleged backing of the coup plotters in Sierra Leone,
refusing any relations with the junta.
</P>
<P>
While United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan last week
renewed his call for the coup leaders to step down, his
counterpart in the Organization of African Unity, Salim Ahmed
Salim, re-assured on Tuesday that the Pan-African body would
continue to work together with ECOMOG to ensure that the deposed
democratically-elected government in the country be restored.
</P>
<P>
Although the ruling AFRC announced on Monday it had foiled a
counter coup and arrested 10 senior officials and politicians
allegedly involved in the plot, there is no sign of any
improvement in the country's tense situation.
</P>
<P>
In Freetown, government and private sector employees defied
the military's repeated calls and continued to refuse to go back
to work, while schools, colleges, hospitals, banks and commercial
houses remained closed.
</P>
<P>
This was termed by some Sierra Leoneans as "a vivid
manifestation of opposition to the military takeover."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, parliament members and religious leaders in the
country have also called on the military leadership to return
power to civilians.
</P>
<P>
Despite Koroma's promise to establish a broad-based government
comprising all parties concerned in an election in due time, his
formal inauguration as head of state only gives the information
that he defies the international call for handing over power to
the toppled civilian government.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe the international community will insist on
the requirement just as Salim put it: "Coups against elected
governments should no longer be tolerated in the continent."
</P>
<P>
It is against this background that ECOMOG is continuing its
military buildup while negotiations are still underway for a
peaceful settlement of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Chief Tom Ikimi, foreign minister of
Nigeria which contributes the bulk of ECOMOG troops and financial
resources, is in Cote d'Ivoire to hold talks with President Konam
Bedie on the matter.
</P>
<P>
This is only part of a series of meetings Ikimi has been
having with leaders of African countries on how best to resolve
the Sierra Leonean crisis and restore Kabbah's government.
</P>
<P>
All this, according to observers, can be interpreted that if
the talks fail and Koroma continues to refuse a handover of
power, ECOMOG might launch larger scale military intervention for
a final resolution.
</P>
<P>
By then, Koroma's military regime will have an even harder
time to suffer.

<HEADLINE> UK Conservative's New Leader Promises Fresh Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 19 (Xinhua) -- William Hague, the newly elected
leader of the Conservative party, promised today "to pick the party
members up and return to the future".
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Conservative members of parliament after he
was elected the party leader in the final ballot, the 36-year-old
former Welsh secretary said he would undertake a "revolution" in
the party so as to unite it together for the next general election
in 2002.
</P>
<P>
"We've had a great setback but let's have no more
recriminations. Let's look forward, not back. Let's pick ourselves
up, dust ourselves down and return to the future," said Hague, the
youngest leader of Britain's Conservative party in over 200 years.
</P>
<P>
Hague won today's vote -- the third and final ballot --by 92
votes to 70 among the 164 Conservative MPs. One MP abstained and
another spoiled his ballot paper.
</P>
<P>
"We all start from a clean slate. It is my responsibility to
lead this party and it is also my responsibility to heal this
party," said the new leader who will succeed John Major, the former
prime minister who promised to step down as party leader on May 2,
the day the Conservative was defeated in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Major hailed Hague's victory at a meeting of the Conservative
MPs, saying "What you have done this afternoon is pass the
leadership of the Conservative party to the most outstanding
political talent in our country today."
</P>
<P>
Another former prime minister Margaret Thatcher, who threw her
open support to Hague on Wednesday said happily: "It's been a good
day."
</P>
<P>
But the new leader was dealt an immediate blow when the
ex-finance secretary Kenneth Clarke, the only rival for the
leadership, rejected an offer of a senior job in Hague's shadow
cabinet, leaving the party more disunited.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Labor Party responded the result of the Conservative
ballot with a delighted tone to see the party remain divided.
</P>
<P>
Margaret Beckett, Labor's Trade and Industry Secretary, said:
"The Tory (Conservative) party has shown that it is more split
today than ever before...There are two Tory parties and Mr Hague
doesn't know which one he's in."

<HEADLINE> US, Britain Meet Opposition for New Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The United States and
Britain Thursday met strong opposition in the Security Council in
introducing new sanctions on Iraq for its interfering with the
work of the U.N. weapons inspection team.
</P>
<P>
The draft was "a disproportionate response to events," said
Chinese U.N. spokesman Chen Ranfeng. Russia, France and Egypt are
known to object also, with one of them even saying the draft
cannot serve as the basis for consultation.
</P>
<P>
The measures include preventing Iraqi government officials,
members of the army and police and their immediate families from
traveling abroad and suspending reviews of trade sanctions
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain introduced the measures after
hearing an oral report of the chief U.N. arms inspector Rolf
Ekeus, who accused Iraq of interfering arms inspection several
times last month.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz, in a recent letter to
the Security Council, said access to some sites had recently been
denied because of concern that the inspections were not to carry
out the U.N. mandate but to "detect the arrangement made for the
security of Iraq, its leadership and the personnel involved."
