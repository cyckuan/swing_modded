EDITORIAL: EQUITABLE COVERAGE FOR MENTAL ILLNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, June 10:
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has announced that he will require federal
employee health plans that cover nine million people to provide the
same coverage for mental illness and substance abuse that they do
for other diseases. Congress should expand upon that sensible and
humane step by requiring mental health parity in all group
insurance plans.
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 Mental Health Parity Act was supposed to do that in
plans serving businesses with more than 50 employees. But insurance
companies, which opposed the law, have gotten around it by changing
the way they limit access to mental health services. The 1996 act
does not mandate mental health coverage. Instead it prohibits
health plans that offer such coverage from setting annual or
lifetime dollar limits for mental health services that are lower
than limits for other medical services. Many insurers have simply
replaced those overall limits with tight restrictions on the number
of hospital days or outpatient visits for mental illness.
</P>
<P>
   A bill introduced by Sens. Pete Domenici and Paul Wellstone,
sponsors of the 1996 act, would close that huge loophole, and
impose the requirement on plans for companies with more than 25
workers. The bill would also provide for parity on deductibles and
co-payments in treatment for severe mental illnesses such as
schizophrenia. A broader House bill sponsored by Marge Roukema
would also include parity for substance abuse treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the debate in 1996 concerned fears that treating mental
illnesses equitably would send insurance costs soaring or cause
many employers to drop mental health coverage altogether. Evidence
gathered by the National Institute of Mental Health found that
neither has happened. A 1998 NIMH study, based largely on states
that instituted strong mental health parity requirements before the
1996 act, found that such requirements increased health care costs
by less than 1 percent when carried out under managed care. There
is evidence that the costs connected to parity for substance abuse
treatments are also very small.
</P>
<P>
   Recent medical breakthroughs have produced effective treatments
for mental illness. The brain is an organ, and diseases related to
this organ should be treated like any other medical illness.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
THIS is not the way it's supposed to end.
</P>
<P>
   Not when an individual has been such an integral part of three
championship teams. Not when he has the numbers and professional
portfolio worthy of the Hall of Fame, not to mention the Dallas
Cowboys' Ring of Honor at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But it's happening to Michael Irvin, and it's an awkward,
uncomfortable and quite humiliating thing to see.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of reason to say Irvin deserves any indignity
heaped upon him, though it would be difficult to imagine an
embarrassment or slur worse than he has attached to his own name.
He has shamed himself, his family and the Dallas franchise that
rewarded him so handsomely with both money and the fame that
eventually brought him down.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there remains a reason to feel queasy at seeing the final
act unfold, if for no other reason than as a cold, stark reminder
of all that Irvin has thrown away, which also includes his NFL
legacy. And that is a shame.
</P>
<P>
   For while Irvin's actions away from the football field are
indefensible, so has he been for the past 11 seasons, including 10
on the receiving end of all those passes from quarterback Troy
Aikman. What's more, while Irvin has been anything but a role model
in his personal life, the truth is that when it comes to this game
at which he excels, he has always been the consummate pro. He
practices hard, plays hard, bleeds Cowboys blue and cares about
winning as much as any player who ever wore the famous helmet with
the star on the side, even though he often crosses the line with
his strutting peacock routines.
</P>
<P>
   What is just the slightest bit regrettable isn't seeing Irvin,
the repeatedly unrepentant bad boy, getting his comeuppance in the
form of club owner Jerry Jones dangling his name in trade talks. It
is seeing a sports hero, who could have and would have had it all
in Dallas because of his immense talent, twist in the wind at the
end of his career as a result of his own personality flaws.
</P>
<P>
   They have always been and always will be interchangeable pieces
in the business machine of pro football. There is nothing new in
that. And the fact Jones is making himself unavailable to the media
to discuss the situation with Irvin for the upcoming season speaks
loudly that the Cowboys would actually prefer that one of their
all-time greatest wide receivers not be a part of it.
</P>
<P>
   As the Cowboys prepare for the start of training camp, just more
than a month away, and look ahead to their prospects for the 1999
season, the outlook for success is bleak even with Irvin in the
lineup. So the owner who has been hogtied by the very same salary
cap he helped invent and exploit is looking for ways to alleviate
his financial burden, and if he also happens to lose one of his two
biggest public-relations nightmares _ don't forget Leon Lett, who
has just been suspended a third time for violating the NFL
substance-abuse policy _ then all the better.
</P>
<P>
   For most of his career, Irvin was a simultaneous symbol of how
good the Cowboys could be as football players and how bad they
could be as people. In the eyes of so many Dallas-haters around the
nation, he was the Cowboys, all wearing one set of shoulder pads
and a single jersey, No. 88.
</P>
<P>
   For so many of those years as Irvin was hauling in 740 passes
for 11,737 yards and 62 touchdowns, his sheer talent and desire to
compete and win were enough to make him indispensable to the
Cowboys, even after his sordid cocaine-and-hookers bust in 1996
that resulted in a five-game suspension by the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, after a year when his production fell off to just
one touchdown catch all season and he was virtually abandoned by
first-year head coach Chan Gailey's offense after Thanksgiving,
Irvin, who carries a base salary of just under $3 million against
the cap, finds himself to be quite disposable. Except that his rap
sheet, including probation terms that could send him to jail for
even a minor slip-up, makes him unwanted by other teams.
</P>
<P>
   And the handwriting is on the wall in Dallas, where Irvin, 33,
is being permitted to enter the final year of his contract without
an offer of the kind of extensions given to Aikman and running back
Emmitt Smith. Their skills, too, are eroding, but they have earned
the right to be part of the organization and of Cowboys lore to the
end.
</P>
<P>
   Not so for Michael Irvin, who has finally been run down by his
past.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the way it's supposed to end. Not sad, just pathetic.
</P>

SONY MUSIC PLANS TO TEST USE OF IN-STORE DIGITAL KIOSKS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass. N.Y.)   (rk) 
 By LISA NAPOLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sony Music Entertainment said Wednesday it had struck a deal
that will let consumers buy music through digital vending machines
in music stores.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement follows a flurry of deals and partnerships in
recent months that hope to capitalize on public interest in the
digital delivery of music over the Internet. The Sony deal is
unusual, however, because it shifts digital delivery out of the
home and into retail outlets.
</P>
<P>
   In an agreement with Digital On-Demand, a company that has
developed the in-store digital kiosks, consumers will be able to
choose from 4,000 albums, about half of Sony's music catalog. The
digital files will then be sent over a proprietary computer system
and pressed to the customer's choice of format, including CD, DVD,
or minidisk.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction, which would include the printing of art and
liner notes to match that of a pre-packaged CD, should take 10 to
15 minutes, according to Scott T. Smith, president of Digital
On-Demand, which is based in Carlsbad, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   An initial test of the kiosks is to take place in 50 stores in
the New York and Los Angeles metropolitan areas beginning this
fall, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The kiosks will also be able to download music to digital music
players, once such a standard is created, Smith said. A music
industry coalition, including Sony and the other four major music
producers, have said they will reach a digital delivery standard by
June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, even in advance of an agreement on a standard, Sony
said it planned to begin selling singles by its musicians this
summer directly through the Internet _ a move that could bring it
into conflict with traditional retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Yarbrough, chairman of Sony Music Distribution, said
Wednesday that the kiosks would not eclipse efforts at online
sales, but make music more widely available in more formats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this as an expansion of the business,'' he said. ``It
offers the retailer the ability to offer titles they wouldn't be
able to physically carry to that consumer in that environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were skeptical of the plan, citing problems with the
operation and maintenance of kiosk devices in highly trafficked
retail outlets, as well as the unwillingness of consumers to wait
for their purchases to be prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hardie, senior analyst with Forrester Research of
Cambridge, Mass., noted a proliferation of ``smoke and mirrors''
announcements stemming from the eagerness of various industries to
ride the mania surrounding digital-based production.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much noise being made about technology that glosses
over the realities of poor products, bad interfaces, the true
market,'' he said. ``At the end of the day, I don't think this is
going to succeed. It's neat technology at a time when the world is
ga-ga over neat technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Dreese, founder of Newbury Comics, a New Enland music
chain, said that his experience with earlier versions of kiosks in
his stores had been troublesome.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an enormous disconnect going on between technologists,
the music industry, and the people who have tested these devices,''
he said. ``There are very few in-store devices that work.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, several attempts this decade to sell music through
kiosks have failed. Digital On-Demand is a successor to another
kiosk business, Newleaf Entertainment, which was a joint venture by
IBM and Viacom Inc.'s Blockbuster Entertainment unit. That venture,
whose patents Digital On-Demand has licensed, was shelved because
the companies could not create enthusiasm for the idea within the
industry.

SPORTS COLUMN: TOGETHERNESS CAN'T OFFSET CAMBY'S FLAIR 
</HEADLINE>

   INDIANAPOLIS _ They have climbed this mountain four times in
eight years now, and never made it over the peak, to the other
side, where the championship series awaits. The Indiana Pacers have
kept coming back, though, with an earnest spirit and a united core.
Along the way, these anti-Knicks made one celebrated coaching
change, tinkered a bit, but the principal players remained the
same.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers of Dan Quayle's home state have been the Eastern
Conference franchise of family values, their foundation built with
teamwork and trust, with the conviction that persistence and
patience would be rewarded in the end. As the showdown with the New
York Knicks became inevitable, the Pacers clung to the belief that
the team which refused to let a work stoppage stop it, which
practiced conventional basketball logic, would ultimately outlast
an opponent which all season long has defied it.
</P>
<P>
   And continued to defy it on Wednesday night, precisely in the
manner that Marcus Camby refused to be stereotyped, even dismissed,
as too weak and too soft.
</P>
<P>
   It was raw and utter defiance, the way Camby picked the Knicks
off the floor in the second quarter of the pivotal fifth game at
Market Square Arena and took them for a rousing ride on his
magnificent wingspan.
</P>
<P>
   This brutal reality now faces the once-favored Pacers after
losing, 101-94, in Game 5: elimination Friday night, in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The edge they believed that would carry them home was altered
and downright rejected, the way Camby treated so many of their
shots at the rim. Months ago, the Pacers practiced when the league
was padlocked three months by a lockout. They went through the
short season thinking a dividend on that investment was coming.
``Yeah, at the end, you'd think so,'' Larry Bird said. ``But you've
got to understand that 5 of our top 9 players weren't even there.''
</P>
<P>
   And not enough of them were there on Wednesday night. Instead,
it was Camby dominating inside, and Latrell Sprewell and Allan
Houston winning the perimeter war with Reggie Miller, and Larry
Johnson showing up late with two huge threes. The Pacers once again
failed again to demonstrate that brotherhood determines who plays
on and who goes home.
</P>
<P>
   All the standby team-sport cliches are on the line in this
series, all the accredited visions of how to grow a champ. Three
times in seven years the Pacers reached Game 7 of the conference
finals, a step away, and were beaten, on the road, by Patrick
Ewing, Shaquille O'Neal and Michael Jordan. When the three
all-league teams were announced Tuesday by the National Basketball
Association, there wasn't a Knick _ or Pacer, for that matter _ to
be found. Shouldn't one then assume that intangible factors such as
familiarity and continuity and stability would be more significant
than ever and inevitably play out Indiana's way?
</P>
<P>
   While the Pacers were bonding until David Stern opened his
doors, Patrick Ewing was flabbing out in the negotiating room,
setting in motion the chain of events that turned the Knicks'
season into a Jerry Springer script. When the lockout ended, the
Knicks were re-made in the manner of a Latrell Sprewell dash down
court, Sprewell and Kurt Thomas added on the eve of the season,
while the unproved Marcus Camby was forced on an insecure coach who
only wanted players he could trust.
</P>
<P>
   Yet after all the fussing and feuding and firing, these Knicks
were thrown into the playoff microwave and came out smoking, all
the way to within one game now of the NBA finals.
</P>
<P>
   After Game 2, the Knicks had plunged back into emotional turmoil
for pushing the injured Ewing too hard and lost him for good.
Naturally, after they won Game 3 by the grace of Jess Kersey's
whistle, Jeff Van Gundy decided it was high time for a major lineup
change. Suddenly faced with the electric Sprewell going up against
the defensively challenged Chris Mullin, Bird yawned. Told the
Knicks ``to just go out and play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no need to tinker when the coach believes in you, and
when you believe you have the best team,'' said Mark Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   This all sounded good and wholesome, the Indiana Pacer way. But
then, Utah's practitioners of clearheaded practice had already been
bounced from these playoffs by the highly combustible Blazers,
before a match was taken to their title series dreams by the San
Antonio Spurs. Now, suddenly, the Knicks have the well-practiced
Pacers on the Garden mat.
</P>
<P>
   It is a long climb up the championship mountain. Sometimes, at
higher elevations, the audacious and illogical have the better
chance to survive because, the Knicks proved on Wednesday night,
you can't practice pressure.

JACKSON BRINGS HIS PUSH FOR BUSINESS DIVERSITY AWARENESS TO KANSAS
CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY SANCHEZ and ERIC PALMER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Jesse Jackson came to Kansas City on
Wednesday to publicly praise several local companies for their
diversity efforts. Behind the scenes, he urged the city's largest
private employer to do more.
</P>
<P>
   The public visit included breakfast with a black ministers'
group and a tour of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum with baseball
legend Buck O'Neil. Jackson joined former Mayor Emanuel Cleaver and
other local black leaders to expand a minority-investment program.
Jackson was the featured speaker at a luncheon that raised money
for his Rainbow//PUSH Coalition while honoring the diversity
efforts of two local businesses and the city of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   But in between the speeches and handshakes, Jackson used
virtually every minute available to talk with officials of Sprint
Corp. He said he was asking the company to add more minorities and
women to its boardroom, executive-level jobs, construction projects
and vendor lists.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and others who participated described the talks as
cordial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have agreed to work out a relationship that is mutually
beneficial,'' Jackson said before leaving for an appearance in
Wichita.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our business is super-competitive,'' said Ben Watson, senior
vice president of human resources for Sprint. ``We are believers
that diversity makes us stronger and they are bringing us ideas on
how we can be stronger as a more diverse company.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Sprint is expected to name an African-American to its
board of directors for the first time, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Sprint hired nearly 12,000 new employees, Watson
said. Of that number, 34 percent were minorities, 20 percent
African-Americans. The company also established a call center in
the 18th and Vine Historic District.
</P>
<P>
   Watson was one of about four Sprint executives who met with
Jackson as he walked from one appointment to the next, in a hurried
boardroom meeting after the luncheon, and during Jackson's car ride
to Kansas City International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   William T. Esrey, Sprint's chairman and CEO, called Jackson from
Paris as Jackson took his morning tour of the Negro Leagues Museum.
Sprint's board of directors is in Paris for meetings this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The telecommunications giant is the metropolitan area's biggest
private employer and a $17 billion company. But while Sprint was a
major funder of the luncheon, the $25,000 that it donated to the
effort has been placed in an escrow account until negotiations with
the corporation progress further, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can choose to be a contributor, but until we resolve
these matters, we are holding the money,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jackson and others involved in the negotiations with
Sprint stressed that it is just one of many companies at which PUSH
is seeking change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not just Sprint,'' Jackson said. ``Let's take a look at
all of corporate Kansas City. Let's challenge them.''
</P>
<P>
   The company became a focus of minority groups' attention in
February. The Rev. Wallace Hartsfield was asked by a group of local
minority contractors to question Sprint about what they considered
a lack of women and minorities' being used to construct its new
world headquarters in Overland Park.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint spokeswoman Laura Meyer said that from the beginning,
Sprint has committed to spending at least $40 million with
businesses owned by minorities and women, out of the estimated $750
million it will cost to build the Sprint campus.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer said more opportunities would be available to those
businesses after building construction proceeds to interior work,
where smaller firms have more opportunities to bid.
</P>
<P>
   Some minority business owners said Sprint has been making
strides, but shouldn't need prodding to make improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campus is the largest private project in the world. Sprint
had a grand opportunity to set an example, with levels of minority
participation never before achieved. They missed that and they are
now playing catch-up,'' said Donald Gardner, owner of Group One
Architects, a minority firm.
</P>
<P>
   In his luncheon speech, Jackson used a baseball analogy to make
the point for inclusion. He wore a replica jersey of the Negro
Leagues' Kansas City Monarchs throughout much of the day, including
during the luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   American companies right now are operating without the talents
of women and minorities, he said. Before the black baseball leagues
were allowed to join the white leagues, neither collection of
talent was at its best.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how good American business can be until all of
the players are at the table,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City-based law firm of Shook, Hardy &AMP; Bacon also
sponsored the luncheon. The firm represents Rainbow//PUSH on
telecommunications issues.
</P>
<P>
   At the luncheon, St. Luke's-Shawnee Mission Health System,
Kansas City Power &AMP; Light and the city of Kansas City were honored
for their diversity efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, the Rainbow//PUSH organization bought $2,000
worth of stock in Sprint to make it a part of Jackson's Wall Street
Project, an effort to buy stock in major corporations as a means of
gaining access to those companies. Jackson started the project
about a year ago at the national level, and is now encouraging
similar efforts in local communities.
</P>
<P>
   A Kansas City chapter of the Wall Street Project was organized
Wednesday in a breakfast meeting attended by nearly 100 of the
area's most prominent black ministers and other activists.
</P>
<P>
   Former Mayor Cleaver and the Rev. Sam Mann were chosen as
co-chairmen of the Kansas City Wall Street Project.
</P>
<P>
   ``By being stockholders, you wind up being able to talk to
someone on the inside, not just on the outside,'' Mann said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said he hoped the local chapter would eventually buy
$2,000 to $5,000 worth of stock in Kansas City's top public
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Hartsfield said the discussions with Sprint had gone well. But
he said Sprint, like all major employers, has unfinished business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am hoping and praying that our relationship with (Sprint)
will lead to more,'' Hartsfield said. ``I want to be able to brag
about a company that was bodacious enough and creative enough to do
what's right.''

HUMANA CONSIDERS SELLING OR TRANSFERRING OPERATIONS OF CLINICS

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Humana Inc. is evaluating whether to sell or
transfer the operations of about 50 clinics around the country,
including seven in the Kansas City area, a Humana spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Humana assumed control of the clinics June 1 from FPA Medical
Management Inc. as part of the bankruptcy reorganization of
Miami-based FPA. Twenty-one of the clinics, including the ones in
the Kansas City area, had been operated by Humana earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City area clinics are known as the Prime Health
Medical Group. They serve 60,000 to 70,000 patients, comprising
Humana members and others. The clinics employ about 400 people.
</P>
<P>
   Humana spokesman Jose Marques said the company wanted to
concentrate on providing health insurance rather than operating
clinics. However, he said there was no timetable for changing the
status of the clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our No. 1 priority when we agreed to assume operational
responsibility for these medical centers was to maintain continuity
of care for our members,'' Marques said. ``Any future decisions we
make concerning the clinics will be made on the same premise.''
</P>
<P>
   FPA, formerly based in San Diego, took over management of eight
area Humana clinics in June 1998, one month before it filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company subsequently closed a clinic in
Kansas City and merged it into another.
</P>
<P>
   Humana, based in Louisville, Ky., is one of the largest publicly
traded managed health-care companies, with about 6.1 million
members.

<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ After being eliminated by the Indiana Pacers in
last year's playoffs, the New York Knicks decided to make the
emotional decision to trade Charles Oakley for Marcus Camby last
summer for critical occasions just like this one.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks held on to the athletic Camby's buoyant presence and
stayed close enough to the Indiana Pacers in Game 5 of the Eastern
Conference finals to grab an improbable, 101-94, victory Wednesday
night in front of a stunned crowd at Market Square Arena.
</P>
<P>
   With Game 6 of this best-of-7-game series at Madison Square
Garden on Friday night, the Knicks, who lead, 3-2 , need just one
more victory to advance to the NBA finals.
</P>
<P>
   To put them in such an amazing position, Camby was everywhere _
blocking shots, making free throws, flying in for put-back dunks _
in the fourth quarter as the Knicks made up a six-point deficit to
take the lead with 6 minutes 35 seconds left. There were a series
of lead changes, but that ended when Larry Johnson hit consecutive
3-pointers to give the Knicks an 89-84 lead with three minutes
left. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Camby ended the game with 21 points and 13 rebounds, while
Latrell Sprewell did not pass up a single shot opportunity on his
way to 29 points. The Pacers were led by Reggie Miller, who had 30
points.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks absorbed the Pacers' intense initial blast and made
up a 14-point deficit at the end of the first quarter to exit the
half with the score tied, 42-42, thanks in large part to the
omnipresent Camby.
</P>
<P>
   When things looked bleak, Camby came up with points and blocks
to give the Knicks some semblance of offense and defense, pulling
the Knicks back into the game after their out-of-control start.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' Allan Houston, a little more focused, a little more
aggressive than he was earlier in the series, shrugged off his
2-for-7 start and delivered six consecutive points off jumpers and
runners, giving the Knicks a 50-46 lead three minutes into the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pacers turned to Chris Mullin, who came up with a couple
of nifty pump fakes on Sprewell to give the Pacers back the lead,
52-50, with 7:29 left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Houston was hot, but he was also in foul trouble. That left
Charlie Ward to guard Miller, who went right at the shorter player.
Miller scored eight straight points on Ward and gave the Pacers a
67-61 lead on a fall-away jumper with two minutes left in the
third.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks needed Camby, but with three fouls in the first half,
he was being saved for the end of the third. When he came back in,
the Knicks went right to him. In his brief time on the floor, he
delivered three free throws, two rebounds and altered a shot by
Jalen Rose to help keep the Knicks close. They were down by 69-65
at the end of the third.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell was not on the floor for the Knicks' final two minutes
of the third after he had been beaten by Mullin. For two days,
Sprewell had to hear how old-man Mullin had dominated him in Game
4. He came out with the intent of putting a few gray hairs into
Mullin's crewcut as he went on a shooting binge in the frantic
first quarter. That was not necessarily a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell was off, and the Pacers went on a 9-0 run to start the
game. But Sprewell made a few circus shots and topped that spurt
with a 10-0 run. Problem was, the Knicks defense broke down and
allowed an 11-2 run by the Pacers that culminated with a 3-pointer
from 28 feet by Mark Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   That shot gave his team a 22-12 lead with 2:15 left in the first
quarter. After the Knicks missed their final 11 field goals of the
first quarter, the Pacers had a 28-14 lead after an emotional,
up-and-down opening to the game.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the Knicks' two key starters, Houston and
Sprewell, were a combined 4 for 12, which was not the initial punch
coach Jeff Van Gundy had been counting on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We rely on them,'' Van Gundy said before the game. ``It's no
secret they have to produce for us to win. That's one of the main
reasons I put Latrell in to start. I thought it would help him be
more efficient. I didn't think he had played well the last Atlanta
game or the first four Indiana games as far as shooting percent.
You'll always be second-guessed, but that's the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The second-guessing ended when the Knicks got their act
together. Once Camby got revved up, so did the rest of the team.
Camby scored eight points, came up with two two blocked shots and
created havoc for the Pacers as the Knicks made up their
first-quarter deficit and tied the score at halftime. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Camby was displaying the same zeal he has the entire series,
living up to the remarks of coach Larry Bird, who called him the
best player on the floor after Game 3. Although Dale Davis and
Antonio Davis combine to make a fearsome duo _ and combined for 16
first-half rebounds Wednesday night _ Camby did not flinch as he
took a dish from Chris Childs and exploded for a dunk over both
with 1:10 left in the half, tying the score. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you say about Marcus?'' Larry Johnson said. ``He's
been everywhere. He's not intimidated by anyone.''  &QL;

CITY TURNS BACK CLOCK FOR EDUCATIONAL `REVIVAL'

   LEXINGTON, Mo. _ Lexington folklore says that only four
townspeople voted for Abraham Lincoln for president, and two of
those four were run out of town. So Elizabeth Van Lew, a Southern
belle turned Union spy during the Civil War, would have had few
friends in a Lexington crowd.
</P>
<P>
   But this is 1999, and Lexington has welcomed Van Lew, Gen.
William Tecumseh Sherman, Sojourner Truth and other Union
sympathizers to town for a weeklong chautauqua with a Civil War
theme. The event runs through Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Heartland Chautauqua, produced by the humanities councils of
Missouri and Illinois, revives a tradition of traveling tent shows
that provided education and entertainment in small towns across
America around the turn of the century. At least four chautauquas
were held in the early 1900s in Lexington, before radio, television
and cinema made the shows obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chautauqua was a big social event, with everybody getting
together to eat picnic lunches and see the famous orators and
musicians,'' said Marilou Edwards, executive director of the
Lexington Tourism Bureau. ``I think people are getting that same
flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   The program has been six months in the making for Lexington, a
Lafayette County city about an hour's drive east of Kansas City.
The humanities councils provide the tent, the equipment and the
scholar-actors. Each of six host communities in Missouri and
Illinois does the rest.
</P>
<P>
   The Lexington Tourism Bureau spearheaded its community's
chautauqua, collecting cash and in-kind donations from
organizations and businesses in nearby Lexington, Richmond,
Higginsville, Grain Valley and Odessa. The tourism bureau booked
musical entertainment each evening and arranged for the performers
to put on daytime programs at schools, senior centers and
libraries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so easy to perform,'' said Alice McGill, a professional
storyteller who portrays freed slave Sojourner Truth. ``Once you
enter a community, because of all the work they have done, it feels
like there is already a bond, that they are eager to support you.''
</P>
<P>
   The town, whose battle site is part of Civil War history, has
taken on its part with vigor.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, almost 250 people helped raise a yellow and white
striped tent at the Battle of Lexington State Historic Site. The
Friends of the Anderson House, volunteers who perform
living-history demonstrations at the site, are appearing in period
dress each evening to hand out paper fans and sell programs. A
local resident donated the use of a chautauqua organ, made in 1887,
that she found in her attic.
</P>
<P>
   Only that kind of enthusiasm makes a chautauqua work, said
Barbara Gill, deputy director of the Missouri Humanities Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider it not a project that we are putting on but a
community project,'' Gill said. ``We are the facilitators, but they
are the folks who really are doing it. It's their chautauqua.''

IT'S NOW OR NEVER FOR WNBA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Twenty three years after the American Basketball
Association died, we're witnessing the resurrection of its spirit.
</P>
<P>
   It's a red, white and blue sun rising majestically in the June
sky.
</P>
<P>
   It's one former ABA team, the San Antonio Spurs, advancing to
the NBA Finals and another, the Indiana Pacers, two victories away
from turning the NBA's swank soiree into a rollicking ABA reunion.
</P>
<P>
   It's one former renegade league, the ABL, feeding the WNBA
enough extraordinary players to transform women's professional
basketball as we know it.
</P>
<P>
   It's awesome and a little eerie, the confluence of events that
basketball acolytes can see so clearly.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976 ABA founder Dennis Murphy's creation died in a hotel
conference room in Cape Cod, Mass. Four of the league's teams _ the
Spurs, Pacers, Denver Nuggets and New York Nets _ were absorbed
into the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Like the ABL some 20 years later, the ABA had terrific talent
but not nearly enough television exposure. Its teams were fashioned
to push the ball up the court, but the league, as constructed,
couldn't stand on its own.
</P>
<P>
   The ABA created a more exciting brand of basketball, then turned
the blueprint over to the NBA, which ran with it. Attendance during
the first season after the ABA-NBA merger reached an all-time high
and television ratings increased 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the influx of talent from the defunct ABL, the WNBA,
which begins its third season tonight, will be more fun to watch.
But how many more people will notice?
</P>
<P>
   That's the question rolling around in the stomachs of the NBA
suits backing the sister season. No less than the future of women's
professional basketball is riding on the league's balance sheets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every year is a crucial year for the WNBA,'' said
Cleveland Rockers coach Linda Hill-MacDonald. ``We certainly have
not gotten to the level that we want in terms of exposure and. . .
. I don't think the game is accepted at the level that's as far as
it can go.''
</P>
<P>
   No question the NBA has the machinery to exploit the women's
game. But does it have the patience and vision to develop it?
</P>
<P>
   The NBA didn't just fall into this monopoly. It stealthily
killed the ABL with the ol' back-door play, consistently beating
its overmatched rival to TV and product endorsements. It served its
own interests. Now we'll find out how serious it is about doing
what's best for the women's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty percent of businesses fold after Year Two. So we're
ahead of the curve,'' said Detroit Shock coach Nancy
Lieberman-Cline. ``We have to maintain our focus and put the league
first and not us individually.''
</P>
<P>
   The league is lucky that way. It is loaded with players who have
more game than ego. If anything, the players might be too
unpretentious for their own good.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Kara Wolters, one of the newest members of the two-time
defending champion Houston Comets. She broke her toe trying to load
her luggage for the trip to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't she know she's supposed to pay people to deal with her
baggage, be it Samsonite or psychological?
</P>
<P>
   Wolters is an ABL refugee playing on a team outside her native
Connecticut for the first time in her life. Nevertheless, she
should feel right at home. In the May draft, 20 of the first 25
picks were players from the little league that couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-ABLers Dawn Staley, Yolanda Griffith, DeLisha Milton and
Natalie Williams are the real deal. They'll make you remember their
names, same as Julius Erving, Moses Malone, Artis Gilmore and
Maurice Lucas did an entire generation of NBA fans.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. The NBA wasn't one starless night after another
before Magic and Larry and Michael leaped up into the sky. People's
perspective tends to get lost in the black hole of hype.
</P>
<P>
   So it is on the women's side. Some awfully good players preceded
Lisa Leslie, Rebecca Lobo and Chamique Holdsclaw. UCLA's Ann
Meyers, for one. USC's Cheryl Miller, for another.
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw, who led Tennessee to three NCAA titles in four years,
was the No. 1 overall draft pick of the Washington Mystics last
month. Coach Nancy Darsch hears people talk as though she's the
guardian of the game's greatest jewel, its Hope Diamond.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't know what to say, except that most peoples' memories
must be shorter than Utah Starzz point guard Debbie Black.
</P>
<P>
   Holdsclaw could one day develop into the player against whom all
others are judged. But right now, Mystics teammate Nikki McCray has
a prettier pull-up jumper.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've been around women's basketball for 20 years, she has
some pretty stiff competition,'' Darsch said of Holdsclaw. ``But if
you've been watching women's basketball for five or six years, then
I think you're very, very impressed with Chamique and you see her
as the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Holdsclaw has something Michael Jordan does not: a
college diploma. She graduated last month with a degree in
political science. In the world of women's basketball, that doesn't
make her noble, just normal.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977 Holdsclaw was born and the NBA arrived. Its finest
season was capped by a final featuring two teams, Portland and
Philadelphia, laden with former ABA players. Two years later, Magic
Johnson and Larry Bird and cable television would carry the NBA
into another stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows, maybe the melding of the ABL and WNBA will rocket the
women's game into orbit. All we can say is they better strap
themselves in tight because it's going to be a bumpy ride. &QL;

KANSAS WORKS TO HALT ILLEGAL SALES OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS OVER
INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN L. PETTERSON  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. _ Warning of potentially dangerous and frightening
consequences, Kansas Attorney General Carla Stovall on Wednesday
said she had filed lawsuits to stop illegal Internet sales of
prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's only a matter of time before somebody dies as a
result of taking medications that are prescriptions and//or
controlled substances obtained over the Internet,'' Stovall said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators for the attorney general and the Kansas Board of
Healing Arts used the Internet to buy such medications as Viagra,
used to counter impotency, and diet drugs Meridia and Phentermine.
</P>
<P>
   Those purchases, including several made by a minor under the
supervision of the attorney general's office, formed the basis for
the legal actions.
</P>
<P>
   Stovall, in conjunction with the Board of Healing Arts and the
Kansas State Board of Pharmacy, filed six lawsuits in Shawnee
County District Court to halt the Internet prescription sales.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general said she thought Kansas was the first state
to crack down on the Internet prescription business.
</P>
<P>
   At the National Association of Attorneys General in Washington,
spokesman Chris Privitt said he was aware of no other states that
were active in that area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a new concept to pursue this, and certainly Kansas
has been in a leadership role,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, Attorney General Jay Nixon's office has filed no
similar cases, but spokesman Scott Holste said, ``We're certainly
very interested in looking at these businesses that sell these
drugs through the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Stovall said there were at least ``a couple of hundred'' Web
sites where prescription drugs can be purchased without the buyer
being examined by a doctor licensed to practice in Kansas and
without obtaining a prescription.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many of these companies that we don't have the
resources to go after all of them now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Stovall said temporary restraining orders that direct a halt to
the practice had been signed by a judge.
</P>
<P>
   Named as defendants in the actions were seven companies selling
prescription-only medications, six doctors not licensed to practice
medicine in Kansas but who are prescribing the medications, four
individuals doing business under fictitious names and three
non-Kansas pharmacies that are dispensing the medications without
being registered in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   All of those named in the lawsuits were from out-of-state
locations such as Virginia, Florida, Washington, Hawaii, Nevada,
California and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Convictions under the state's consumer protection and pharmacy
laws carry penalties of $5,000 for each violation.
</P>
<P>
   One case was filed in February by the Board of Healing Arts, and
the rest were filed Monday and Wednesday by the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the companies sold prescription drugs to a minor, who
was acting under the direction of one of the attorney general's
agents.
</P>
<P>
   From one of them, the minor was able to buy the diet drug
Meridia, a controlled substance. Controlled substances are
addictive or have a high potential for abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Using his correct age and paying with his mother's credit card,
the minor also was able to purchase Viagra from two other
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should greatly alarm and be yet another enormous red flag
to parents regarding the importance of always monitoring their
children's Internet activity,'' Stovall said.

WOODS-DUVAL AN EXPENSIVE OUTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If you plan to traipse after those
ready-for-prime-time players Tiger Woods and David Duval as they
spend a pleasant summer evening going club head-to-club head to
determine the best darned golfer in the universe, be prepared for
some sticker shock.
</P>
<P>
   Woods and Duval, both wealthy young men, can afford tickets to
the $1.5 million ``Showdown at Sherwood,'' the made-for-TV event
being promoted by IMG, the athlete management company, with the
blessing of the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   So can Hollywood types, tycoons and the winner or winners of
Wednesday night's lotto jackpot, whether there was one or a bunch.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of us might have to draw down the savings account or
take out an equity line of credit.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for the Aug. 2 event, which will be shown live on ABC
beginning at 5 p.m., are expensive on the low end and out of sight
on the high side.
</P>
<P>
   For $225, you can buy a ticket and wander about one of the most
over-the-top golf courses in America, watch a little golf and dream
about what it's like to be really rich. Act fast, though, because
only 1,500 of these tickets are available.
</P>
<P>
   Got a little extra cash and an itch to hobnob with the rich and
maybe famous? Then spend $550 for one of the 200 regular clubhouse
passes being offered. This gets you into the event, the expansive
and stunning clubhouse, pre- and post- match parties and VIP
parking. Food is included in the price, but the booze isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Prepared to open that checkbook a little wider?
</P>
<P>
   Sherwood Country Club, in conjunction with Tickets.com, is
offering 50 special auction packages to the event. On four of them,
the bidding will start at $2,000. No telling how high it will go.
</P>
<P>
   And this could be a deal. Each package includes golf for two at
the course designed by Jack Nicklaus and home to Greg Norman's
annual Shark Shootout. Also included are two clubhouse tickets to
the match, VIP parking and a poster autographed by Duval and Woods.

   Home sweet home: El Caballero Country Club member Ron Cherney
got a different view of his home course this week. He caddied for
Las Vegas resident Brady Exber in Monday's 36-hole U.S. Open
qualifying tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is El Cab a tough course to play, it gives walkers a
good workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like a train ran me over. The pace of play was
relatively slow, but it was a ton of fun. I really enjoyed it,''
Cherney said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time he has toted a bag in an Open qualifier
at El Cab. And he was impressed with Exber, although he failed to
qualify for the Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a real good player, but he didn't have a great day. He
was a lot of fun to follow and he had a great attitude,'' Cherney
said of Exber.
</P>
<P>
   Players of that caliber also manage to put themselves into a
zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hit the ball a lot farther than the average club player,
that's for sure. And they are much more exacting and focus a little
bit better.And they try harder on each shot than the average club
player,'' Cherney said.
</P>
<P>
   Cherney has his own qualifier coming up. He's going to try to
for a spot in the U.S. Senior Open in a few weeks during a
tournament at Mountain Gate Country Club.

MILLER BREAKS FREE, BUT KNICKS HOLD FAST
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Before the between-game adjustments were made _
before Jeff Van Gundy went back to his film room and chalkboard for
Game 5 _ Reggie Miller made an analogy as to how difficult it is to
match up with his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the guys it's like an overflowing dam,'' Miller said
after his offensive ineptitude in Game 4. ``The water is getting to
the top, the dam is gonna burst. And when it does, there'll be a
flood.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller had just emerged from another lackluster individual
performance, the kind of 3-for-10 game that makes people inquire,
``What's wrong with Reggie?'' But the Pacers, this multipronged
offensive gadget that the Knicks are starting to figure out the
directions to, had forged out a victory on the strength of their
fourth through eighth offensive options.
</P>
<P>
   He needed to take over a game.
</P>
<P>
   Miller finally broke through Wednesday night, finding his range,
his points and his complete game. He went back to being the Reggie
New York Knows and Hates, the villainous character who complains
after each shot that he was not only fouled but also had all his
valuables stolen.
</P>
<P>
   Obnoxious. Insufferable. But so good. Yet he had so little help
in a game the Pacers had to have Wednesday night, a game that the
Knicks worked so hard to get back into and won, 101-94.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 4, Chris Mullin, Jalen Rose, Antonio Davis and Dale
Davis scored 63 of Indiana's 90 points. Van Gundy had to do
something, had to rely on some sort of energy mass to combat all
those Indiana weapons.
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday night Latrell Sprewell and Marcus Camby became
those players. Driving, dunking, doing all the intangibles to keep
the Knicks in this series, the two most-maligned players this
season responded to playoff pressure as if they were the hardened
playoff veterans.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller kept stepping up, the old man holding off the
youngsters with head fakes and runners and every imaginable flop
known to the game.
</P>
<P>
   He drew a foul and hit a double-clutch runner in the lane with 6
minutes 7 seconds left, converting a 3-point play to put Indiana on
top, 80-79 _ their last lead. He pulled them to within four on a
3-pointer with 2 minutes left, but again, he never received help.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Van Gundy was beginning to resemble a worried
engineer _ plugging one hole in a dike just as another starts to
leak.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a unique team,'' the Knicks coach said prior to Game
5. ``We were talking about it the other day. Not many NBA teams
have a very, very explosive offensive team where you have to guard
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so, you can't just say, `Miller, Smits or Miller, Smits,
Jackson or tonight we're going to concentrate on the perimeter,
because their post-up game will hurt you.' In the post. Behind the
3-point line. Keep them off the free-throw line.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy went on to say he wanted the Knicks to do a better job
of keeping the Pacers out of the middle, to cut off penetration
before it gets too deep.
</P>
<P>
   Smits began to establish himself without Patrick Ewing in the
lineup in Game 3, scoring 25 points, 15 straight during a binge in
the second quarter. But he wilted in the game's final minutes along
with Miller, and the Knicks went on to win on an improbable 4-point
play by Larry Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Smits' nor Miller's talents surfaced in Game 4, and yet
Rose had one of the most clutch games of his career. The Pacers'
sixth man made every important shot as the Knicks tried to crawl
out from a first-half hole they had dug themselves.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if Allan Houston, who guarded Rose for most of the
game, and Latrell Sprewell, assigned to check Mullin, had forgot
that the two Pacer swingmen were deadly left-handed shooters.
</P>
<P>
   There is a thought circulating around the league that San
Antonio's frontline and overall depth will be too strong for anyone
coming out of the Eastern Conference. Well-rested and clicking as
well as they have all season, the Spurs seem to have every
imaginable advantage headed into the league championship series.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they don't have the Pacers' multitude of offensive options,
diverse players with so many different skills. And it remains to be
seen if they have the heart of the Knicks, a group of players that
won't die.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about their five-game war with Miami. If the Knicks can
win on Friday or Sunday and get out of this round, they will have
dodged the most lethal bullet in pro basketball's post-season.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Duncan and David Robinson are awesome in their own right,
but the Spurs don't have the backcourt to match up with Sprewell
and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   After weathering a gauntlet in Indiana, San Antonio would be a
piece of cake.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
CHICAGO _ It's hard to decide which side of Chicago Jeff Bagwell
likes best.
<TEXT>
<P>
   North side or south side?
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, baseballs are flying in the Windy City.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell on Wednesday night posted his second three-home-run game
in Chicago this season, hitting his 18th, 19th and 20th of the year
in the Astros' 13-4 rout of the White Sox at Comiskey Park.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell had three home runs April 21 across town at Wrigley
Field. In five games this season in Chicago, Bagwell has six homers
and 14 RBIs. Wednesday's was Bagwell's 17th multiple-homer game and
the third three-homer game of his career.
</P>
<P>
   He became just the 12th major-leaguer with a pair of three-homer
games in a season.
</P>
<P>
   What surprised the power-hitting first baseman the most was that
his three long balls came after an 0-for-3 start at the plate that
included a fly to right, a strikeout looking and a pop-up in foul
territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home runs come in cycles,'' said Bagwell, who moved into a tie
with the Cubs' Sammy Sosa for the National League lead. ``I was
having a tough game. It's kind of funny to hit three home runs
after the start I had. I wouldn't have bet on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell sent the first pitch from reliever Sean Lowe over the
left-center-field wall for a three-run homer in the sixth. He hit a
full-count solo homer to left off Bill Simas in the eighth and a
two-run shot to left off Keith Foulke on an 0-1 pitch in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The six RBIs give him 58 for the season, tops in the NL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go in streaks when I hit home runs,'' Bagwell said. ``My
swing is kind of unorthodox. When it's off, I'm not hitting any
home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Bagwell hit three home runs against Los Angeles. The
last player to have two three-homer games in a season was Mark
McGwire last season.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a total of seven three-homer games in the majors
this year.

COMPANY WANTS TO MANAGE KEMPER ARENA, BARTLE HALL IN KANSAS CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GROMER JEFFERS JR.  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A Philadelphia company with ties to Mayor Kay
Barnes' chief campaign consultant is interested in managing the
city's convention and sports facilities, including Bartle Hall and
Kemper Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The company _ SMG _ manages about 40 facilities in the United
States and Europe, including the Louisiana Superdome, Soldier Field
in Chicago, the Spectrum in Philadelphia, Mile High Stadium in
Denver, and the Moscone Center in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Briglia, a vice president for SMG, said he had met with
several Kansas City Council members in recent months. Briglia said
he also plans to meet in coming weeks with Barnes, who has said she
favors studying the privatizing of facilities such as Kemper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very interested in coming to Kansas City and managing
Kemper Arena and Bartle Hall,'' Briglia said. ``We have met with
some of the elected officials and we hope to meet with the mayor
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Briglia said his company's efforts to manage Kansas City's
convention facilities were boosted by a poll prepared by Pat Gray,
the top political consultant for Barnes during her mayoral
campaign. The poll, done in 1997, gauged Kansas City residents'
feelings about privatizing convention facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave us a comfort level in which to meet with elected
officials,'' Briglia said. ``Unfortunately, the former
administration didn't embrace taking a look at this.''
</P>
<P>
   SMG is not the first company linked to Gray that has an interest
in managing a Kansas City department.
</P>
<P>
   On May 28, The Kansas City Star reported that Gray was working
for Environmental Management Corp., part of a consortium called
EA2//Systems, at the same time he was running Barnes' campaign.
EA2//Systems is interested in managing the Water Services
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Gray, whose involvement with Barnes' campaign and EA2//Systems
did not violate any laws, did not return telephone calls made to
his office Wednesday for comment about his work for SMG.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes was not available for comment Wednesday, said Joe
Serviss, her chief of staff. But Serviss said he did not think that
Barnes had met with SMG officials or that she had any plans to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   Serviss said Barnes also did not know about any relationship
that SMG had with Gray. ``We don't know about any contracts with
anybody locally,'' Serviss said.
</P>
<P>
   But Serviss noted that SMG, once known as Spectacor, has been
trying to manage Kansas City's convention center for years.
``Twenty-five years ago, I had Spectacor come to the city when I
was a councilman,'' Serviss said. ``It's like deja vu.''
</P>
<P>
   Briglia would not provide The Star with the poll data Gray had
generated, but he said most of those surveyed favored privatization
of the city's convention facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``They clearly feel that taxpayers should not heavily subsidize
these venues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Briglia said he had hired Gray _ who has built a reputation as
one of Kansas City's savviest and busiest political consultants _
only to do the poll _ not to put him in touch with elected
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We meet independently with city officials and elected
officials,'' Briglia said.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Evert Asjes, who said he had had conversations with
SMG regarding management of Kemper, said Wednesday he was not aware
that the company had at one time hired Gray.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them (SMG), when we're ready to go that way, we will
let them know,'' Asjes said. ``But there are four major management
companies interested. And they all go around looking for
business.'' Asjes said he could not recall specific names of the
other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Reports about Gray's ties to a St. Louis company that wants to
manage the Water Services Department raised a furor last week.
Angry city workers and some area ministers confronted Barnes and
demanded that she explain her relationship with Gray and
EA2//Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling their ire was a document outlining a plan for taking
over the operations of Water Services, obtained anonymously through
the mail by The Star. It included a strategy to elect a mayor and
council that favored privatization and a plan to discredit the
department so the public would support a private takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Gray has declined to comment on the document, saying it could
have been stolen or altered.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, who also has declined to comment on the document's
contents, said she had met twice with officials from EA2//Systems,
and one 45-minute meeting included Gray. But she said she had not
been influenced by Gray and had been an advocate of exploring
privatization for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Jim Rowland, however, said Wednesday that he hoped
future discussions about privatization could avoid politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat Gray is just an unfortunate sidebar to this whole thing,''
Rowland said. ``We need to seriously evaluate the delivery of
services. We can't afford to be distracted.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials in some cities that have contracted with SMG have seen
improvements in the management of convention facilities. For
example, SMG took over management of the 1.2 million-square-foot
Greater Columbus Convention Center in Columbus, Ohio, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Lalonde, a spokesman for the Greater Columbus Convention
and Visitors Bureau, said SMG had worked with his group to attract
more trade associations and conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Jennison, executive director of the public authority that
owns that convention center, said Wednesday that he had just signed
off on a two-year extension of SMG's original three-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've done an excellent job in managing our facilities,''
Jennison said. ``Their national presence in the marketplace gives
us some clout we didn't have as a stand-alone facility.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City's convention facilities and arenas have weathered
some highly publicized complaints in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   After Wal-Mart Stores Inc. held its 1997 manager's meetings at
Bartle, more than 10,000 delegates left town disappointed and
disgusted over dirty restrooms, poor lighting in meeting rooms and
other problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Wal-Mart complaints also were the last straw for the
then-director of city convention facilities, who was forced to
resign.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the city has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
on facelift work and infrastructure improvements at Bartle. Nearly
two dozen vacant maintenance jobs also were filled.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Wal-Mart's annual sessions for managers from its 2,300
stores worldwide are booked at Bartle through 2002, and the company
has options through 2005.
</P>
<P>
   In February, The Star reported that a key tenant _ the Kansas
City Blades hockey team _ and several patrons had complained that
the upkeep of Kemper Arena was unsatisfactory. Other problems,
brought to light during the Big 12 Conference men's basketball
tournament last season, involved a leaky roof.
</P>
<P>
   The city's director of convention and entertainment centers
promised corrective measures to clean up trash, fix deteriorating
stairs and remedy storage problems.

BUSINESS LEAVE ACT NEEDS CLARIFICATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Katherine Thorson missed at least four consecutive days
of work and went to the doctor twice. Diagnosis: small hiatal
hernia, mild antral gastritis and duodenitis.
</P>
<P>
   Were those minor medical ailments or serious health conditions?
</P>
<P>
   A doctor whose diagnostic expertise I respect says he wouldn't
classify those ailments as serious health conditions. But your
answer will help you decide if Thorson is making a mockery of the
Family and Medical Leave Act or if she deserves the law's
protection.
</P>
<P>
   The act, now nearly 6 years old, provides for unpaid leave to
help workers deal with their own or a close family member's
``serious health condition.'' That's the language of the law.
</P>
<P>
   A case summary says Thorson was fired from her job at Gemini
Inc. for absenteeism. She argued she was entitled to job protection
and leave under the act.
</P>
<P>
   The company, and several national human resource organizations,
contended she was not.
</P>
<P>
   A federal district court in Iowa said she was.
</P>
<P>
   The matter now is before the 8th U.S. Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   The good doctor points out that different people react to pain
and illness differently, so it's hard to legislate what's
``serious'' and what's not.
</P>
<P>
   Chalk the predicament up to another case of workplace
legislation creating minefields out of well-intentioned rose beds.
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious that the act needs much tinkering.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the interpretation-hungry law exempts more people
than it covers; most Americans don't work for companies that employ
50 or more at a single site, which is one criterion for coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the act's unpaid leave is a mixed prize. Many
workers can't forgo a paycheck, so the privilege is moot.
</P>
<P>
   The act has been a godsend to workers who otherwise would have
lost their jobs because of time spent dealing with their own or a
family member's medical problems. But its limitations _
particularly in small businesses _ are apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Several work//family organizations want Congress to expand the
act's coverage to companies with as few as 25 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Also, President Clinton suggested last month that states use
unemployment insurance to provide some replacement income for those
who take leaves under the act. Similarly, the National Partnership
for Women and Families today launches a ``Campaign for Family Leave
Income.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Society for Human Resource Management predicts
trouble if the Thorson decision stands. The society's
friend-of-the-court brief says:
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Court endorses this construction of `serious health
condition,' it will tell employers that in every situation where an
employee has an illness _ from a cold to cancer _ or (undergoes)
tests for an illness _ whether ultimately present or not _ the
employer has to invoke the FMLA.''
</P>
<P>
   The human resource society says its corporate members already
are wrestling with the vague ``serious health condition''
definition and don't know when to advise employees to take leave
under the act.
</P>
<P>
   Left untouched, the Thorson decision will only deepen confusion.

POLICE LAUNCH CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION OF WRESTLER'S DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE VENDEL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Police now are conducting a criminal
investigation into the death of professional wrestler Owen Hart
because they wonder if the equipment he was using was appropriate
for the stunt.
</P>
<P>
   Hart, 34, died at a World Wrestling Federation show May 23 at
Kemper Arena. He was preparing to descend into the ring when a
quick release mechanism on the back of a harness he was wearing
opened prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   Hart dropped 78 feet to the ring below. Police initially said
the drop was about 90 feet but have since revised their estimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``In looking at the rigging, I have a concern whether this was
the safest way to do this stunt,'' Police Maj. Gregory Mills said
of the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said detectives will try to answer several questions in
the criminal investigation, including:
</P>
<P>
   - Was the equipment right for the stunt?
</P>
<P>
   - If so, was it being used in the right way?
</P>
<P>
   - And was Owen Hart properly trained to use the equipment?
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be seeking expert advice to help us draw some
conclusions,'' Mills said. ``We can't say if it was right or wrong
or if due caution was taken. What we do know is that in attempting
to do that stunt, Owen Hart died.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills said the investigation is not focused on a particular
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investigation at this point is focused on a particular set
of circumstances and we have to figure out who was involved in
those circumstances,'' Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   If someone is charged in the case, the charge likely would be
involuntary manslaughter, which involves reckless conduct that
causes a person's death, police said. Prosecutors would have to
prove the defendant disregarded a substantial risk and deviated
from what a reasonable person would do under similar circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The charge carries a maximum prison sentence of seven years,
said Jackson County Assistant Prosecutor Michael Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Hart's family did not want to be contacted, said family attorney
Gary C. Robb.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hart family is following with interest this ongoing
criminal investigation,'' he said. ``We are proceeding with our own
investigation into a civil wrongful death lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   No civil lawsuit has been filed.
</P>
<P>
   The stunt that led to Hart's death was intended to slowly lower
Hart by rope into the wrestling ring from a catwalk just below the
ceiling at Kemper Arena. Once in the ring, Hart was supposed to
trigger a quick release mechanism that would detach him from the
rope.
</P>
<P>
   Three workers were on the catwalk with Hart before the stunt:
two stagehands from the Kansas City area and a rigger from Florida,
all hired by the wrestling federation.
</P>
<P>
   The rigger told police he connected a ring on Hart's vest to a
snap hook, and connected the snap hook to a ring on the end of the
rope. Then Hart stepped off the catwalk, putting his full weight
onto the rope. The rigger lowered Hart until Hart's head was about
even with the rigger's knees.
</P>
<P>
   The rigger told police he saw Hart adjusting his vest and ``Blue
Blazer'' costume as he dangled in midair, waiting for music to cue
his descent. Then, the rigger said, he heard the distinctive
``snap'' that the quick release mechanism makes when it opens. The
rigger peered over the catwalk and saw that Hart had landed in the
ring below.
</P>
<P>
   Experts at the Kansas City Crime Lab told Mills that Hart
plunged into the wrestling ring at a speed of 50 mph. The impact
ruptured Hart's aorta, causing him to bleed to death internally.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not pushed and the equipment that was to lower him to
the floor does not appear to have been tampered with,'' Mills said.
``We know someone else did not pull the ring to trigger the quick
release.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened while Owen Hart was hanging there. He was the only
one there when it happened. His fall had nothing to do with an
overt act by someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the wrestling federation did not return telephone
calls Wednesday. The rigger who oversaw Hart's stunt could not be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Woulard, a professional stunt man who lives in the Los
Angeles area, said the stunt Hart was attempting was not unusual.
He said, however, that when he performs similar stunts, he uses a
secondary rope as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
   ``You release the secondary rope just before they say, `Action,'
'' said Woulard, who is a member of the International Stunt
Association. ``Then you release the primary line when you're ready
to detach from the rope.''
</P>
<P>
   Woulard said being suspended by a vest and rope is cramped,
which is another reason to have a secondary rope.
</P>
<P>
   ``People get restless,'' he said. ``Why take chances?''
</P>
<P>
   Another stunt man, Henry Kingi Jr., who lives in the Los Angeles
area, said when he has performed similar stunts, he waited until
the last minute to put his full weight on the rope.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few minutes in the harness is uncomfortable,'' he said. ``It
can cut the blood supply off to your legs if you're there too
long.''
</P>
<P>
   Woulard and Kingi said the performer's weight is a factor in
what kind of equipment to use. Heavier performers need stronger
quick release mechanisms. Hart weighed about 230 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Both men said it was not unusual to have the quick release
triggered by a single motion. Kingi, however, said there are
different kinds of release mechanisms available.
</P>
<P>
   Hart was using a tear-dropped shape mechanism that opened like
handcuffs. Kingi said he prefers a three-ring mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the 3-ring, if you pulled the trigger out an inch, you
wouldn't go anywhere,'' Kingi said. ``You'd have to completely pull
it out for the rope to detach.''

was incorrectly described May 29 in a Kansas City Star article as
450,000 gallons and possibly the worst pipeline incident in state

the pipeline operated by Kaneb Pipe Line Co. almost 50,000 gallons
of gasoline flowed out. While state officials consider it a
significant spill, others in Kansas have been larger.

JOHNSON PATIENT WITH HUNDLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Texas Rangers stole six bases Tuesday night
against the Dodgers and catcher Todd Hundley felt the brunt of it.
He heard the boos, and in comparison to New York . . . they're
still pretty darn loud.
</P>
<P>
   But Dodgers manager Davey Johnson says he's content to wait for
Hundley to get better, targeting the other side of the All-Star
break as when his catcher will begin to play as management
expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The play behind the plate will get better,'' said Hundley, who
didn't start Wednesday against the Texas Rangers. ``I'll be the
first one to say it's been tough. I haven't produced like I should,
like I need to. I'll also be the first to tell you no one is more
frustrated and trying harder than I am. I have to be patient and
that's not one of my better traits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick to the game is how you deal with failure. It's a
failure game.''
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, Hundley is dealing with it the way you'd
hope _ by working hard.
</P>
<P>
   However, as big a crutch as his .224 average is, the bigger
problem appears to be how much teams are running on him.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson says that's unfair, and the blame should fall more on
the pitchers for not holding runners on base.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Rangers) had walking leads,'' Johnson said. ``By and
large, you steal off the pitcher. The only guy I know that might
have got three of the six is on the other team (Ivan Rodriguez),
but he's so good. He's the best I've seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking more to the second half of the season with
(Hundley) in all areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a statistically oriented man, need look no further than
the stat sheet to make his case for catchers. By all accounts,
Dodgers rookie catcher Angel Pena is one of the best young
defensive catchers in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Pena entered the series finale against Texas throwing out 2 of
15 (13 percent) would-be base stealers. But before being sent to
Triple-A Albuquerque, Paul LoDuca threw out three of seven.
</P>
<P>
   And one of the first things recently appointed pitching coach
Claude Osteen was asked to do was work on the pitchers in
quickening their deliveries home.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bazooka back there couldn't throw some of those guys out,''
Hundley said in regard to the Rangers' six stolen bases. ``It's a
matter of timing and everything coming together; pitchers holding
runners on, changing their times to home and making the throws to
second.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth pushed back: Dodgers outfielder Todd Hollandsworth
said he got a little ahead of himself in telling Johnson he could
be ready by the weekend. After working out before Tuesday's game,
Hollandsworth said he realized a more realistic return would be
Tuesday against Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a little more than I thought, just a couple
of days.'' said Hollandsworth, on the disabled list with a torn
muscle on his right side. ``I have to be reasonable about it. It's
not all there yet. I have to make sure when I don't have a perfect
swing that I'm not going to hurt it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he might use injured center fielder Devon White
(groin strain) as a designated hitter during the three-game series
in Oakland this weekend, which also means the Dodgers will continue
with three healthy outfielders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not bothering him hitting,'' Johnson said. ``I have my
fingers crossed he could hit by the weekend. Maybe DH or something.
. . . I'm learning day-to-day means eight to 10 days.''
</P>
<P>
   Elite company: Texas right fielder Juan Gonzalez entered the
series finale with the Dodgers with 999 RBI in 1,154 career games.
Only six players in major-league history reached 1,000 RBI in their
first 1,200 games, and Gonzalez was one RBI away from being the
sixth fastest to hit that mark.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Greenberg was the quickest, driving in his 1,000th run in
his 1,026th game. He's followed by Lou Gehrig (1,079), Joe DiMaggio
(1,081), Al Simmons (1,081), Ted Williams (1,146) and Jimmie Foxx
(1,158).
</P>
<P>
   F.Y.I.: Dave Hansen started at third base in place of Adrian
Beltre. Johnson said he did it to keep Hansen sharp and make sure
Beltre wasn't tiring. . . . Three-year-old Rex Spjute (Meridian,
Idaho) sang the national anthem before the game.

POLICE DEPARTMENT'S HANDLING OF EX-WORKER'S THREAT CRITICIZED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TRACY JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRKLAND, Wash. _ Death threats allegedly made by a former
Kirkland, Wash., police employee have prompted questions about the
way the department handled the situation.
</P>
<P>
   In early May, police support officer Delano Dumo allegedly
called a colleague and said he wanted to put a gun to the back of
his training officer's head and pull the trigger, and that he
``should pull a Columbine'' at work, said Sean Riley, president of
the Kirkland Police Officers' Guild.
</P>
<P>
   Dumo, 27, resigned days later, and has since written a letter of
apology to the department, police Chief Pleas Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Green said his department took the alleged threat seriously and
ordered an armed officer to shadow the training officer while Dumo
was under investigation. The department determined Dumo's remarks
were offhand and lacked any criminal intent, and the matter was
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   But Riley said many department employees fault the department's
handling of the incident, which prompted few changes in security
and resulted in no written report.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people were afraid for their safety,'' Riley said.
``There's no doubt in my mind a crime was committed. ... Police
officers on the street are required to take those kind of
reports.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They tried to make it go away without doing anything formal,''
said officer Mike Murray, a member of the union's executive board.
</P>
<P>
   Training officer Bob Balkema, the man targeted by the alleged
threats, said he initially was concerned and now wished the matter
would go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``They probably did some investigating, but I don't believe it
was a thorough investigation, and I don't believe it was what they
would expect their officers to do,'' Balkema said.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo dated May 7, Riley asked Green to respond to the
questions and concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Among the questions: why wasn't a report taken? Why no
internal-affairs investigation? Why weren't others notified about
the threat? Why didn't the department change the codes on locks at
the department's offices after Dumo's resignation?
</P>
<P>
   Green said no report was taken because no crime was committed,
and an internal affairs investigation would not apply to someone
who had already resigned. A card-key entry system is planned to
limit access, he said, and personnel privacy concerns limited what
staff could be told.
</P>
<P>
   Green said Capt. Joe Simon last month sent all staffers an
e-mail explaining the incident had been investigated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was determined that, the statements were made in an attempt
at jest, and out of frustration,'' Simon wrote, adding that the
employee was embarrassed and had apologized.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Simon said the officer who received Dumo's alleged
threatening call took it as a joke. Another city employee reported
the call after hearing about it.
</P>
<P>
   Dumo could not be reached for comment Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Though both Green's memo and Simon's e-mail encouraged those
with concerns to come forward, no one did, Simon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone is trying to make an issue out of a non-issue,'' Simon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Simon said department administration did not learn of the
threats _ alleged to have happened over a weekend _ for a few days,
after Dumo had already quit.
</P>
<P>
   Dumo was hired to work at the city Jail in October and was under
a one-year probation period. He ``was not meeting the performance
requirements of the job'' and knew it, Simon said.
</P>
<P>
   As support staff and not sworn officers, neither Dumo nor
Balkema carried guns on the job.

NORTHRIDGE AD HIRING CHALLENGED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Saying former Cal State Northridge president
Blenda Wilson disregarded the recommendations of diverse campus
entities, several university advisory board members announced
Wednesday they are requesting the recent appointment of Dick Dull
as the school's new athletic director be overturned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision deserves investigation and it deserves
reconsideration,'' said Lee Alpert, a board member who supported
Robert Arias as the new athletic director. ``President Wilson's
appointment of Dick Dull, with the choice of Bobby Arias still out
there, simply flies in the face of logic.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven people spoke at the press conference, which drew 18
people, all of whom are Arias supporters. Some made references to
Dull's background and the fact Dull resigned as athletic director
at Maryland in 1986 in the wake of the Len Bias cocaine death
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The formal request, which is addressed to Governor Gray Davis,
Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, D-Los Angeles and CSU
Chancellor Charles Reed, also claimed there was a
``misrepresentation'' by Dull to ``the San Fernando Valley
community about his experience at the University of Nebraska (He
was actually at Nebraska-Kearny).''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Dull never represented himself to anyone at CSUN as
being the athletic director at the University of Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   Alpert said Wilson's choice of Dull went against the
recommendation from the athletic director search committee and
CSUN's head coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I know,'' Alpert said, ``it was unanimous. I would
assume that included the two coaches (on the committee).''
</P>
<P>
   A member of the search committee, who wished to remain
anonymous, said that is not true.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't allowed to select anybody,'' said the committee
member. ``We were commissioned to select four people to recommend
to president Wilson.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Jankovich, CSUN's interim athletic director who will
relinquish his duties when Dull takes over July 1, confirmed there
was not a unanimous vote of the coaching staff or the search
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Jankovich also said he disagreed with Arias' supporters holding
a press conference to decry the selection of Dull.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's proper,'' he said.

KOSOVAR REFUGEES IN AREA HAVE LITTLE FAITH IN YUGOSLAV GUARANTEES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY STEVE CARNEY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They've seen some of the best Los Angeles has to
offer _ thrill rides, fresh salads, Pacific surf and sand _ but
many Kosovar refugees in the Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley say
they just want to go home.
</P>
<P>
   Still, news of the peace agreement did little to convince them
they will be leaving any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe it's really going to happen,'' said Hisman
Vlashi, 59. ``I don't trust the Serbian government. We did have
autonomy and they took it away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   News of the peace accord came as the group of 30 _ all relations
of Hajrush and Renee Vlashi of West Hills _ spent Tuesday as guests
of Universal Studios.
</P>
<P>
   They said Yugoslav soldiers near their border town threatened
the ethnic Albanian children by making slicing gestures across
their throats. Then, the soldiers laid mines and forced the
townspeople to abandon their homes March 25.
</P>
<P>
   The Vlashis came to Los Angeles in May with the help of the
Valley Jewish Federation, which secured host families for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I have, I left behind. I brought only the clothes I
was wearing,'' Hisman Vlashi said. He even left behind a son,
fighting in the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   He yearns to go home but thinks he'll keep his youngest son,
10-year-old Ahmet, in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can we offer him over there but hardship, working the
land or construction? Here he can get an education,'' said Hisman.
</P>
<P>
   And in spite of her relatives' pledges to return to their
village, Renee Vlashi said she thinks many will remain here.
``Their village is gone, and that's what they want back.''
</P>
<P>
   For their day at the park, though, the group set aside their
turmoil and surrendered to the pleasures of American pop culture.
</P>
<P>
   They laughed and gasped while the Back to the Future ride
bounced and buffeted them in its ersatz DeLoreans _ the children
had seen the movies before, in Macedonia. They thrilled to the
floods, explosions, earthquake, shark and gorilla attacks during
the studio tour. And they joked about turning into goats while
munching on a fresh salad at lunch _ far different from their usual
fare of beans, bread and meat pies.
</P>
<P>
   Coming to Southern California wasn't a dream come true for
16-year-old Bekim Vlashi, 16. He never even imagined it was
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it. I love the people. I feel free and not threatened
by anybody,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he won't stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if you're in heaven, you cannot match anything in the
world to your native town, your birthplace,'' he said. ``As soon as
the border is open and there is peace and freedom, I'll be on a
plane to go back there.''

EXPLORER POSTS INTRODUCE OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK DAVIS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ High school freshman David Ralls learned what
it takes to build a bridge _ a real bridge _ over a creek.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Bruce, a junior, tried her hand at landscape design. Later
this month, volunteers probably will put some of her ideas to work
in the courtyard of the Mattie Rhodes Art Center.
</P>
<P>
   Both students took part in Explorer Post 2967, led by Darren
Nielson, an architect at HNTB Architects Engineers Planners in
Kansas City. More than 5,000 students are wrapping up similar work
through 126 Explorer posts from Lawrence, Kan., to Warrensburg, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Exploring, which is a part of Boy Scouts of America's Learning
for Life, brings together students and businesses throughout the
school year. Two or more times a month, the students work with
advisers who are artists, bankers, lawyers, doctors, police,
dentists, firefighters, computer designers and the like.
</P>
<P>
   The idea isn't just to get work-space and landscape designs for
Mattie Rhodes, or plans for a bridge over the creek at Osage Oaks
Arena near Buckner. Exploring helps these kids plan their careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made it more realistic,'' said Bruce, 17, who is now even
more convinced she wants to be an architect. ``This is all
hands-on. This is what we wanted to do. All Darren did is he helped
us make it real.''
</P>
<P>
   She definitely plans a return to HNTB's Explorer post when it
starts up again in September.
</P>
<P>
   Ralls, 15, found that maybe he would rather be an engineer than
an architect. Next school year, he might try a different Explorer
post. But he sees potential from his work at HNTB.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might be interested in getting a job there. Then, having
this Explorer post thing would be good on my record,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   About 65 students in Post 2967 worked on three separate
architectural projects at HNTB. They were to present their designs
Wednesday evening to officials of HNTB, Mattie Rhodes, Osage Oaks
Arena and a local chapter of the American Society of Landscape
Architects. The society tapped the post for plans to rehabilitate
and redesign Observation Park in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited. I want to see the work these students have
done,'' said Mary Lou Jaramillo, executive director at Mattie
Rhodes, which provides counseling services and art programs for
children.
</P>
<P>
   Jaramillo got a preview of the students' ideas in March when
they presented three preliminary plans. Jaramillo said she and two
board members steered the students away from one of the plans and
pointed out parts of the two others they liked best.
</P>
<P>
   They particularly liked the notion of moving the art center's
entrance to the side of the building, through the courtyard. It's
not something they thought of themselves, Jaramillo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so used to coming in that darn front door. It's so
narrow there's no place to greet people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce said a side entrance would bring visitors into an open
area where Mattie Rhodes' kids could display their work, as well as
hang their coats and backpacks. The students' plan also would move
the work station that was crowding the area by the side door.
</P>
<P>
   Exploring is more than 50 years old and first included girls in
1968, said Erik Lingren, who oversees the program for the Boy
Scouts of America Heart of America Council in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   He said 5,100 students were in the council's posts at the end of
1998, up 12 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Exploring is open to any boy or girl ages 15 to 20. A
14-year-old who has completed the eighth grade also can join.
Explorers needn't have been involved in Boy Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   Lingren said the students paid between $7 and $9 for the
school-year-based program. Companies that sponsor posts donate
their employees' time, the meeting space and materials.
</P>
<P>
   Most students find out about Exploring at school. Lingren said
many area schools allowed Exploring to survey students about their
career interests. This information is forwarded to companies that
want to start an Explorer program.
</P>
<P>
   So, armed for a storm of curiosity, HNTB mailed invitations last
year to about 1,200 area students who had listed architecture
career interests, Nielson said. He said 225 showed up at the first
meeting and 90 paid the fee to participate. Competition from sports
and other activities ultimately winnowed the group to 65, he said.

POLICE SEEK PUBLIC'S HELP IN GETTING CLUES TO TRIPLE SLAYING

<P>
   SEATTLE _ As they sifted through the crime scene for clues,
Seattle homicide detectives on Wednesday said they had eliminated
several family members as suspects in the slaying of a woman, her
daughter and grandaughter.
</P>
<P>
   But after 24 hours on the case, police said they had exhausted
all ``obvious leads'' and asked the public for help in the shooting
deaths of Patricia Whitfield, a 50-year-old day care owner; her
daughter, Artis ``Tizi'' Ingram, 24; and Ingram's daughter,
Champagne Younger, 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really have not narrowed the focus of the investigation,''
said homicide Sgt. Cynthia Tallman. ``We're absolutely dependent
upon the community to provide us with any information, no matter
how small or unimportant it may seem to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The three victims were found Tuesday afternoon inside Whifield's
home in Seattle's Mount Baker neighborhood. Whitfield had operated
a day care center at the four-bedroom residence.
</P>
<P>
   Two possible supects emerged early in the investigation, but
quickly were dismissed. Police ruled out the father of Ingram's two
youngest children, a week-old baby and an 11-month-old baby, who
were in the house during the slaying, but were unharmed. Neighbors
said the boyfriend had been feuding with the family, but he was in
jail on a domestic-violence incident at the time of the slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Also ruled out was Ingram's ex-boyfriend and father of
Champagne, whose alibi checked out; he was with relatives,
detectives said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives also interviewed Whitfield's ex-husband, with whom
she had a history of domestic violence and had divorced in 1995.
After detectives interviewed him, they decided he was not their
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``By midnight (Tuesday), we exhausted all the obvious leads,''
said detective Steve Kilburg, who was at work at the crime scene
Wednesday. While his partner, Kevin O'Keefe, brought out sheets,
blankets and other evidence from the house, Kilburg estimated they
had spent at least 20 hours on the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're asking friends and family for any bits of information,
any leads that would help,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield's death shocked many in her close-knit community,
where she ran a day care operation in her home and was known as
``the neighborhood mom.'' Police say one of her sons hysterically
called 911 Tuesday afternoon, after finding his mother, sister and
niece dead from multiple gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives say there were no signs of forced entry, robbery or a
struggle, and that they found no evidence that points to a specific
motive. Police believe the intended target was Ingram, who had been
known to associate with gangs through one of her boyfriends, a
source said last night. But it was not clear that the slayings were
gang-related.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, neighbors were still grieving as they watched two of
Whitfield's sons enter their mother's house and come out with
diapers and clothes for a funeral Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why God would take her away,'' Arnell Wilkerson
said of Whitfield. ``It's very hard for me to believe she's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a more troubled portrait of the victims emerged
through court records and school officials.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Whitfield filed for divorce from her husband of 24
years, citing a history of domestic abuse. In 1986, she said she
shot her husband in self-defense. In 1994, Whitfield entered an
Alford plea to a charge of attempted malicious harassment, which
was later dismissed. Prosecutors accused her and a companion of
harassing an interracial couple in the Central District, according
to court records.
</P>
<P>
   The couple wasn't assaulted, but police were called.
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield's daughter, Tizi, also had problems. She moved
frequently this year, and at one point lived in a shelter while her
daughter, Champagne, attended a school program in Everett for
homeless children. Champagne, a kindergartner, also attended John
Muir Elementary, near Whitfield's home, for about a month earlier
this year, but then transferred to Jackson Elementary in Everett
and later to Skyline Elementary in Lake Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   But over the years, friends said, Whitfield worked hard to
overcome her struggles, working several jobs while rearing her
family. She loved her children and took them on trips, including
one to Louisiana so that they could be exposed to black
universities, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was just a pillar of strength to everyone,'' said friend
Beulah Brooks. ``I have never known her to say `no' to anyone who
asked her for anything. She was a wonderful, generous,
inspirational person.''

TARZAN FANS TO SWING BY FOR CONVENTION

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Practice that yell.
</P>
<P>
   Drawn from as far afield as England and France, about 150 fans
of Tarzan creator Edgar Rice Burroughs will converge on Woodland
Hills today for the start of a three-day convention.
</P>
<P>
   They will discuss the ape man hero's many incarnations, shop for
rare Tarzan paraphernalia and watch _ a week before the rest of the
world _ Disney's new animated Tarzan movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time in convention history that we've all
attended a Tarzan movie together, much less one that hasn't come
out yet,'' said organizer Scott Tracy Griffin.
</P>
<P>
   The convention, called a ``Dum Dum'' after a ceremonial
gathering of apes in the Tarzan stories, will be held at the Warner
Center Marriott in the Woodland Hills community of Los Angeles' San
Fernando Valley and will be open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Those who merely wish to sit in on some of the discussions or
browse the merchandise room can do so for free. Full admission,
which includes the movie preview and a Saturday banquet, costs $70.
</P>
<P>
   Burroughs bought 550 acres of property in the San Fernando
Valley in 1919, dubbing it Tarzana Ranch, a name that stuck when
the land was developed with homes years later.

ANGELS AVOID A GIANT SWEEP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Considering how things have gone for the Angels
lately, they must have thought Wednesday was Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did they learn that shortstop Gary DiSarcina has been
cleared to begin a rehab assignment today and could be back within
two weeks, the Angels also actually won a game, avoiding a sweep by
beating the San Francisco Giants 2-1 before 17,516 at 3Com Park.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina will play at Single-A Lake Elsinore today through the
weekend before going to Erie, Pa., on Monday to play for the team's
Double-A affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news for the Angels on Wednesday was their offense still
isn't hitting. They scored just two runs in each of the three games
of the series against the Giants, but this time Angels starting
pitcher Tim Belcher held the Giants to one run in eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher (4-5) was pitching on three days rest and coming off
Saturday's fight with the Dodgers' Chan Ho Park. But he cut back on
his workouts between starts and it made him stronger for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, I was sore after that game at Dodger Stadium,'' said
Belcher, who threw 117 pitches and lowered his ERA to 6.57, the
lowest it has been all season. ``Getting stuck on the bottom of the
pile like that is more tiring than making 300 pitches. There's such
an adrenaline rush and an emotional rush, it can zap your
strength.''
</P>
<P>
   He must have looked strong to the Giants, who scored their only
run on Jeff Kent's RBI double in the first inning. Barry Bonds
returned to the lineup for the first time since arm surgery April
20 and went 0 for 4, with three of his at-bats against Belcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Belcher gave me problems when I was in Pittsburgh, so this is
nothing new,'' said Bonds, who is 6 for 42 vs. Belcher in his
career. ``I'm just happy to do what I do best and I just hope it
doesn't take too long before I help this ballclub. Right now I feel
like a third wheel out there. I've been away so long it takes time
to build that bond with your team.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher said Saturday's fight didn't provide any extra
motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The fight was) just the motivation to get back out there and
prove to the manager and the team that I'm all right,'' Belcher
said. ``Because I had pitched three or four pretty good games, then
gave up a grand slam and gave up a lead (against the Dodgers). I
wanted to get back out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels offense, such as it was, was provided by Jeff Huson's
RBI single in the fourth inning and Mo Vaughn's RBI single in the
fifth. Both came off losing pitcher Chris Brock (5-5). Vaughn was
lifted for a pinch runner after the single because of a stiff left
ankle, but he is expected to be back in the DH spot Friday in
Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn has struggled lately along with the rest of the offense,
and said it's got to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``In games we've lost we've given up the lead,'' he said. ``We
all know four runs is not enough to win in the American League.
When we get teams down, we've got to crush them. Our pitchers have
done a good job. But we've got to put teams away when the
opportunity's there. That's what good teams do.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for the Angels, they had Belcher and closer Troy
Percival, who pitched a 1-2-3 ninth inning for his 17th save.
</P>
<P>
   Percival has been almost unhittable since having the worst
performance of his career on May 1 against the White Sox. In that
one, he gave up five runs in two-thirds of an inning in an 8-5
loss. Since then, he has pitched 141/3 scoreless innings in 15
games, recording 13 saves and allowing only one hit.
</P>
<P>
   A big play in Wednesday's game came in the third inning when,
with one out and a runner at first, Bill Mueller singled to right
field. Marvin Benard went from first to third on the play, and the
throw in from the outfield was cut off by Huson at shortstop. Huson
threw to Vaughn at first to catch Mueller rounding the base too far
for the second out of the inning with Bonds coming up.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds rolled out to the pitcher to end the threat.

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
CHICAGO _ The Chicago White Sox may have been exactly the right
prescription to cure the ailing Astros.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not to mention a dose of Jeff Bagwell.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell continued his Windy City mastery Wednesday night,
belting three home runs and driving in six runs as the Astros tied
a club record by homering five times in rolling to a 13-4 victory
over Chicago at Comiskey Park.
</P>
<P>
   After being swept by Pittsburgh to begin a season-longest
12-game road trip, the Astros took two of three in each of the next
three series to finish the trip 6-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``This made things satisfying,'' manager Larry Dierker said
after his club pounded 17 hits for the second time in three nights.
``I don't think any of us thought this trip would be easy with so
many guys out of the lineup. I was hoping it wouldn't be
disastrous. After the start we had, it could have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it finished on a memorable note as Bagwell produced his
second three-homer game of the season. Coincidentally, his other
one came just down the road when he homered three times April 21 at
Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell, who has 17 multiple-homer games in his career, has six
home runs and 14 RBIs in five games this season in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice coincidence,'' said Bagwell. ``My home runs come
in bunches. I was having a tough game early. It's kind of funny
after coming back and hitting three home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox weren't in a laughing mood.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell's feats were the exclamation point on a three-game
series that saw the Astros turn things around offensively. They
batted .358, scored 24 runs and had 43 hits and six home runs
against the White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros have double-digit hit totals in four of their last
six games.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bell went 4-for-6 Wednesday, Carl Everett homered for the
second time in as many days and had three RBIs, and Tim Bogar
snapped a yearlong homer drought.
</P>
<P>
   Eight Astros had hits, six with two or more.
</P>
<P>
   The five-homer game tied the club record accomplished five times
previously, the last on Aug. 22, 1996, against Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it was a matter of time with this club,'' third
baseman Bill Spiers said. ``We always go through little spells
during the season. I think we came out of it good, and hopefully
we'll keep it going.''
</P>
<P>
   The offense overshadowed a strong pitching performance by Mike
Hampton (7-2), who gave up one earned run and seven hits in 6
innings. He struck out six and walked three.
</P>
<P>
   After going 1-1 in his first four starts, Hampton is 6-1 with a
2.48 ERA since April 29.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros actually had this one well in hand before Bagwell
chipped in, building a 4-0 lead in the first three innings.
</P>
<P>
   After an 0-for-3 start, Bagwell hit a three-run homer in the
sixth inning, a solo shot in the eighth and a two-run drive in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a legitimate power hitter,'' White Sox manager Jerry
Manuel said. ``His style is a little different, but once he gets it
going he is one of the dominant hitters in the National League.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros sent eight batters to the plate in the first inning
to take a 2-0 lead. Craig Biggio and Spiers lead off with
consecutive singles, and Bell delivered an RBI single. Everett's
grounder to first base scored Spiers.
</P>
<P>
   Bell hit the second of his four singles to start the third
inning, and Everett followed by sending a pitch from James Baldwin
over the fence in straightaway center field.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin (3-5) allowed seven runs and nine hits in 5 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago scored an unearned run in the fourth when Astros catcher
Tony Eusebio overthrew Spiers at third while attempting to throw
out Magglio Ordonez.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros put the game out of reach with a four-run sixth.
Bogar snapped a 275-at-bat homerless streak with a solo shot to
right. It was Bogar's first homer since April 16, 1998, against
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes me 275 at-bats to regenerate my power,'' Bogar said.
``Don't expect to see another home run for another 275 at-bats.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, after a Biggio walk and a single by Spiers, Bagwell
unloaded a three-run shot to left off reliever Sean Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was positive to get the last two series,'' Bogar
said. ``Ending 6-6, I don't think this team is happy with that, but
we'll take it.''

SPARKS NEED A FAST START
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAMELA LEWIS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Sparks are eager to show they're an improved
team with the addition of two Yugoslavian national team players and
a defense designed by assistant coach and former Laker Michael
Cooper. They get their chance tonight when they open their third
WNBA season against Sacramento at 7:30 at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks released three players Wednesday to reach the
11-player limit. Gone are guard Katrina Colleton, a two-year Sparks
veteran; Eugenia Rycraw, who joined the team last year and center
Tiffani Johnson. Guard Jamila Wideman (knee) and forward-center
Sandra VanEmbriqcs (hamstring) were placed on the injured reserve
list.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality of professional sports is you have to deal with
the cards that are dealt you, and right now the people that are in
(the locker) room, including the people that are coming, we feel
are our best shot to have a very successful team,'' said Sparks
head coach Orlando Woolridge.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavian point guard Gordana Grubin was scheduled to arrive
in Los Angeles on Wednesday night and is expected to make an
immediate impact. Woolridge said she could play against the
Monarchs tonight. It's unlikely 6-foot-6 Nina Bjedov, who is
arriving this afternoon, will play.
</P>
<P>
   Both were competing for their national team at the European
Championships, which concluded Sunday. Woolridge expects it will
take about a week before the pair is integrated into the team's
game plan.
</P>
<P>
   As for the remaining nine active players, Woolridge said the
team is ready to start the season. ``I feel good about where we're
at,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks were a disappointing 12-18 last season and went
through their third coaching change in two years when Woolridge
relieved Julie Rousseau with 10 games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play well together,'' center Lisa Leslie said. ``We
didn't have good team chemistry. I think right now we have very
good team chemistry, and obviously the pressure is totally off of
us because we aren't expected to do well... and I think that might
be a very good motivator for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Woolridge will stick with his starting five from the two
exhibition games, which means rookie Ukari Figgs, who led Purdue to
its first NCAA title in March, will start in her professional
debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very confident with Ukari running the point,'' he said.
``I have to remind myself from time to time that she's a rookie.
She's showing great leadership out there. She's delivering the ball
to people when they need it. She's running the offense, she's
creating the tempo and that's one thing that we want from the
start, ball movement, player movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie, who led the Sparks with 19.6 points and 10.2 rebounds
last season, finally has the post help she's needed the past two
seasons to counter the double- and triple-teams. DeLisha Milton and
Clarisse Machanguana, who were selected in the draft, and Bjedov,
once she learns the system, figure to make it tough for opponents
to key on Leslie.
</P>
<P>
   Tamecka Dixon returns to her spot as the shooting guard, and
Allison Feaster, who played only three games after fracturing her
foot in '98, starts at small forward. Both are offensive threats
from beyond the arc. Last season, Dixon shot 42 percent from
3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   Mwadi Mabika, one of the most improved players on the team, is
another threat from the perimeter and should see a lot of minutes
off the bench. Penny Toler, a starter the last two seasons, will
come off the bench and play the point or shooting guard.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks' biggest improvement will be Cooper's defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came in and implemented a defensive plan that is
outstanding,'' said Dixon. ``It's a very aggressive, in-your-face
defense. If we can come out strong defensively, it's going to be
tough to beat us.''

STUDENTS UNITE POW WITH TEACHER WHO WORE HIS NAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MARY LOU AURELIO  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK _ As a boy in New Jersey, Dave Thomson felt so deeply
about the plight of American prisoners of war in Vietnam that he
wrote off like a lot of kids and got a bracelet inscribed with the
name of a soldier on it.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, as a teacher at Burbank High, Thomson's devotion
came back to him tenfold when former POW Harold Johnson stepped
into his school _ a meeting arranged by 60 students who tracked
Johnson down in Iowa and collected money to fly him to California
because they ``just wanted to give something back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He shows he cares about us,'' said Jeanie Lim, 16, who helped
organize the surprise, regarding her Advanced Placement U.S.
history teacher. ``He'll stay here as long as we need him after
school. He just never gives up.''
</P>
<P>
   For 14 years, Thomson has been telling students how he grew up
in Medford Lakes, N.J., and one day wrote to a sponsoring group
that he wanted to support the POWs. A bracelet inscribed with the
name of U.S. Air Force Capt. Harold Eugene Johnson came back in the
mail.
</P>
<P>
   He wore the bracelet until Johnson's safe return after six years
in captivity and later got a thank-you letter after his release.
That was their last contact, except Johnson would show his students
the bracelet and mention how someday he would like to meet the man
whose name is on it.
</P>
<P>
   His students took him seriously and used a POW database on the
Internet to find Johnson in Blakesburg, Iowa, where he is mayor of
the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told me there's somebody here in California telling
stories about me,'' Johnson said. ``But that they're good
stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixty students each contributed up to $25 to buy the air ticket
as a gift to Thomson.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, they brought the teacher to the library under
false pretenses and then presented Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   A stunned Thomson was momentarily speechless. ``I thank you for
your service and dedication to this country,'' Thomson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is better than any movie I've seen,'' he added as the
students applauded. ``I remember wearing the bracelet, then seeing
on TV when you came home and cheering and yelling. Then I received
a letter from you, but I never thought I'd get to finish this
story.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was touched by the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a wonderful teacher you must be to influence this many
students,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The students agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not just a teacher, but a friend. He puts so much
preparation into class,'' said Tigran Sinanyan, 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's there if we need him before or after school,'' said Jacob
Leon, 17. ``He gets emotionally involved and he teaches from
personal experience. He gives us a firsthand look at the Vietnam
War.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was honored by student Ryan Jones, 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your life was an example of pure patriotism,'' Jones said.
``You're an example to all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson responded: ``I know I've been part of history, and I
hope it has some meaning to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he said, ``I'm pleased to see kids doing things like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   For Thomson, the experience was deeply moving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't express the gratitude I have and how much I appreciate
all of you,'' he told the students. ``I'm still kind of stunned.
This is an opportunity to bring a story to fruition _ to come full
circle.''

MARTINEZ STRIKES OUT AS EXPOS SWEEP UP 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-EXPOS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Among his other talents, let it now be said that
Pedro Martinez also can raise the dead. He just couldn't save
himself, or ultimately, the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   With Olympic Stadium transformed from catacomb to discotheque by
the return of Martinez _ who was welcomed back Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night as
if he were Rocket Richard, Jean Beliveau, or Ken Dryden _ the Expos
fed off some of that love Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night and hammered the Red
Sox, 13-1, completing a hat trick of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   Playing before a Martinez-inspired crowd of 19,012 that was
bigger than the last two gatherings combined, the Expos swept the
three-game set from the Sox, outscoring Boston, 26-4.
</P>
<P>
   They sent the Sox, who were outhit, 14-5, to their fifth
straight defeat, the longest losing streak in more than a year for
the Sons of Jimy Williams. That downturn dropped them into second
place in the American League East, a half-game behind the Yankees,
after a run of 22 days in first place.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Expos and another obscure pitcher, Mike Thurman,
ended a nine-game winning streak for Martinez (11-2), who hadn't
lost since April 15 but was lifted after a yield of four runs and
six hits in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got to me,'' said Martinez, who struck out 10 before
parting but also gave up more earned runs Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night than he
had in any of his previous dozen starts. ``They played better
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to have the ball the next day we play, but I trust
that other guys out there will do their job. I look for them to
pick us up with a good game, help us bounce back, and pick up the
team. Right now we need something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox may want to look somewhere other than the bullpen for
that pick-me-up. Wednesday night, the Expos bounced the Sox back
toward the border with an eight-run eighth inning against three
relievers _ Mark Portugal, Mark Guthrie, and John Wasdin.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal, who opted for relief over retirement, pitched 1 1/3
innings Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night and allowed five of the last seven batters
he faced to reach safely. Guthrie went double, sacrifice fly,
intentional walk, home run, and single, the home run a tape-measure
number by Expos reliever Guillermo Mota, a converted minor league
shortstop who'd never batted before in the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Wasdin, who was taken deep in the opener here, gave up a home
run to the first batter he faced Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night, Manny Martinez,
a defensive replacement who had one home run in 141 previous
at-bats this season. That makes it four home runs in his last five
appearances for Johnny Waz, which is one way of becoming Johnny Was
very quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not one person who is going to ride this out for us;
we've got to do it collectively as a team,'' said Mike Stanley,
whose bid for a tying home run in the sixth, when it was still 2-0,
went just foul, and his subsequent try for extra bases a couple of
pitches later was snatched at the wall by Rondell White's leaping
catch in left-center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, this is a disappointment. It's not that we took
them lightly, but we felt we were the better team. To come in here
and get swept like that, I don't think anyone thought that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got our butts kicked here, and got embarrassed tonight, but
by the time we land in New York, hopefully we'll have a good offday
then get ready for the Mets. We've got to put this behind us.
There's nothing we can do about it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez breezed through the first three innings, striking out
four and allowing just one base runner, Shane Andrews, who walked.
But the veneer of invincibility cracked in the fourth, when Jose
Vidro lined a double to the right-center-field gap to open the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   White bounced a ground-ball single up the middle, scoring Vidro
with the game's first run. Orlando Merced was retired on a tapper
in front of the plate, White advancing to second, and Vladimir
Guerrero, whom Martinez treats like an adopted son, pulled an
outside pitch through the left side for an RBI single to make it
2-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got such long arms,'' Martinez said. ``Someone else
doesn't even reach that pitch. But I've seen him hit a bouncing
breaking ball into center field for a base hit. He's quick and
strong, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Since giving up three runs in the eighth inning against Tampa
Bay in his second start April 10, Martinez had not allowed as many
as two runs in an inning in his next 10 starts, a span of 77 2/3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night, he did it twice, as the Expos widened their
lead to 4-0 in the sixth. White bounced a one-out single and went
to third as Merced doubled into the right-field corner. Martinez
elected to give an intentional walk to Guerrero, the first he's
issued this season, but rookie catcher Michael Barrett crossed up
that strategy by lining an 0-and-2 pitch into center for a two-run
single.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it coming,'' Martinez said of Barrett's hit. ``I hung a
breaking ball. I shook off the sign about three times, I wanted to
bounce it out of the strike zone but I didn't. That was a mistake,
and he took advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who reached double figures in strikeouts (10) for the
44th time in his career, ninth time this season, and 17th time with
the Sox, was lifted for Portugal at the start of the seventh. It
was just the third time in 13 starts that he has not pitched more
than six innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, meanwhile, were held scoreless for 15 consecutive
innings, from the time they scored a first-inning run Tuesday
against rookie Dan Smith until they broke through in the seventh
against Thurman, a 25-year-old righthander who came into
Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night's game with exactly six big-league wins in his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm going to lose to a team,'' said Martinez, who got a
standing ovation just for showing up, ``I'd rather it be this
one.''

KARROS' HOMER SPARKS DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There's not much to do but wait and find out
whether the Dodgers will hit as they should, or pitch as they
should.
</P>
<P>
   So the Dodgers are left to hope for many more instances like the
six-run fourth inning they put up against Texas, which turned into
a face-saving 7-2 Dodgers win against the Rangers on Wednesday
night in front of 46,539 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second most explosive inning for the Dodgers this
season, beaten only by the seven runs they scored in the seventh
inning nearly a month ago at St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros had a three-run
homer to left-center to spark the barrage.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers right-hander Kevin Brown (7-3) increased his team-lead
in wins by working eight innings. He allowed two runs on five hits.
Brown struck out six and walked three. He also improved his record
to 5-1 after a Dodgers loss, retiring the last 10 batters he faced.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the first time in four starts that Brown defeated
the Rangers, the team that drafted him in the first round (fourth
overall) in 1986. He pitched six full seasons for the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers broke a three-game losing streak and finished the
six-game homestand 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers (29-29) also moved back to the .500 mark a day after
dropping below it for the first time since April 26 when they were
9-10. Ironically, Brown won on April 27 against Milwaukee to
trigger a season-high five-game winning streak. The Dodgers also
won seven of nine games, beginning with that Brown win.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Eric Young, who homered in the ninth inning to
tie Tuesday's game, had three hits and three RBI. He was also
robbed of first-inning homer by Rangers left fielder Rusty Greer.
</P>
<P>
   Until the offensive outburst in the fourth, the Dodgers were in
jeopardy of facing Texas starters Aaron Sele, Mike Morgan and Mark
Clark and not being in a position to win. That trio entered the
night with a combined 13-12 mark and a 6.42 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Clark rolled through the Dodgers batting order the first time
with ease, striking out four and allowing only a first-inning
single.
</P>
<P>
   The second time through was much different.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield began the assault with a one-out single. Raul
Mondesi walked before Karros hit his eighth homer of the season and
his first since May 27, to give the Dodgers a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Dave Hansen walked and Trenidad Hubbard, who had
three hits in Tuesday's loss, singled to right. Catcher Angel Pena
singled to center to score Hansen. Pena's third RBI of the season
put the Dodgers ahead 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Young singled off third baseman Todd Zeile's glove to score the
final two runs of the inning. Clark (3-5) left after the inning.
</P>
<P>
   One of the keys to any rally is sustaining the momentum by
shutting the opponent down the next inning, and Brown teetered on
the edge of disaster in the top of the fifth before getting one of
the game's most dangerous hitters out to end a potentially
horrendous inning.
</P>
<P>
   Royce Clayton singled with one out in the fifth and pinch-hitter
Luis Alicea hit a grounds-rule double to put runners on second and
third. Brown got Tom Goodwin to pop up for the second out, but
walked Mark McLemore to load the bases. Rusty Greer singled to
center to break through Brown and make it a 6-2 game.
</P>
<P>
   It also brought reigning American League MVP Juan Gonzalez, who
has 16 homers and 52 RBI, to the plate. But Brown got Gonzalez to
hit into a fielder's choice ground-out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers added a run in the sixth inning against reliever
John Burkett, and it was Young who came up with his second straight
two-out hit. Hubbard led off with a single and moved to second on
Brown's bunt. He scored when Young singled to right as the Dodgers
took a 7-2 lead.

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
INDIANAPOLIS _ Start spreading the news.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Knicks are for real.
</P>
<P>
   The live-on-the-edge Knicks traveled to Market Square Arena on
Wednesday night and whipped the Indiana Pacers 101-94 in Game 5 of
the Eastern Conference finals before 16,541 disappointed fans, most
of whom were busy spreading the boos when the final horn sounded.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, up 3-2 in the best-of-seven series, are on the verge
of advancing to the NBA Finals for the first time since 1994, when
they lost to the Rockets in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just excited about getting to a point where we're
playing to move on,'' said New York coach Jeff Van Gundy. ``That's
all anybody wants to do in any kind of tournament, just try to move
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're playing against a great team and we're going to
have to play very well to win. But that's how we've been playing
for five games, and I don't think it's going to change now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, who squeaked into the playoffs as the eighth-seeded
team, are doing it their way. Which, of course, means the hard way.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do they seem more comfortable on the road, winning two
games at Market Square Arena, but the Knicks are having to do it
without perennial All-Star center Patrick Ewing, who will miss the
rest of the playoffs with a torn left Achilles' tendon.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Van Gundy has gone with a small lineup, starting
6-5 Latrell Sprewell at forward, a move that backfired in Game 4 on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But it paid huge dividends in Wednesday night's game, with
Sprewell erupting for 29 points to lead the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it's right there,'' Sprewell said. ``We know it's one
more game and we're in the Finals. We have to play as well as we
did in the fourth quarter tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to (win it Friday), but I'm not going to say we are.
But we're going to come out ready. Like I said, if we come out and
play like we did in the fourth quarter _ move the ball, find the
open guy, make shots and defend _ then we're going to put ourselves
in the position to do just that, finish this series off.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially if Larry Johnson plays the way he did in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   For the clueless Pacers, it was Johnson (again), from the
outside (again), with the 3-pointer (again) doing all the damage
late in the game, scoring 12 of his 17 points in the final period.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who won Game 3 with an improbable four-point play,
drilled back-to-back 3-pointers in a span of 49 seconds Wednesday
night to put New York up 89-84 with 2:49 to play, and the Pacers
never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   And they have to be wondering what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   After taking the Bulls to seven games in last season's
conference finals, the Pacers thought they would be knocking on
heaven's door this season. Instead, they've been given a few
classes in the school of hard knocks.
</P>
<P>
   Or make that the school of hard Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Miller scored 30 points for the Pacers but got little
help.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Jackson chipped in 16 points but hit just six of 14 shots
and had only four assists. And Rik Smits, who was saddled with foul
problems (again) in the first half, hit only four of 14 shots to
finish with eight points.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Davis was the only other Pacer to show up, finishing with
12 points and a game-high 18 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too bad for us that some guys can talk the talk but they
can't walk it,'' said Indiana coach Larry Bird. ``Some guys didn't
show up tonight, and that's very disappointing. Disappointing for
all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   It has to be even more distressing that New York refused to
fold, despite falling behind by 14 points in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell, Marcus Camby (21 points, 13 rebounds), Johnson (15
second-half points) and Allan Houston (19 points, 15 in the second
half) brought the Knicks back.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great,'' Camby said. ``Considering where we started
and where we are now, this is really great. We were a bunch of guys
who really didn't know each other, but now we're here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have just one more game to go to the Finals; it's what
we've all dreamed about. We just have to make the best of the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Like they did Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   How crucial is the fifth game in the conference finals? Put it
this way _ the winner almost always moves on to the next round _
with one memorable exception.
</P>
<P>
   During this decade, 11 conference finals have been tied 2-2, and
the winner of Game 5 has gone on to win 10 of those series. The
exception was the 1994 Eastern Conference finals between the Knicks
and Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana won Game 5 at Madison Square Garden _ the night Miller
scored 25 of his 39 points in the fourth quarter _ to take a 3-2
series lead. But the Knicks took the last two games to move on to
play the Rockets in the 1994 NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, the Pacers went up by six points moments into
the fourth quarter, but the Knicks kept plugging away until they
finally came back and took the lead at 78-77 on Johnson's nine-foot
baseline jumper with 7:10 to play.
</P>
<P>
   And Johnson, who saved the Knicks with his four-point play to
end Game 3, would be the hero again for New York.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson bombed in the first of his 3-pointers with 3:38 left to
put the Knicks up 86-82, then came back after a Smits jumper to
bury another, putting New York up 89-84 with 2:49 to play.
</P>
<P>
   The shot appeared to take the life out of the Pacers, even
though Miller dropped in a long 3-pointer with 1:59 left to pull
Indiana to within 91-87.
</P>
<P>
   But the Knicks managed to keep them at arm's length, running out
much of the rest of the game at the free-throw line.

YANKEES CRUSH PHILLIES, 11-5 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ A player lowered his voice in the New York
Yankees' clubhouse here on Wednesday and asked a question that will
gain relevance if this team retains its current mediocrity for much
longer: ``What does George think?''
</P>
<P>
   George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, watched
Wednesday night's game from the stands at Veterans Stadium, a frown
carved into his face until his players blew open a tense contest
with eight runs in the sixth inning of an 11-5 victory. The Yankees
(33-24) snapped a three-game losing streak and moved into first
place in the American League East, a half-game ahead of Boston,
which lost its fifth consecutive game, in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   This was the Yankees' first victory against the Phillies here
since Game 2 of the 1950 World Series. Swept here in 1997, the
Yankees managed to avert another three-game sweep on Wednesday
night chiefly because Tino Martinez banged a three-run homer and
David Cone pitched five and two-thirds innings in gaining his sixth
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Their timing could not have been better, with Steinbrenner
staring them down from his seat behind the Philadelphia dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we just keep playing good ball, we're going to wind up in a
good position,'' said Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner mostly has avoided reporters since Darryl
Strawberry's arrest in April, but others in the organization say
there are days when his unhappiness is profound. The Yankee players
are finally coming to grips with the fact they won't be as good as
they were in 1998 _ ``It's official,'' Paul O'Neill said Tuesday _
but there's no assurance Steinbrenner feels the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Cone (6-2) has been the Yankees' best pitcher this season and
and he has great credibility with Steinbrenner. Martinez's home run
staked him to a 3-1 lead in the fourth, but in the bottom of the
fifth, Cone threw 41 pitches gave up two runs after there were two
out, forcing home the tying run by allowing a bases-loaded walk to
Scott Rolen.
</P>
<P>
   Rico Brogna smashed a line drive toward right field, a would-be
single, a two-run hit in the making but second baseman Chuck
Knoblauch reached high over his head to snag the liner.
Steinbrenner glared ominously.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Ogea the Phillies' starter, had run the bases during the
rally, and right away, he was in trouble in the top of the sixth.
Derek Jeter led off with a single and stole second, and the Yankees
were on parade: Bernie Williams singled and Martinez walked and
after a pitching change, O'Neill lined a two-run triple.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius singled and Knoblauch added his second hit of the
game. After Joe Girardi whiffed for the first out of the inning,
Cone lined a ground-rule double to left, his first regular-season
hit since he as with the Mets in 1992. (Cone later joked with
Girardi that the pitcher should have batted eighth, Girardi ninth).
</P>
<P>
   And on and on it went. In Tuesday's loss, Philadelphia sent 13
batters to the plate and scored 9 runs; on Wednesday night, the
Yankees sent 13 batters to the plate and scored 8 runs. ``It was
huge,'' said Cone.
</P>
<P>
   All of the players involved in Manager Joe Torre's lineup
changes fared well the last two days. Knoblauch has been a markedly
different player since he was shifted from the lead-off spot to the
bottom of the batting order. Often unaggressive on the bases this
season, Knoblauch extended his usual lead off first base after
reaching base three times tonight, and he broke from first
repeatedly, even stole second.
</P>
<P>
   When Cone bounced his double into the stands in the sixth
inning, Knoblauch kept running and running until the third base
coach Willie Randolph stopped him. In Monday's game, Knoblauch
slowed up on a similar play, earning Torre's anger.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch also has had several great plays on defense in the
last two days and Torre expects to restore him to the top of the
lineup in a few days.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill dropped from third to fifth in the lineup had two hits
on Tuesday and drove in two runs on Wednesday night. Martinez,
moving from the No. 5 spot to cleanup, has hit home runs in both
games and Williams has had three hits from the No. 3 spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to shake things up,'' said Martinez, ``and get
everybody to relax.''
</P>
<P>
   By the seventh inning, Steinbrenner was laughing out loud,
joking with friends, and when the Phillie Phanatic approached the
Yankee owner, Steinbrenner grinned and played along. Good thing,
for the mascot's sake, the Yankees were winning big.

COURT OUSTS WEST FROM CORPORATION COMMISSION

<P>
   PHOENIX _ A divided Arizona Supreme Court booted Tony West from
the powerful Arizona Corporation Commission on Wednesday after
finding West illegally held a securities sales license when he was
elected in November.
</P>
<P>
   The high court's 3-2 vote will not affect any of the key utility
rulings West made during the past five months, including his swing
votes on electrical deregulation and long-distance phone service.
</P>
<P>
   West, a former two-term Republican state treasurer and 16-year
member of the Legislature, declined to comment on the Supreme
Court's action. His attorney, Tom Irvine, said the 3-2 decision
could not be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is disappointed,'' Irvine said. ``But he's looking forward
to going back into private life.''
</P>
<P>
   West's predecessor, Renz Jennings, the only Democrat on the
three-member regulatory panel, will return from retirement on a
south Phoenix farm until Gov. Jane Hull appoints a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Hull's appointee will serve until the November 2000 general
election, when Arizona voters will pick someone to fill out the
remaining four years of West's six-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings complained about West to the Supreme Court after fellow
Democrat Paul Newman was narrowly defeated by West in the Nov. 3
general election.
</P>
<P>
   The law was discovered when West asked the commission's
securities staff in December to help him avoid any conflict between
selling securities and regulating the financial industry. When told
there was no way, West surrendered the license.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not solve West's problem, Justices Charles Jones,
Thomas Zlaket and Stanley Feldman said in a 49-page opinion:
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time of the election, West was a registered securities
salesperson licensed to a registered securities dealer. Both West
and the dealer were subject to regulation by the commission. Under
the plain language of the statute, he was not eligible to be
elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Justices Frederick Martone and Ruth McGregor dissented.
</P>
<P>
   ``West ran for public office and won,'' they said. ``It was not
until then that his opponent raised this issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``. . . it is so plainly unjust to remove an elected official
under these circumstances,'' Martone and McGregor said.
</P>
<P>
   But, the majority said, allowing West to serve would permit all
three commissioners to sell securities while regulating their
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This raises the specter of enormous conflicts,'' the majority
ruling said.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Ching, attorney for Jennings, called the decision a
``historic event,'' noting that no other elected state officer had
been ousted by the Arizona Supreme Court since the state's first
governor, George W.P. Hunt, was removed temporarily in a dispute
over balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Hull, a fellow Republican who served with West in the
Legislature, thanked him for 24 years of service as an elected
representative. Early in the election controversy, West predicted
that Hull would appoint him to the commission if he lost the court
case, but he later asked the governor not to be considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect to name a Republican replacement as soon as
possible,'' Hull said.
</P>
<P>
   She did not comment on speculation that possible candidates
include Pima County Supervisor Mike Boyd, former state senator and
now Pima County Superior Court Clerk Patti Noland, and former Rep.
David Schweikert, R-Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings said the Supreme Court was correct in siding with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the statute was just crystal clear,'' he said. ``My
service extends until my successor qualifies.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings added that ``things look pretty bad for Tony.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings referred to an Attorney General's inquiry into alleged
securities deals West attempted to make with investment bankers
handling state funds while he was state treasurer over the past
eight years.
</P>
<P>
   West has repeatedly refused to discuss those dealings.
</P>
<P>
   One of those deals was revealed by ``The Arizona Republic'' on
Feb. 22, when the Supreme Court heard arguments about West's
illegal election.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings said he plans to show up Thursday at the commission,
barring an unforeseen move by Hull.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll go there and do what needs to be done until she makes the
reappointment,'' Jennings said. ``I know where everything is.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes several boxes of documents taken home from his
commission office when Jennings completed his final six-year term
in January. Attorney General's investigators seized the materials
when West complained that they had been removed improperly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they'll bring them back,'' Jennings said. ``I've asked
my lawyers to ask them to return the boxes. I assume they will.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennings will serve with two Republicans: Chairman Carl Kunasek,
whose term ends in 2000, and Jim Irvin, whose term ends in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``One, we wish Tony the best,'' Irvin said. ``Number Two, I
certainly concur with the court decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over West's election capped several years of
turmoil and personnel turnover at the commission. The high court's
decision, and the governor's appointment should add stability,
Irvin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really depends on whom the governor appoints,'' Irvin
added. &QL;

PACERS BEING SHOWN GLIMPSE OF THE FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: CHANGES throughout)  (rk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ As he was about to shoot and make a free throw to
seal Game 5, Latrell Sprewell was hit with a barrage of chants from
the less-than-tactful Market Square Arena crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Choke! Choke! Choke!'' the crowd yelled, an obvious reference
to the incident that led to Sprewell's exile from pro basketball
last season.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of the court, Marcus Camby had barely rejected
his sixth shot of the night when a fan began yelling, ``We know you
got paid in college,'' another tasteless reference to a Knick
player's past.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment from the crowd was understandable in some ways. So
frustrated with the aging Indiana Pacers, who never seem to clear
the last hurdle, they watched the players of the next millennium in
the Eastern Conference go by their team in a blur.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell, Camby and Larry Johnson not only fought the most
diverse offensive unit in the league Wednesday night, they seized
the most important game of the Knicks' season.
</P>
<P>
   Future 101, Past 94.
</P>
<P>
   ``That young man has such a gift,'' Chris Childs said about
Camby after the lithe 7-footer pinned the Pacers against the glass
to give the Knicks a 3-2 advantage in the best-of-7-game series.
``He might not even know how good he is yet, but it's such a
pleasure to play with him. People questioned his heart, his
toughness. Marcus answered all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell did too. He jackknifed in the air, scored 29 points and
drew so much attention that someone had to be open.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it is right there,'' Sprewell said, referring to the
finals. ``We're going to come out ready Friday. I'd like to do it
for our fans at home. I'd like to finish Indiana off there.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the between-game adjustments were made _ before Jeff Van
Gundy went back to his film room and chalkboard for Game 5 _ Reggie
Miller had made an analogy for how difficult it is to match up with
his team, all the diverse weaponry at the disposal of the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the guys it's like an overflowing dam,'' Miller said.''
The water is getting to the top, the dam is going to burst. And
when it does, there'll be a flood.''
</P>
<P>
   Reggie finally broke through, but there was no onrushing tsunami
from the Pacers. Sprewell, Camby and Johnson fixed the leaks and
propelled the Knicks one game away from their first finals
appearance in five years.
</P>
<P>
   In a clutch performance befitting the Eastern Conference finals,
they played through unseemly actions by the crowd, a miserable
first quarter and all the distractions a playoff game might merit.
</P>
<P>
   They became the answers to every question the Pacers had posed
in Game 4, fighting the might and muscle of Indiana with their long
arms and arching jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell, battling a head cold, went to the basket with a fury
and a passion unseen in Game 4. He ended with 29 points on 8-of-19
shooting, silencing his detractors (including this one), who took
issue with his adjustment as a starter in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   Camby? What else can be said about this gifted player who
frustrated Rik Smits, pinned a Miller layup against the glass and
would not quit even after the game had been decided. His sixth
block came with four seconds left, a rejection of Sam Perkins along
the right baseline. Twenty-one points, 13 rebounds. Awesome.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys played me hard and banged me,'' Camby said, ``but I
just wanted to win so bad and go up, 3-2. When we started off the
season, no one thought we would be where we are now. Just the
opportunity to go to the finals is a dream come true for most of
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks had been waiting for Johnson to emerge since his Game
3 miracle four-point play, and you wondered if that was possible
after his passive performance on Monday night at Madison Square
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he did as much as anyone on the roster to give the Knicks a
chance to end the series at home Friday, knocking down the most
crucial, back-to-back 3-pointers with less than four minutes _
daggers from the right wing that put the Knicks ahead by four and
five points.
</P>
<P>
   Miller finally broke through Wednesday night, finding his range,
his points (30) and his complete game. He went back to being the
Reggie New York knows and hates.
</P>
<P>
   But these young guns who like to run and have fun were too much
for the veteran and his graying team.
</P>
<P>
   There is a thought circulating around the league that San
Antonio's front line and overall depth will be too strong for
anyone coming out of the Eastern Conference. Well rested and
clicking as well as they have all season, the Spurs seem to have
every imaginable advantage headed into the league championship
series.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it remains to be seen if they have the heart of the Knicks,
a group of players that won't die, a team on the brink of going
where no one outside that locker room dreamed they would go; the
league championship series.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about their five-game war with Miami. If the Knicks can
somehow find a way to get out of this round, they will have dodged
the most lethal bullet in the post-season. Tim Duncan and David
Robinson are awesome in their own right, but the Spurs don't have
the backcourt to match up with Sprewell and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   After weathering a gantlet in Indiana, San Antonio would be a
piece of cake. It's not over yet. But when Johnson talks about
being on a float cruising down Broadway in a couple of weeks, you
get the sense they are impossibly close.

BROTHERLY LOVE, BUT ALSO LUMPS, FOR MARINER PITCHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Jordan Zimmerman knew he was going to hear about it.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, after the Mariners had beaten the Colorado
Rockies, the clubhouse TVs were showing the Texas Rangers' game in
Los Angeles. Jeff Zimmerman was pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Uh-oh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants him to do bad because we're in such a rivalry
with them,'' said Jordan Zimmerman, the Mariners' left-hander. ``A
lot of guys were joking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Zimmerman pitched a shutout inning that night, then
followed with two more Tuesday to run his record to 6-0. The
Rangers right-hander leads all American League relievers with a
1.15 earned-run average and only Anaheim's Troy Percival has held
batters to a lower average than Zimmerman's .116. He has thrown 39
innings, sixth in the AL.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Jordan buys a newspaper, he flips immediately to the
box scores to see if his brother pitched the night before. He's
rarely disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad he's doing it, but I don't know how his arm's holding
up,'' said Jordan. ``He's throwing one or two innings almost every
single day. I guess the more you do it, the stronger you get.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Jordan can relate. He has worked only 42/3 innings in
eight games since being called up from Class AA New Haven on May
16. But with John Halama solidifying his place in the rotation,
Zimmerman is the lone lefty in the M's bullpen. He figures to be
with the team when the Rangers come to town to close out the
Kingdome on June 25-27.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 family members and friends will be on hand, many coming
down from the Zimmermans' hometown of Kelowna, B.C. It will be the
first time the brothers have played against each other, and an
especially proud moment for their father, Bill, who is recovering
from lymphoma after spending five months in a coma last year.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan Zimmerman filmed an interview with ESPN Wenesday, in a
piece to run on Father's Day.
</P>
<P>
   SOUVENIR ... SORT OF: Ken Cloude reached for the baseball, still
tucked in his glove in the back of his locker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I'll do with it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Tom Lampkin gave Cloude the ball after Tuesday night's
save, the first of Cloude's professional career. Cloude had been
passed over in favor of Frankie Rodriguez for the start Tuesday,
but came on for four relief innings.
</P>
<P>
   Cloude said his goal is to be a starting pitcher, which is the
role he prefers. But his statistics work against him. In four
outings as a starter, Cloude is 0-2 with a 14.14 earned-run average
and .441 opponents' average. In nine relief appearances, he is 3-0
with a 2.49 ERA and .205 opponents' average.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it, I don't have a choice,'' Cloude said.
``I've struggled starting, and I've really done nothing to show I
deserve to pitch every fifth day. But at the same time, I know I
can get guys out and make a contribution to the team. If it means
pitching in the bullpen, that's fine with me.''
</P>
<P>
   ONE OF THE GUYS: Before Wednesday night's game, each Mariner had
a flier for Thursday's annual Cystic Fibrosis Golf Tournament at
his locker. This prompted several Mariners to try their swings _
including outfielder Raul Ibanez, who got some serious ribbing for
his front-leg kick that accompanied an ugly stroke.
</P>
<P>
   But Ibanez will take the insults, and give them back. He
re-joined the team this road trip after a week-long injury rehab at
Class AAA Tacoma, which, in his words, is ``a nice play to visit,
but you don't want to stay there.''
</P>
<P>
   Not when you could be in the majors, he meant. Ibanez's roster
spot is fairly secure _ he serves an important role as an emergency
catcher and solid left-handed pinch-hitter, and he's out of
options, meaning he can't be sent to the minors without first
clearing waivers.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners think highly of Ibanez, who likely would be
claimed. He shuttled between Tacoma and Seattle for three seasons
before '99, and he's enjoying staying in one place.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge difference in your state of mind,'' Ibanez
said. ``You feel a lot more comfortable up here knowing you're not
going to be going back down. You can be a part of the team, blend
in well. It's easier to have fun with the guys and mess around when
you know you're going to stay here. That's definitely nice.''
</P>
<P>
   AROUND THE HORN: Outfielder Butch Huskey wouldn't mind if the
Mariners set the all-time record for home runs in a season. ``That
would be better than the last time I was a part of history,''
Huskey said. His current distinction? Huskey is one of only three
players to make his major league debut in a no-hitter. He was
0-for-3 with three strikeouts on Sept. 8, 1993, as then-Houston
Astros pitcher Darryl Kile no-hit the New York Mets. ...
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Ken Griffey Jr. tried on a Shannon Sharpe jersey
given to him by the Denver Broncos tight end before Wednesday
night's game. Griffey had given Sharpe a jersey, bat and batting
gloves when the Broncos were honored at Coors Field Tuesday. ...
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners will be collecting non-perishable food items and
monetary donations for Fight Hunger Day Friday at the Kingdome.

METS TOP BLUE JAY, 4-3, IN EXTRA INNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Mets lost Benny Agbayani to a freakish injury in
batting practice on Wednesday, but they didn't need him on
Wednesday night as they staged a stunning comeback for their fourth
consecutive victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets rallied for three ninth-inning runs that were charged
to David Wells to force extra innings. Then Rey Ordonez lofted a
fly-ball single over a drawn-in outfield with one out in the 14th
inning to drive home the winning run early on Thursday morning in a
4-3 triumph over Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after that did Mets Manager Bobby Valentine grudgingly
admit there have been more problems with Bobby Bonilla, who has
been benched since Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to say he wasn't available,'' Valentine said
when asked why he did not use Bonilla on Wednesday night.
``Yesterday, he was asked to pinch-hit and he couldn't. I was told
today it was the same situation. I'm very confused.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bonilla was not talking. ``I have nothing to say,
to be honest with you. I'm not going anywhere that I know of. But
I'm not volunteering any information.''
</P>
<P>
   Most perplexing of all was General Manager Steve Phillips'
response. Before the game, Phillips was asked if having a
disgruntled Bonilla around the clubhouse could turn problematic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a problem unless it becomes a problem,'' Phillips
said. Is it a problem?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think so,'' Phillips said then.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the same question was posed to Phillips. ``I have no
comment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The night began with a ball hit by Agbayani, the Mets' budding
folk hero, ricocheting off the corner of the batting cage during
batting practice and bouncing back into Agbayani's face, leaving
him with considerable swelling under his right eye. The night ended
with the remnants of the fans at Shea Stadium cheering news of the
Knicks' victory in Indiana and then the Mets' final rally.
</P>
<P>
   And by the time it was over, Valentine who had been ejected for
arguing a catcher's interference call in the top of the 12th
inning, was peering out from the dugout entrance disguised in a
fake mustache, sunglasses and a non-Mets cap.
</P>
<P>
   The way Wells was throwing over the first eight innings, it was
debatable how much Agbayani would have helped anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But Wells tired after carrying a shutout into the ninth. The
Mets, who were behind by 3-0, staged a dramatic rally in their
final at-bat against a pitcher they may covet. After Robin Ventura
singled home two runs with two outs, after fouling off four
consecutive pitches, not only was the shutout gone, so was Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Three pitches later, Brian McRae smacked a double off Billy Koch
into the left field corner to score pinch-runner Luis Lopez with
the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez and McRae drew walks off Thomas Davey to open the Mets'
14th, and then Roger Cedeno laid down a two-strike sacrifice bunt
against Dan Plesac. One pitch later, Ordonez launched his single to
left to score Lopez easily.
</P>
<P>
   The comeback was reminiscent of one on May 23, when the Mets
rallied for five runs in the bottom of the ninth against
Philadelphia's Curt Schilling to wipe out a 4-0 deficit. Wednesday
night's turnaround was similarly stunning, considering that Wells
had thoroughly outpitched Rick Reed, who allowed 10 hits, 2 home
runs and 3 earned runs in 6 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Wells was an out away from his first complete game of the season
and Reed was an out away from losing his third consecutive start.
The Mets were that close to losing for the first time since
Phillips dismissed three of Valentine's coaches late Saturday night
on the heels of a season-worst eight-game losing streak.

DENYING FRESHMAN ELIGIBILITY FALLS SHORT OF GOAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gotta hand it to the NCAA. Once college basketball's governors
see the horse has left the barn, gone to the neighbor's pasture and
found a filly, raised young 'uns and won the Kentucky Derby, the
NCAA slams the door shut.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1972, the NCAA is considering making
freshmen ineligible for men's hoops. In the history of overdue
actions, this one ranks up there with today's delivery of a
baby-names book to George Foreman.
</P>
<P>
   Something called the Division I Working Group to Study
Basketball Issues is considering recommending that players be
barred from competition for the first year so that they can adjust
to college.
</P>
<P>
   It would be gratifying to know that the NCAA is moved to such
worthy action based on noble principles. But like most
self-satisfied bureaucracies, it is forced to act out of pure
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   The graduation rate in men's basketball is 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Considering how easy it is at most schools to graduate when the
student is a 6-foot-7 dunker who can drain the trey, the fact only
41 percent make it is altogether remarkable. Normally a mere
six-point scoring average is enough to get a C in medieval European
history.
</P>
<P>
   But the real problem with the graduation rate is not that
competing freshmen become maladjusted students. The problem is that
a growing number of freshmen quit to go pro or transfer to another
school, but their departures count as a failure against the
original school's graduation count.
</P>
<P>
   For each NBA draft, the list of underclassmen leaving college
early seems to grow. This spring had a first: The lordly Duke
program, which had never been victimized by the NBA plunderers, not
only lost sophomore Elton Brand, NCAA player of the year, but a kid
off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   Too many high school players, full of the patronizing platitudes
of street agents, shoe-company reps and gold-digging friends and
relatives, are fooled into regarding college as a one- or two-year
stop on the way to swooping with Kobe Bryant on the fast break.
</P>
<P>
   They are oblivious to the fact that 99.5 percent of the
scholarship men's basketball players in Division I in any one year
will never play a minute in the NBA. Unfortunately, the same 99.5
percent believe they will make it.
</P>
<P>
   Since there's neither an accounting nor a remedy for this
breathtaking foolishness, the NCAA has decided not to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   By barring freshmen eligibility, the NCAA tacitly adds another
significant reason for some high school kids to skip college and
try the pros.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should not be a primary consideration,'' said Jim Delany,
Big Ten commissioner, said. ``Those players are not going to be (in
school) very long anyway. At the end of the day, that's not an NCAA
problem. That's a problem for the NBA Players Association.''
</P>
<P>
   However callous that sounds, he's right. Any rule or custom that
helps destroy the myth that athletes must go to college before
attempting professional athletics is worthy of immediate adoption.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. is virtually the only country in the world to
perpetuate this preposterous system. Throughout Europe, Latin
America and Asia, talented athletes are directed to athletic
academies and clubs, and get schooled on the side. Students, on the
other hand, are directed to college, and play sports on the side.
</P>
<P>
   Hard to believe, isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Barring freshmen eligibility doesn't represent the dawn of
enlightenment in college athletics. Nor does the fact that the NCAA
sees the rule as a cheap way to improve its embarrassing graduation
rates eliminate virtue from the maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   If implemented, the plan at least filters out some kids who
would be wasting time and resources, while possibly giving others
more interested in the other benefits of college a shot at a richer
experience.
</P>
<P>
   A kid willing to sit out a year of ball gets a shot to find out
if he's college material. If he is, the incentive is greater to
pursue a degree. Obviously, there's no guarantee the kid won't quit
early, but the decision at least becomes harder.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's work is far from done, and undoubtedly will face
opposition from many coaches. So it may recommend something less
radical: Ineligibility for only the first term of the first year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one term is very appropriate,'' said Barbara Hedges,
the University of Washington athletic director and committee
member. ``I think that provides time to adjust to college and
campus. I just have not believed that a full year is absolutely
necessary. In basketball, unlike football, the student has time to
get used to things before the season begins.''
</P>
<P>
   Hedges said most of the committee started out with a similar
sentiment, but the full year is gaining support. Chief persuader
has been committee member Dean Smith, the retired North Carolina
coaching legend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dean is very much in favor of the full year,'' she said.
``He's seen it both ways, and brought a wonderful perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   To college basketball fans who might feel cheated by missing out
on freshmen, I would recommend checking them out on the nearest NBA
team. True, it's a little more expensive, but as was learned this
season, bad basketball isn't cheap.

KNICKS ASSUME CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>

 By MICHAEL HOLLEY

<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ By the end of the night, Larry Johnson was
calling himself a 3-point shooter. ``I'm not saying I'm Allan
Houston,'' the New York forward said, ``but I can hit 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to disagree with him. You can ask Larry Bird and his
Indiana Pacers about that. They are in the Eastern Conference
finals against the Knicks, which is a matchup they wanted. But they
are on the verge of losing this best-of-seven series following
Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night's stunning 101-94 loss to the Knicks in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. The Knicks are one game away from playing against
the Spurs for the NBA championship. They are in that position for
several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   You can point to Johnson's two wide-open 3-pointers _ less than
a minute apart in the fourth quarter _ directly in front of the
Indiana bench.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can talk about Marcus Camby's 21 points, 13 rebounds, and
6 blocked shots. ``He dominated the game tonight,'' Bird said.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget about Latrell Sprewell's 29 points (and 13 of 14
from the line).
</P>
<P>
   And as you absorb all that, remember this about the Knicks: they
would be the first No. 8 seed in league history to play in the
Finals.
</P>
<P>
   What is this?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a one-game season now,'' Indiana's Reggie Miller said.
``We've got to get a win.'' If the Pacers don't win, they come back
here to be serenaded by their fans. It will be far worse than the
random boos that echoed through Market Square Arena in the final
minute Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night, when it was obvious the Pacers would lose.
</P>
<P>
   Fans here had to hear how the Pacers had an advantage by working
out together during the lockout. They heard players talk about
winning the championship, especially with the retirement of Michael
Jordan. They certainly don't want to see guys named Sprewell,
Camby, and Van Gundy win the title at their expense.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is speculation until tomorrow night in New York,
when Game 6 will be played at Madison Square Garden. But the
results won't be any different if the Pacers can't find a way to
guard Johnson. The forward made the two biggest shots of the night
_ 3-pointers with 3:38 and 2:49 remaining _ to put New York ahead
for good. Camby followed Johnson's three with a layup and the New
Yorkers in the building, waving orange towels behind the team's
bench, knew they were going back to Manhattan with a 3-2 series
lead.
</P>
<P>
   This was clearly a shocker for the fans at Market Square. Late
in the fourth, the marketing department showed a clip of
``Hoosiers'' in the Hoosier State to inspire the crowd. It worked.
But the crowd didn't have to guard Johnson. For that matter,
neither did any Pacer. Actually, focusing on Johnson is the easy
part. If you dare look at the larger picture, you'll see that the
Pacers allowed the Knicks to score 36 fourth-quarter points, 1 shy
of the most the Pacers have ever allowed in one quarter in their
playoff history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not very pleased with our defense,'' said Bird, who
looked disgusted after Johnson's second three went down. ``We
worked on playing decent defense, but it collapsed at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony of the night is that Miller, who had been the subject
of much analysis over his departed shot, scored 30 points. When
told that, he shrugged and said, ``I'd rather have the 12 I had in
New York and win the ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   There was the irony of Johnson, too. If you polled 100 Knicks
fans before the season, 90 would have begged you to take Johnson
and his outrageous contract off the team's books. The man known as
LJ is not suddenly as beloved as Walt Frazier was in the 1970s, but
he is gaining a reputation as a clutch player.
</P>
<P>
   Making the story even crazier is that Patrick Ewing watched all
of this from the bench. He is out of the playoffs with a torn
Achilles'. And, as you can imagine, his team's run without him will
certainly stoke the ``We don't need Patrick'' cries in the
offseason. But no one is thinking about that now. The Knicks
watched the Pacers score the first 9 points of the game, then
watched a 19-4 Indiana run for a 28-14 deficit. Yet, they won.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like an impossible dream two months ago,'' veteran
forward Herb Williams said. ``We've proven to be a pretty good team
after all.''
</P>
<P>
   Following Camby's layup that made it 91-84, Miller made a three
of his own with 1:59 left. But the Pacers wouldn't get any closer
than 4 points the rest of the night. They got their points from
Miller and 18 rebounds from Dale Davis. That was irrelevant by the
end of the night. They wanted to play defense and they wanted to
win. They could do neither. They are now 48 minutes away from being
knocked out of the playoffs.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ There was a driving layup by Latrell Sprewell
that glanced off the rim and hung in the air like a bubble. The
ball was right there, for anyone who wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   That is when Marcus Camby cut a diagonal across the lane and
soared above the paint as if on a magic carpet ride. If he was,
there was room on it for the whole team as he took Sprewell's miss
and turned it into an emphatic dunk that provided the New York
Knicks with a lead they would embrace for the final six minutes of
their 101-94 victory over the Indiana Pacers in Game 5 of the
Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Only when the drama of this tense night ended did Camby throw a
fist in the air against a background of emptying seats at a silent
Market Square Arena. Those fans remaining were in disbelief. But
the improbable has become a habit for this team. The resilient
Knicks are one victory away from advancing to the NBA finals
against the San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're close,'' Camby said. ``Just to have the opportunity to
be one win from the finals, it's a dream come true.''
</P>
<P>
   With a 3-2 lead in this best-of-7-game series, the Knicks will
play Game 6 at Madison Square Garden on Friday night. Camby put
them in this position. He finished the night with 21 points, six
blocked shots and 13 rebounds off the bench and provided the kind
of energy that transferred to the rest of his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the bounty wasn't big enough,'' coach Larry Bird said,
referring to the description coach Jeff Van Gundy used to describe
the physical play against Camby he expected from the Pacers. ``He
gets better every time we play. We want to keep a body on him but
we can't seem to find him.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Camby was everywhere. His dunk with 5 minutes 55
seconds left in the game gave the Knicks an 81-80 lead. The Knicks
then clamped down on defense and came up with a stream of big shots
_ which included back-to-back 3-pointers by Larry Johnson near the
3-minute mark _ to keep their advantage.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't of the miracle variety, but Johnson's long-range
accuracy was almost as uncanny as the ones he nailed to give the
Knicks Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't consider myself a 3-point shooter,'' Johnson said.
``But I can hit them. As you can see, I can hit them.''
</P>
<P>
   Latrell Sprewell fed Johnson for one of those shots. After being
invisible for most of this series, Sprewell came out of the chute
firing away. If he missed, he didn't care. He just kept coming and
thriving on the fast break on his way to 29 points. Beside him, the
previously quiet Allan Houston also caught fire in the second half
and finished with 19 points. That effort countered the Pacers'
Reggie Miller, who broke out of his shell with 30 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it's right there for us,'' Sprewell said. ``We have to
win one more game and we're there. To do it, we have to play like
we did in the fourth quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, the Knicks overcame a five-point deficit with 10
minutes left by shooting 10 for 15 from the field while the Pacers
were 9 for 20. Camby had four rebounds, while Johnson scored 12 of
his 17 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry's 3's were huge,'' Van Gundy said. ``Sometimes it comes
down to misses or makes. And we made tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, it seemed Miller was going to lead his team to
victory. The Pacers had a 14-point lead after the first quarter but
the Knicks hung in and stayed close. They were within six points
early in the fourth quarter. Houston came through and delivered a
flurry of baskets, but it was Camby who kept the chances alive with
rebounds, tips and blocked shots. This from a player who couldn't
get time on the floor early in the season, but persevered and
gained the trust of Van Gundy.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see where we started off, and to see where we are now, it's
a great feeling,'' Camby said. ``Everyone was writing us off. We've
come a long way to be this close to a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   That dream is so close to becoming a reality. But home court has
meant little in this series. The Pacers took Game 5 at the Garden
with a 12-point victory. Undaunted, the Knicks came right back and
weathered whatever runs the Pacers had in them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played in spurts tonight,'' Mark Jackson said. ``You can't
do that. They were on a roll and kept us from doing things we
wanted to do. This is far from over.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that far. The Knicks will have the energy, emotion and drive
from their home crowd on Friday night. But they'll also need the
kind of results they got Wednesday night. Both Sprewell and Houston
clicked together and combined to score 48 points on 15 for 36
shooting and got to the free-throw line 20 times by being
aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were also able to hold the Pacers to 41 percent from
the field, which allowed them to get some easy baskets in
transition off missed shots.
</P>
<P>
   Although they were in foul trouble early, they played smart and
kept their main players in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Camby produced in the crunch and came up with the dunk off the
Sprewell miss that allowed the Knicks a chance to never look back.
If they work it right, they won't have to come back to Market
Square Arena again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about coming back here; it's about getting to the
finals,'' Van Gundy said. ``Obviously, you want to come out and
advance. The other team has to have something to do with it, too.''

SHOCKED PACERS LAMENTING ANOTHER BLOWN OPPORTUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The Indiana Pacers slunk out of their own gym on
Wednesday night, amazingly unnoticed by what remained of their
fans, who were preoccupied with booing the jubilant New York
Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Just 24 hours before Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals,
the Pacers had stood in Market Square Arena after a practice and
spoke of a renewed confidence now that the series was tied and the
home-court advantage was theirs again. But on Wednesday night, that
ebullience had evaporated, sucked up by the shock of a 101-94
Knicks victory that puts them one victory from the National
Basketball Association finals. Game 6 is Friday night at Madison
Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   After opening a 14-point lead in the second quarter, the fizz
went out of the Pacers as quickly as a bottle of champagne bereft
of its cork. Inexplicably, they looked worn and frazzled, like a
team that in the course of the second half had aged several years _
several years too long for them to make a run at a championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed right now,'' a subdued Mark Jackson said in
an utterly silent locker room. ``We had them were we wanted them.
We jumped out and played great. It's incredible how the mood swings
this deep in the playoffs. We're hurt right now, but this is far
from over. The mood right now is disappointment, but that's because
we lost, right now, the biggest game of our lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating because we had the opportunity to take care
of business at home and we didn't do it twice. We're a team that
lives dangerously. I don't know why. I wish I knew why. We didn't
put them away when we had a chance. But it's not over. I'll be on
the plane with everyone else going back to New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers had as few answers for what went wrong as they did
for the Knicks' firepower.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Camby confounded them all over the place and Larry
Johnson fried them with two fourth-quarter 3-pointers. While Dale
Davis had 12 points and 18 rebounds, and Reggie Miller finally
unleashed his shot for 30 points, the Pacers got little else from
anyone. They had only one assist in the critical third quarter, an
astoundingly small number for a team that passes the ball with ease
and skill.
</P>
<P>
   Their feet seemed stuck in quicksand, every movement clumsy and
ill timed. The heroes who had saved them in Game 4 virtually
disappeared. Jalen Rose had just 6 points. Chris Mullin, who
outplayed Latrell Sprewell in Game 4, had 13 points, but they were
quiet. And he was matched up frequently against Camby, who was as
energetic as the Pacers were lethargic. The Pacers gave up 36
points in the fourth quarter and let the Knicks shoot 66.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   After the loss in Game 3, Davis had lamented the lost
opportunity to put the Knicks in a 3-1 hole. Before Game 5, he was
sure the Pacers would not let such a chance slip away again.
Afterward, he dressed, shook his head when he was asked for a
theory of what went wrong. ``We just had too many breakdowns at
critical points,'' Davis said. ``We let a good opportunity go to
waste once again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We became too predictable,'' was how Rose described it. ``Any
time that happens, it's tough to win. They took it to us. They knew
the calls we were running and they did a good job of calling them
out. It was a game we felt we were going to play with intensity.
You can't excuse it, that's why we're in the losing locker room.
Now it's do or die. We've got to win with heart, with character,
the things we had throughout the season. But none of that matters
if we don't win.''
</P>
<P>
   They will have to win under the most trying circumstances. As
confident and relaxed as the Pacers seemed after Game 4, the Knicks
will surely be even more confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're never lost two at home and had to go somewhere else with
our back to their wall,'' Miller said. ``But we've got to play much
better than we did tonight. For us, it's a one- game season.'' &QL;

the well-oiled machinery of U.S. women's soccer on and off the
field, the simple act of catching the Mexican team bus can turn
into an action movie. By Jere Longman.

   &UR; CIRCUITS (Moved in ``a'' category) &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   MICROSOFT-OFFICE-2000 (Undated) _ Office 2000 hit the shelves
this week and this complete overhaul of Microsoft's suite of
so-called productivity applications offers many new features _ and,
predictably, a few new irritations. But its most remarkable
innovation is the way the entire family of applications seamlessly
interacts with the Internet, in essence recasting cyberspace as the
World Wide Hard Drive. By Rob Fixmer.
</P>
<P>
   REFUGEES-INTERNET (Fort Dix, N.J.) _ On the scene with Kosovo
refugees at Ft. Dix as they use newly installed Internet
connections to find family in Kosovo. By Lisa Guernsey.
</P>
<P>
   ANTHROPOLOGISTS-TECHNOLOGY (Undated) _ Anthropologists go to
work for the high-tech industries to analyze how people use
technology, and have an effect on design and marketing. By Katie
Hafner.
</P>
<P>
   STEINWAY-TECHNOLOGY (New York) _ Computer technology makes its
way into a Steinway piano factory. By Catherine Greenman.
</P>
<P>
   SMART-MICROWAVE _ New microwave oven that knows how long to cook
food and warns of potential allergens (as long as the food maker
notes them in the label or bar code). By Lisa Guernsey.
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER-VIRUS _ Symantec team hunts for computer viruses. By
Michael Marriott.
</P>
<P>
   POWERS-GAME-REVIEW _ Review of the Austin Powers Trivia Game.
</P>
<P>
   SHAREWARE-REVIEW _ Review of best shareware sites.
</P>
<P>
   NIGHT-VISION _ Night vision products.
</P>
<P>
   Q&AMP;A _ Recovering files from a dead hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   GEEK-NOTES _ New e-mail device; ergonomic mice; a survey looks
at spam; searching for the slightest Web connections.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HOME (Moved in ``l'' category) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EAMES-EXHIBITION (Undated) _ You could smell the plywood at the
Library of Congress, where ``The Work of Charles and Ray Eames: A
Legacy of Invention,'' an exhibition of the two American designers'
multi-faceted achievement, recently opened. By William L. Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   WEGMAN-AT-HOME (New York) _ At home with William Wegman, who is
just now putting the final touches on a memoir (to be published
Oct. 1) of living and working with Fay Ray, the Weimaraner who
helped to make him the world's most famous dog owner and
portraitist. By Julie V. Iovine.
</P>
<P>
   SHAG-RESURGENCE (Undated) _ There's nothing quite like a good
shag. Its long, soft wool demands to be stroked, petted like the
pelt of some rare mountain sheep. The thing is almost obscenely
sexy, a vaguely naughty artifact from a more swinging age that
makes you want to exclaim, in a bad impersonation of Austin Powers,
``Oh, behave!'' By Rick Marin.
</P>
<P>
   OUTDOOR-FLOORS (Undated) _ An outdoor floor used to be forever.
To install a terrace, patio or deck meant waiting on professionals,
with their own inscrutable timetables. Now, with do-it-yourself
kits and loose-lay flooring, you can just about bring home the deck
and put out the lounge chairs. By Marianne Rohrlich.

DODGERS OFFENSE WAKES UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The optimism permeates the Dodgers these days
because they are looking to extend on anything positive.
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, the Dodgers' 7-2 win against the Texas Rangers on
Wednesday at Dodger Stadium seems like any other idle win in a
frustrating two months of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Yet breaking a three-game losing streak gave some of the players
a different feeling than other wins this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been easy,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.
``We needed something to happen to break the tension. Maybe tonight
was the night. I haven't said that a lot, but I'm saying that
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers scored six runs in the fourth inning, their
second-most productive one-inning output of the season. Eric Karros
hit a three-run homer, slumping Eric Young had three hits and three
RBI, the Dodgers got out to a big lead and Kevin Brown was
impressive and sound in beating another of his former employers.
</P>
<P>
   Those are important ingredients that some are taking stock in.
</P>
<P>
   ``This win, it's big,'' said Dave Hansen, who started at third
and walked in the crucial fourth inning. ``I don't know how big,
but it's a big win for a lot of reasons. The little things that
happened are huge within the ball club.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have had trouble scoring runs, and have rarely given
their pitchers big leads. Karros did that with his eighth homer of
the season when he hit a Mark Clark (3-5) fastball over the
left-center field fence to give the Dodgers a 3-0 lead. It was his
first homer since May 27.
</P>
<P>
   Young, the catalyst for the Dodgers offense, broke out of an
0-for-16 slump Monday, hit a game-tying homer Tuesday and went 3
for 5 in the series finale. He had seven hits and six RBI in the
three-game series with the Rangers and raised his average 19 points
to .268.
</P>
<P>
   Young also had the hit that broke the game open. Catcher Angel
Pena's RBI single put the Dodgers ahead 4-0 and Young capped the
six-run inning with a two-run single that squeezed past the glove
of Rangers third baseman Todd Zeile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what we needed,'' Johnson said. ``A little offense, a big
spot. I almost forgot we could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   It also provided Brown with a comfortable cushion that he is
unlikely to want to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take that any time,'' Brown said after improving to 7-3.
``No doubt about it, a little breathing room was much
appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown allowed two runs on five hits in eight innings. He struck
out six and walked three in silencing one of baseball's best
lineups.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers (35-23) were third in the major leagues in hitting
(.285) and fifth in runs scored (325), yet managed only a two-run
single by Rusty Greer in the fifth off Brown.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Brown retired the last 10 batters he faced and improved
his record to 5-1 after a Dodgers loss.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the first time in four starts Brown defeated the
Rangers, the team that drafted him in the first round (fourth
overall) in 1986. Brown pitched six full seasons for the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any win is a good win,'' Brown said. ``I don't care if it's
Texas as in Houston or Texas as in the Rangers.''
</P>
<P>
   However, whether this win is a catapult won't be determined for
a while.
</P>
<P>
   What it did do was send the Dodgers (29-29) into today's off day
in a much better frame of mind and the ``comfort'' of being .500 a
day after dropping below it for the first time since April 26 when
they were 9-10. Ironically, Brown won on April 27 against Milwaukee
to trigger a season-high five-game winning streak. The Dodgers also
won seven of nine games, beginning with that Brown win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some moments where we thought we had the ball
rolling,'' Karros said. ``We haven't had that run of 10 or 15 games
in a row where we play well. Even the Florida Marlins won seven in
a row. It's been a collective lull for (us). We haven't gotten the
big hit, or made the big pitch. It's been a collective effort where
you can't really single out one thing.''

<P>
   Maybe in a few weeks the Dodgers will point toward this win as
the reason for their resurgence. Of course, the chances are 50-50
that won't happen.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: GOP poll shoots GOP gun position
 &HT;    For release June 13, 1999.
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Could the message be any clearer to the GOP and the NRA? The
public wants something done about the misuse of guns. Note
carefully: I said misuse of guns, not banning them.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent message was delivered from within the Republican
Party in the form of what the Associated Press described as
``internal Republican polling.'' I presume that means registered
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The poll showed support in the vicinity of 80 percent for an
increase in the allowable age for handgun purchases, background
checks for gun show sales, safety devices for guns and mandatory
sentences for felons who commit crimes with guns.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this overwhelming finding, the Republicans and the
Democrats continue to spar with various forms of legislation
regarding guns, with the anti-gun forces scorching the National
Rifle Association and the pro-gun people standing behind ancient
arguments and splitting hairs.
</P>
<P>
   The public does not want hairs split. I don't believe the public
wants guns banned either, at least not most guns. The public wants
an end to this political fiasco that results in many dead people.
</P>
<P>
   What is missing in the gun argument is a sense of concession, a
sense of trying to understand each other's side.
</P>
<P>
   The internecine combat going on on Capitol Hill this past week
over varied versions of House and Senate bills, of President
Clinton posturing one way, the GOP leadership another has reached a
point where the public sits back in angry bewilderment over this
lack of comprehension.
</P>
<P>
   What the anti-gun people need to understand is that guns aren't
going to be outlawed, ever. Dilute the Second Amendment, chance
losing the First as well, and so on. Some weapons, the kind that
can mow down armies rather than elk, possibly can be banned, but
that's really not the biggest issue of the gun control war.
</P>
<P>
   Who gets the guns, how they get them and how we try to keep
track of them is the critical issue.
</P>
<P>
   What the pro-gun people need to comprehend is that their
absolutism does them ill. They've got to give a little while still
protecting their right to own guns. But to start splitting hairs
over legislation that would require waiting periods over sales at
gun shows is not what the public wants. There is just no reason _
constitutional or otherwise _ why it is OK for a maniac to buy a
gun at a gun show and not have to go through a background check,
while he would have to at a regular gun shop.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control and banning guns are two terms that are inexplicably
mixed but are hardly the same. It is similar to driver's licenses
and autos. The person using the auto needs to be checked out; drunk
driving doesn't result in the auto being banned.
</P>
<P>
   You might think the poll taken by the GOP right after the
Littleton school tragedy would influence legislators to put aside
their stupid political posturing and listen to the people who sent
them to Washington, but it hasn't; nor has it stilled the lobbying
voice of the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) says Democratic Party pressure to pass
legislation as a result of the Littleton shootings is ``their
typical knee-jerk reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   So was declaring war after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Henry.
</P>
<P>
   No one is going to completely win this argument _ ever. But it
seems to me that if the Brady Bill types give in just a bit and the
NRA types pull back their troops slightly, we might be able to
agree on some things _ such as age restrictions, safety locks (that
work), mandatory sentencing and the silly nuance over background
checks that differentiate not only between gun shop and gun show
sales but within the gun show sales themselves _ the things that
poll showed so strongly.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP must have taken its poll for a reason, presumably to get
a handle on the public's pulse. What they got was the pulse of the
people within their own party. They asked for it, they got it.
</P>
<P>
   Now pay attention to it!

   1. GREEN GOLD Throughout civilization, emeralds have been
symbols of immortality, a cure for dysentery and preservers of
chastity. Why such reverence? Because emeralds are very rare -
rarer than diamonds. The reason they are rare, says geologist Alain
Cheilletz of the Centre for Petrographic and Geochemical Research
in Nancy, France, is because 'Earth's green gold' is a mixture of
elements that don't ordinarily get a chance to mix : ``They are a
mineral that shouldn't exist at all.'' By Robert Kunzig. From
Discover magazine. 1,000 words + photo.

TRYING DIFFERENT DRUGS HELPS HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE PATIENTS FIND BEST
TREATMENT High blood pressure is a major cause of heart attacks and
strokes, the world's two leading causes of death. Fortunately, in
most cases, it is possible to lower elevated blood pressure to safe
levels with medication. But finding the right drug for patients is
often difficult because different individuals can react very
differently to the same blood pressure medication. Researchers
report that patients may be able to find the drug that is best for
them if they first try out several different medications before
settling on one treatment. By Michael McCarthy. The Lancet. 1,000

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Lessons of the Never Mind War
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Far from bringing joyous crowds boiling into the streets of
alliance nations, NATO's victory in Kosovo has raised barely even a
lazy, passing huzzah. We have prevailed in the Never Mind War.
</P>
<P>
   For all of the vast public indifference to either its waging or
to its successful conclusion, the war nonetheless accomplished
important ends. Serbia has been isolated in a way _ and damaged to
a degree _ that it will be unable to excite further Balkan mischief
even if its chief mischief-maker, the regrettable Slobodan
Milosevic, clings to power. A nation led by an indicted war
criminal does not enjoy great international cachet.
</P>
<P>
   Ethnic cleansing has been forbidden and defeated. NATO has
asserted, where great horrors are being written, the primacy of
human values over the political technicalities of dubious
statehood. No, governments may not devastate their own people as a
right of office.
</P>
<P>
   NATO must now shepherd a million Albanian Kosovars to devastated
communities, prepare winter quarters for them, shield Serbian
Kosovars and defang the Kosovo Liberation Army (itself a sometimes
nasty bunch and revenge-minded), crank up war-crimes investigations
and arrests, aid rebuilding and establish and police a nanny
statelet for no doubt years to come.
</P>
<P>
   As expensive as the war was, the peace will be pricier. Yet the
cost of inaction would have been higher still _ in human waste, in
a modern precedent for indulged aggression and ethnic abuse and in
the creation of a permanent regional political irritant with the
potential _ and proven willingness _ to destabilize southern and
southeastern Europe, to whatever broader damage one can only guess
and fear.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
particularly, held NATO more or less steady against its centrifugal
few and gave it new cohesion, refreshed purpose and enhanced
credibility _ even, in an especially difficult trick, involving the
conflicted and anxious Russia as a diplomatic player and
peace-minder.
</P>
<P>
   And of less importance but interestingly, Clinton once again
utterly flummoxed his constant domestic detractors. The draft
dodger proved the armchair generals wrong in their universal claim
that the air campaign could not prevail and _ the ones who went
further _ that since ground war would not be easily prosecutable,
he should therefore have done naught.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional and would-be presidential Republicans have been
left stranded in various isolated positions of opposition, most
embarrassingly the House majority, which in effect voted to
surrender by refusing to vote support for NATO and then, befuddled,
authorized twice as much money for the war as the president thought
necessary. Say what?
</P>
<P>
   Heavy humanitarian and political labors lie ahead, as does a
potential pitfall: the temptation to believe that because this
bombardment worked, all we need do at the next frustration is to
pull the same trigger. For now, though, it would not be shameless
to let out a discreet cheer. Hey, team, we won.

APPLE CORE: `ER'S' NOAH WYLE PLAYS STEVE JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's Hollywood Stars
entertainment column) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Noah Wyle in
``Pirates of Silicon Valley.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Steve Jobs, the man who invented the Apple computer, is
obsessive, dictatorial, frequently irrational and often paranoid.
 &HT;    And Noah Wyle just loves him.
 &HT;    Wyle steps out of his character as ``ER's'' likable Dr. Carter
for a trip through the computer world as Jobs in Turner Network
Television's ``Pirates of Silicon Valley,'' airing June 20. Anthony
Michael Hall plays Jobs' archrival, Microsoft founder Bill Gates.
 &HT;    Jobs has his share of fans and his share of detractors. Count
Wyle among the former.
 &HT;    ``I'd like him if I met him,'' Wyle says after a quick lunch in
his suite at Los Angeles' Four Seasons Hotel. ``A journalist told
me she'd interviewed Jobs and asked him if he knew about our
project, and how he felt about me playing him. She said it was the
only time he smiled.
 &HT;    ``But you have to believe that a man like that sees this as
nothing more than a distraction.''
 &HT;    The film traces Jobs' career from his childhood through a
college identity crisis to his early struggling days, and on to
fame as the founding father of Apple and of California's Silicon
Valley, before a fateful showdown with Gates for supremacy in the
personal-computer business.
 &HT;    Jobs comes across as a man of vision, with an absolute
commitment to his business and his product. But he also emerges as
a control freak who demands absolute loyalty from his staff, works
them half to death with 90-hour weeks, humiliates employees in
public and refuses to share the company's wealth with his fellow
executives.
 &HT;    ``To do what he did he had to be the way he was,'' Wyle says.
``One of the most potent testimonials I heard about him was from a
former employee who said that he had never been treated as poorly
as he was by Steven _ he'd never been belittled or berated or had
his humanity questioned more.
 &HT;    ``But he also never had had a time when he had done better
work.''
 &HT;    Besides, Wyle relishes the chance to flex muscles he doesn't use
much as ``that nice Dr. Carter.'' But the actor knows that it is
the success of ``ER'' that has made everything else in his career
possible. He makes a point of putting the show first on his
priorities list, and in fact almost turned the chance to play Jobs
for that reason.
 &HT;    ``But as soon as I saw a picture of Jobs and saw that we bore a
more than passing resemblance to each other, and I realized the
dynamic, charismatic, conflicted character that he was, I jumped at
the chance,'' he says.
 &HT;    With George Clooney out of ``ER'' and Wyle signed for an
additional three years, he finds himself suddenly the mainstay of
one of television's most popular series. No one is more surprised
than the 27-year-old actor himself.
 &HT;    ``I didn't have much interest in working in television,'' he
says, ``so it's a wonderful irony _ the one thing I didn't want to
do has given me everything I've ever wanted.''
 &HT;    It's certainly a gratifying development for a young man who not
so long ago was most remarkable as the only boy in his class at The
Thacher School in Ojai, Calif., who decided not to go on to
college.
 &HT;    ``Not the most popular decision, I can tell you,'' he says with
a laugh.
 &HT;    Instead, he headed for Los Angeles and the enticing but unlikely
prospects of an acting career. After initially running into a
series of dead ends, he found a job as a busboy at a hotel
restaurant, a job he quit on the day he signed for his first movie,
``Crooked Hearts'' (1991).
 &HT;    ``The maitre d' left me on the payroll for another four or five
years,'' he recalls, ``just in case I needed my job back.''
 &HT;    Three years later he was cast in ``ER,'' and not long afterward
his picture was on the walls of teen-agers' bedrooms all over the
country.
 &HT;    His emergence as a sex symbol still bemuses Wyle, who values his
privacy _ especially now, when he's planning his wedding to
30-year-old Tracy Warbin, a makeup artist he met on the set of
``The Myth of Fingerprints'' (l997).
 &HT;    ``I would like to make it as private as possible,'' he says.
``It's sad, but it's the reality that the first call we made in
planning the wedding was to a security person. I have `ER' to thank
for that.
 &HT;    ``It's ridiculous to complain about it after reaping so many of
the benefits,'' he adds. ``Nonetheless, there are still moments
when your vulnerability is down and you think, `Why does that have
to be the byproduct of success?'''
 &HT;    Among the more welcome of those byproducts is the ranch estate
he and Warbin call home. Formerly the property of John and Bo
Derek, it's located in the rolling hills of the Santa Ynez Valley,
120 miles north of Los Angeles, and is the most obvious testimony
to the literally millions of dollars the show has brought him.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, he says, he's not extravagant. Other than ensuring
his mother's comfortable retirement and buying the ranch _ ``it was
a good investment,'' he insists _ he's put his money into blue-chip
stocks and conservative investments.
 &HT;    ``Any actor in my shoes would be smart to be smart with money,''
he says, ``and not believe million-dollar checks will come every
year.''
 &HT;    He credits Clooney for a lot of his financial savvy.
 &HT;    ``He's a blueprint for me, a very smart businessman who knows
the industry well,'' the actor says. ``I get advice from him very
often.''
 &HT;    Wyle hopes that his next three years on the series will be a
learning process in studio politics and production.
 &HT;    ``Hopefully I'll walk away having brought a few things to
fruition,'' he says, ``as well as earning a nice chunk of change.''
 &HT;    In the meantime, he likes what the ``ER'' writers have in mind
for Dr. Carter.
 &HT;    ``He's interested in going into the community, to the people who
don't necessarily make it into the emergency room, and in
practicing triage medicine in the streets. Have stethoscope, will
travel,'' Wyle says. ``And there was a sort of big-brother
relationship starting between him and a kid from the streets on a
scholarship, with Carter as mentor. I like that.
 &HT;    ``Taking doctors out of the hospital to show their personal
lives can mean that the further we leave the hospital behind, the
more it becomes a nighttime soap,'' he acknowledges. ``So anytime
we find a story line that involves the personal a bit but is still
steeped in medicine, it's always the way to go.''

   `Chocolate Lizards' a fast, fullfilling look at duo's life on
oil fields
</P>
<P>
   By Jay Milner
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   The guy sitting next to me at the table where several of us
semi-famous authors were sitting and waiting to autograph our books
said he was from Abilene, the one in Texas. He was a clean-cut,
fairly handsome young man whose book had a colorful jacket and
title, ``Chocolate Lizards.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his name was Cole Thompson. I saw on the jacket of his
book that he was a Stanford University graduate and his book was
published by St. Martin, a New York outfit. So, I picked up a copy
and read the blurbs on the back.
</P>
<P>
   Larry McMurtry called it a ``very entertaining example of West
Texas oil field Gothic.''
</P>
<P>
   Waylon Jennings said Thompson had ``captured'' the scenery and
ambiance of West Texas oil fields, ``even the insanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Darrell Royal said ``if you want a fast and funny crash course
in pickup trucks, cowboy boots and the search for oil, read
'Chocolate Lizards.'''
</P>
<P>
   I usually don't pay a lot of attention to book jacket blurbs,
but these three intrigued me: so, I bought the book and asked my
neighbor to sign it. Which he did, then he bought a copy of my
book, ``Confessions of a Maddog,'' and I signed it for him.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't read my new friend's book for a couple of weeks after
returning home with it. I was in the middle of ``The Return of
Little Big Man'' and other matters. When I did get around to it, I
found it was a fast, entertaining story, well told, that would, in
my opinion, make a dandy movie, starring that young fellow, Matt
Damon and Paul Newman or some other older star, maybe John
what's-his-name who played Roseanne's husband in that TV sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   You say Paul Newman and John What's-his-name are nothing alike?
If you read the book you'll see what I mean. They wouldn't play the
part alike, no doubt, but either could pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   See, the story is about this young Harvard graduate who has been
in Hollywood trying, very unsuccessfully, to make it as an actor.
He finally gives in to his father's pleas and, with money his dad
sends him (his dad's a professor at Harvard) heads back to Boston
on a bus.
</P>
<P>
   About halfway home, in West Texas to be specific, he loses what
cash he had left in a poker game with a con man and gets stranded
in Abilene, flat broke.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the story begins. This young, naive Harvard man
stranded in Abilene, Texas, with no money and ashamed to contact
his father for help.
</P>
<P>
   He winds up, by an interesting turn of events, working for Merle
Lusky, a hard-drinking, tough-as-nails, woman-loving wildcatter who
is about to lose his oil rigs and ranch to a crooked banker. That's
the part Newman or that other guy could play.
</P>
<P>
   The raunchy oil man hires the Harvard man (he calls him
``Harvard'') to help him concoct a scheme to save his ranch and
rigs and the way they do this is the bulk of the book. It is a
vivid and action-packed tale. They are aided and abetted by
Tex-Ann, a busty, gum snapping topless dancer imported from Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Author Cole Thompson is a graduate of Stanford, not Harvard, but
has a day job in the oil fields of West Texas. This is his first
book, but I predict he'll be able to drop his day job soon and earn
a living writing full-time.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, like some writers, he only grinds out a book every 35
years.
</P>
<P>
   And, I own an autographed, first edition of his first novel.
Someday it may be worth as much as $40, like the first book of
someone I know on today's market.

 &HT;    Sharon Stone and I make a gossip column
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGODOCHES, Texas _ Andy Warhol said we'd all have 15 minutes
of fame. Looks like I've received mine, so it's all downhill from
here. To steal columnist Dave Barry's line, I'm not making any of
this up. This is all gospel truth, and I have the newspaper clip to
prove it.
</P>
<P>
   A while back I wrote a column about a recent visit I made to
Palm Beach, Fla. for a Cox newspaper editor's meeting. I walked
around the island for a few days, took notes, and made some
observations about a small town whose residents by-and-large have
more money than God, love little white dogs and are fond of talking
incessantly on cell phones while lounging by the swimming pool.
Let's say I poked gentle fun at these folks, whose lifestyle is,
well, a bit different than mine and 99.9 percent of the people in
America.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Beach Daily News, which is owned by the same folks that
own this newspaper, published the column with an editor's note
apologizing for my backwoods attitude. It was all done in fun and
good humor. I realized this would not endear me to some people in
Palm Beach, though in truth the only reaction I received after it
ran were two e-mails from ex-residents who said they enjoyed the
column _ and both of them mentioned they had mothers still living
in Palm Beach who owned little white dogs.
</P>
<P>
   The editor of The Palm Beach Daily News, who has enjoyed calling
me Brutus, as in ``et tu Brutus,'' since the column ran, last week
sent me a clipping from The New York Post. A gossip columnist there
took offense to my column and saw fit to remark upon it.
</P>
<P>
   A little background. The New York Post is a tabloid newspaper,
the kind with screaming headlines, such as ``Six Killed In Bloody
Enchilada Battle.'' It revels in scandal, murder, mayhem and
corruption. That's why it's one of my favorite newspapers, though
it seems doubtful now that any future career move of mine will
involve a transfer to the Big Apple, not that I am looking.
</P>
<P>
   The column, called ``Neal Travis' New York,'' leads off with
sultry actress Sharon Stone's spokesperson denying that promoters
are using a double for her when she takes off her clothes, which
she seems to do quite often in films. I remember a movie a few
years back when it quickly became obvious that Ms. Stone was not
fond of underwear. I remember thinking that she best be careful.
Think how embarrassed her mother would be if she was in a car
wreck.
</P>
<P>
   The last item in the gossip column concerns the piece I wrote
about Palm Beach. It calls my name, as we say in East Texas, and
speculates about whether one of the Cox family members, who owns a
chateau in Palm Beach, ever saw the column written by one of her
``pesky'' newspaper editors. That's what the writer called me:
pesky.
</P>
<P>
   His sage advice: ``Never let the hired help hang out anywhere
near your private domain.''
</P>
<P>
   I can say with total confidence that this is the only time my
name and Sharon Stone's will be mentioned in the same big-city
gossip column. Me and Sharon, we're tight.
</P>
<P>
   Columnist Travis, who seems inexplicably defensive about a town
1,500 miles or more from where he lives, is worried that my
``diatribe'' and ``nasty column,'' as he put it, will hurt the
social standing of another Cox family member who still lives in
Palm Beach and recently had an art show. I'm thinking everything is
going to be OK. Newspaper people, apparently everywhere but New
York, have a sense of humor. At least that's what I'm counting on.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, I was most offended by his calling our fine little
Palm Beach paper a rag. Coming from The New York Post, that's like
being called ugly by a frog. As for me, in the words of Ben
Bradlee, portrayed magnificently by Jason Robards in ``All the
President's Men,'' which, coincidentally, I was watching while
writing this column in a Palm Beach hotel room that cost more daily
than my monthly electric bill here behind the Pine Curtain: I stand
by my story.
</P>
<P>
   But I appreciate the plug in The New York Post. If Sharon calls
Mr. Travis to complain about her mention in his column, I hope he
tells her to look me up some time. Maybe we can go underwear
shopping together at Wal-Mart.

 &HT;    If cars ran like computers

<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Computer magnate and multibillionaire Bill Gates
is alleged to have said that if the car industry had kept up with
technology like the computer industry has, we would all be driving
$25 cars that got 1,000 miles to the gallon.
</P>
<P>
   This bit of whimsy, sent to me by a friend, shows what would
happen if indeed Detroit built cars the same way personal computers
are:
</P>
<P>
   _ For no reason, your car would crash twice a day.
</P>
<P>
   _ Every time they repainted the lines on the road, you would
have to buy a new car.
</P>
<P>
   _ Occasionally, your car would die on the freeway for no reason,
and you would accept this, restart, and drive on.
</P>
<P>
   _ Occasionally, executing a maneuver such as a left turn would
cause your car to shut down and refuse to restart; in which case
you would have to reinstall the engine.
</P>
<P>
   _ Only one person at a time could use the car, unless you bought
``Car98'' or ``CarNT.'' Then you would have to buy more seats.
</P>
<P>
   _ Macintosh would make a car that was powered by the sun, was
more reliable, five times as fast, and twice as easy to drive, but
would only run on five percent of the roads.
</P>
<P>
   _ The oil, water, temperature and alternator warning lights
would be replaced by a single ``general car fault'' warning light.
</P>
<P>
   _ The airbag system would say ``Are you sure?'' before going
off.
</P>
<P>
   _ Occasionally, for no reason, your car would lock you out and
refuse to let you in until you simultaneously lifted the door
handle, turned the key and grabbed hold of the radio antenna.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dealers would require all car buyers to also purchase a deluxe
set of Rand McNally road maps, even though they neither need them
nor want them. Attempting to delete this option would immediately
cause the car's performance to diminish by 50 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   _ Every time a new car was introduced, car buyers would have to
learn how to drive all over again because none of the controls
would operate in the same manner as the old car.
</P>
<P>
   _ You would press the ``Start'' button to shut off the engine.

 &HT;    Perry receives mostly favorable reviews this session
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Lt. Gov. Rick Perry got fairly high marks for
his first session following Democrat Bob Bullock as presiding
officer of the Texas Senate. As might be expected, his fellow
Republicans were more lavish in their praise than were some of the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``You came in as a rookie, and you followed an icon,'' said Sen.
Bill Ratliff (R-Mount Pleasant) on the final night of the session
May 31. ``You mastered this job. You kept the Senate together at a
lot of times when it could have fallen apart. ... You had a good
session, Mr. President.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Eliot Shapleigh (D-El Paso) had similar kind words.
``Managing 30 bucking broncos in the shadow of an icon isn't an
easy task,'' Shapleigh said in an interview. ``He moved the agenda
with very few errors.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry, with glibness and a quick sense of humor, seemed quickly
in control from the Senate dais. However, in contrast to the
one-man rule often exercised by his predecessor, he acted more as a
referee than as someone deciding issues for the Senate. Even
Democrats gave him credit for stepping in and helping close deals
on some issues.
</P>
<P>
   But he had nowhere near as ambitious an agenda as the omnivorous
Bullock, who pushed big issues like school finance and water, among
others. Perry's own personal concerns, in fact, seemed limited
largely to requiring parental notification of abortions, which
passed, and allowing school vouchers, which the Democrats kept from
reaching the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Parental notification was dear to Gov. George W. Bush's
presidential campaign. Perry, who knows he wouldn't have been
elected lieutenant governor had it not been for Bush's coattails,
was only too happy to oblige.
</P>
<P>
   Bush paid lip service to vouchers but didn't push it. Perry did
_ causing some Democratic senators to note that it seemed a payback
to San Antonio multimillionaire James Leininger and other voucher
supporters for pumping more than $1 million into Perry's campaign
last year for TV ads.
</P>
<P>
   Perry's chewing out of some senators of both parties over their
reluctance to support some of Perry's pet issues cost him some
points, some senators said. One Democrat complained Perry's
decision to have standing five-member subcommittees to which bills
were directly referred meant the seven-member full committee had to
vote on issues without having been involved in public hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Whether any of that makes much difference in the long run
remains to be seen. Several senators _ and probably Perry, too,
though he doesn't admit it _ think he may be a very short-term
presiding officer.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush is elected president in 2000, Perry would move into the
Governor's Mansion. If Bush fails to take over the White House, the
general speculation is he would not seek another term as governor
in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   That could set the stage for a face-off for the GOP
gubernatorial nomination between Perry and U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey
Hutchison, who has indicated an interest in the job.
</P>
<P>
   Since Hutchison presumably will have just been re-elected to the
Senate in 2000 and have just renewed her name identification and
organization, some speculate Perry wouldn't take her on. In fact,
there has even been talk that Perry might stay out of that race,
let Hutchison become governor, and then she would appoint him to
her vacant Senate seat. He had talked before the 1996 election
about possibly running for the Senate if a vacancy occurred.
</P>
<P>
   That said, Perry has defied conventional wisdom before _
beginning with his switch to the Republican Party in 1989, for what
most thought was a very remote chance to unseat Democratic
Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower. But Perry did, and a decade
later, he's one election away _ though it's Bush's, not his _ from
becoming governor.
</P>
<P>
   And so on ... Some senators actually breathed easier with the
absence of the all-knowing Bullock and his unquenchable thirst for
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bullock had an unerring political antenna,'' said one
Democrat. ``He knew what was going on in your office before you
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the session, Bullock gave each senator a set of
longhorns on a swivel base. More than one senator would talk into
the longhorns, only half-joking that they were a camouflaged
antenna _ hooked to a transmitter that went straight to Bullock.

 &HT;    Safe travel: To go or not to go
 &HT;    By Cheryl Blackerby
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The Palestinian ``intifada,'' or
uprising, was underway in Israel. But I was still surprised to walk
into the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem in 1988 and find only
a monk.
</P>
<P>
   The usual crowds of tourists and pilgrims had been scared away
by the nightly news showing bombed city buses and streets patrolled
by soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   On my way out, I passed a lone British tourist. We stopped to
talk. ``A war is always the best time to travel,'' he said,
smiling, with no apparent sarcasm.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean to sound gruesome, but I have enjoyed a blessed
lack of tourists and increased graciousness from locals after ugly
well-publicized incidents.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris during a series of metro bombings, I felt even safer
than usual because of increased security. Who's going to rob me
with soldiers in fatigues nearby?
</P>
<P>
   Something awful happens and tourists naturally run the other
way. After all, who wants to think about safety when you're trying
to relax and have fun? Americans are especially cautious. Tensions
erupt in the Middle East and travelers cancel plans to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But now there's a war in Europe. Is it safe to go to Italy?
We're seeing stealth bombers and F-16s flying out of Aviano on the
nightly news. Should we go to Greece?
</P>
<P>
   And what about the Middle East and Africa?
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department Web site (http://travel.state.gov) is
getting 90,000 hits a day since NATO attacks began, double the
usual number.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous callers have sought guidance from the State
Department's hotline (202-647-5225) on whether they should go to
Serbia or countries nearby, or to countries that support or oppose
NATO action.
</P>
<P>
   At present, only four European countries have State Department
warnings, which means American citizens should not travel there:
Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia-Montenegro and Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
   These countries have State Department ``public announcements,''
which means you should heed the State Department's information and
then decide whether to go: Greece, Croatia, former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia, Moldova, Kyrgyz Republic and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Statistically, Americans are safer from terrorists in Europe
than they are from terrifying drivers on U.S. roads. The trick to
staying safe, if you judge by the numbers, is to vacation in
Croatia and stay off our highways.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, seven private American citizens (nongovernment
employees) died from terrorist attacks worldwide, according to the
Bureau of Diplomatic Security at the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the total number of U.S. casualties from terrorism
was 23, all killed in the bombing of the embassy in Kenya. Of
those, 12 were private citizens. On Florida roads, for example,
more than 2,000 people were killed in 1997, according to statistics
compiled by the University of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But for those going overseas, there are plenty of safety
precautions to consider, some of which go against the conventional
wisdom of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Most people think it's safer to travel with a group. But this
has proven deadly in Egypt and Uganda, where groups of tourists
were targeted and killed.
</P>
<P>
   Is there safety in numbers? ``There's no such thing as being
absolutely safe even in this country,'' says State Department
spokeswoman Nyda Budig. ``Hopefully, well-organized groups won't
take them to countries where there are warnings.''
</P>
<P>
   How about visiting U.S. embassies? The rule of thumb used to be
to stop by and get the latest safety information. But after the
bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya and the demonstrations at U.S.
embassies worldwide by Serb sympathizers, it might be more prudent
to call.
</P>
<P>
   One recently retired U.S. Embassy employee told me that friends
and associates of embassy workers now ask to meet in restaurants,
not at the embassies.
</P>
<P>
   And forget about wearing your New York Yankees cap. Contrary to
popular belief here in the States, not everybody out there likes
us. It's always best to keep a low profile.
</P>
<P>
   Stay away from demonstrations. Resist the temptation to watch,
and quickly walk the other way. You never know when they might turn
ugly. Since the beginning of NATO air strikes in Serbia, there have
been almost daily demonstrations at NATO-member embassies around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Buy health insurance, particularly a policy that includes
medical evacuation. And call the State Department's hotline about
the countries you're thinking about visiting.
</P>
<P>
   When you arrive at your destination, read newspapers, watch the
local TV news, take a shortwave radio if you're in a developing
country, and talk to fellow travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Then, try to relax.
</P>
<P>
   --Athens, Greece
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers marching in a daily ceremony are entertainment, not
cause for alarm. The U.S. State Department emphasizes that it is
not warning U.S. citizens against going to Greece.
</P>
<P>
   But a bomb placed at the Intercontinental Hotel in Athens killed
one person in April, and there were two failed bombing attempts,
one at the U.S. Consulate General in Thessaloniki.
</P>
<P>
   You might avoid the U.S. Embassy. Since the beginning of NATO
air strikes in Serbia, there have been almost daily demonstrations
in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   --Venice, Italy
</P>
<P>
   Gondola rides in Venice have always been a popular tourist
attraction. Now, war planes flying out of Aviano Air Base are
drawing crowds, too. Sightseers gather outside the base to watch
fleets of NATO planes flying round-the-clock sorties to the
Balkans. As a result, officials have built higher walls to shield
the tents housing new troops.
</P>
<P>
   It's pickpockets, not terrorists, that you need to watch out for
in Italy, according to U.S. State Department Consular Information.
</P>
<P>
   --Jerusalem, Israel
</P>
<P>
   Hassidic men pray at the Western Wall. Many tourists are making
religious pilgrimages here for the millennium. Travelers can call
the State Department for a brochure on safety in the Mideast.
</P>
<P>
   --Amboseli, Kenya: There are no State Department warnings
against travel to Kenya, though last year's embassy bombings are
sure to make tourists wary.
</P>
<P>
   5 TIPS FOR SAFE TRAVEL
</P>
<P>
   Safety in numbers used to be the conventional wisdom, but this
has proven deadly in the Middle East and Africa, where tourist
groups were targeted and killed.
</P>
<P>
   Reconsider visiting U.S. embassies. After the bombing of the
U.S. Embassy in Kenya and the demonstrations at U.S. embassies
worldwide, it might be more prudent to call.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about wearing your New York Yankees cap. It's always best
to keep a low profile and not broadcast being American.
</P>
<P>
   Buy health insurance, particularly a policy that includes
medical evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   Before you leave home, call the U.S. State Department hot line,
(202) 647-5225, about the countries you are visiting.

   RESTAURANTS-NOISE _ That sleek industrial look so popular in
restaurants these days has a sometimes intended, sometimes not
effect: noise. Restaurant owners say an energetic buzz can draw
younger customers, yet some are taking steps to cut down on the
commotion. Floataway Cafe, for example, is installing carpet in
early July because noise is the most common complaint they get.

   MONTSERRAT-VOLCANO _ MONTSERRAT _ This small island made
headlines when Soufriere Hills, its long-dormant volcano, awoke
from its slumber in 1995, eventually killing 19 people and forcing
the evacuation of much of the island. Although scientists
maintained that the northern third of the island was safe,
Montserrat's tourism industry was decimated. Still, 3,000 residents
_ of the original 10,000 _ refused to leave their homeland in the
hopes that their volcano would quiet down. The volcano continues to
steam, but scientists say it has entered a period of repose. So how
do you rebuild an island when so many roads, houses and schools
have been completely wiped out? (Emling, Cox News Service). 30.

here in 1994, building an $800,000 dream house on a cliff in Isles
Bay, a posh area often referred to as Montserrat's own Beverly
Hills. A year later, the island's long-dormant volcano erupted. But
the Kleebs, who say they have all their money tied up in their
retirement home, have refused to leave. They alone have stayed on
in the shadow of the volcano in open defiance of a government order
to leave the so-called danger zone. ``I'm 70 years old and I've
done everything I've wanted to do in this world,'' said Beverly
Kleeb, a retired psychiatrist from Michigan. ``If I have to be

 &HT;    All the buzz at restaurants
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Lee
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's a Sunday night at Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen, and
things are running at full cry. In the bar, blenders whipping up
margaritas and pina coladas barely make an impression over the buzz
of the crowd. The loudspeaker crackles with intermittent
announcements that tables are ready. In the dining room, the
chatter of hundreds of patrons fueled with swamp things and other
high-octane drinks bounces off the tin ceiling, colliding with a
Cajun soundtrack, clattering plates and the occasional shrieks of
children.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to hear the waiter, sometimes hard to hear your
companion across the table. Yet Pappadeaux, one of the most popular
restaurants in Gwinnett County, probably isn't the noisiest
restaurant in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel the atmosphere creates entertainment and the people
enjoy that,'' says Cris Reed, guest relations manager for the
Texas-based Pappas Restaurants, which owns Pappadeaux.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not noise, it's just people enjoying themselves and the
music.''
</P>
<P>
   If noise indicates enjoyment, diners should be having the time
of their lives. Restaurants are getting louder, often by design,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, when diners were asked about food, cleanliness, service and
other attributes in a National Restaurant Association survey, they
said they were least satisfied with noise levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a real fine line between too noisy ... and not noisy
enough _ read dead, not lively, not exciting,'' says John
Imbergamo, a Denver restaurant consultant. ``Finding that fine line
is what restaurateurs are trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve and Karen Robbins of Decatur celebrated their fifth
anniversary Friday at the Food Business, which ranked loudest in a
small Journal-Constitution spot check of noise levels at metro
Atlanta restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was leaning over toward Karen just so we could hear each
other,'' said Steve, 31, an accountant.
</P>
<P>
   He calls the downtown Decatur eatery ``the Neyland Stadium of
Atlanta restaurants,'' referring to the University of Tennessee
football venue renowned for its crowd noise. But, he adds, the good
food makes up for the overly loud ambience.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more, noise has become an issue,'' says Atlanta
restaurant designer Bill Johnson of the Johnson Studio, architects
for the Cheesecake Factory, Seeger's, Rio Bravo Grill and many
other restaurants in Atlanta and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Banging plates, background music and large parties have always
helped pump up the volume at restaurants. But as design styles have
changed, Johnson says, restaurants have gotten louder. Popular,
low-maintenance building materials such as wood, tile, plaster,
metal and concrete give a hip, industrial look _ and often an
industrial-strength sonic blast.
</P>
<P>
   Open floor plans, uncarpeted floors and ceilings without
sound-absorbing material bounce conversations across the room.
Factor in baby boomers who seem to be growing less tolerant of loud
settings, and you get complaints about clamor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's my age, but I tend to be looking for a quieter
environment these days,'' says Tim Zagat, publisher of the New
York-based Zagat restaurant guides. ``The funny thing is, it's a
two-edged sword. A lot of people don't think a restaurant is
exciting unless it's noisy.''
</P>
<P>
   Many restaurateurs would agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's really noisy it's probably busy and popular, and I
wouldn't change anything,'' says Pano Karatassos, president of the
Buckhead Life Restaurant Group, which owns Pano's and Paul's, the
Buckhead Diner, the Atlanta Fish Market and other dining spots.
</P>
<P>
   Karatassos remembers when noisy restaurants were unheard of in
Atlanta. In 1991, when the company opened Pricci, an Italian
restaurant in Buckhead, Karatassos worried about how loud it was.
He considered hiring sound engineers to improve the acoustics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would take business away,'' Karatassos says.
``But very quickly people got used to it. There's always going to
be somebody who might want to be in a more quiet room, but we can
accommodate that.''
</P>
<P>
   As co-owner of Bacchanalia and Floataway Cafe, Anne Quatrano
oversees restaurants that fall on opposite ends of the decibel
scale. Bacchanalia, in Buckhead, drew complaints about noise when
it opened. In response, its wooden floors were covered with carpet
and the restaurant now has a reputation as a quiet, intimate dining
room. This summer, Quatrano plans to tone things down at Floataway,
near Emory University. The restaurant's industrial-chic design
blends well with its home in a converted warehouse, but it's caused
a problem with acoustics, she says. The aluminum chairs and high
ceilings will stay, but the concrete floors will be carpeted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest criticism I get from people here at Floataway is
that it's noisy,'' Quatrano says. ``It's a mix. Some people like a
place that sounds like a lot's going on, and certainly we attract a
younger crowd here as a result of it than we do at Bacchanalia.''
</P>
<P>
   Count 27-year-old Dana Young, a sales representative from
Atlanta, among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't come here for intimate conversation,'' Young says.
``The tables are too close together for that. I usually come with
several friends and we're the ones making the noise. I don't even
notice the noise from the other tables.''
</P>
<P>
   Big groups keep noise levels high. At Fratelli di Napoli, a
family-style restaurant in Buckhead, owner Tony LaRocco installed
some soundproofing materials several years ago in response to
complaints. But large parties still keep the restaurant buzzing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to have just a fun, energetic dinner, it's a good
place to come,'' LaRocco says. ``If you're looking for a place
where you're sitting across the table holding hands and you can
hear a fork drop, it's not the place to go.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Food Business, host Paul Powell said the restaurant plans
to provide some noise abatement by installing carpet and other
sound-absorbing materials.
</P>
<P>
   Because noise levels have become such an issue, Johnson often
arranges for an acoustic consultant to check out restaurant designs
before construction begins. Fixing problems after a restaurant
opens can be costly.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Smith, president of the acoustic consultants Ballentine
Walker Smith of Kennesaw, estimates the average cost of carpeting
and adding sound-absorbing material in the tens of thousands _ and
that's without tearing out walls and major renovations. Many of
those who call for advice wind up forgoing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I tell them what they're going to have to do it depresses
them,'' Smith says, ``because it involves reconfiguring the way the
restaurant is laid out, and they can't afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   For diners, the best solution is matching a restaurant to the
mood. Increasingly, restaurant reviews include information on
noise. Some dining reviews indicate noise levels, as do restaurant
guides.
</P>
<P>
   Some loud restaurants do have quieter tables that can be
reserved. And visiting during off-peak hours should tone down the
volume too.

restaurants these days has a sometimes intended, sometimes not
effect: noise. Restaurant owners say an energetic buzz can draw

   MONTSERRAT-VOLCANO _ MONTSERRAT _ This small island made
headlines when Soufriere Hills, its long-dormant volcano, awoke
from its slumber in 1995, eventually killing 19 people and forcing
the evacuation of much of the island. Although scientists
maintained that the northern third of the island was safe,
Montserrat's tourism industry was decimated. Still, 3,000 residents
_ of the original 10,000 _ refused to leave their homeland in the
hopes that their volcano would quiet down. The volcano continues to
steam, but scientists say it has entered a period of repose. So how
do you rebuild an island when so many roads, houses and schools
have been completely wiped out? (Emling, Cox News Service). 30.

   MONTSERRAT-EXPATS _ MONTSERRAT _ On this island, Robert and
Beverly Kleeb are known as the ``cliffhangers.'' The couple retired
here in 1994, building an $800,000 dream house on a cliff in Isles
Bay, a posh area often referred to as Montserrat's own Beverly
Hills. A year later, the island's long-dormant volcano erupted. But
the Kleebs, who say they have all their money tied up in their
retirement home, have refused to leave. They alone have stayed on
in the shadow of the volcano in open defiance of a government order
to leave the so-called danger zone. ``I'm 70 years old and I've
done everything I've wanted to do in this world,'' said Beverly
Kleeb, a retired psychiatrist from Michigan. ``If I have to be
french-fried, then that's okay with me.'' (Emling, Cox News

TIMMS, GILLOM FOCUSED ON LANDING TITLE

<P>
   PHOENIX - Pilates and protein.
</P>
<P>
   Could these off-season conditioning regimens practiced by the
Mercury's two senior citizens be the magic bullets to bring down
the two-time WNBA champion Houston Comets and finally deliver a
professional basketball title to Phoenix?
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, they are the age-defiers of choice for
Michele Timms and Jennifer Gillom in their push for the
championship ring that slipped from their grasp some nine months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Up one game and 12 points in a best-of-three series with 7:24
remaining, the Mercury lost to Houston in overtime, 74-69, then
lost again, 80-71, in the deciding Game 3. The heartbreaking finish
left both the league's second-best player, Gillom, and the
underachieving Timms to take a long, hard look in the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the way from that second game up until say a month ago,
that game has not gotten out of my mind,'' said Gillom, runner-up
as WNBA Most Valuable Player behind repeat winner Cynthia Cooper of
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like if I had played a little bit better (she was sick
to her stomach after going 3 for 15 from the field in the overtime
game), we could have won it. I'll never forget it because we were
too close, and that was our opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Gillom, Timms could not even find individual solace.
Although her assist/turnover ratio improved (2.29, compared with
1.71), her other important statistics plunged dramatically _
scoring (from 12.1 per game to 6.9); steals (from 2.6 to 1.3). Her
shooting percentages from the field, line and three-point range all
dropped off as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a bad season, but it wasn't anywhere near how I'd
been playing the year before,'' Timms said. ``I'm trying to
recapture that form, I guess, and even take it to the next level,
and that is being hopefully a little bit smarter in my game.''
</P>
<P>
   With new two-year contracts that will take Gillom to age 36 and
Timms to 35, the Mercury's veteran leaders are not looking
elsewhere for a savior to emerge.
</P>
<P>
   If Edna Campbell and Clarissa Davis-Wrightsil live up to their
American Basketball League credentials, great. If 6-foot-8 Maria
Stepanova blossoms at age 20, even better.
</P>
<P>
   But if Timms and Gillom have to hoist the Mercury on their backs
for the 32-game season that begins Saturday, they're determined to
do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we're getting down to the finals (of their careers),
and if we want to do this, this is our year to do it,'' Gillom
said. ``It's not going to get any easier for us. We know the time
is now. I think she (Timms) is as focused as I am right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Timms' off-season focus was on regaining the step or more that
was missing in '98. For Gillom, it was a high-protein diet and
weight-training program that shed 20 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Timms, who believed she took too much time off after 1997,
played in the Australian WNBL and hooked up with Mark McGrath,
strength and conditioning coach at the Victorian Institute of
Sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really concerned because I was the heaviest I've been
the last two years and just sluggish and slow,'' Timms said.
</P>
<P>
   Through McGrath, she was introduced to Joseph Pilates, the
hip-again German boxer whose conditioning program developed in the
1920s has busted out of the ballet studio to be embraced by
Hollywood (Jodie Foster, Madonna, Vanessa Williams, Sharon Stone).
</P>
<P>
   Timms is blending the Pilates concept, designed to lengthen and
strengthen muscles, with sprinter resistance workouts.
</P>
<P>
   While backup point guard Kristi Harrower clings to an elastic
band connected to her belt, Timms sprints down the court, dragging
Harrower with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I'll take it off, and you just fly,'' said Timms, who put
up 18 points on Charlotte standout Dawn Staley in the Mercury's
first preseason game. ``It's all about letting your mind and your
body know you can turn your legs over.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrie Graf, the Mercury and Australian National Team assistant
coach, said, ``She's much more the player she was in '97. In fact,
I think she's better. From the signs I see, her body's back close
to what it was, she's got confidence, she's much more on top of
just her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timmsy's really at peace with herself and is saying, `I'm
going to maximize the end of my career.' I think that's exciting
for us because she's a great leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet no Mercury leads more by example than Gillom, who, following
the season of her life (20.8 ppg, 7.3 rpg), bypassed the
rubber-chicken circuit for a rigorous off-season of diet, knee
surgery and weights.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-3 Gillom shed 20 pounds to 175, her lightest since
she was a senior at Lafayette High School in Oxford, Miss., in
1982.
</P>
<P>
   Gillom said she used a protein diet similar to the one advocated
by Dr. Robert Atkins in his bestseller.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first time I ever saw fast results from a diet,''
she said. ``That's when I decided, `Hey, this may be it for me,'
and kept with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, instead of her beloved pasta and bread, Gillom opts for
eggs and bacon at breakfast, salad with chicken at lunch and hot
vegetables with meat at dinner.
</P>
<P>
   That might not help to sell ``Mercury Madness in the Kitchen,''
a cookbook in which Gillom's contribution is Pasta Carbonara, but
it has even those who know her looking twice to make sure it's her.
</P>
<P>
   She said at a recent commercial shoot in New York, ``I was
sitting in the chair doing my makeup and Rebecca (Lobo) comes in
and says, `Where's Jennifer? She's supposed to be here.' I thought
she was just joking around, but she was serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those kind of things are just like, wow, it must make that big
of a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I knew if I lost the weight, I had to try to keep myself
strong, so I started going in the weight room a lot more than I
have in the past. I feel strong. I'm still getting used to the new
body, especially on my fadeaway. Sometimes I can feel myself fading
too much because I'm used to the weight holding me in a certain
position.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first preseason game, Gillom suffered the worst shooting
(2 for 16) of her WNBA career and scratched out six points. Nine
days later, she was 12 for 18 for 27 points.
</P>
<P>
   Able to jump somewhat higher because of the weight loss and
arthroscopic left-knee surgery after a half-season in Turkey,
Gillom hopes for another improvement in her rebounding average and
perhaps an increase in the six double-doubles she logged in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury Coach/General Manager Cheryl Miller, her Hall of Fame
playing career cut short more than a decade ago by bad knees, can
relate to the urgency felt by the first two players allocated to
the franchise in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing like looking at your window and that window
gradually getting smaller and smaller,'' Miller said. ``They know
physically what it takes to get where we need to get. For them to
commit like they did was huge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it just has to transcend to leading this team, and that's
where I'm hoping they take that next step. You can be better
physically and as a ballplayer, but you need to make everyone else
around you better. It's the little things that will make us better
that I need both Michele and Jennifer to do consistently.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillom, like Timms, thinks playing a season or two beyond 2000
is possible, but the unpredictability of anything beyond next year
makes winning now mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   In a season in which other teams are catching up to the Mercury
in depth and Phoenix is without starting forward Michelle Griffiths
(on maternity leave), the road just as easily could turn the other
way.
</P>
<P>
   Without wins in its final three regular-season games in 1997 and
the last four in '98, the Mercury would be a two-time also-ran. The
margin of success is that thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get better than what I was last year,'' Gillom
said. ``I've never settled for what I've done last year. It was a
great season, but I thought this was something to even get better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to get a ring out of this some kind of way. I'm not
going to stop until I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditto Timms, whose ultimate goal is to win an Olympic gold medal
in Sydney before her countrymen. She has bronze medals from the
1996 Olympics and the '98 World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``My last two years I wasn't happy with, and I didn't want to go
out on such a bad note,'' she said. ``I want to go out on top, not
as though she should have retired a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way it was looking like. You're hearing the
whispers of what people are saying about you, I guess. I'd be very
disappointed if I went through my WNBA career without winning a
championship. It wouldn't sit right with me.'' &QL;

MILLER'S CHALLENGE: TRIM ROSTER TO 11 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Sleepless for 24 hours, Cheryl Miller expected to end
the angst and cut her Mercury roster to 11 after practice Tuesday.
She couldn't make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Pulling the trigger isn't getting easier for the third-year
coach/general manager, especially given the exponential rise in
talent since 1997, when the agonizing was over a developmental
player or two.
</P>
<P>
   Now some starters' jobs are on the line as Phoenix grasps for
the combination that will earn the rings it fell just short of
claiming last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question we're going to have to let go of people
who have been in this system,'' Miller said. ``I wish there was
some other way. I hate the WNBA for not going to a 12-player
roster'' _ a union initiative that was not included in the new
four-year collective bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   With the camp debut of 6-foot-5 Marlies Askamp on Tuesday and
expected arrival of 6-8 Maria Stepanova today, the Mercury roster
is at 14. If fourth-round draft pick Amanda Wilson and free-agent
center MerleLynn Lange-Harris are among today's cuts and no one
goes on the injured list, Miller will be down to one decision.
</P>
<P>
   Since Michelle Griffiths, a starter at power forward last year,
is sitting out the season while pregnant, all the returning post
players (Jennifer Gillom, Toni Foster and the European centers) are
safe.
</P>
<P>
   So are Australian point guards Michele Timms and Kristi Harrower
and the top three drafts picks _ Edna Campbell, Clarissa
Davis-Wrightsil and Lisa Harrison, all with American Basketball
League experience.
</P>
<P>
   By elimination, that leaves a pair of two-year starters, Bridget
Pettis and Umeki Webb, and 1998 reserve Andrea Kuklova for two
spots.
</P>
<P>
   Pettis, the Mercury's emotional leader and second-leading scorer
(690 cumulative points) is expendable only if all doubts are
removed about Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   But how can they be when the 5-8 shooting guard scored just four
points in one exhibition game and missed the other, plus a good
share of practice time, while protecting a left foot from a
possible fracture?
</P>
<P>
   ``To be perfectly honest, Bridget looks great,'' Miller said.
``So that's comforting to know that we can go in either direction
(Campbell or Pettis) and not miss a beat.''
</P>
<P>
   If Pettis is in, the choice is between Webb, the 5-10 small
forward who is losing her starting job to the 6-1 Davis-Wrightsil,
and the 6-foot Kuklova.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't beat yourself up over it,'' Miller said. ``Once it's
done, it's done. And it's like anything _ if you're going to do
something, do it with conviction. And that's what I've got to live
with.''
</P>
<P>
   And then get on with the job of finishing among the top three of
a Western Conference that most believe to be appreciably stronger
than the East, and of overtaking the two-time WNBA champion Houston
Comets in the West playoffs for another title shot.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell and Davis-Wrightsil, who has been protecting her foot
to avoid a ruptured plantar fascia, sat out the second exhibition
game. Much is expected from both in strengthening a perimeter that
put too much of a burden on Gillom, the league MVP runner-up.
</P>
<P>
   For the slimmed-down Gillom to be free for a full-time move to
power forward, Askamp or the 20-year-old Stepanova must emerge as a
starting center.
</P>
<P>
   Germany flopped to 12th at the European Championships, but
Askamp played big (18 points per game, tournament-high 12 rebounds
per game). The 28-year-old reported in the best shape of her WNBA
career and was immediately inserted into the Mercury's revamped
transition offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury opens at Sacramento on Saturday, then is home
against the Monarchs on Monday and against Cleveland on June 19
before embarking on a team-record seven-game road trip that
continues through July 3.
</P>
<P>
   If it comes through that stretch with a winning record, Phoenix
will be poised to finish strong, playing 14 of its final 22 games
at America West Arena. &QL;

1999: THE YEAR OF THE DUNK?  
 TEAMS GEAR UP AS SEASON NEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The WNBA Year 3 slogan makers settled for We Got Game, perhaps
because Summer Slam is under some pro wrestling copyright.
</P>
<P>
   But won't this certainly be the season when dunks _ we'll even
settle for just one _ come to U.S. women's professional basketball?
</P>
<P>
   A combined four-plus seasons between the WNBA and now-defunct
American Basketball League have produced a miss by Lisa Leslie in
the nationally televised WNBA debut and nothing since, except
Sylvia Crawley's blindfolded contest jam at the 1998 ABL All-Star
Game.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-4 Crawley was not one of the 35 ABL players chosen in
the 50-player WNBA draft last month, but there are plenty of other
new candidates to palm the smaller WNBA ball and deposit it where
no woman in America has since the University of North Carolina's
Charlotte Smith in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 6 feet tall, is a third-round draft pick of the Charlotte
Sting, while 6-7 Kara Wolters, third in the 1998 ABL dunk contest,
was a third-round choice of the two-time WNBA champion Houston
Comets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been dreaming about it (dunking),'' said Sacramento's 6-4
Yolanda Griffith, another ABL crossover and the second overall pick
in the draft. ``I can throw the ball down, and this ball is small.
I'm going for it if we're winning.''
</P>
<P>
   The tallest players in the WNBA are returnees: 7-2 Margo Dydek
of the Utah Starzz and the Mercury's 6-8 Maria Stepanova. Both dunk
in warm-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Starzz Coach Frank Layden now has a full season to cajole Dydek,
who thinks dunking is impolite, into making history. Large Marge
was the leading scorer (19.3 points) at the just-completed European
Championships as she and new Starzz guard Krystyna Lara took host
Poland to a title.
</P>
<P>
   Stepanova, a reserve for European bronze-medalist Russia, should
significantly better her playing time (6.5-minute average) with
Jennifer Gillom sliding to power forward. She has the mobility to
slam in transition.
</P>
<P>
   The point of who slams first or most is an aside to who wins
last, which common sense again says will be Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But the Comets have issues, beginning with the duel between
Sonja Henning and Jennifer Rizzoti to replace point guard Kim
Perrot, under treatment for lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Chemistry also will be an issue with the arrival of 1998 No. 1
draft pick Polina Tzekova of Bulgaria, who missed all of last
season because of her mother's poor health. Now this year's No. 1
pick, Russian forward Natalia Zasulskaya, faces the same family
crisis, and her availability is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is any doubt that everybody else has
closed the gap on us talentwise,'' Comets Coach/General Manager Van
Chancellor said.
</P>
<P>
   But if not Houston, with two-time league MVP Cynthia Cooper and
MVP-in-waiting Sheryl Swoopes, then who? Even picking 10th, the
runner-up Mercury came up with two new starters from the draft to
make the deepest team in the league more so, despite the maternity
absence of Michelle Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
   An expanded playoff format prevents a Houston-Phoenix finals
rematch. Each conference champion earns a bye while the second- and
third-place finishers in each conference meet in one-game
quarterfinals. A best-of-three series then determines each
conference champion and the league champion.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty of the 32 regular-season games are against conference
opponents. Eight teams begin play Thursday, with the Mercury
starting Saturday at Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   The addition not only of ABL talent but of Chamique Holdsclaw,
arguably the most heralded collegian since Cheryl Miller, has teams
as down as 3-27 Washington talking playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, we have a vision,'' former ABL MVP McCray said.
``Last year, we weren't so sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The same can be said of the Utah Starzz and Sacramento Monarchs,
neither of whom has managed more than 10 wins in each of the first
two seasons. And of the underachieving Los Angeles Sparks, who are
on their third coach, Orlando Woolridge, and have entrusted their
point guard position to rookie Ukari Figgs. At least Figgs, out of
NCAA champion Purdue, is familiar with the league's new hand-check
rule, which is consistent with how American women's college
basketball is called.
</P>
<P>
   Also new this year is the league's first All-Star Game, July 14
in New York, and expansion teams in Minnesota and Orlando. Next
year, the roster of teams grows to 16 with the addition of Portland
and Seattle in the Western Conference and Indianapolis and Miami in
the East.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could you have a league and not have us in it?'' Indiana
Pacers President Donnie Walsh modestly declared Monday. ``This
legitimizes the WNBA.''
</P>
<P>
   WNBA President Val Ackerman might remind Walsh that the league
bettered 1.6 million in regular-season attendance last year and
expects to maintain a 10,000-plus per-game average even with
expansion to Minnesota and Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, Phoenix, New York and Washington averaged 12,600 to
15,900, with Cleveland and Detroit cracking the 10,000 barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana and company will have a ways to go with ABL leftovers
and inexperienced collegians to catch up with their brethren next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we've proven beyond a doubt the existence of an
audience for women's professional basketball,'' Ackerman said. ``We
have found a different fan base than the NBA. The fan support we've
had has been truly amazing.'' &QL;

DOSE OF REALITY A SHOT IN THE ARM FOR MTV'S `REAL WORLD' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA MITCHELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new season of ``The Real World premieres'' Tuesday on MTV, and
if the first episode is any indicator, expect this cast to bring
back the ``reality'' that made the show's early seasons so
captivating.
</P>
<P>
   When the dysfunctional docu-soap debuted in 1992, its concept
was simple: Pick seven strangers to live together and have their
lives taped to find out what happens when people stop being polite
and start getting real.
</P>
<P>
   A mostly Gen X audience tuned in weekly to see what the
roommates _ Julie, Eric, Heather, Kevin, Norman, Andre and Becky _
were up to in their Manhattan loft. Was Julie still a virgin? Could
model/actor wannabe Eric keep his shirt on? Would Kevin be angry,
again?
</P>
<P>
   It was new. It was fresh. And, except for Eric, we rarely felt
like cast members were posing for the cameras. Reality-based
programming was becoming a part of our TV culture, and we liked it.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Real World'' has never been as ``real'' as its debut
season. Because producers must cast from a pool of people who grew
up watching the show, it got harder to find those capable of
keeping it real. Remember the revolting Puck of the 1994 San
Francisco cast? His every action was contrived.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has the concept remained simple. We long for the days when
cohabitation was all MTV asked of the roommates. In 1996, the Miami
cast struggled to start a business. We struggled to stay awake.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these flaws, we remain fans (ratings have increased 73
percent since the show's debut) because sparks of reality continue
to fly each season. Nothing has been more real than the life and
death of Pedro Zamora, an HIV-positive AIDS educator from the 1994
season in San Francisco. He died from AIDS-related complications
just days after the last episode aired.
</P>
<P>
   The seasons that followed _ London, Miami, Boston, Seattle _ had
their high, and low, points, but it always felt like the roommates
were too aware of the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle cast certainly had its ``real'' moments, including
Stephen slapping Irene. But it looks like the new season, set in
Hawaii, will bring the series back to its original glory.
</P>
<P>
   The cast, ranging in age from 19 to 22, seems oblivious to the
cameras. Today's young people have spent their formative years in
front of one lens or another _ at ATMs, in department stores, at
work _ and can watch others' lives unfold on the Internet. Perhaps
they've been desensitized to cameras.
</P>
<P>
   The one-hour season opener airs Tuesday night. More than 23,000
auditioned for the Hawaii season, but only seven made it. Let's
meet them:
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Ruthie,  &LR; 21, Hawaiian native, Rutgers University student,
bisexual with a girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   In the first episode, Ruthie skinny-dips, drinks nonstop and
passes out in a bar. Two roommates take her home, where she has a
seizure, then is rushed to the hospital with alcohol poisoning. The
roommates hold an intervention, and producers, who say Ruthie hid
her alcoholism during the screening process, allow her to take a
30-day leave of absence.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Kaia,  &LR; 22, African-American studies major at the University
of California-Berkeley, vegan, feminist.
</P>
<P>
   Kaia spends much of the season topless and announces in the
first episode: ``I really, really like looking at myself.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Teck,  &LR; 22, Illinois native, wannabe filmmaker, ladies' man.
</P>
<P>
   Teck is Ruthie's skinny-dipping partner in the first episode but
said during a recent interview: ``I didn't do it for shock
effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Ruthie, Teck and Kaia, MTV had to increase its
blurring budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent thousands of dollars blurring the nudity,'' said
supervising producer Matt Kunitz. ``We figured if they are this
comfortable being nude, then we don't want to stifle that.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Amaya, 21, UCLA grad, sunny blonde, has issues with her body.
</P>
<P>
   Amaya takes care of the drunken Ruthie and cringes at her
skinny-dipping roommates. Will she be the den mother? She also
falls for Colin, giving the show its first serious intra-cast
romance.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: FAST-FORWARDING THROUGH HISTORY
 &HT;    For release Sunday, June 13
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Rodham(cq)
said today, ``I shall go to Kosovo'' in a bid to extract U.S.
forces from the Balkan quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   Rodham's pledge to visit the shaky cease-fire lines as her first
presidential act was promptly assailed as ``an empty gesture'' by
Vice President Elizabeth Dole, the Republican choice to succeed
President George W. Bush in 2009.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasting from her Internet site, people-first.com, Rodham
cited what she termed ``the long litany of Bush blunders that have
compelled our brave women and men to forgo their role as
peacekeepers to fight a ground war against the Eastern Orthodox
Axis on behalf of the Islamic Brotherhood.''
</P>
<P>
   In announcing her intention to visit a divided Kosovo if
elected, Rodham retraced what historians regard as a possible
turning point in the 1952 U.S. presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   The eventual victor, Dwight Eisenhower, had said ``I shall go to
Korea'' in criticizing another unpopular war. After taking office,
Eisenhower secretly told the North Koreans and Chinese that he was
prepared to use nuclear weapons and carry the war to China if peace
were not quickly achieved.
</P>
<P>
   An armistice was promptly signed. The fact that some 40,000 U.S.
troops remain on Korean soil, some 55 years after that cease-fire,
has not emerged as an issue in the 2008 elections.
</P>
<P>
   As she readied her White House run after winning a second Senate
term from New York, Rodham has increasingly turned her attention to
foreign affairs. Her opponent in the 2006 Democratic primary, Rep.
Andrew Cuomo, D-N.Y., a former Cabinet member in the Clinton
administration, has endorsed the Dole-Bush candidacy as ``my
personal moral choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo had sought to make an issue of Rodham's scandal-driven
divorce from former President Bill Clinton, now a wealthy Internet
attorney. But the press corps, reporting under the newly mandatory
Universal Polling Guidelines, frustrated Cuomo's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   As a hundred million Americans prepare to vote in November on
the Internet, it is all but certain that Rodham has been
``inoculated'' against the issue of the now six-year-old divorce
proceedings. In a similar sense, Vice President Dole is seen as
having been ``inoculated'' against the ``Viagra hoax'' scandal that
once engulfed former Sen. Bob Dole, her 85-year-old husband and the
Second Spouse.
</P>
<P>
   But surveys suggest that both major party candidates face
political problems within a restive electorate in the wake of the
sporadic fighting in the Balkans that Clinton triggered in 1999 and
which Bush has not been able to halt. The prolonged hostilities
sparked the Turko-Greek-Cypriot War of 2004 that finally ruptured
the NATO alliance and revived the Cold War with the masters of the
Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is known to be weighing an exploratory mission to Moscow by
his trouble-shooting brother Jeb, the former Florida governor and
Dole's current running mate.
</P>
<P>
   The third-party tag team of Jesse Ventura and Jesse Jackson,
seeking to mount what they call ``a co-presidency'' in 2009, have
denounced both the projected Rodham and Bush trips as ``just more
messin' around.''

<P>
   Biblical critics have offered many theories that challenge the
credibility of the gospels and the events described in the New
Testament. But now, out of the catacombs of history, comes new
information that will startle skeptics and make the heart of
believers rejoice.
</P>
<P>
   Long buried in ancient texts are surprising accounts that will
revolutionize old assumptions that Thomas was the only apostle who
went to India, that the Jews of Jesus' time spoke Aramaic and not
Hebrew, that the four gospels were originally written in Greek and
that Mark's gospel was the first of them.
</P>
<P>
   This newly uncovered information further confirms that Matthew,
an eyewitness to the miracles and events of Jesus' ministry, was
indeed the author of the first gospel and verifies both the
Jewishness and early date of the first gospel.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have a clear mention that the Gospel of Matthew was
written in Hebrew -- not Greek or Aramaic, as widely thought -- and
was carried out of Israel by one of the original apostles to the
Far East.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the earliest church fathers and historians, Eusebius and
Origen, wrote that a second, long-overlooked apostle, Bartholomew,
also went to India and took a gospel text with him, according to
Princeton scholar and author Samuel Moffett.
</P>
<P>
   In his ground-breaking book, ``A History of Christianity in
Asia,'' Moffett reveals that Pantaenus, a church historian and
missionary who traveled to India in 180 A.D., discovered the copy
of the Gospel of Matthew in Hebrew that Bartholomew had taken with
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is reported,'' wrote Eusebius, a fourth-century bishop and
church historian, ``that among persons there who knew Christ,
(Pantaenus) found the Gospel according to St. Matthew (which had
arrived ahead of Pantaenus by more than a century). For
Bartholomew, one of the apostles, had preached to them and left
them (in India) the writing of Matthew in the Hebrew language which
they had preserved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a shock hidden in that rather matter-of-fact
statement. ... The surprise, of course, is the mention of
Bartholomew as the pioneer to the East,'' Moffett says.
</P>
<P>
   Many scholars are unaware of an apostle other than Thomas ever
going to India, and some even doubt that Thomas himself went.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Moffett ponders, ``What was Bartholomew ... doing in India with
a Hebrew Gospel of Matthew?''
</P>
<P>
   Why India?
</P>
<P>
   ``Jewish colonies are known to have existed in India from very
early times,'' Moffett writes, ``If there were, as tradition
asserts, Hebrew or Aramaic copies of the Gospel in circulation as
early as that, it is not unreasonable to imagine a Jewish
missionary using one in his evangelistic work, for it was the
apostolic missionary tradition to preach first to the Jewish
community.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, two historical records -- the New Testament's
Book of Acts and the writings of the Church Fathers -- confirm some
of Moffett's assertions.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Gospels were so thoroughly Jewish, there was no
concept among Jewish believers of preaching to gentiles. According
to Acts, Jewish believers in Israel were horrified to learn that
Peter entered a gentile home and preached to gentiles. Jews did not
preach to gentiles until the Jewish believers fled from persecution
to the Greek city of Antioch in Asia Minor.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While the Book of Acts lists the 11 apostles -- Judas having
hanged himself -- it doesn't say how they were paired. But what is
known is that Jesus instructed his disciples to work and travel by
twos.
</P>
<P>
   So, it would be natural for Thomas to travel with a companion to
India and for Bartholomew to have taken along a freshly copied text
of Matthew's gospel, especially if it was the first and only gospel
written at the time. Jews customarily took their sacred texts with
them, as we see from the New Testament accounts of Paul's travels,
and it was this Gospel of Matthew that Pantaenus found a century
and a half later in India.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Like many Jews of the early centuries, Pantaenus became a
follower of Jesus. But it is not only Pantaenus' academic
background as philosopher, his founding of the great theological
school in Alexandria and his two renowned disciples, Clement and
Origen, that make him so important here.
</P>
<P>
   As Moffett writes, ``The fact that Pantaenus was ... Jewish ...
explains his particular attention to the Hebrew copy of the Gospel
of Matthew.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that he returned to Alexandria with the same gospel
adds enormous validity to its discovery.
</P>
<P>
   These discoveries about Bartholomew going to India, the
existence of the Gospel of Matthew in Hebrew that was probably
written before A.D. 50 and the same text being returned to the West
add ``another piece of evidence of once again very early dating of
the New Testament,'' said Douglas Cecil, associate professor of
pastoral ministries at Dallas Theological Seminary.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do we now know where some of the apostles traveled but
also that Hebrew was far from a dead language at the time of
Christ, as many scholars espouse, and it evidently was used by Jews
all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   In search of what language was used during the time of Christ,
we find some interesting clues. Scholar George Howard, in his book,
``The Gospel of Matthew According to a Primitive Hebrew Text,''
quotes an early second century writing by Papias (ca. 60-130 CE),
bishop of Hierapolis in Asia Minor, as stating that ``Matthew
collected the oracles in the Hebrew language.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard goes on to say, ``It has become commonplace (for the past
century and a half) to suppose that by 'Hebrew,' Papias meant
'Aramaic.' The subsequent discovery of many ... Hebrew documents
from Palestine from the general time period of Jesus now show
Hebrew to have been alive and well in the first century.''
</P>
<P>
   He also writes of a ``remarkable Hebrew text of the Gospel of
Matthew'' that appears in a 14th century rabbinical text by
Shem-Tob, which Howard says is written ``in a kind of Hebrew one
would expect for a document composed in the first century.'' That
is, before 100 AD. He suggests that this Hebrew text, going back to
the time of Christ, may have ``served as a model for the Greek.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a common scholarly assumption that the original language
of the gospels was Greek. Yet the Church Fathers tell us otherwise.
Irenaeus, in the second century A.D., tells us that Matthew was not
the only gospel writer who wrote to the Hebrews ``in their own
dialect.''
</P>
<P>
   Historians Epiphanius and Eusebius, both from the fourth century
A.D., tell us that ``Matthew issued his Gospel in Hebrew'' and that
he wrote his Gospel ``in his native language.''
</P>
<P>
   A Dallas Theological Seminary professor of New Testament,
Darrell Bock, said that according to the tradition of the early
church, the language Jesus originally spoke ``was a Semitic
language.''
</P>
<P>
   William Farmer, a New Testament professor at University of
Dallas and author of the just-published book, ``Anti-Judaism and
the Gospels,'' sees a concerted effort by modern scholars to
divorce Jesus from his Jewish roots and language.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an unconscious attempt to remove Judaism from
Christianity by making Mark the first gospel instead of Matthew,
which is more Jewish. By making Mark the first gospel, it
discredits Matthew as only a Jewish makeover of Mark and thus
offers an excuse to disregard Matthew.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, some Biblical critics denied the use of Hebrew
and promoted the theory that the gospel writers used Aramaic and
Greek in an effort to dilute the Jewishness of the gospels.
</P>
<P>
   But there is other evidence that, if anything, Aramaic and Greek
took a backseat to Hebrew among Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia Orthodox rabbi and Talmudic scholar Dov Brisman
said the Talmud implies that the two great sages of Judaism in 100
BC, Hillel and Shammai, ``spoke Hebrew to one another.'' He also
said the Aramaic version of the Bible was discontinued because Jews
only read the Holy Scriptures in the original Hebrew so that
nothing would be lost in translation.
</P>
<P>
   Two other scholars also assert that Aramaic was not the only
Semitic language used by Jews in Israel before and at the time of
Christ.
</P>
<P>
   In a paper presented to the Leeds University Oriental Society in
1966 called, ``Qumran to Edessa,'' JCL Gibson wrote, ``No doubt
that Jews of the homeland continued to speak Hebrew in the everyday
life still into the Christian epoch -- otherwise how can we explain
the emergence of the late form of Hebrew known as Mishnaic
Hebrew?''
</P>
<P>
   Milton Fisher, professor of Old Testament at Philadelphia
Theological Seminary and the seminary's former president, provided
the coup de grace to the whole matter, saying, ``Did not Paul speak
to Jews at Jerusalem in Hebrew?''
</P>
<P>
   How could scholars miss this well-known passage of scripture in
the Book of Acts dealing with Paul's arrest by the Romans and his
defense before Jewry?
</P>
<P>
   ``And when he (the chief captain) had given him license, Paul
stood on the stairs ... And when there was a great silence, he
spoke to them in the Hebrew tongue ... And when they heard that he
spoke in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence...''
(Acts 21: 39 through Acts 22: 2)
</P>
<P>
   It is not only in the language of the Gospels and of Jewry that
biblical critics take issue with the facts of history, but in the
historical truth and validity of the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   With a subtle anti-Semitic agenda behind liberal scholarly
theories about the Old and New Testaments, biblical critics have
developed, according to Ben Levi's book ``Revelation,'' a ``dogma
that nothing original came from the Jews'' and that ``the existence
of miracle, prophecy, and revelation (without which no
understanding of the Bible is possible) were denied in a dogmatic
fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   These anti-supernaturalists theorized that Matthew and Luke
``borrowed'' the language, style and, most importantly of all, the
viewpoint of Mark's condensed version of Jesus' life, and they
expanded upon Mark's account.
</P>
<P>
   This so-called Synoptic (i.e. similar viewpoint) theory was
developed and exploited by liberal scholars who did not accept the
possibility that four different men who knew Jesus and were his
disciples could be divinely inspired to write similar accounts from
what they witnessed from their own personal perspectives.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But, the 1993 Catholic Dictionary tells us, ``It is the
unanimous tradition of Christian antiquity that (Matthew) was the
author of the first of the four gospels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend of contemporary opinion is that the Gospel 'of St.
Matthew' was written after and dependent upon the Gospel 'of St.
Mark' ... . It is highly unlikely that one of the 12 apostles would
have taken his material from Mark, who had not been an (original)
apostle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Dictionary also dates Matthew as having been
written before 50 AD. By bringing Matthew's gospel to India,
Bartholomew would also confirm this early dating, thereby refuting
the contemporary theory that Matthew was written between 70 and 125
AD.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect of the anti-supernaturalist theory is that the
gospels were written long after the fact. There are still many
diehards among biblical critics who accept their own dating of the
gospels and say they were not written by eyewitnesses. It is
precisely here, in the clash between unbelief and belief, that
liberals and believers cross swords.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the testimony of the early church reminds us that the
gospels have as much historical as ethical value and that apostles
such as Bartholomew and Thomas, eyewitnesses to the ministry of
Jesus, did not give their lives for a mere myth.

   The fact that he returned to Alexandria with the same gospel
adds enormous validity to its discovery.
</P>
<P>
   These discoveries about Bartholomew going to India, the
existence of the Gospel of Matthew in Hebrew that was probably
written before A.D. 50 and the same text being returned to the West
add ``another piece of evidence of once again very early dating of
the New Testament,'' said Douglas Cecil, associate professor of
pastoral ministries at Dallas Theological Seminary.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do we now know where some of the apostles traveled but
also that Hebrew was far from a dead language at the time of
Christ, as many scholars espouse, and it evidently was used by Jews
all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   In search of what language was used during the time of Christ,
we find some interesting clues. Scholar George Howard, in his book,
``The Gospel of Matthew According to a Primitive Hebrew Text,''
quotes an early second century writing by Papias (ca. 60-130 CE),
bishop of Hierapolis in Asia Minor, as stating that ``Matthew
collected the oracles in the Hebrew language.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard goes on to say, ``It has become commonplace (for the past
century and a half) to suppose that by 'Hebrew,' Papias meant
'Aramaic.' The subsequent discovery of many ... Hebrew documents
from Palestine from the general time period of Jesus now show
Hebrew to have been alive and well in the first century.''
</P>
<P>
   He also writes of a ``remarkable Hebrew text of the Gospel of
Matthew'' that appears in a 14th century rabbinical text by
Shem-Tob, which Howard says is written ``in a kind of Hebrew one
would expect for a document composed in the first century.'' That
is, before 100 AD. He suggests that this Hebrew text, going back to
the time of Christ, may have ``served as a model for the Greek.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a common scholarly assumption that the original language
of the gospels was Greek. Yet the Church Fathers tell us otherwise.
Irenaeus, in the second century A.D., tells us that Matthew was not
the only gospel writer who wrote to the Hebrews ``in their own
dialect.''
</P>
<P>
   Historians Epiphanius and Eusebius, both from the fourth century
A.D., tell us that ``Matthew issued his Gospel in Hebrew'' and that
he wrote his Gospel ``in his native language.''
</P>
<P>
   A Dallas Theological Seminary professor of New Testament,
Darrell Bock, said that according to the tradition of the early
church, the language Jesus originally spoke ``was a Semitic
language.''
</P>
<P>
   William Farmer, a New Testament professor at University of
Dallas and author of the just-published book, ``Anti-Judaism and
the Gospels,'' sees a concerted effort by modern scholars to
divorce Jesus from his Jewish roots and languag.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an unconscious attempt to remove Judaism from
Christianity by making Mark the first gospel instead of Matthew,
which is more Jewish. By making Mark the first gospel, it
discredits Matthew as only a Jewish makeover of Mark and thus
offers an excuse to disregard Matthew.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, some Biblical critics denied the use of Hebrew
and promoted the theory that the gospel writers used Aramaic and
Greek in an effort to dilute the Jewishness of the gospels.
</P>
<P>
   But there is other evidence that, if anything, Aramaic and Greek
took a backseat to Hebrew among Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia Orthodox rabbi and Talmudic scholar Dov Brisman
said the Talmud implies that the two great sages of Judaism in 100
BC, Hillel and Shammai, ``spoke Hebrew to one another.'' He also
said the Aramaic version of the Bible was discontinued because Jews
only read the Holy Scriptures in the original Hebrew so that
nothing would be lost in translation.
</P>
<P>
   Two other scholars also assert that Aramaic was not the only
Semitic language used by Jews in Israel before and at the time of
Christ.
</P>
<P>
   In a paper presented to the Leeds University Oriental Society in
1966 called, ``Qumran to Edessa,'' JCL Gibson wrote, ``No doubt
that Jews of the homeland continued to speak Hebrew in the everyday
life still into the Christian epoch -- otherwise how can we explain
the emergence of the late form of Hebrew known as Mishnaic
Hebrew?''
</P>
<P>
   Milton Fisher, professor of Old Testament at Philadelphia
Theological Seminary and the seminary's former president, provided
the coup de grace to the whole matter, saying, ``Did not Paul speak
to Jews at Jerusalem in Hebrew?''
</P>
<P>
   How could scholars miss this well-known passage of scripture in
the Book of Acts dealing with Paul's arrest by the Romans and his
defense before Jewry?
</P>
<P>
   ``And when he (the chief captain) had given him license, Paul
stood on the stairs ... And when there was a great silence, he
spoke to them in the Hebrew tongue ... And when they heard that he
spoke in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence...''
(Acts 21: 39 through Acts 22: 2)
</P>
<P>
   It is not only in the language of the Gospels and of Jewry that
biblical critics take issue with the facts of history, but in the
historical truth and validity of the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   With a subtle anti-Semitic agenda behind liberal scholarly
theories about the Old and New Testaments, biblical critics have
developed, according to Ben Levi's book ``Revelation,'' a ``dogma
that nothing original came from the Jews'' and that ``the existence
of miracle, prophecy, and revelation (without which no
understanding of the Bible is possible) were denied in a dogmatic
fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   These anti-supernaturalists theorized that Matthew and Luke
``borrowed'' the language, style and, most importantly of all, the
viewpoint of Mark's condensed version of Jesus' life, and they
expanded upon Mark's account.
</P>
<P>
   This so-called Synoptic (i.e. similar viewpoint) theory was
developed and exploited by liberal scholars who did not accept the
possibility that four different men who knew Jesus and were his
disciples could be divinely inspired to write similar accounts from
what they witnessed from their own personal perspectives.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But, the 1993 Catholic Dictionary tells us, ``It is the
unanimous tradition of Christian antiquity that (Matthew) was the
author of the first of the four gospels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend of contemporary opinion is that the Gospel 'of St.
Matthew' was written after and dependent upon the Gospel 'of St.
Mark' ... . It is highly unlikely that one of the 12 apostles would
have taken his material from Mark, who had not been an (original)
apostle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Dictionary also dates Matthew as having been
written before 50 AD. By bringing Matthew's gospel to India,
Bartholomew would also confirm this early dating, thereby refuting
the contemporary theory that Matthew was written between 70 and 125
AD.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect of the anti-supernaturalist theory is that the
gospels were written long after the fact. There are still many
diehards among biblical critics who accept their own dating of the
gospels and say they were not written by eyewitnesses. It is
precisely here, in the clash between unbelief and belief, that
liberals and believers cross swords.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the testimony of the early church reminds us that the
gospels have as much historical as ethical value and that apostles
such as Bartholomew and Thomas, eyewitnesses to the ministry of
Jesus, did not give their lives for a mere myth.

</P>
<P>
   URBANA, Ohio -- Don Hilkerbaumer stood in front of his
Presbyterian congregation one recent Sunday to conduct his final
worship service here -- and to say goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   In the front row sat a despondent and tearful Polly Wilbur. For
the 13-year-old, Hilkerbaumer was the only pastor she had ever
known. And though his new church is only 40 minutes away, the break
from this congregation will be permanent, in accordance with
Presbyterian polity.
</P>
<P>
   Hilkerbaumer himself cried so often during the service, he
finally stopped in mid-sentence while delivering his sermon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever wonder why God made us in such a way that our
noses run when we cry?'' he sniffled loudly, as the congregation
laughed.
</P>
<P>
   This scene will be replayed thousands of times over the next
several weeks throughout the country. For American churches and
synagogues, the period between Memorial Day and Independence Day is
clergy-moving season.
</P>
<P>
   There are scandals, illnesses and other reasons that cause
pastors and rabbis to leave their posts abruptly. But most clergy
follow a well-ordered, time-tested moving season defined around
academic calendars and summer breaks.
</P>
<P>
   A rabbi in Sacramento also teaches Hebrew at a local university,
so she waits until the end of the academic year to accept her new
position.
</P>
<P>
   An Episcopal priest waits until the school year ends before he
moves his two elementary-age children to a new community -- with
hopes they can make a handful of friends before entering a new
school in late August.
</P>
<P>
   Like any other element of congregation life, each denomination
gives the event its own twist.
</P>
<P>
   While Presbyterians, Lutherans and Episcopalians typically honor
</P>
<P>
   their pastors with a Sunday evening potluck and tribute, United
Methodists and Roman Catholics seem less likely to overflow with
emotion. Their pastors move frequently and can be abruptly snatched
away at the whim of higher church officials. Goodbyes are sometimes
nothing more than a handshake and a pat on the back.
</P>
<P>
   In Southern and American Baptist churches and in almost all
African-American churches, the pastor's move can be genuinely
traumatic. He typically serves the congregation 15 to 20 years and
is usually not just a religious leader but a community force as
well, sitting on local boards like United Way, the Chamber of
Commerce and the YMCA.
</P>
<P>
   Reform and Conservative rabbis average eight to 12 years at one
congregation, and their reputation for community involvement is
second only to black pastors. Their good-bye dinners typically
include an audience that extends far beyond their own
congregations.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor-parish specialists from all denominations agree on three
golden commandments for departing clergy:
</P>
<P>
   --Thou shalt allow several weeks between the day thou announce
thine departure and the day of thy final service.
</P>
<P>
   This gives members enough time to adjust to the change and
prepare for the new clergy.
</P>
<P>
   Less than six weeks, and church members tend to feel robbed.
More than a few months, and they begin to wonder if the pastor is
actually leaving.
</P>
<P>
   --Thou shalt not allow thy final worship service to become a
tribute to thee.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the final service should closely follow the
congregation's traditional worship form but include what
denominations call ``The Release of Pastoral Duties.''
</P>
<P>
   In this litany, the congregation formally says goodbye to the
pastor or rabbi while forgiving him or her of any past mistakes and
thanking him or her for past contributions.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, the pastor or rabbi forgives members of the
congregation for their errors and thanks them for their
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the spirit of an ancient Hebrew covenant, the pastor
and congregation commit each other to God and part ways.
</P>
<P>
   --Thou shalt make a clean break.
</P>
<P>
   No fuzzy departures. No saying good-bye and then hanging around
to see if you can help out at the next wedding or funeral.
</P>
<P>
   A change in clergy means a change in leadership style, the
likely addition of new ministries and probably even alterations in
the worship services.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation must be allowed to develop a relationship with
the new clergy without interference from the former.

NOT A PERFECT SCORE   FOR `THE RED VIOLIN' 
(FOR USE BY NYTIMES NEWS SERVICE CLIENTS) 
</HEADLINE>
 Our rating: 2 1/2 stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Spanning five countries, four languages and more
than 300 years of history and cultural upheaval, ``The Red Violin''
certainly gets high marks for ambition, not to mention cinematic
form.
</P>
<P>
   But the film's interconnected stories _ held together by the
musical instrument of the title _ too often lack the kind of detail
and humanity needed to give the movie the resonance for which it
strives. In the end, this really is a just a movie about a violin,
and the inherent impersonality weighs a bit too heavily for it to
work.
</P>
<P>
   Directed and co-written by Canada's Francois Girard, ``The Red
Violin'' feels like a natural extension of his 1994 cult favorite
``Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould.'' This time, though,
Girard and co-writer Don McKellar (who has a small role in the
movie) have chosen to profile a musical instrument instead of a
musician. It's an intriguing concept for a biography, since people
(save for biblical times) tend to expire after several decades,
while an object can live on for centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The violin dates back to 1681, when it was made by a master
craftsman as a gift for his unborn son. (How it acquired its
unusual color is a mystery explained near the film's conclusion.)
The instrument then passes through the hands of several owners who
treat it, alternately, as a muse, a surrogate parent and a symbol
of cultural depravity.
</P>
<P>
   All this is foretold by the violin maker's housekeeper, who also
specializes in tarot card readings. Before each of the movie's five
main stories, Girard returns to a newly upturned tarot card that
predicts what is to come next. In a small way, this framing device
spoils the stories that follow, since it spells out their emotional
outcomes _ anger, infirmity, fear, rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   Girard uses a second connecting device as well, that of a
modern-day auction of the red violin. (Samuel L. Jackson is the
segment's featured actor.) It's here that Girard's technical
proficiency shines best, as the movie repeatedly returns to the
auction house, each time revealing a new detail from a different
vantage point.
</P>
<P>
   All this structural complexity is interesting and, at times,
engaging. But the film's disparate stories aren't always fully
formed and often feel like one-note genre pieces. There's a costume
drama, a bodice-ripper, a political thriller.
</P>
<P>
   The stories have their moments and fine performances _ the
second segment about a lovably vain music master and his 6-year-old
child prodigy works best _ but in the end, it feels like Girard is
more interested in form than he is in storytelling. And the form is
hardly original. This sort of construction has been done before and
to better effect in Joseph Mankiewicz's ``A Letter to Three Wives''
and ``Tales of Manhattan'' (which followed a fancy tail coat).
</P>
<P>
   The movie's deficiencies come to a head during its final scenes,
which fail to tie up the story, mostly because Girard doesn't
supply the necessary details. Thus, rather than being a
transcendent statement about love and mortality, ``The Red Violin''
comes off resembling a performer who knows all about technique but
lacks the soul to bring it off. &QL;

SPY SPOOF SPUTTERS IN SECOND GO-AROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
Our rating: 2 1/2 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There are enough really funny gags in ``Austin
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' to justify its existence.
</P>
<P>
   But just barely. This sequel to Mike Myers' '60s spy movie spoof
goes to heroic lengths to pump some clever new humor into what was,
even the first time out, a one-joke concept. It works sporadically,
but the strain shows.
</P>
<P>
   Myers, who co-wrote the screenplay with Michael McCullers,
spreads the net of pop-culture references here to include riffs on
``The Jerry Springer Show,'' Viagra consciousness and even that
perplexing Elvis Costello-Burt Bacharach collaboration. But the
vigorous satire, even coupled with a kind of gross-out ingenuity
rivaling that of ``Something About Mary,'' can't counterbalance the
sequel's long mirthless stretches.
</P>
<P>
   Myers made the not-exactly-astute decision to focus this film's
attention more on the mincing Dr. Evil than on the prancing Powers.
And while he takes the villain to behavioral lengths that must have
been fun for Myers to play, they're not nearly as enjoyable to
watch as Austin when his mojo's working.
</P>
<P>
   And wouldn't you know it? Austin's loss of mojo _ which can
politely be described as the unlikely love machine's life force _
is the movie's main plot point.
</P>
<P>
   As we all know, British secret agent Powers was cryogenically
frozen in the late '60s and thawed out in the less swinging '90s.
So was his lifelong, equally incompetent foe, Dr. Evil. Unable to
conquer the brave new premillennial world, Evil returns to the '60s
in a time machine, where he has the iced Austin's biological
Gatorade extracted.
</P>
<P>
   Back (or is that forward?) in 1999, Austin suddenly feels a
certain something missing. So he has to go back 30 years, too,
where he hooks up with the CIA's beautiful and ultra-willing
Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham, who may not be a natural comic
but was made to wear go-go boots and crocheted dresses). Despite
Austin's uncharacteristic timidity, she gives her all to helping
him regain his juice and stop Dr. Evil's latest, ludicrous scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the master-villain-in-his-own-mind would likely succeed
anyway. He's too distracted by his own dysfunctional dilemmas to
dominate the planet. These include the disdain of his unloved son
Scott (Seth Green, funny like before), disagreeable henchmen (Rob
Lowe does an uncanny imitation of Robert Wagner as the younger
version of Number Two) and his infatuation with a one-eighth-sized
clone of himself that he dotingly dubs Mini-Me (Verne Troyer,
uncannily mimicking Myers' mannerisms).
</P>
<P>
   The psychocomedy that grows out of all this is amusing the first
couple of times, but less so as it drags on through the film.
</P>
<P>
   Myers also takes on a third persona as another Evil operative, a
grotesquely obese Scotsman whose name cannot be printed in a family
newspaper. He's the source of most of the film's disgusting humor,
and the fat suit is a pretty impressive special-effects job from
the Stan Winston Studios.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's overall look is also a treat, brimming with
retro-mod references from Rusty Smith's bright, sightgag-strewn
production design to Deena Appel's goofy-yet-flattering British
Invasion costumes.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Roach, who also directed the original ``Austin Powers:
International Man of Mystery,'' brings more of the same off-rhythm
that one had to ``Spy's'' shaggy comedy (not to mention some of the
same bits). Islands of high hilarity dot an often tedious sea in
which Myers rows strenuously without always getting anywhere. Good
times can be had with ``Spy,'' but a reliable humor mojo would have
made it a more shagaliciously satisfying experience. &QL;

MEN, WOMEN AND SEX GET SUPERFICIAL TREATMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
By BOB STRAUSS 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The gimmick that's supposed to make ``Just a
Little Harmless Sex'' stand out from the run of cheap romantic
comedies is that its male characters were written by a man and its
female characters were written by a woman. Not a bad idea, but one
nonetheless crucially dependent on the writers being clever,
regardless of their gender.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Mills, a former assistant director, and Marti Noxon, a
co-producer on TV's ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' don't exactly
display sparkling wit in their script for this low-budget ensemble
comedy. Not much insight, either; the basic deal here is that men
are ruled by their urges, women are only slightly more repressed,
but true love is what they both really need to live happily ever
after.
</P>
<P>
   The focus is on three young adults of each persuasion, all of
them generic types. Alan (Robert Mailhouse) is unfulfillingly
married to Laura (Alison Eastwood). We first see him in a strip
club with his buddies, the divorced and vocally sex-obsessed Danny
(Jonathan Silverman) and the quietly sex-obsessed bachelor Brent
(William Ragsdale). With that beginning, we really can't feel too
much sympathy for the guy when, after being arrested for giving a
beautiful girl with car trouble a lift, he honestly claims not to
have known she was a hooker.
</P>
<P>
   Laura deals with her apparently ruined marriage by getting drunk
with her pals _ Danny's promiscuous ex Terrianne (Jessica Lundy)
and cute-but-doesn't-know-it Ally (``Father of the Bride's''
Kimberly Williams) _ then going out to the same pickup bar the guys
are hopping in and out of.
</P>
<P>
   You won't believe what complications ensue!
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe you will. Mousey Ally, who says things like, ``I
never did nubile _ I went straight from awkward to gawky,'' has too
much to drink and does an impromptu striptease. Danny, who says
things like, ``We cannot help it, it's biological'' in regard to
male infidelity, endeavors to kiss and make up with Terrianne in
the men's room. Brent becomes infatuated with Laura's worldly
mother, most probably because she's played by Lauren Hutton.
</P>
<P>
   There are enough by-the-numbers dumb misunderstandings,
inappropriate clinches and just-missings of significant others to
make an episode of ``Friends'' seem like ``Shakespeare in Love'' by
comparison. Little about the playing or staging salvages the
superficial material.
</P>
<P>
   The director, Rick Rosenthal, has done some fine television
work, including the pilot episodes for such noteworthy series as
``The Practice'' and ``Life Goes On.'' He also made a good, tough
prison feature with Sean Penn, ``Bad Boys,'' in 1983, but since
then his theatrical output has been pretty shaky. This outing is no
exception.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal doesn't show any particular flair for comic timing or
sensitivity to the serious emotional contradictions ``Harmless''
hints at here. He also made the rather curious decision to turn the
film's cinematography over to Bruce Surtees, a fine interpreter of
Clint Eastwood's darker visions but not necessarily the right guy
for glib comedy.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, ``Just a Little Harmless Sex'' lives up to the
harmless part of its title. But ``Just a Little Forgettable Sex''
would be just as apt a label. &QL;

MIKE MYERS' SPY POWERS HIS WAY INTO POP CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
( EDS:  Note use of italics throughout)  
BY GLENN WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _Mike Myers never planned to make an ``Austin
Powers'' sequel. He figured the first movie, 1997's ``Austin
Powers: International Man of Mystery,'' made a little money, earned
him a few critical kudos and steered his career back on track after
disappointments like the ``Wayne's World'' sequel and ``So I
Married an Axe Murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the movie came out on video and Myers' plans changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just took on this kind of weird life of its own,'' Myers
says. ``I heard through somebody, and I don't know if this is true,
that when King Hussein (the late ruler of Jordan) was sick at the
Mayo Clinic, he would watch `Austin Powers,' and it would revive
his spirits. And supposedly, he went to the Pentagon in some sort
of high-level defense capacity and stormed in and announced,
`Gentlemen, I want 20 F-16s and one (BEGIN ITALICS)meeelion!(END
ITALICS) dollars.'
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard that mind-blowing story,'' Myers says, shaking
his head, ``I knew we had made it into the pop-culture lexicon.''
</P>
<P>
   And how. Just a sampling of the film's catchphrases _ (BEGIN
ITALICS)``Yeah, baby!'' ``Oh, behave!'' ``Do I make you
randy?''(END ITALICS) _ indicates just how much the swinging secret
agent has infiltrated our consciousness. And with the sequel,
``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' arriving in theaters
today, the number of bad Austin Powers imitations is only going to
multiply.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie is loaded with conversation pieces, and that's a big
part of its success,'' says Paul Dergarabedian, president of the
box-office tracking firm Exhibitor Relations Co. ``If you haven't
seen the movie, you won't get what everybody's talking about. `Star
Wars' was like that, and it's the same thing with `Austin Powers.'
It's part of our culture now.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is rather remarkable, given the movie's humble origins.
Myers' wife, writer Robin Ruzan, knew he was onto something one
night when she heard her husband splashing around in the bathroom,
bellowing, ``Yeah, baby! Do I make you horny, baby?'' It all came
from Dusty Springfield's version of ``The Look of Love,'' the
sensual Burt Bacharach song that to Myers evokes images of ``lust,
libido, mojo, James Bond and all that other swinging stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Baby.
</P>
<P>
   Myers, 36, then wrote a movie that paid humorous homage to all
the things his late father loved _ Peter Sellers movies, ``Our Man
Flint,'' ``Beyond the Fringe,'' Monty Python, ``The Goon Show'' _
and convinced New Line Cinema to put up a few million dollars to
make it. Test screenings were, as they say, inconclusive, and there
were many at the studio who believed audiences just wouldn't get
all the English humor and phrases.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some hand-wringing and maybe deservedly so,'' says
Jay Roach, the USC film school graduate who has directed both
movies. ``More or less, we were making that first movie for
ourselves and our friends. We figured it would reach a Monty
Python-sized audience, which, in this country, isn't all that
big.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie opened in May 1997, made $9 million in its first week
and held on to rake in a respectable gross of $54 million _ or
about what ``The Phantom Menace'' made in two days. But ``Austin
Powers'' received a second life on video, selling more than 3
million copies and earning $47 million in rental revenue. The film
remained one of Billboard's top rentals well into this year,
whetting the public's appetite for the sequel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of layers to Mike's comedy, and it's not that
easy to take it all in in just one viewing,'' says ``Powers''
producer John Lyons. ``You get the physical, broad stuff when you
first see it. But then there are these subtle things going on in
the background, along with verbal and pop-culture components.
Bottom line, though, it's a producer's dream. People like to watch
it again and again.''
</P>
<P>
   And that leads to the smashing forecasts for ``The Spy Who
Shagged Me.'' Basically, the sequel flips the plot. This time,
Austin must travel from the 1990s back to the psychedelic '60s so
he can recover his ``mojo'' _ the very quality that makes him so
shagadelic _ from nemesis Dr. Evil. Myers again plays both parts as
well as a third _ a corpulent Scotsman named Fat Bastard.
</P>
<P>
   The humor, never subtle to begin with, is even more outrageous
this time around. (The title alone is raising a small ruckus in
England, where shag does (BEGIN ITALICS)not(END ITALICS) refer to a
loose-knit type of carpet.) Bathroom jokes abound, and there's
plenty of screen time for a pint-sized Dr. Evil clone, Mini-Me,
played by a 28-inch-tall actor. Heather Graham replaces Elizabeth
Hurley (who does turn up for a cameo) as Austin's sexy sidekick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Austin has always been a superspy with a 13-year-old
mentality,'' Roach says.
</P>
<P>
   Adds Myers: ``People just want to have a good time right now.
We're at the end of the second millennium, and it's like a
pop-cultural appetizer tray where people want to sample a little
bit of this and a little bit of that, but mostly, I think people
really want to enjoy themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Myers also maintains that the ``Austin Powers'' movies
contain a message, albeit one disguised like a Flintstones vitamin.
(``They don't need to know that it's good for them,'' Myers quips.)
</P>
<P>
   According to Myers, the central question of the first movie was:
Will Austin find love despite his outmoded sexual mores? Move
forward to ``The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' where the core issue is:
Will Austin find love despite his lack of belief in love due to a
broken heart and a rekindling of his old swinger ways?
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a whole lot in common, but Austin and I are
believers in true love,'' the unfailingly polite and sincere Myers
says.
</P>
<P>
   Such reads may be a tad deep for a series that strives to find
as many uses for the word ``shag'' as possible. More likely,
audiences connect with Austin because, for a guy with bad teeth,
(shag-)carpet chest hair and a wardrobe that would be the envy of
Little Lord Fauntleroy, he's completely and infectiously confident.
And pretty funny, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Austin is like a breath of fresh air,'' says Myers' friend Rob
Lowe, who has a small part in the new movie. ``People respond to
his enthusiasm and his love of life. He's a little _ how shall I
put it? _ dense, but he charges forward with this insanely positive
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Graham: ``I'd shag him.''
</P>
<P>
   It's too late for that, though. Austin belongs to the world now.
HBO has an Austin Powers animated series in the works. His likeness
is selling a host of beverages _ Starbucks coffee, Heineken beer,
milk (BEGIN ITALICS)(smashing moustache, baby!(END ITALICS) _ and
is also featured on those ubiquitous Virgin ``Shaglantic'' Airlines
billboards. And, of course, there's the usual array of trinkets _
key chains, T-shirts, watches, action figures, books _ and the
not-so-usual (embossed martini glasses).
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, everyone is already asking for (yet) another sequel.
Myers is non-committal, saying he never makes plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if my heart is in it, and Jay's around, then I'm sure it
would be fun,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Roach seems to already be sketching the plot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't help but think about it,'' the director says. ``I
always have to cut certain things from the movie, which is painful,
but then I think, `Well, OK. Maybe we can use it in the next one.'
We've got a lot of that stuff, so, basically, we could start
tomorrow _ even without a script.''
</P>
<P>
   To which, fans will no doubt say: Yeah, baby! Yeah! &QL;

CAUGHT BETWEEN SOFT ROCK AND HARD PLACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Most Americans who came of age in the '60s recall
radio that played a free-form mix of pop, rock and soul _ stations
that weren't afraid to let the disc jockey choose the records.
</P>
<P>
   So why has music radio become so unimaginative and
one-dimensional?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to pretend there's a huge glut of people
desperate to listen to experimental radio, but there are people who
want to hear something a little more stimulating than the next soft
rock station,'' said cultural critic Susan J. Douglas, author of
``Listening In: Radio and the American Imagination'' (Times Books;
$27.50).
</P>
<P>
   The book gives a history of radio from a listener's perspective,
from Wolfman Jack to Howard Stern. A resident of Ann Arbor, Mich.,
Douglas says her town has music stations that offer the usual
tightly formatted playlists.
</P>
<P>
   ``One station out of Canada has renamed itself `soft rock' and I
hate soft rock, but they think I'm their demographic,'' said
Douglas, who is in her late 30s. ``I do think all this has cultural
consequences. Radio stations advertise themselves in coded ways by
saying things like, `no rap any of the time.' That says you won't
have to hear any African-American voices except maybe Lionel
Richie.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas believes some teens today listen to less radio than ever
while preteens flock to Radio Disney's influential mix of teen-pop
and oldies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids listen to radio to the age of 14 then move on to CDs,''
she said. ``That's because when they reach a certain age, they
don't find the stations that play music which appeals to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas said if she could program her own station, it would
feature new, young acts as well as Latin and hip-hop music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to hear what young people are doing,'' she said.
``Instead, radio stations try and serve one strict demographic.
What I hope is some station might start programming to those of us
who want to listen across age, gender and race divides.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FRESH PRESSED: Tuesday's album releases include discs from
Santana, Mase, Heavy D, ex-Spice Girl Geri Halliwell and a live
effort from Sarah McLachlan.
</P>
<P>
   Santana's ``Supernatural'' (Arista) features cameos by Eric
Clapton, Lauryn Hill, Dave Matthews, Everlast and more.
</P>
<P>
   Mase unleashes ``Double Up'' (Bad Boy/Arista), while Heavy D
offers ``Heavy'' (Universal). Halliwell puts forth ``Schizophonic''
(Capitol).
</P>
<P>
   Lilith Fair founder McLachlan's latest is ``Mirror Ball''
(Arista). &QL;

DIDO/``NO ANGEL'' (Arista)

<P>
   &LR; The semaphorically named Dido is a smoky-voiced graduate of
England's trip-hop scene (she helped brother Rollo and his band,
Faithless; he returns the favor by co-producing about half these
tracks). Their loss is our gain. Dido's voice shares certain
qualities with Dolores O'Riordan, without the unlistenable bray the
Cranberries diva sometimes lapses into. It's the same smoke and
quaver and heavily textured alto that wraps around the words of a
song about heartbreak or hope. The many highlights here include the
nasty reverse psychology of ``Don't Think of Me,'' the unapologetic
title track and the lilting longing of ``Here With Me'' (among the
most-added tracks at adult-alternative radio this week). For such a
beautiful bird, Dido's song is sad and lovely. 3 1/2 stars

most accomplished release, the accent is on white-hot funk and
disco stomp, typified by first single ``Canned Heat'' and the
equally memorable ``Supersonic.'' In fact, many of these tunes
could be from an imaginary lost Average White Band album.

They weren't a great live act and most of their music doesn't have
the kind of warmth that translates to those shiny-happy '80s

shows why _ for a brief, shining moment anyway _ this was a band
that straddled the line of rock and punk rather brilliantly. The
hits (``Good Times Roll,'' ``My Best Friend's Girl,'' ``Just What I
Needed'') fill the first disc; the second includes the fully formed
demos (the band knew what it was doing) that won the Cars its
record deal, along with rough versions of five unissued songs.

Sinatra working with the incomparable Nelson Riddle _ a rarity,
since Riddle rarely left the studio and accompanied Sinatra on the
road. That alone makes this an essential recording. The 19-song,
hourlong program features the usual suspects (``I've Got You Under
My Skin,'' ``I Get a Kick Out of You,'' a work-in-progress version
of ``One for My Baby,'' which Sinatra would record a year later),
as well as rarely performed gems like ``I Won't Dance'' and ``It
Happened in Monterey.'' Sinatra wasn't in tip-top form; a cold
limited his range. (After missing one note during ``My Funny
Valentine,'' he complains, ``I think I've got a shot glass stuck in
my throat.'') Still, the feeling is there, The Voice in all its

Miles (done this winter by Material boy Bill Laswell) and do their
own dirty work. The five lengthy, techno/ambient results include
one by Laswell himself, with others by Doc Scott, DJ Cam, Jamie
Myerson and the duo of King Britt/Philip Charles. Mostly, the
otherworldly tones of Miles' spacey ``In a Silent Way'' masterpiece
and subsequent electric-period albums float across loping beats
like a rowboat reverie on a cloudy afternoon. Essential? Nah. This
is strictly for the hard-core Miles-ophile. But it's nice to know

Summers' formidable interpretive skills. The former Police
guitarist exuberantly explores both Monk classics (``Rhythmaning,''
``Brilliant Corners'') and little-known treasures (``Shuffle
Boil,'' ``Boo Boo's Birthday,'' the title cut) in ways that put a
fresh spin on these masterful compositions. The grooves range from
hip-hop to calypso to dense sonic collages. The album's highlight
is a haunting ``Round Midnight,'' featuring a beautifully lush
vocal from Sting, Summers' former partner. It all adds up to
Summers' most cohesive album yet as a leader. Incidentally, Summers
appears Saturday at the Baked Potato in Hollywood. 3 1/2 stars

like a rowboat reverie on a cloudy afternoon. Essential? Nah. This
is strictly for the hard-core Miles-ophile. But it's nice to know
the master's voice lives on in so many ways, eight years after his
too-early death. You can't silence the great ones. 2 1/2 stars

   ANDY SUMMERS/``GREEN CHIMNEYS'' (RCA)
</P>
<P>
   This 13-song tribute to jazz great Thelonious Monk showcases
Summers' formidable interpretive skills. The former Police
guitarist exuberantly explores both Monk classics (``Rhythmaning,''
``Brilliant Corners'') and little-known treasures (``Shuffle
Boil,'' ``Boo Boo's Birthday,'' the title cut) in ways that put a
fresh spin on these masterful compositions. The grooves range from
hip-hop to calypso to dense sonic collages. The album's highlight
is a haunting ``Round Midnight,'' featuring a beautifully lush
vocal from Sting, Summers' former partner. It all adds up to
Summers' most cohesive album yet as a leader. Incidentally, Summers
appears Saturday at the Baked Potato in Hollywood. 3 1/2 stars

THE ACTING IS GREAT, BUT `LIMBO' LEAVES YOU HANGING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Writer-director John Sayles, the first of the indie film heroes,
knows what to do with actresses. He gives Mary Elizabeth
Mastrantonio one of the best parts of her career in his newest
film, ``Limbo.'' She plays Donna, a down-on-her-luck lounge singer
who drags her teen-age daughter, Noelle (Dallas native Vanessa
Martinez), with her whenever she feels the need to relocate. This
time, it's to a small Alaska town, called Port Henry, given its
full natural glory by cinematographer Haskell Wexler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Limbo'' is not just Donna's story, even though Mastrantonio's
performance dominates the film. The entire town is in a state of
limbo, caught between circumstances. Joe (David Strathairn) carries
his dislocation around with him, like a cloud of bad luck hanging
over his head. He's moved from one job to another because an
accident on one of his fishing trips has shaken his confidence.
He's been distant and slightly lost ever since. All that remains is
his fundamental decency. It's a quality that both Donna and Noelle
fall for.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to not respond to Sayles' ambitions _ at least for me.
He has a deep-set interest in how people's work defines them, and
how being stripped of vocational definition can rob them of
something integral to their beings. (He once said no one eats or
makes love eight hours a day, but most of us do spend that much
time at work. The only thing we spend as much time at is sleep.)
</P>
<P>
   Being so deprived can leave anyone in a state of limbo, even
though some try to fight it, as does Leo Burmester. He plays
Harmon, an angry ex-fisherman who now works at a canning factory.
When Sayles finds the right actors, like Burmester, ``Limbo''
springs to life. Mastrantonio, with her stubborn vivacity, sends
real experience through the film. (She also does a fine job singing
in her performance scenes.) The young Martinez comes through
beautifully. Hypersensitive and willful, she matches up physically
and psychologically with Mastrantonio. She's part of a new wave of
distinctive and watchable young actresses who are making the future
of film exciting to behold _ especially when the two find
themselves trapped with Joe on an uninhabited island after a
boating tragedy that involves Joe's brother (Casey Siemaszko).
</P>
<P>
   As a director, Sayles has become more confident and willing to
take risks himself. ``Limbo'' contains a scene that has now become
his signature: He moves the camera through a big event, shifting
the film's focus from one character to another, giving us a sense
of what's going with each person. It's a way to use his limited
financial resources, as well as to stretch and give his films a
cinematic import.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the few times we get a rush of filmmaking energy
from him, because ``Limbo'' has that fixed, literary quality that
can sometimes make his films dreary. The allegories are worked out
in an almost mechanical manner. This can makes Sayles' storytelling
less than engaging, as is the case here. The rigidity is
oppressive, and ``Limbo'' is hard to enjoy because of it; even the
ending lends itself to the title, and audiences may be left
unsatisfied, no matter how much of an affinity they may have for
Sayles' work.

THE WARMONGER DOES SOMETHING RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Before I go back to blasting him about the war
against Yugoslavia, I want to thank President Clinton for a couple
of recent moves. They reminded me of why I twice voted for him.
</P>
<P>
   1. The long overdue but wily appointment of James Hormel as
ambassador to Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   For 18 months, a handful of reactionary, homophobic Senate
Republicans used a nasty little procedural trick to keep Hormel's
nomination from coming to the Senate floor for a vote. The
president trumped their trick with one of his own: the chief
executive's right to make appointments while Congress is in recess.
</P>
<P>
   The ultra-conservatives used their trick _ called a ``hold'' _
because they knew it was the only way to keep the 66-year-old San
Francisco philanthropist from being confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Since October 1997, when Clinton nominated Hormel, the votes
have been there. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved
the nomination 16-2. A majority of senators supported his
appointment, including Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. And the Luxembourg
government said he was most officially welcome.
</P>
<P>
   None of those people, it seems, gives a rat's bum about the fact
that Hormel is a comfortably out-of-the-closet gay man. The
ultra-conservatives _ led by Sens. James Inhofe, R-Okla., and Tim
Hutchinson, R-Ark., who created the hold _ care a great deal.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott cares, too _ enough to aid and
abet the hold for 18 months instead of acting like a man and
allowing a full Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
   But, of course, Lott, R-Miss., says he believes that
homosexuality is not only a sin but a curable disease like
kleptomania or alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   Other than being gay, everything about Hormel screams,
``Traditional U.S. diplomatic corps!''
</P>
<P>
   He's male, rich, white, elegant, educated, cosmopolitan and
comes from a fine old family. He's a father, served as the dean of
the University of Chicago Law School and as a U.S. delegate to the
United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Like many ambassadors, Hormel is a generous donor to his
favorite political party and drops big bucks on charity ($500,000
to the San Francisco Public Library alone).
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton did his end-run around the vacationing Congress,
Inhofe whined like a child that the Hormel appointment ``shows
President Clinton's utter contempt of the Senate and its values.''
A week later he retreated to the shallowest end of the baby pool
and vowed to hold up every Clinton nomination because the president
had ``forfeited the presumption of any cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator, the man beat you at your own game. Grow up.
</P>
<P>
   2. Kudo II goes to Clinton for holding the first-ever White
House conference on mental illness and for pledging $7.3 million
for a National Institute of Mental Health study of mental illness
and a national training program for teachers to recognize and help
disturbed children.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe even better, the president informed managers of nearly 300
health plans used by federal employees that they must cover mental
illness and substance abuse. He urged private employers to follow
suit.
</P>
<P>
   Because Tipper Gore headlined the conference and spoke about her
own struggle with clinical depression, some cynics dismissed the
mental illness action program as an administration ploy to make
Vice President Al Gore a more attractive presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   If that's true, so what? For the first time in history a
president has insisted that we stop stigmatizing the tens of
millions of Americans who suffer from mental illness, and he has
put some substantial money where his mouth is.
</P>
<P>
   I don't care if Clinton called the conference to make his dog
Buddy look good; $7.3 million is $7.3 million. Besides, as
manipulative political posturing goes, I'll take a conference on
mental illness over the bombing of Serbia any day.

A LUSH LOOK AT A LOVE BEYOND WORDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With ``Besieged,'' director Bernardo Bertolucci proves himself
one of film's reigning sensualists. There's so much visual and
aural texture here that you realize it's more than 10 minutes into
the picture before we hear either of the protagonists speak.
</P>
<P>
   One of those protagonists is Shandurai (Thandie Newton), whose
schoolteacher husband is arrested by the militia of their small
African country. Before we know it, she's in Italy, where she's
studying to be a doctor and working as a housekeeper for a British
recluse/pianist named Mr. Kinsky (David Thewlis), who she thinks is
rich.
</P>
<P>
   Baroque and swooningly romantic, ``Besieged'' plays at a high
emotional pitch. The music in the film spells out Shandurai's
emotional states. This motif could be condescending in the wrong
hands, since Shandurai screams at Kinsky, ``I don't understand your
music,'' as he toys at a classical composition. But it's clear this
music means something to Shandurai. It's a constant part of her
life, her soul, and it helps to ease some of her feelings of
alienation in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besieged'' has an extraordinary suppleness and visual
richness. After the torpor of his last movie, ``Stealing Beauty,''
Bertolucci is awake and focused here. He's helped by having an
actress up to the demands the movie makes of her. At times,
Shandurai is painfully, desperately alone; as played by Newton, her
feelings are always erupting to the surface. Those who recoiled
during Newton's no-holds-barred performance as the title spirit in
``Beloved'' may re-experience some of that discomfort here.
</P>
<P>
   Newton is not afraid of looking foolish, and sometimes she looks
just so. That bravery also helps her succeed at depicting a full,
potent brew of drama that a Bertolucci movie hasn't offered in some
time. (Bertolucci gains by falling for Newton. She deserves a
director who knows how to use her gifts, as her talent has shone
through in roles in which she's barely been used.)
</P>
<P>
   Thewlis, who looks like a combination of Alan Rickman and Pete
Townshend of the Who _ most specifically in his slim-lipped cruelty
_ suffers exquisitely here. Kinsky sells off his possessions,
including his prized piano, to help finance a legal defense for
Shandurai's husband. He wilts in the room whenever he beholds
Newton's ripe beauty, and who can blame him?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Bertolucci's days of plumbing new depths in the medium are
behind him. Yet there's a radiance, a sureness of touch coupled
with his astonishing taste and style, that makes ``Besieged'' a
unique pleasure. It glows.

JUST A LITTLE CHARMLESS MOVIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Believe it or not, movie reviewers have consciences (well, some
of us do), and a negative reaction to a film like ``Just a Little
Harmless Sex'' can induce pangs of guilt. Here's a little movie
that's apparently well-meaning, modestly budgeted, cast with
familiar faces but bereft of ``stars,'' and devoid of the
calculation that goes into a crowd-pleasing confection like
``Notting Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Picking on a film like this feels kind of like bullying, but the
truth is that ``Just a Little Harmles Sex'' is just a little
needless movie. The acting is OK at best, the direction static
despite some nifty camera movements, courtesy of veteran
cinematographer Bruce Surtees. The main villain, though, is the
screenplay, which is yet another hackneyed variation on the battle
of the sexes.
</P>
<P>
   The set-up: Alan (Robert Mailhouse), having left his buddies
behind at the topless bar, comes to the aid of a stranded woman on
a rainy night. Turns out she's a hooker, because in the sexist
world of movies, all stranded women on rainy nights are either
hookers or victims. Alan can't resist a little sexual favor from
her, and naturally this doesn't go over too well with his wife,
Laura (Alison Eastwood), who dumps Alan and cuts his face out of
all their family pictures.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Alan and Laura kind of choose teams. On Alan's team
are Danny (Jonathan Silverman), a male-pig sort who's working out
his anger over his own divorce, and Brent (William Ragsdale), whose
main purpose in the movie seems to be to give the male team as many
players as the female team. On Laura's team is Danny's ex,
Terrianne (Jessica Lundy), who's apparently so loose that she has
slept with every guy in town even though she can't reach a climax;
and Allison (Kimberly Williams of the ``Father of the Bride''
movies, virtually unrecognizable in a boyish haircut), who's shy
and demure _ except, of course, when she drinks.
</P>
<P>
   This examination of male-female relationships was co-written by
Marti Noxon, who handled the female characters, and Roger Mills,
who provides the male perspective. Their not-too-surprising
insights: Men just can't help themselves when it comes to sex;
women like sex, too! Just because the movie's not calculated
doesn't mean it's not contrived; didn't anyone learn from the
awkwardness of 1991's similarly constructed ``He Said, She Said''
that such a forced screenwriting collaboration is better in theory
than it is in practice?
</P>
<P>
   Well, no, but then it's apparent that the people involved here
haven't really learned much of anything, or at least haven't paid
attention to a decade's worth of TV, where shows such as
``Seinfeld,'' ``Friends'' and even ``Melrose Place'' have addressed
sexual politics in much more deft and entertaining ways.
</P>
<P>
   This is particularly surprising when you consider all the TV
vets involved, from Lundy (as entertainingly flinty here as she was
in the short-lived sitcom ``Hope &AMP; Gloria'') to Silverman (not
quite as irritating here as he was in the sitcom bomb ``The Single
Guy'') to Noxon, who works with much more incisive material as
co-producer of ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie suffers from having such bland leads as Mailhouse and
Eastwood, and from a playlike structure that populates its few sets
with dozens of extras but barely a dozen speaking parts.
Actress-models Lauren Hutton and Rachel Hunter, along with
musicians Nuno Bettencourt and Tito Larriva, help flesh things out,
but to little avail. ``Just a Little Harmless Sex'' feels like what
it is, a personal film developed among friends. But that doesn't
mean you or your friends should see it.

TRIO'S SOCIAL COMEDY TAPS INTO BORDER ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The ``all-American monster,'' as Richard Montoya
calls it, wears the bland, baby-faced expression of Eric Harris and
Dylan Klebold.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, there are the two Columbine High School seniors,
staring out from the 15th anniversary flier that Montoya and the
other two members of the Latino comedy troupe Culture Clash are
using to promote their 15th anniversary tour.
</P>
<P>
   Less familiar are the flier's two other faces, those of Montoya
and Herbert Siguenza as they appeared in their own high school
yearbooks. Culture Clash's third member, Ric Salinas, declined to
include his face in the flier, having been the random victim of a
shooting himself several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But he is represented by an acerbic message: ``Violent people,
guns &AMP; the NRA Suck!''
</P>
<P>
   A touch of gallows humor, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   But Culture Clash believes that America currently is in the
midst of a cultural war, being fought with live ammunition. That,
they say, is where theater comes in. Seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody was talking to each other in Littleton, Colo.,''
Montoya explains. ``That is the antithesis of what Culture Clash
and what good theater ought to be doing, is provoking discussion,
provoking dialogue. Because the Littleton, Colorados of the world
are going to start popping up more and more.''
</P>
<P>
   After several years of performing throughout the United States,
the aggressively non-politically correct L.A.-based trio is popping
up in its hometown this week for a five-week engagement of
``Culture Clash in Bordertown'' at the Actors' Gang in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Originally commissioned by the San Diego Repertory Theatre,
where it was produced last June, the piece is a series of
identity-switching skits about the various borders _ economic,
political, sociological and even cosmic _ that divide citizens of
that gaping !ital!frontera!off! encompassing San Diego and its
Latinate twin, Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Based on weeks of firsthand observation and more than 100
interviews the trio conducted with residents on both sides of the
fence, ``Bordertown'' weighs in on a number of thorny issues
including ethnic tensions, anti-gay discrimination within the U.S.
armed services, xenophobic performing killer whales and the
ultimate flight from reality's border undertaken by the Heaven's
Gate cult.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Culture Clash stocks its comic arsenal with
vaudeville, commedia dell'arte techniques and a sardonically hip
sensibility that American Theatre magazine likened to ``the Marx
Brothers meet the Rolling Stones.''
</P>
<P>
   While some of the more painful themes in ``Bordertown'' will be
all-too-familiar to Angelenos, Montoya suggests there may be an
additional ``subtext'' beneath the show's jocular facade.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the last five years, thanks to people like Gov. Pete
Wilson, (they) have kept us so obsessively focused on the border
and the `brown tide' that comes from the south,'' he says. ``While
we were so focused on that, militias got armed to the teeth and the
all-American monster next door was building pipe bombs. Now, I've
never heard of an illegal immigrant blowing up a federal building.
We've got the monster and the terror right in our back yard.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words: It's a war zone out there, folks.
</P>
<P>
   However, Montoya stresses, we're all implicated in this
conflagration, not just the Dylan Klebolds and Eric Harrises
lurking among us.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not here pointing the finger and saying, `Those are
white suburbanites.' We're saying that when Culture Clash goes to
new cities like Detroit or New York or Lawrence, Kan., instead of
everybody rushing us to the inner-city school to go talk to
inner-city schoolkids, people better start getting us out to the
white suburban high schools too. And we better be prepared to try
to make sense to these kids out there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bordertown'' may come as a bit of a surprise to those who
haven't seen Culture Clash in a while. Founded in 1984, on Cinco de
Mayo, the group initially favored a broad style of physical comedy
that in some ways echoed the stand-up-comic heyday of the
mid-Reagan years.
</P>
<P>
   But, partly because Culture Club was ``never were really
embraced'' by mainstream comedy clubs, Montoya says, the troupe
began gravitating toward university campuses and legitimate
theaters, honing its acting chops along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Culture Clash material also assimilated modern playwrights like
Bertolt Brecht and Dario Fo, the scathing monologues of Lenny Bruce
and the timeless comic insights of the classic Greek dramatist
Aristophanes.
</P>
<P>
   Culture Clash began developing more ambitious pieces such as
``The Mission'' (1990), whose definitive moment is a sequence in
which Father Junipero Serra literally beats religion into some
hapless Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mission'' paved the way for the group's 1994 breakthrough
work, ``Radio Mambo,'' about the frothing ethnic and cultural
jambalaya that is the city of Miami. It was later performed at
L.A.'s Tamarind Theatre, where it won Theatre L.A.'s Ovation award
for ensemble performance.
</P>
<P>
   Culture Clash's growing reputation has taken it to Lincoln
Center, the Kennedy Center, off-Broadway, the Mark Taper Forum and
the La Jolla Playhouse _ where it recently did a version of
Aristophanes' ``The Birds'' _ among other venues.
</P>
<P>
   Its production of ``A Bowl of Beings'' premiered on PBS' ``Great
Performances'' in 1992, and the group has been seen, individually
and/or collectively, in such feature films as ``Encino Man,''
``Falling Down,'' ``Mi Vida Loca'' and ``Star Maps.''
</P>
<P>
   With all that under their belts, it was time to reconnect with
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``In `Bordertown,' the subject matter is a lot closer to us.
It's about Southern California, it's about the border, it's about
Mexicans,'' says Siguenza. ``I think it's a little funner than
`Radio Mambo,' it has some glimpses of, like, our older styles here
and there, a little broader here and there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing here (at Actors' Gang) was totally strategic,''
Siguenza goes on. ``We've got to be honest. It's kind of in the
middle of the city. When you play the LATC, you get no Westsiders.
They're not going to cross Vermont (Avenue). So it's totally
strategic. We said, `We've got to be in the middle of the city
where we get Eastsiders and Westsiders.'''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Montoya, ``And people from the Valley, for God's sake!''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Angelenos are able to see their own reflections in the
mirror of San Diego-Tijuana, Culture Clash appears to have crossed
a border of its own. As the trio closes in on middle age _ Siguenza
is 40, Salinas and Montoya both 38 _ their focus has shifted
steadily away from pratfalls to a more sobering perspective on
life.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas, who nearly died of a shotgun blast to the chest while
trying to break up a fight between two kids eight years ago, thinks
that incident, in particular, cast a shadow of mortality and
seriousness over the group's work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since then, I think our work has always been pretty full of
life-and-death situations,'' he observes. ``So here in Los Angeles,
with this piece, `Bordertown,' you're going to see that it is going
to be funny, but we're really saying some heavy stuff.'' &QL;

WEB SITES UNFAZED AD-BLOCKING SOFTWARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOBBY McGILL  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Fed up with advertising banners crowding your
screen while surfing the Web? Thanks to numerous versions of
ad-blocking software that are relatively inexpensive, and often
free, you can live a banner-free lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Similar to a security guard at the front gate, ``ad blockers''
ward off any unwelcome ad intrusions.
</P>
<P>
   The software monitors block strings that indicate the nature of
what is being transmitted to your browser. Once identified as an
advertisement, the software instructs the browser not to download
it to the screen.
</P>
<P>
   According to Anne Marshall, product marketing manager for the
Seattle-based software company WRQ Inc., by preventing the often
image-heavy ads from downloading, Web users experience much faster
download times. ``Users should experience downloads that are up to
six times faster,'' said Marshall, whose company makes and markets
AtGuard ad-blocking software.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the ad-blocking technology doesn't seem to unravel Internet
businesses, where banner advertising revenue is crucial.
</P>
<P>
   According to Drew Ianni, an advertising analyst at the New
York-based consulting firm Jupiter Communications, this year's
on-line advertising expenditures will top $3 billion. That will
continue to grow, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're about to release our 2003 projection, and that will
probably call for it to eclipse $10 billion,'' Ianni said.
</P>
<P>
   David Sims, editorial director of Web Review.Com, a publication
that relies on advertising to stay in business, said losing
advertising dollars due to ad blockers is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ad-blocking software is really not very high on our radar
screen,'' Sims said from his office in Sebastopol, Calif. ``It
certainly doesn't keep us up at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Sims describes a ``covenant'' between Web users and Web content
providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of users understand the deal. We spend our time and
effort to create content. Part of the reason we show up is to get
paid, and the way we get paid is selling ad space,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Charlene Li, senior analyst with Forrester
Research, a consulting firm based in Cambridge, Mass., ad blockers
are of little worry because they are rarely used.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few people use it or even care about it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Catlett, founder and president of Junkbusters Inc., a New
Jersey company that distributes free ad-blocking software from its
Web site (www.junkbusters.com), acknowledges that few Web surfers
use the software. He said his product and products like it would
not hurt advertising revenue ``that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Market analysts do not track use of ad-blocking software, but
the companies producing it report that sales are doing well.
``Interest has definitely been on the rise,'' Marshall said.

YOUNG MEDICAL WORKER PLANS A CULTURALLY SENSITIVE AIDS CAMPAIGN

</P>
<P>
   &UR; By ALISON ARCHER &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   As American colleges release thousands of graduates this spring
to seek promising careers in business or go on to further study,
one of the nation's brightest is passing up medical school to
enlist in the fight against a deadly and badly misunderstood
disease in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Stewart, a 22-year-old Fulbright Scholar, Truman Scholar
and USA Today Academic All-American, is heading for Africa to mount
a unique attack on the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   Her focus is Namibia, a small country situated at the
southeastern tip of the continent where, if the current rate of HIV
infection persists, one-quarter of the population will be wiped out
by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Suffering a record 26 percent infection rate, Namibia's campaign
against AIDS has been hindered by a lack of healthcare education,
facilities and media technology to promote awareness.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of an $18,414 Joanna Jackson Goldman Memorial
Prize, Stewart will conduct an HIV and AIDS education and research
project. It will focus on exploration of the indigenous culture and
modification of behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's first taste of medical missionary service was in
Port-au-Prince, Haiti, two years ago. It was quite a change from
the comfortable neighborhood where she grew up in Peoria, Ill., and
her four years on the campus of Miami University in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   She recalls that one day in 1997, as she walked the streets of
Port au Prince, she heard a soft voice whisper, ``Anmwe. M'ap
mouri,'' which in Haitian Creole means, ``Help. I'm dying.''
</P>
<P>
   The plea came from an abandoned little girl lying in the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her tiny hands groped over her body, scratching the scabies
that infested the sores under her armpits, legs and groin,''
Stewart says. ``Her ribs were clearly visible, bulging through her
translucent brown skin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She made no sound as I picked her up to take her with us.''
The child died a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw dying people lying in the dirt, singing spirituals and
hoping to die,'' Stewart says.
</P>
<P>
   It was on that trip, as she rocked children with sad eyes,
wounded spirits and stomachs distended by hunger, at the
Missionaries of Charity Orphanage, that she decided to work for
change in international healthcare attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   She sees the arrogance of western culture as a major hurdle in
promoting health reforms in third world countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The root of the healthcare problems in the international world
is (our) attitude that if something is different, it's wrong. We've
got to overcome that,'' said Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Dr. Martin Bosman, a Namibian professor
visiting Miami University, Stewart will focus on the eight local
tribes' understanding of the country's history, leaders, practices
and resources. She plans to use case studies and questionnaires to
form a culturally sensitive program that will be embraced by the
community.
</P>
<P>
   During the year-long project, which begins in August, she will
study local cultures to isolate the problems that make their region
home to three-fifths of the world's AIDS population.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's unique approach to the Namibia project, stemming from
her mission work with the sick and poverty-stricken in Haiti and
India, began under the direction of Dr. John Caroll, an
emergency-room doctor at St. Francis Hospital in Peoria.
</P>
<P>
   In Stewart's first experience with Third World healthcare, she
brought six Haitian children to the U.S. for life-saving surgery,
after lobbying for visas, raising money for airfare, and locating
U.S. doctors to donate surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the children received open-heart surgery. Two
hydrocephalic babies, with a deadly condition of fluid collecting
on the brain, underwent surgery, and one blind boy received a
cornea transplant, restoring his sight.
</P>
<P>
   These are stories of success, but Stewart also tells stories of
tragedy and death.
</P>
<P>
   She held a 5-pound, 8-month-old girl, Alice, in her arms as the
baby died, so she wouldn't be alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slowly, I began to accept my limitations, and realize that,
sometimes, my job was to comfort, not to cure,'' said Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   During the summer of 1998, Stewart continued her work in
Radjkar, India, where she helped local residents of the small rural
village learn proper sanitation techniques for their hospital,
which allowed cows to pass through the operating room and had not
been cleaned in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``To many people in the world, this kind of suffering seems
insurmountable. People deem their efforts as futile and use the
justification 'life just isn't fair.'
</P>
<P>
   ``However, the medical work I have rendered in Haiti, India and
the U.S. has convinced me that by being privileged to be a citizen
of this country and obtain an education, I have not only the
ability, but the responsibility to help others who are not as
privileged,'' said Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Though these problems seem far removed from the United States,
Stewart points out that Haiti is only a 90-minute plane ride from
the U.S. and that a child dies there every five minutes from
dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   Upon her return to the United States, Stewart plans to pursue
both a medical degree and master's degree in international public
health at either Harvard University or John Hopkins University.
</P>
<P>
   She plans to follow her passion of global healthcare reform as a
doctor with the World Health Organization, where she will use
hands-on experiences drawn from countries to develop policies,
allocate funds for research and reform, and enact public health
projects.

``passenger rights'' bills, say they will voluntarily adopt reforms
like providing food, water and toilets to passengers stranded on

   DAD: Jackson County's first fathering class graduates today.
About a year ago, County officials decided to help a few so-called
deadbeat dads instead of jailing them. It worked. The program
ordered men into programs such as drug treatment, job placement and
fatherhood training. The Fathering Project had 45 men, but few
worked full-time, paid child support or visited their children. Now
30 of the men have jobs, 26 pay child support and 31 visit their
children. Prosecutor Bob Beaird said the approach can help children
and prevent crime. Erica Thesing. 15. Photos, graphic.

GAG ME, BABY: TOILET HUMOR AND SEXUAL INNUENDO ARE THE `POWERS'
THAT BE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What was so much fun about the original ``Austin Powers'' is how
much of a surprise it was. An affectionate surprise, as it was full
of the obsessions of its creator and star, Mike Myers, that we'd
already glimpsed. For all of the enjoyment it provided, it wasn't
much of a movie; it was an extended sketch. And a lot of its appeal
came directly from Myers' boyish need to please, which surfaced in
his character. Unlike the cigarette-wielding super-spies ``Powers''
parodied, the International Man of Mystery just wanted to be liked.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' Dr. Evil (also
played by Myers) escapes from that orbiting Big Boy statue and goes
into the past to steal away Powers' mojo. ``His libido,'' Dr. Evil
trills mournfully, sounding even more like ``Saturday Night
Live's'' ruthlessly hip honcho, Lorne Michaels, this time around.
By doing so, Powers will be more useless, if that's possible. So
Powers sprints into the past _ 1969, for obvious reasons _ to
defeat his nemesis and get his mojo back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Powers'' works as a media satire _ it's an amusing idea,
bringing in the professionally shallow Rob Lowe to play a younger
version of the equally professionally shallow, but more likable,
Robert Wagner (Dr. Evil's right-hand man). This time around,
though, the satire has a price tag hanging off of it. Jokes about
Starbucks, Chili's and Heineken are more product placement than
they are funny. And a lot of ``Spy'' feels like just a rehash, and
a barely heated one at that.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are some very choice bits, giving Myers a chance to
pilfer from the pop culture of the past 30 years _ bits from ``The
Exorcist,'' and even the king of shameless, Jerry Springer, show
up. Myers gives Dr. Evil a small clone of himself, Mini-me, as a
son figure, to replace his whiny slacker offspring Scott (Seth
Green). And Dr. Evil has picked up a hilarious addiction to dated
hip-hop culture, including a musical number that almost
single-handedly redeems the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Myers trots out another of his loves _ Scottish hooligan culture
_ and combines it with the hugely fat and openly disgusting Mr.
Creosote from ``Monty Python'' for the villain Fat B------, a
character that functions as a collection of gross-out jokes. The
toilet humor that could be shaken off in the first movie just about
gets its own subplot here.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Spy,'' Powers still wants to be liked. And the movie is
still essentially a lengthy sketch, which means at some points,
it's tiresome, like the last half-hour of ``Saturday Night Live.''
It also means there's so little going on that a talented actress
like Heather Graham is wasted, because there's nothing for her to
play. A glamorous nonactress, like Elizabeth Hurley, who briefly
reprises her role from the first ``Powers,'' is far better off
because she doesn't try to play anything.
</P>
<P>
   There is some funny stuff here, although if Myers has an
original thought in his head, he doesn't use it in this picture. To
keep yourself from getting bored, you can sit and tick off the
sources that Myers and director Jay Roach have so lovingly ripped
off. ``(Spy'' is mostly lifted from the James Bond epic ``You Only
Live Twice,'' which many aficionados consider to be the best Bond
movie.)
</P>
<P>
   It's still funny to watch this sprite in wolf's clothing _ Myers
is like a kid chasing all the cute girls around the classroom. And
they're going for it. But Powers' vocal shtick _ ``Yeah, baby'' and
``Behave'' _ has worn out its welcome, if only because everyone in
the theater imitates it every time Powers opens his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The role of sequels is to reassure, and when the sequel is
reprising a lightweight piece of material in the first place, it
seems even more limited. The ``Austin Powers'' movies have become
this generation's ``Pink Panther'' films. And let's not forget, the
endless repetition of those films turned into an industry.

SEX JOKES? GROOVY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - If you're wondering where all the 15-year-old boys
are, they're chuckling their butts off at ``Austin Powers: The Spy
Who Shagged Me.''
</P>
<P>
   This comic sequel to Mike Myers' surprise 1997 winner hits all
the high spots _ or low spots, depending on your taste in tasteless
humor _ of the original.
</P>
<P>
   Myers and crew provide an endless string of sex jokes, potty
jokes, then back to the sex jokes again.
</P>
<P>
   The story? Well, there's no story in a spoof like this. Or as
Myers points out: If you try to follow the runaround they use
instead of a plot, you'll end up cross-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   Austin Powers is a takeoff on James Bond, with Myers as the
British super-agent with the bad teeth and the groovy libido.
</P>
<P>
   His mission: to bed babes. In between, he doesn't mind saving
the world from Dr. Evil (also played by Myers).
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' Dr. Evil goes back in time to
steal Austin Powers' mojo. Austin then goes back in time to stop
him. There are threats to destroy the world and, even more
diabolical, deplete Austin's sex drive. Heather Graham runs along
changing her modish clothes as Austin's new sidekick, Felicity
Shagwell.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's just me, but I don't buy Graham (``Boogie Nights'')
as babelicious. She's sexy from a distance or while dancing, but
something goes wrong when director Jay Roach stops her for
close-ups. Maybe her head's too big for her body, or her body is
too small for her head.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't matter much because Roach, who also directed the
original ``Austin Powers,'' doesn't stop long before it's back to
the sex jokes and the potty jokes, including a couple of gross-outs
gross enough to gross out the previously ungrossable.
</P>
<P>
   The sequel is funnier than the original because it has more
silliness, more smut and more ``yeah-babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers owes much of his wink-wink sex humor to the British clown,
Benny Hill, with whom most of ``Austin Powers''' audience will not
be familiar. In recycling dirty jokes, Myers goes so far back for
old gags that they're as good as new to most teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of spoof humor creates a treadmill effect. Every gag
is like every other gag, and the movie runs along at a zippy pace
without ever actually getting anywhere. But Myers knows his
audience, and he caters to their amusements with enough chuckle and
snicker material to fill a chat room.
</P>
<P>
   Myers also triples up as Dr. Evil's hit man, Fat Bastard, in a
remarkable exhibit of gross-out body costuming.
</P>
<P>
   The film packs in a large number of familiar faces in cameos,
including Elvis Costello, Woody Harrelson, Tim Robbins and Willie
Nelson. Except for Jerry Springer, Roach doesn't use the cameos to
any great cameo effect.
</P>
<P>
   Myers gets away with the title gag, using an English slang that
if he used the American equivalent, he wouldn't get away with it.
</P>
<P>
   Will they retitle the movie when it opens in England? They've
already agreed to do that in other, more restrictive countries. My
favorite so far is Indonesia, where the title now is the translated
equivalent of ``The Spy Who Made Me Feel Good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' also gets away with a
PG-13 rating. It has more than enough profanity and raunchy humor
for an R. 3 stars. &QL;

 By STEPHEN L. COHEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Like many doctors, Dr. Byron Thomashow, a pulmonary specialist,
is fed up with managed care. He's tired of justifying the need for
clinical procedures to ill-informed HMO personnel. He's weary of
fighting endless battles in order to treat his patients. And he's
frustrated by loss of the autonomy he once enjoyed to make his own
medical decisions.
 &HT;    But unlike many of his colleagues, he's fighting back. In fact,
he's given up on managed care altogether, electing to withdraw from
the web of HMOs and health insurers that have come to dominate our
healthcare system.
 &HT;    ``I just couldn't stand it,'' he explains. ``The thought of
being put on hold by people who don't know a quarter of what you
are doing to get permission for patients to go to the bathroom''
was simply too much to take.
 &HT;    Dr. Barney Softness, a New York pediatrician, is another rebel.
When his HMO suggested that he fire his registered nurses to reduce
costs, he did something few doctors have dared to do: he fired his
HMO instead. He says he just wants ``to give the kind of care that
I think people deserve.''
 &HT;    The two mutinous physicians are not alone. Across America, state
insurance commissioners are reporting a veritable revolt by doctors
against their HMOs, and medical society officials say that more and
more practitioners are severing their ties with managed care
altogether. A recent headline in The New York Times heralded this
trend, citing a growing rebellion by doctors like Thomashow and
Softness.
 &HT;    Of course, much of the dispute revolves around the reduced fees
that insurers are paying physicians for their services.
Nonetheless, despite a glut of physicians in many specialties,
doctors' incomes have continued to rise, unencumbered by the laws
of supply and demand. For this reason, some critics have described
the controversy as much ado about money. But it is also about
something much more fundamental -- the sudden encroachment of
``outsiders'' into the practice of medicine.
 &HT;    For the first time in history, insurers are telling physicians
how to practice their profession, and the medical community is up
in arms. As an early participant in managed care, I am no stranger
to this phenomenon, and I've seen what it is like to lose your
autonomy as a doctor. It is not a pretty sight.
 &HT;    As a salaried physician at an HMO, I experienced firsthand the
sense of helplessness and outrage that can result when a third
party comes between you and your patients, preventing you from
caring for them the way you were trained. Indeed, after years of
advanced training and education, I felt something I'd never felt
before in my life as a doctor: the inability to have my medical
decisions carried out.
 &HT;    As any doctor can tell you, this is a dreadful feeling. It goes
to the very heart of medical practice. Moreover, it challenges some
of the basic assumptions about what it means to be a physician.
From the outset of their training, doctors are taught that they
alone bear ultimate responsibility for the fate of their patients,
and therefore they alone must have the final say -- in conjunction
with their patients -- regarding clinical decisions. They may
consult with other health professionals before reaching a
conclusion, but in the end, they must make the final call.
 &HT;    This may seem a bit autocratic to some, but because lives are at
stake, it's a necessarily authoritarian regime. When dealing with
life-and-death decisions, you can't have a committee bickering over
strategy.
 &HT;    On the other hand, medicine cannot afford to operate in a
vacuum. When dealing with one-seventh of the U.S. economy, you just
can't leave the decision to physicians alone. This is how we
arrived at the current economic crisis in the first place. The
medical community, unconstrained by managed care, continued to
inflate medical spending until it consumed a whopping 14 percent of
the nation's economic output.
 &HT;    This voracious appetite for dollars obviously couldn't be
sustained, and the need to control runaway costs eventually set the
stage for managed care. The result was the current revolution in
health care, in which the laws of economics finally held sway over
the canons of medicine. Economic pressures steadily chipped away at
the hegemony of the medical profession, and managed care ultimately
did what no other force had ever done: it turned doctors into
``employees'' on a massive scale.
 &HT;    Now, the revolution has led to another first: physicians are
clamoring to join unions as never before. Courted by everyone from
the American Federation of Teachers to the International
Association of Machinists, doctors are beginning to unionize across
the country. And they are being welcomed with open arms.
 &HT;    The Service Employees International Union, the nation's
fastest-growing labor coalition, pledged in March to spend $1
million this year to organize the nation's 600,000 doctors. Even
the United Food and Commercial Workers union has gotten into the
act, seeking to expand its base by enrolling doctors disaffected
with managed care. This could lead to some intriguing alliances, in
which doctors could find themselves walking the picket lines
alongside supermarket workers.
 &HT;    Though there is already some precedent for the concept of a
physicians' guild, unionization still raises some troubling ethical
questions for the healing profession. Perhaps the most important
issue involves organized labor's right to strike. Could doctors
actually go on strike, denying care to their patients? If so, who
would treat their patients while they walked the picket line? And
how would they reconcile withholding care with the obligations of
the Hippocratic oath?
 &HT;    These are difficult questions, but they'll have to be addressed
as we move into the next phase of the managed care revolution. In
the meantime, one thing is certain: the revolution will continue.
As insurers press on with their onslaught, doctors will persist in
the struggle, fighting a rear-guard action in the hope of regaining
some control over their fate in the new healthcare economy.

 &HT;    But unlike many of his colleagues, he's fighting back. In fact,
he's given up on managed care altogether, electing to withdraw from
the web of HMOs and health insurers that have come to dominate our
healthcare system.
 &HT;    ``I just couldn't stand it,'' he explains. ``The thought of
being put on hold by people who don't know a quarter of what you
are doing to get permission for patients to go to the bathroom''
was simply too much to take.
 &HT;    Dr. Barney Softness, a New York pediatrician, is another rebel.
When his HMO suggested that he fire his registered nurses to reduce
costs, he did something few doctors have dared to do: he fired his
HMO instead. He says he just wants ``to give the kind of care that
I think people deserve.''
 &HT;    The two mutinous physicians are not alone. Across America, state
insurance commissioners are reporting a veritable revolt by doctors
against their HMOs, and medical society officials say that more and
more practitioners are severing their ties with managed care
altogether. A recent headline in The New York Times heralded this
trend, citing a growing rebellion by doctors like Thomashow and
Softness.
 &HT;    Of course, much of the dispute revolves around the reduced fees
that insurers are paying physicians for their services.
Nonetheless, despite a glut of physicians in many specialties,
doctors' incomes have continued to rise, unencumbered by the laws
of supply and demand. For this reason, some critics have described
the controversy as much ado about money. But it is also about
something much more fundamental -- the sudden encroachment of
``outsiders'' into the practice of medicine.
 &HT;    For the first time in history, insurers are telling physicians
how to practice their profession, and the medical community is up
in arms. As an early participant in managed care, I am no stranger
to this phenomenon, and I've seen what it is like to lose your
autonomy as a doctor. It is not a pretty sight.
 &HT;    As a salaried physician at an HMO, I experienced firsthand the
sense of helplessness and outrage that can result when a third
party comes between you and your patients, preventing you from
caring for them the way you were trained. Indeed, after years of
advanced training and education, I felt something I'd never felt
before in my life as a doctor: the inability to have my medical
decisions carried out.
 &HT;    As any doctor can tell you, this is a dreadful feeling. It goes
to the very heart of medical practice. Moreover, it challenges some
of the basic assumptions about what it means to be a physician.
From the outset of their training, doctors are taught that they
alone bear ultimate responsibility for the fate of their patients,
and therefore they alone must have the final say -- in conjunction
with their patients -- regarding clinical decisions. They may
consult with other health professionals before reaching a
conclusion, but in the end, they must make the final call.
 &HT;    This may seem a bit autocratic to some, but because lives are at
stake, it's a necessarily authoritarian regime. When dealing with
life-and-death decisions, you can't have a committee bickering over
strategy.
 &HT;    On the other hand, medicine cannot afford to operate in a
vacuum. When dealing with one-seventh of the U.S. economy, you just
can't leave the decision to physicians alone. This is how we
arrived at the current economic crisis in the first place. The
medical community, unconstrained by managed care, continued to
inflate medical spending until it consumed a whopping 14 percent of
the nation's economic output.
 &HT;    This voracious appetite for dollars obviously couldn't be
sustained, and the need to control runaway costs eventually set the
stage for managed care. The result was the current revolution in
health care, in which the laws of economics finally held sway over
the canons of medicine. Economic pressures steadily chipped away at
the hegemony of the medical profession, and managed care ultimately
did what no other force had ever done: it turned doctors into
``employees'' on a massive scale.
 &HT;    Now, the revolution has led to another first: physicians are
clamoring to join unions as never before. Courted by everyone from
the American Federation of Teachers to the International
Association of Machinists, doctors are beginning to unionize across
the country. And they are being welcomed with open arms.
 &HT;    The Service Employees International Union, the nation's
fastest-growing labor coalition, pledged in March to spend $1
million this year to organize the nation's 600,000 doctors. Even
the United Food and Commercial Workers union has gotten into the
act, seeking to expand its base by enrolling doctors disaffected
with managed care. This could lead to some intriguing alliances, in
which doctors could find themselves walking the picket lines
alongside supermarket workers.
 &HT;    Though there is already some precedent for the concept of a
physicians' guild, unionization still raises some troubling ethical
questions for the healing profession. Perhaps the most important
issue involves organized labor's right to strike. Could doctors
actually go on strike, denying care to their patients? If so, who
would treat their patients while they walked the picket line? And
how would they reconcile withholding care with the obligations of
the Hippocratic oath?
 &HT;    These are difficult questions, but they'll have to be addressed
as we move into the next phase of the managed care revolution. In
the meantime, one thing is certain: the revolution will continue.
As insurers press on with their onslaught, doctors will persist in
the struggle, fighting a rear-guard action in the hope of regaining
some control over their fate in the new healthcare economy.

THE `POWERS' THAT BE DON'T CUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nobody, and I mean nobody, is looking forward to the second
Austin Powers movie, ``The Spy Who Shagged Me,'' more than I am.
</P>
<P>
   I plan to be there the day it opens, first showing, popcorn and
soft drink in hand, ready to settle in, laugh at Austin's teeth
(again!) and hear him purr ``Yeah, baby!'' (again!) and swoon over
Heather Graham _ ready to, well, have at least as good a time as I
had with the first one.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe the music on this 12-cut soundtrack will work within
the context of scenes in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Sure hope so, 'cause it sure doesn't work on its own.
</P>
<P>
   The problems with the ``Powers'' soundtrack are the same that
have vexed numerous soundtracks in the past _ (a) Weak original
songs, and (b) Weak cover versions of good old songs.
</P>
<P>
   In the former category we have ``Alright'' by The Lucy Nation, a
really boring bit of modern radio rock, and in the latter we have,
well, where do we start? Lenny Kravitz's version of ``American
Woman'' is fair, but come on, it's ``American Woman,'' one of the
most overplayed songs in rock history. There's only so much Kravitz
can do.
</P>
<P>
   And after that, things go downhill fast: R.E.M.'s ``Draggin' the
Line'' is lame, Melanie G.'s take on Cameo's classic ``Word Up'' is
completely anemic, and Big Blue Missile's butchering of ``Time of
the Season'' is, frankly, horrible.
</P>
<P>
   Letting modern artists update classic rock tunes is hardly ever
a really good idea, however good a marketing ploy it may seem to be
_ but in this case it sinks the CD like an anvil tied around a
gangster's foot.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't help matters that the live version of the Who
doing their classic ``My Generation'' is thin and stiff, or that
the Elvis Costello/Burt Bacharach cover of Bacharach and Hal
David's ``I'll Never Fall in Love Again'' is good for its kitsch
factor and not a whole lot else.
</P>
<P>
   A shame, too, as there is some good stuff here. The opener,
Madonna's ``Beautiful Stranger,'' is a great summer song and will
deservedly be a hit, and Dr. Evil's take on Will Smith's ``Just the
Two of Us'' (in this case, a paean to Mini-Me) is cute _ but only
just. Also fairly interesting is the Flaming Lips' ``Buggin''' _
although it's hardly the best thing these guys have ever done. And
the remix of Quincy Jones' ``Soul Bossa Nova'' is a pleasant, campy
final touch.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a final touch on, really, a lot of mediocre material.
Four memorable songs out of 12 is not a good batting average. This
soundtrack might be an indication that this Powers film isn't as
good as the first. Or maybe the CD's just a stand-alone
disappointment. I'm really hoping it's the latter.

GETTING INTO THE JUNETEENTH ACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The late, lamented comedian Jimmy Durante had an expression that
fits what's happening to that long-standing Texas tradition called
Juneteenth.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with instances of people imitating him or responding
to some funny line of his, Durante would grumble: ``Everybody wants
to get into de act.''
</P>
<P>
   So it seems with the June 19 observances that most
African-Americans in Texas have considered their own peculiar
institution.
</P>
<P>
   But for several years now, Juneteenth celebrations have been
flowering in places like Buffalo, N.Y., Los Angeles, Washington,
D.C., Kansas City, Mo., and Omaha, Neb.
</P>
<P>
   I knew that. Still, I believed that the real thing only happened
in Texas cities and towns. I doubted that anywhere else in the
nation went about the business of celebrating the anniversary of
the announcement of the Emancipation Proclamation in Texas in the
way that African-Americans in Fort Worth, Port Arthur, Beaumont and
Houston do it.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine my astonishment when I came across a wire story
indicating the big way that folks underscore June 19 in the City by
the Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Something about Juneteenth and the San Francisco I know from
movies, songs and brief visits just didn't seem to go together.
Therefore, I called to make certain that the wire story was telling
about the same Golden-Gated, cable-carred, Nobb-Hilled,
Fisherman's-Wharfed place where Tony Bennett left his heart and
Rice-A-Roni supposedly originated.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, it was the same windy, chilly place. And according
to publicist Sandra Varner, Juneteenth is no
semi-holiday-come-lately to that cosmopolitan metropolis. According
to Varner, it's been going on there with varying degrees of
emphasis for the past 32 years.
</P>
<P>
   That would make the San Francisco observance about as old as the
revived Juneteenth observance in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the celebration really began 134 years ago, when Gen.
Gordon Granger landed in Galveston and put the word on the
grapevine that two years earlier, President Abraham Lincoln had
issued the Emancipation Proclamation.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: ``You slaves can tell your masters to take their
nonpaying jobs and shove them.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas African-Americans used to take a lot of ribbing about
getting the news so late. But that was before CNN and the Internet.
Union troops did not reach Texas to spread the news until 1865
because no major Civil War battles were fought in the state.
</P>
<P>
   In short, it wasn't the slaves' fault that they didn't find out
they were free until they did. When they did hear, they celebrated.
And in Texas and parts of Louisiana, they have celebrated that
hallelujah day every year from that day until now.
</P>
<P>
   However, the intensity of those celebrations waned in the 1950s
and early 1960s, when many African-Americans became so committed to
integration and assimilation that they downplayed their history and
heritage to try to blend into the dominant culture.
</P>
<P>
   With the rise of the black pride movement in the late '60s,
Juneteenth came back to the fore as a public observance in places
like Fort Worth. And it apparently was about that time that the
tradition was started in San Francisco by African-Americans who had
moved there from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Varner said the observance is flourishing more than ever in San
Francisco because of the support it is receiving from Mayor Willie
Brown, a native Texan. She said that Brown is committed to
elevating Juneteenth to a level comparable to all of the city's
other big festivals.
</P>
<P>
   That shows in some of the activities planned for the observance.
Among them are:
</P>
<P>
   _A talent show similar those traditionally staged at Fort
Worth's Renaissance Center. That June 12 event will be hosted by TV
and movie star Tamala Jones.
</P>
<P>
   _The first annual National Black Invitational Rodeo on June 18
at Golden Gate Park. The event will be hosted by actors Glynn
Turman and Reginald Dorsey.
</P>
<P>
   _A film festival on June 18-19 that will honor pioneer
African-American filmmaker Melvin Van Peebles. The annual event
will be named after Van Peebles.
</P>
<P>
   _A free gospel concert featuring gospel singer Bobby Jones.
</P>
<P>
   There's more. So Fort Worth and Houston Juneteenth coordinators
will have their work cut out to top San Francisco's Juneteenth and
probably those several other non-Texas cities around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Durante was right. Everybody wants to get into the act.

   YUGOSLAVIA-KOZOVO CRISIS
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MAIN _ SKOPJE, Macedonia _ With NATO airstrikes
suspended, peacekeeping forces began flooding into Macedonia as a
prelude to moving into Kosovo to enforce compliance with a peace
deal there. As Serb troops began withdrawing from the embattled
province, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic went on national
television to proclaim victory. Story will wrap in all major
developments. (Albright, Cox News Service).

<P>
   KOSOVO-MACEDONIA _ SKOPJE, Macedonia _ You would think that
refugees and peacekeepers would be excited that they will soon be
moving into Kosovo. But among ethnic Albanian refugees, the mood
here is surprisingly subdued. They are extremely apprehensive over
whether it's safe to return and at the notion of what they will
find in their abandoned villages. And members of the U.S. 82nd
Airborne Division aren't overly eager. Many of them express concern
that they are moving into a dangerous situation. And they are
chafing at playing the role of peacekeeper after having been
trained in the art of war. (Kunstel/Albright, Cox News Service).

   KOSOVO-ALBANIA _ KUKES, Albania _ Refugees here are just
learning that they won't be returning very soon to their homes
inside Kosovo. Their fellow refugees in Macedonia will be first
back, and some of the refugees in Albania may not be able to return
until next year. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

   KOSOVO-AIRWAR _ WASHINGTON _ After 78 days, nearly 35,000
sorties and more than 20,000 bombs, the U.S.-led NATO air strikes
against Yugoslavia were suspended on Thursday without a single
combat fatality for the allies. There has never been an air
campaign like it, said Defense Secretary William Cohen, who called
the campaign ``an extraordinary achievement in the history of air
warfare.'' Pilots flew high and let lasers, satellites and infrared
scanners guide 2,000-pound bombs to their targets miles away.
Despite advances in tactics and technology that put this air war a
full generation ahead of what was seen during the Gulf War,
Operation Allied Force was dogged by two of the oldest variables in
the history of battle: weather and terrain. And it ended without
solving the debate over whether wars can be won from the air alone.
(Deans, Cox News Service).

   DEMOCRATS _ WASHINGTON _ Two days before Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas makes his presidential campaign debut, the two top national
Democratic Party officials, Joe Andrews and Gov. Roy Romer of
Colorado, unloaded on the frontrunning GOP candidate. At a
breakfast with reporters, they sought to tie Bush to Republicans in
Congress who are blocking spending bills and gun control
legislation.

   CHRISTIAN-COALITION _ WASHINGTON _ The Internal Revenue Service
has ruled that the Christian Coalition is not entitled to
tax-exempt status, forcing the once-vaunted political powerhouse to
split into two entities in changes that will leave it
``dramatically reshaped.'' (Sherman, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   SOCIAL-SECURITY _ WASHINGTON _ The House Ways and Means
Committee ends two days of hearings on a Social Security reform
proposal offered by its leaders. (Lipman, Cox News Service).

</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-KILLING _ MEXICO CITY _ At first Paco Stanley's murder
was seen as the most glaring example yet of vicious, random crime
in this metropolis. Television anchors and fans of the famous comic
wept, assuming Stanley was an innocent victim of an assault on a
Mexico City street Monday. Political opponents of the city's mayor
saw a chance to weaken his presidential aspirations, wasting no
time in attacking him for failing to stem crime. But now it appears
that Stanley's killing could spotlight the pervasiveness of drugs
in Mexico -- their use and trafficking -- rather than street crime.
Police reports confirmed that Sanchez had cocaine in his body and a
stash of the drug in his car, where he was killed execution-style.
Unconfirmed allegations are flying that he consorted with one of
Mexico's most notorious cocaine traffickers and that he may have
owed $300,000 on a drug shipment. The killing has also made a
mockery of Stanley's employer, TeleAzteca, a network that had been
sponsoring a ``Say no to drugs'' campaign. (Ferriss, Cox News
Service).
</P>
<P>
   HAITI-TROOPS _ MIAMI _ Nearly five years after the United States
invaded Haiti to restore democracy, the U.S. House of Reps. is
expected to vote Wednesday on whether to end the permanent U.S.
military presence there. A growing number of lawmakers are
demanding the withdrawal of the remaining 500-member U.S. Support
Group in light of a rapidly deteriorating security situation in
Haiti that has left even military leaders concerned about the
safety of U.S. troops. The House will be voting on an amendment
proposed by Rep. Porter Goss (R-Fla.) and Rep. Ben Gilman (R-N.Y.)
(Emling, Cox News Service).

   WICCA-BOYCOTT _ Pentagon responds to Christian right's
anti-Wicca boycott of the Army. Folks there told us Wednesday they
were too busy dealing with media questions about Kosovo to decide
what to say about Christians and witches. They promised to talk to
us Thursday. Story will include other fallout as it happens.

   BAPTISTS _ ATLANTA _ In the days before their annual meeting in
Atlanta, Southern Baptists plan to blitz the city with evangelism,
door-to-door and in revival-style worship. This comes at a time
when the denomination recently admitted losing members for the
first time in decades. (Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   CHURCH-RAISING _ Members of Gateway Baptist Church in Dawson
County, Ga., have spent three years meeting in a school. All that
changes next week (June 7) when they and members of a special
Baptist ministry, Builders for Christ, build a structure for the
faith community. In the tradition of an Amish barn raising, the
facility will rise quickly, in just four days, according to
Gateway's pastor, the Rev. Ray Rhodes Jr. Everyone will help out _
parents, children, builders from West Virgnia, South Carolina,
North Carolina and Georgia. (White, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   MISS-GOV _ Gov. Kirk Fordice, whose love life has been the talk
of Mississippi ever since he was spotted holding hands with a woman
in a restaurant while his wife was out of town, said Thursday he is
getting divorced and will marry his junior high school sweetheart.

   ECOLI-SUITS _ A profile of Bill Marler, the lawyer who
specializes in E. coli cases, and is handling all the White Water
litigation, plus an update on where the litigation stands. Marler
is speculating this will be the first E. coli case to go to trial
(all the others have been settled for huge sums), because White
Water's liability is a little less clear than that of meat
manufacturers and Jack in the Box. (Guthrie/Miller, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 30.

<P>
   BUSHGALLERY _ Out in the Hill Country, they're getting ready for
Friday's opening of the Bush Gallery at the National Museum of the
Pacific War. The former president's story is one of dozens of
wartime accounts told through photos and artifacts. Organizers say
the museum is the only one in the country dedicated to the Pacific
War. The governor's dad will be in Fredericksburg for Friday's
opening. (Kelley, Austin American-Statesman).

   PLANE _ After crash-landing her plane in Sylvia Graham's front
yard, the student pilot knocks on the door and asks to use the
phone to call 911. And, also, could she please have a towel because
she's bleeding. The student pilot was treated at the hospital for
minor injuries. The plane is badly damaged. Graham, who was reading
the paper with her husband when they heard a loud noise they
thought was thunder, didn't get to see the plane in her yard at
2111 Lake Bass Circle. They were evacuated. (Coyle, Palm Beach
Post). WITH PHOTO.

A COMPLICATED CHARACTER WAITS IN THE WINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ The day before Yugoslavia effectively surrendered to
NATO, Vuk Draskovic sat in his office, stroking his beard, already
plotting the future.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, in the hallway of the spacious headquarters of his
Serbian Renewal Movement, boxes of campaign literature were stacked
up, ready to go, even though there is no campaign yet.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, however, is ready. And he says Serbia and the rest of
Yugoslavia is ready once and for all to end its string of futile
wars, to return to the fold of the international community that has
burdened it with economic sanctions and, for more than two months,
blasted it with bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's grip on power has been
weakened by his capitulation to NATO. But whether Milosevic
resigns, which is unlikely, or is pushed aside depends on the
ability of this country's notoriously divided opposition to put
forward a candidate who can beat him.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the biggest opposition party in Serbia, Draskovic is
frequently mentioned as one politician who could replace Milosevic.
While many praise Draskovic's blunt and often courageous honesty,
they just as often bemoan his unpredictability and volatility.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, a 52-year-old writer-turned-politician, embodies all
of Serbia's promise and contradictions. At one moment he is
preaching the virtues of democracy with the passion of a true
believer. Then he digresses into nationalist rhetoric and
reinforces the paralyzing perception of victimhood here, calling
Serbs ``the new Jews of Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   A fervent anticommunist, he advocates the establishment of a
constitutional monarchy and return of the Yugoslav royal family
from exile.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic has publicly called for Milosevic's ouster on many
occasions and led street protests demanding his resignation. Yet
last January, Draskovic joined Milosevic's cabinet as a deputy
prime minister. He said he wanted to change the government from
within. His critics say he sold out.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no denying Draskovic's charisma, his ability to
attract and inspire an audience, or his bravery in a political
culture where there are few examples of people willing to incur the
wrath of Milosevic's shadowy, heavy-handed police.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, he was jailed for four days for leading protests
demanding a free press. In 1993, he spent 46 days in prison after
he organized demonstrations against the forced expulsions by Serb
forces in Bosnia. He was beaten regularly and went on a hunger
strike.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Draskovic was the first member of Milosevic's
government to publicly suggest that the country should cut its
losses by allowing an armed international peacekeeping force into
Kosovo under the auspices of the United Nations. Milosevic fired
him for such temerity.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Milosevic has accepted what Draskovic was urging more
than a month ago, Draskovic's stock with ordinary people has risen,
even as many remain skeptical that he could or should replace
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   People here still speak with admiration for how Draskovic stood
before tens of thousands of people and dared to say that Bosnian
Serb forces, backed by the Belgrade government, were killing and
expelling Muslims and Croatians. His wife, Danica, also spoke out,
dramatically challenging the government's denials by noting that
her Muslim friend, and maid of honor at her wedding, had been one
of those expelled.
</P>
<P>
   But many here who want a more open society can't quite bring
themselves to say that Draskovic is the best candidate to replace
Milosevic and bring Yugoslavia back into the embrace of the
international community, even if they can't think of one better
positioned to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Zarko Korac, who leads a small opposition party and is also a
psychologist, said Draskovic is a tough read, both politically and
psychologically.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a genuine pro-western nationalist. I think he genuinely
believes that he is the bridge to the west,'' says Korac. ``The
trouble with him is his ups and downs, his inconsistency. It
borders on being emotionally unstable, which is not good for a
politician.''
</P>
<P>
   The ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party, whose leader,
Vojislav Seslj, is positioning himself to challenge Milosevic,
claiming that Milosevic sold out the Serb people by giving in to
NATO, clearly fears Draskovic. The party's magazine routinely
depicts Draskovic as a drug addict, with cartoon caricatures of
Draskovic with needles sticking in his arms in every issue.
</P>
<P>
   Many democracy activists here, meanwhile, privately express
concerns about Draskovic's former close friendship with Seslj.
Draskovic and Seslj were best men at each other's weddings, but
have since had a falling out. But some see them as being cut from
the same demagogue cloth.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Draskovic insisted that his brand of
``democratic nationalism'' is far more constructive than the
``negative nationalism'' of Milosevic and Seslj, which is
authoritarian and antiwestern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democratic Serbian nationalism is healthy nationalism,
fighting for the interest of the nation but not against other
states,'' he said. ``Democratic Serbian nationalism means the
project for establishing democratic institutions, a non-ideological
army and police, private property as a basis of the economy, a free
media, a non-ideological justice system. It can transform Serbia
into a European state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Destructive Serbian nationalism is fighting for isolation, to
keep Serbia separated from Europe and the USA. It means the
promotion of the US and Europe as traditional enemies. It's a
program based on the sovereignty of the last century.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a democratic Serbia must respect and accommodate the 26
ethnic groups living in the country. He calls ``ethnic cleansing''
_ a term coined by Serbs to refer to the forced removal of a
different ethnic group _ ``a crime against humanity.'' But he says
it must be looked at in a historical context, and that Serbs have
been victimized just as ethnic Albanians were in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Draskovic advocated that those who refused to formally
declare allegiance to the Serbian government be expelled from
Kosovo. ``The war between Serbs and Albanians will be very short,''
he said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, Draskovic is more conciliatory. He admits that
some Serb forces ``committed crimes while expelling Albanians,''
but insists that most refugees fled on their own or on the
instructions of the Kosovo Liberation Army, which wanted to create
a humanitarian disaster to galvanize international support for
their cause.
</P>
<P>
   He says that, on his recommendation, Milosevic authorized the
arrest of any Serb forces who overstepped their authority in
Kosovo, and claims that more than 400 were arrested before he was
thrown out of the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``My duty is to demand that any Serb who committed atrocities,
crimes against civilians, must be prosecuted. It is the only way to
protect our national face and tradition,'' he said. ``I would hope
terrorists and killers on all sides would be prosecuted.''
</P>
<P>
   In that list, he includes the NATO generals who killed hundreds
of innocent Serb civilians in more than two months of airstrikes.
He said at least 140 members of his party have been among the
victims. A family friend, 16-year-old Sanja Milenkovic, was killed
when NATO bombed a bridge just days after Draskovic gave her one of
his novels to read as she prepared for a mathematics competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I learned Sanja was killed, I almost cried,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But with the hostilities winding down, Draskovic is the only
politician here openly calling for reconciliation with the west.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic said his grandfather, Peter Draskovic, was a gold
miner in California who left the promise of America to return home
to fight during World War I. His father was a partisan who fought
the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather's last words to me were `Always love America.'
I'm not so brave that I could go to his grave and tell him, `Look
what America has done to us,' '''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he believes the development of democracy in Serbia, and a
willingness by the West to embrace the longtime pariah of the
international community, is the only hope for his country. He also
hints at more street protests and mounting a challenge to
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that when the war stops, we have a big political
fight,'' he says. ``I will be out there the first day the bombing
stops.''

TEXAS SCHOOLS TAP THE POWER OF SHAME

<P>
   FORT WORTH _ A decade of reform efforts, cash rewards, and
threats of state takeovers didn't improve test scores at the Van
Zandt-Guinn Elementary School.
</P>
<P>
   Shame did.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, Texas began labeling every public school with one
of four ratings, from low-performing to exemplary, based largely on
state test scores. Then, they launched a campaign to publicize
them. Soonparents, teachers, students, and neighbors near Van
Zandt-Guinn saw the tiny school flashed on the local nightly news
with a red F.
</P>
<P>
   The shame factor worked. Staff volunteered to tutor students,
students held pep rallies to boost enthusiasm for learning, and
parents brainstormed at community meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Van Zandt-Guinn has among the highest test scores in the
state, despite a student population that is 100 percent poor. It
seems everyone, from a 45-year-old neighbor with no children to a
nearby store clerk, knows the school is ``recognized,'' the state's
second-highest rating.
</P>
<P>
   Now, other states are starting to recognize the role that public
embarrassment can play in public education. Massachusetts plans to
start assigning schools similar ratings next year based on the
Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System, or MCAS. And if
Texas is any indicator, publicizing those scores may prove to be
the most powerful motivator local public school reform has ever
seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a system of reality. ... It says this is where we are
and this is where we need to be,'' said David P. Driscoll,
Massachusetts education commissioner. ``Sometimes motivation is a
pat on the back and sometimes it is fear.''
</P>
<P>
   But Massachusetts teachers, already feeling a strong dose of
public humiliation after half of the candidates who took a new
teacher test last year failed, say the ratings will only make
teachers feel more disillusioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the dunce cap was put in the closet a long time
ago,'' said Steve Gorrie, head of the Massachusetts Teachers
Association, the state's largest teachers' union. ``Teachers, like
students, respond far better to support than naming, shaming, and
pointing fingers.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas education officials agree that shame alone does not change
schools. But they were able to turn teachers' frustrations in
low-performing schools into action and _ along with money, staff
training, and even teacher firings _ to boost scores on the Texas
Assessment of Academic Skills, or TAAS.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has poured money and effort into schools since reform
began in 1984. Tactics included lowering class sizes to 22 in
kindergarten to fourth-grade. The movement gathered steam and in
1994 the state began grading schools and letting communities know
exactly how their schools stacked up.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently _ and most remarkably _ the reform movement has
meant every single one of the state's 250,000 teachers, some of the
most poorly paid in the country, will get a $3,000 raise this
September.
</P>
<P>
   Texas also has curbed social promotion of students and
strengthened teacher candidates. Those efforts have trickled down
to local districts such as Fort Worth, and individual schools, such
as Van Zandt-Guinn.
</P>
<P>
   Nervous that Van Zandt-Guinn's test scores, although improving,
weren't rising fast enough, Fort Worth School Superintendent Thomas
S. Tocco transferred all the teachers out of the school four years
ago. Principal Constance Goines hand-picked new teachers, keeping
only four of the original 14. Tocco insisted on 18 extra days for
teacher training and Van Zandt-Guinn's school year was extended to
200 days.
</P>
<P>
   Students began spending a minimum of 2 1/2 hours a day on
writing. An hour was set aside for math and every student received
an additional two periods of the subject a week from a specialized
math teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Van Zandt-Guinn, named after two prominent local families, is in
an impoverished southeast section of Fort Worth, a block from
Interstate 35.
</P>
<P>
   Boarded-up or dilapidated single-family homes line wide,
pothole-filled streets near the school; a bail bondsman's office is
two blocks away. All 280 students in the almost all-minority school
are on a free- or reduced-price-lunch program. Most of the students
walk to the school, created in 1979 when two schools merged. Many
parents were taught in those earlier schools.
</P>
<P>
   While the school was largely once ignored by residents, it is
now noticed _ and celebrated. Neighbor Marie Hapatale, 22, says she
will continue to rent in the area to ensure that her 2-year-old
attends school there. Others also say they are staying because of
the stellar school, despite the ability to move to better sections
of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is very strong pressure,'' said Goines. ``You feel like
everyone knows what you are. It's in the newspapers and it's public
record. The kids know it, the parents and everyone else knows it.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Tocco's leadership, Fort Worth's other schools also have
improved: Forty-six of the district's 114 schools were projected to
be low-performing last year. Only one was.
</P>
<P>
   Texas boasts similar results, and Massachusetts _ which is
mimicking many Texas reform efforts _ hopes to see similar rises in
test scores.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread fears of major failures plagued Texas when it began a
graduation test in 1988, but the news has largely been good: In
1994, some 5 percent of Texas seniors didn't pass the test; this
year, only 2 percent failed. Starting in two years, Massachusetts
seniors will have to pass the MCAS to graduate.
</P>
<P>
   And Texas will not allow any school to make excuses for bad
scores because of students' race or socio-economic background.
Ratings are largely based on the lowest-performing ethnic or
socio-economic group in a school. Massachusetts will rate schools
on their overall scores as well as their ability to raise scores of
all students.
</P>
<P>
   And while teachers in both states say they are resigned to
standardized testing, they still worry they cannot teach as
creatively with such singular emphasis on the tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hate it, we call is TASS-Mania,'' said Annette Cootes,
spokeswoman for the Texas State Teachers Association. ``It is too
high-stakes, it is all anyone focuses on. We drill, we drill, we
drill.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, at Van Zandt-Guinn, everything is about the test.
</P>
<P>
   Every bulletin board in the school offers TAAS advice: ``Slam
dunk the TAAS'' reads one. Posters are tacked in every room showing
students as young as first grade that words like ``sum'' and
``add'' both mean put together.
</P>
<P>
   Students who are expected to take longer on the untimed TAAS are
put in a separate room so they don't feel pressure to finish when
their classmate do.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, after fifth-grade teacher Mourine Kirk spent the
period before lunch going over decimals _ an item bound to appear
on the test the following week _ her students nervously shifted
from foot to foot and predicted their outcome on the test. They
take several practice tests so they know their anticipated score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm nervous, I'm not going to pass,'' said Laquana Phillips,
11, shaking her head sadly. She said she needs more than 10 points
to pass math, her weakest subject.
</P>
<P>
   Her classmate Amber Sherman frets over the stress on her and
even her teachers. ``You don't want people thinking you go to a bad
school,'' Amber said.
</P>
<P>
   While some Texas educators continue to cringe at the amount of
pressure on children to perform well on the TAAS, some community
leaders say the rating system gives a tangible measure of schools
that was missing in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very important benchmarks,'' said Floyd R. Davis Jr.,
president and CEO of United Community Centers Inc., which provides
social services to residents around Fort Worth. A community center
he oversees is six blocks from Van Zandt-Guinn.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Davis said he understands why some teachers, parents, and
students dislike the pressure of the test. Those teachers and
students often say they feel the reputation of the entire community
is hinged on how well their school performs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is,'' Goines said. ``It's like a report card. Everyone can
understand it.''

WEB IS WINNING THE TALENT WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's possible that CNN financial news anchorman Lou Dobbs will
rescind his decision to quit the network. He has resigned (or
threatened to resign) on numerous occasions. Some believe that his
most recent resignation is just another gambit to extract more
concessions from CNN management.
</P>
<P>
   But it's more likely that Dobbs really has decided to leave and
move on to the next thing. The next thing is an Internet venture
called Space.com. Dobbs has long been, as he says, ``a space nut,''
and joining Space.com offers him the opportunity to make his
avocation his livelihood. It also offers him the chance to make a
great deal more money than CNN would ever be willing to pay him
(and they pay him a ton).
</P>
<P>
   One ordinarily wouldn't think of Dobbs as a cutting-edge kind of
guy, but he's emblematic of an important shift in the employment
game. Simply put, talent is going to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, there was great concern that the most talented
business school graduates were eschewing careers in manufacturing
and management to become consultants and financial services
professionals. Now, talented business school graduates are
eschewing consulting and financial services to join Internet
enterprises. This brain drain is causing something close to panic
at ``traditional'' companies. It will likely accelerate as Internet
technology advances and improves.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what's happening is financial. Consider the case of two
Wall Street Journal employees. One stayed and is now a senior
editor. He probably makes $125,000 a year and has some options to
buy Dow Jones stock. Including benefits and travel and
entertainment expenses, his current annual compensation package
comes to roughly $180,000.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad, you say, but it's nothing when compared to the
compensation package earned by David Kansas, a former Wall Street
Journal employee who now edits TheStreet.com.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas earns the same salary (give or take) as his former
colleague, gets similar benefits, but owns stock in TheStreet.com
that, at current prices, is worth roughly $5 million. Given the
choice between these two career paths, talent will go where Kansas
went.
</P>
<P>
   Talented people everywhere are doing just that. Wednesday, The
Wall Street Journal (of all places) published a front-page article
describing how one top manager after another has left The Walt
Disney Company to join recently established or newly established
Internet ventures. The advertising business has had to increase
salaries dramatically and create Internet marketing companies to
keep key employees down on the farm.
</P>
<P>
   Even with these inducements, creative talent is leaving in
droves. The consulting and accounting businesses are finding it
much harder to recruit new hires. Young hotshots look at a 15-year
path to partnership as a kind of careerist's Death March when
compared to the possibilities, real or imagined, of the Web.
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't just about money. Another piece of this migration
is demographic. Hotshots in their 20s and 30s look at traditional
companies and see squadrons of baby-boom white men occupying all
the best jobs. Many of these good old boys are on their second
marriages, with new families, so they'll be working into their 70s.
Moving up the organizational chart under these circumstances isn't
just difficult, it's impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies, on the other hand, are run by talented
people in their 20s and 30s. The organizational chart has lots of
good jobs and empty boxes waiting to be filled. There's more than
enough opportunity. If anything, there's too much to do.
</P>
<P>
   This leads to the third great attraction of Internet employment;
failure is expected. Bright young people know that they can go to
an Internet start-up, fail, and yet still get picked up on waivers
by some other Internet start-up. Internet culture considers failure
a necessary qualification for moving up. You can't be any good
unless you've taken a big chance on something that didn't work out.
</P>
<P>
   This is not how traditional companies think, to say the least.
People who participate in corporate failures at traditional
companies are usually consigned to some nonexistent square on the
organizational chart. Failure leads to exile and an abrupt end to
one's career path. This is why so many traditional companies
engender such odious office politics. The game is about avoiding
blame and not taking chances.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a game highly intelligent, highly motivated, highly
creative people are interested in playing. They'd much rather go
for it and see what happens. In the world of the Internet, they can
and they're not penalized for trying. They're only penalized if
they don't try.
</P>
<P>
   When Lou Dobbs, the consummate inside player, dispenses with the
old model, the rules of the game really have changed. The talent
war is being won by the Web. The challenge for traditional
companies will be to reverse this trend. It isn't just about money.
It's about changing corporate culture.

 &HT;    Christian groups: Boycott Army until Wicca rejected
 &HT;    By Kim Sue Lia Perkes
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A group of politically influential conservative
religious organizations is telling Christians to boycott joining or
re-enlisting in the U.S. Army until it bans witchcraft rituals on
posts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the Army withdraws all official support and approval
from witchcraft, no Christian should enlist or re-enlist in the
Army, and Christian parents should not allow their children to join
the Army,'' said Paul M. Weyrich, president of the Free Congress
Association, one of the organizations calling for the boycott. ``An
Army that sponsors satanic rituals is unworthy of representing the
United States of America.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the 13 groups calling for the boycott are such familiar
names as the Christian Coalition, Traditional Values Coalition,
Christian Action Network and the American Family Association. The
Christian Coalition alone boasts 2.1 million members.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials _ busy because of the Yugoslavia peace accord
signed Wednesday _ were unavailable for immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over military approval allowing followers of
Wicca _ a nature worshipthat claims roots in pre-Christian Europe
and does not believe in Satan _ to practice their rituals on
installations erupted after an Austin American-Statesman story last
month about witches on the nation's largest military installation,
Fort Hood in Killeen.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Hood officials, faced with a congressman's demand that
Wicca rituals be banned, said last month that the practices would
be allowed to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Hood sanctioned Wicca three years ago by providing space
for rituals, and Wiccan groups now are springing up on U.S.
military bases worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequent reports by other media have focused on the Army,
which is why the conservative religious groups are boycotting that
branch, according to the Free Congress Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The religious groups also are lobbying the Army to change its
handbook for chaplains, which lists the Church of Satan among
alternative religious groups that could be sanctioned to practice
on military posts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The official approval of Satanism and witchcraft by the Army
is a direct assault on the Christian faith that generations of
American soldiers have fought and died for,'' Weyrich said.
</P>
<P>
   John Machate, coordinator for the Military Pagan Network, called
the boycott ``a direct attack on the Constitution of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the country's most sacred tenets is the First Amendment,
which guarantees the freedom of speech and religion, Machate said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All religions are protected, not just those that Congress, the
president or Supreme Court determine,'' he said. ``All religions
are and should be permitted free practice on military bases, within
reasonable limits.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the pagan network, a national civil rights
organization for pagans, at least six military installations allow
witches to practice their rituals.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen installations and two Navy ships are home to Wiccan
study groups.
</P>
<P>
   Several other groups on bases worldwide are in the process of
getting formal approval to practice their faith.
</P>
<P>
   At Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio _ the Air Force's only
basic training base _ about 100 recruits and personnel attend a
weekly Wiccan study group.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the American-Statesman story, U.S. Rep. Bob Barr,
R-Ga., called for banning Wicca from military installations.
</P>
<P>
   Barr attempted, but failed, to attach an amendment dealing with
the issue on to the U.S. Department of Defense budget. Barr has
called the practice of witchcraft on bases ``nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, Warner Robins Air Force Base near Macon permits a
monthly discussion group for pagans.

   CASSETT-EXHIBIT (Washington) _ ``Women should be someone and not
something,'' the American artist Mary Cassatt (1844-1926) once
wrote, emphatically underlining her words. And she dedicated a long
career to fleshing out this conviction through art. Her efforts
come across with a quiet, though sometimes surprisingly passionate
force in ``Mary Cassatt: Modern Woman,'' a succinct survey of her
paintings and prints at the National Gallery of Art in Washington.
The show, which has appeared in Chicago and Boston, is the first
comprehensive look at Cassatt's work in nearly 30 years. And it
marks yet another step in evaluating an artist who was herself a

Sea. For the last four years, their quest has been to collect the
stuff of Earth itself and bring it back for a new exhibition
illustrating the planet's 4.5 billion-year history. Now the

TOURS LET YOU STOP AND SMELL THE FLOWERS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   June is the month of wine and roses _ and garden tours and
courses and lectures. There are so many good things to do and see
that there's almost no time to smell the roses.
</P>
<P>
   Among the best of June are the open house and garden tours
because perennial beds are at their peak and roses are at their
absolute zenith, especially in the grand gardens managed by
professional horticulturists.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, though, I like even better the garden tours put on by
local garden clubs because I can see what serious gardeners, who
are just plain people like me, can do in their own back yards.
There are always new, tasteful ideas, and I have absolute
admiration for the level of work put into these gardens.
</P>
<P>
   So what is more rare than a day in June, snooping around in
private gardens that you wouldn't be invited to otherwise? Actually
not so rare, because you can spend every weekend on one tour or
another, but it's still a treat not to be missed.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Massachusetts Federation of Garden Clubs have
these tours for June, and many months of preparation and hard work
have gone into the big day.
</P>
<P>
   June 11-12, Hanover Garden Club tour, ``Blooms Beyond the Garden
Gate.'' For tickets call 781-843-4366.
</P>
<P>
   June 12, Acton and Stow, ``Rhapsody in Bloom'' with music and
lunch, 978-486-0540.
</P>
<P>
   June 12, Lexington, always an interesting tour. Call
978-369-2835.
</P>
<P>
   June 12-13, Marshfield, ``Festival of Flowers.'' Call
781-834-6135.
</P>
<P>
   June 15-16, Duxbury, ``Artist in the Garden.'' Call
781-934-0824.
</P>
<P>
   June 16, Hingham, Historical Society 75th Annual House Tour.
Call 781-749-1815.
</P>
<P>
   June 26, Brockton, Garden Tour. Call 508-584-2570.
</P>
<P>
   June 27, Belmont, ``Down the Garden Path,'' a tour of 11 special
historic gardens. Call 617-484-4817.
</P>
<P>
   Boston will host another rare treat, a special event for very
serious gardeners. The American Horticultural Society is holding
its annual conference in Boston from Wednesday to Saturday at the
Fairmont Copley Plaza Hotel. Promoting excellence in horticulture
is the aim of this national society headquartered in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   With a theme of ``Celebrating You, The American Gardener,'' the
speakers cover the who's who in American horticulture. The
conference program has cutting edge talks and panels plus giving
awards, including to our own Weston Nurseries, Michael Van
Valkenburgh, Joseph Hudak, and Mayor Thomas Menino of Boston (for
his Broom to Bloom urban beautification program). Four afternoons
of garden tours will cover the best of everything floral around
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The whole event is pricey but good. One-day afternoon tours are
$80-$100 each, and the Saturday flower arranging workshop costs
$25. For more information, call 800-768-8700.
</P>
<P>
   Our own venerable institutions all have superb garden walks,
summer lectures, courses, and hands-on training programs. There's
just no excuse to sit at home and mope about the unfinished
maintenance in one's garden when it's so easy to go to someone
else's garden. They usually have just as many unfinished chores as
you do.)
</P>
<P>
   Some good places for programs, walks, and talks include:
</P>
<P>
   --Massachusetts Horticultural Society Elm Bank in Dover.
Programs all summer plus on June 19 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. you
might enjoy all the marvellous products from our local farms at the
Massachusetts Market Place, produced along with the state
Department of Food and Agriculture. Also included are hayrides,
free pH testing of soil samples, plants for sale, the trial
gardens, and children's activities. Call 617-536-9280, ext. 324.

ATTACKS ON CABBIES RAISE QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No crowded hearings. No noisy demonstrations. No thundering
editorials. No Page 1 stories. No television stakeouts. No flood of
letters to the editor.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, 12 Boston-area cab drivers have been attacked
by armed passengers; all but one have been robbed; several have
been wounded. At first the attackers used knives. Then came
handguns. This past Monday, a cabbie in Roxbury found himself
gazing at the unfriendly end of a sawed-off shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction has been all but nonexistent. The Boston media have
not gone into overdrive. The mayor and governor have had little to
say. The city's vast array of neighborhood organizations and
special-interest groups have preserved an unbroken silence. The
police commissioner serenely waited until the 10th attack before
making time to meet with cab officials and taxi drivers. As for
public outcries: Listen carefully, and you can hear _ nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well. Who cares about cab drivers, anyway? It's not like
these guys getting robbed and stabbed and having guns shoved in
their faces are important. Why get in a lather over people who work
12-hour shifts, don't make a lot of money, and frequently speak
with an accent?
</P>
<P>
   Now, if 12 Beacon Hill politicians had been held up in the past
month, then we'd see some action. The State Police would be
assigning round-the-clock bodyguards to every member of the
Legislature. Senators and representatives would be calling press
conferences to announce bravely that they would perform their
public duties regardless of the threat to their personal safety.
Conservative columnists would be getting slammed for creating the
``antigovernment climate'' that gave rise to the attacks. Yes,
indeed, if politicians found themselves under siege, it would be a
very big deal.
</P>
<P>
   Or suppose it were employees of Boston's abortion clinics who
were being robbed at knife- and gunpoint every few days. The
response would register on the Richter scale. Teams of reporters
would be assigned to the story; their articles would dominate the
front page. Planned Parenthood and the ACLU would be screaming with
outrage. The National Organization for Women would go ballistic at
this latest threat to ``the constitutional right to an abortion.''
The governor would mobilize the National Guard to protect the
clinics _ and, if he didn't, the White House would do it for him.
The talk shows would devote hour after hour to discussing the
latest developments.
</P>
<P>
   But mere cabbies? The only place they're likely to see anyone
who worries about their constitutional rights is in the bathroom
mirror.
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, though, the Boston Police Department is on the job.
The cops are under orders to pull over taxis at random _ ``to
ensure their safety,'' a top police official says. The department's
spokesmen say the drivers are delighted to be pulled over when they
haven't done anything wrong; drivers speaking off the record say
they hate it.
</P>
<P>
   One cab company, Town Taxi, has installed roof ads on 25 of its
cars. ``Save a life,'' they plead, urging motorists to call the
police if a cab driver appears to be in trouble. Those roof ads
would be infinitely more effective if they read: ``WARNING: The
driver of this taxicab is armed.'' In fact, driving a taxi would be
the safest of occupations if cabbies routinely carried a gun.
</P>
<P>
   But the police have no intention of allowing drivers to pack
heat. Until 1989, the Boston Police Department flatly barred cab
drivers from arming themselves. Today, they merely make it
impossible in practice. Any cabbie who qualifies for a gun license
can take his gun with him while driving, the BPD spokesman says _
then immediately adds that none of the drivers who have been
attacked would qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's not as if the police are leaving the cabbies with no
way to protect themselves. When they pull a cab over for a random
check, they are supposed to give the driver a pink card with safety
tips. A cabbie who finds himself under attack could use one of
those cards to give a nasty paper cut to an armed robber.
</P>
<P>
   Let a bank charge $2 to withdraw money from its ATMs, and
lawmakers will trip over themselves in the rush to denounce the
greedy corporations. Let the New England Patriots propose to
relocate from one New England state to another, and forests will be
leveled so the papers can cover the story in numbing detail. But
let a dozen men who spend long days driving for a living be mugged
in the space of a few weeks and no one goes into a frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Even when cabbies are killed, hardly anyone loses sleep over it.
In 1991, three Boston cab drivers were shot dead in their cars. The
city scarcely noticed, until some drivers threatened to stop
picking up fares in Roxbury and Dorchester, where the murders had
taken place. That was too much for then-Mayor Ray Flynn, who
denounced the frightened drivers as ``reckless and irresponsible.''
When the president of one cab company protested Flynn's
callousness, the mayor called a press conference to denounce him.
``If (he) doesn't want to operate his cabs in these areas, he can
get out the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Happily, Flynn is no longer mayor. And happily, no cabbies have
been killed in 1999. Must it come to that? If a dozen beagles had
been attacked with knives and guns on Boston's streets in the last
3 1/2 weeks, the town would be in an uproar. Don't taxi drivers
deserve at least the concern we would lavish on dogs?

CHALLENGES OF PARENTING AN ONLY CHILD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sitting in the family room of their Andover, Mass., home a few
weeks ago, Daniel Morocco and Toby Lazerton listened intently as
their daughter ran through editing changes for her sixth-grade
social studies project on England. Suddenly Lazerton got up and
left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hit me that there was too much intensity in the room with
two adults tending to one child's project,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that two parents should never focus on one child at the
same time; it's just that in the Morocco-Lazerton household,
12-year-old Jaime Morocco is the only child. Having Mom and Dad
both attend to her at once is the norm, not the exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want Jaime to feel like she's under a microscope,''
says her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Lazerton's sensitivity is typical of a kind of sixth sense many
parents of only children develop out of necessity, not just for
their child but also for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parenting an only is high-pressure parenting,'' says
psychologist Carl Pickhardt of Austin, Texas. ``Because it is the
first and last child all in one, you tend to be harder on yourself:
If you have only one child, you only have one time to get it
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, some of that pressure seeps down to the child.
</P>
<P>
   All children, at least through elementary school, want to please
their parents. ``For the only child,'' Pickhardt says, ``that
desire is even greater, because the triangle in the family creates
a stronger attachment.'' Pickhardt is the author of ``Keys to
Parenting the Only Child'' (Barons Educational Series, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   That the attachment is so strong is both good and bad.
</P>
<P>
   It can mean, for instance, that a child is more likely to seek
out parents' views on issues, thus minimizing peers' risky
influence. But it can also mean that a child is so able to take the
parents' perspective that she withholds information to protect
them, rather than withholding to protect herself as most children
do, says University of Texas psychologist Toni Falbo, who has been
researching only children since 1970. That that dynamic exists at
all is a pressure for a child, she says.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that parents walk a thin line, with many falling
victim to one extreme or the other. In the past, for instance, when
less was known about the connectedness that only-child status
confers, parents were likely to be overly indulgent and protective.
Now, Falbo says, with more awareness of that extreme, and with more
mothers pursuing careers and having only one child by choice, the
pendulum is swinging the other way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about parents who are too uninvolved,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Morocco walks the line with exquisite awareness. As a youngster,
he had the double whammy of being an only child and having no
cousins his age. ``I was the focus of my parents and also of aunts
and uncles. I was always under the gun,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He works hard for his daughter not to feel that way and suspects
his parenting is a more conscious process than it is for other
parents of just one child. On the other hand, he probably speaks
for them when he says, ``I worry that I might make a mistake ...
that would cause us to lose the closeness we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Parental dilemmas
</P>
<P>
   The nature of that closeness can affect many aspects of life in
a single-child family:
</P>
<P>
   --Disciplining. Not seeing a sibling also being punished, not
having anyone to commiserate with about how mean Mom and Dad are,
and feeling very connected combine to make an only child take our
disapproval more to heart than other children, says parent educator
Marcy Tannenbaum-Fox, who leads workshops on one-child families at
Families First in Cambridge. Add to that the parental tendency to
overlook infractions, just because it's easy to do so when there's
only one child, and the result is that our anger, when it does
come, can be all the more upsetting.
</P>
<P>
   Tannenbaum-Fox reminds parents that an only child, like everyone
else, needs discipline. ``Don't let any guilt you may have about
only having one child get in the way of appropriate
limit-setting,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   --Giving responsibility. It's also sometimes easier not to
insist that a child pull her weight at home; after all, with only
one child's mess to clean up, it's not a big deal to do it
yourself. In fact, it is a big deal. An only child who isn't
expected to contribute to the family is more likely to feel
entitled, says social psychologist and researcher Susan Newman. A
child who feels more powerful than her place in the family warrants
not only doesn't feel good about herself but also can end up
driving a wedge between her parents, because she is adept at
manipulating them.
</P>
<P>
   Newman's antidote: ``Think big. Establish chores and
responsibilities just as you would in a family with more children,
even if it makes it harder on you,'' she says. Newman is the author
of ``Parenting an Only Child: The Joys and Challenges of Raising
Your One and Only'' (Doubleday).
</P>
<P>
   --Sharing. Selfishness is an issue that pushes the button of
almost every parent of an only, a holdover from the stereotype of
the selfish only child. Newman reminds parents that selfishness is
a developmental issue, especially in the preschool and teen years,
and can have nothing to do with only-child status. Nonetheless,
because an only child doesn't have siblings to share with, she
urges parents to model sharing behavior at all ages, from
toddlerhood _ ``One bite for you, one bite for me'' _ to teens:
``You can borrow this sweater if you want.''
</P>
<P>
   --Dealing with conflict. Because an only child tends to be
emotionally closely aligned with her parents and doesn't have
siblings to fight with, she may find conflict intimidating.
Pickhardt says that may be why the onset of adolescent behavior,
when children and parents are at each other's throat, is typically
delayed for only children. ``They don't feel the need to make the
break as badly as other children. The loss of closeness and
prospect of conflict is as scary to the child as to the parent,''
he says. When it does come, though, it can be worse than in other
families. ``It's not that the only child pushes harder for
independence, but that the members of the triangle are so tightly
interwoven, the push is more deeply felt,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of conflict can also make a child less willing to extend
herself in friendship. ``Friendships by definition include
conflict, which an only may shy away from,'' says Tannenbaum-Fox.
She is quick to point out, however, that personality and
developmental stage contribute to this as well.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving well alone
</P>
<P>
   When children are young, parents should facilitate playdates,
and at all ages we should model conflict resolution. But by school
age, when friendships become more important as well as trickier to
negotiate, we should cool it.
</P>
<P>
   She says there's a tendency for parents of an only child to rush
in to fix problems, an irony that is often lost on the parents:
``This is the child who needs the hands-on experience the most, and
here we are reducing opportunity for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickhardt tells parents not to worry so much about a child who
wants to spend time alone. It's not just that these children come
to enjoy peace and quiet, but also that they enjoy their own
company. ``If the choice is having a great time with yourself or
going off with friends where you may or may not have a great time,
there will be times when they will choose to be alone, and that's
OK,'' he says. Tannenbaum-Fox says that even an only child who
likes being in the social thick of things tends not to get bored
the minute she's alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as a child has some playmates, don't assume that
because she spends time alone, she's unhappy,'' says
Tannenbaum-Fox. ``Accept that your only may have fewer friends, but
that the friends she has are likely to be more loyal and more
intense.''
</P>
<P>
   The rule of thumb that guides Newman's advice (as well as her
parenting of her son, Andrew, who is 17) is that it's not good to
do everything you can or be all things to your child, whether it's
a question of picking up a toddler every time he falls down or
buying something he wants just because you can.
</P>
<P>
   Jaime Morocco says she has never felt that her parents give her
too much or too little of anything, including themselves. ``Maybe I
get more help with my homework,'' she says, ``but mostly, I just
think the three of us are a good team.''

WASHING SODA CLEANS WITHOUT PHOSPHATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. You wrote recently that to clean a garbage disposal, you
should pour in some washing soda, then two trays of ice cubes, and
run the disposal. It sounds like a good idea, but for the life of
me, I cannot find washing soda. What is it, and where can I get it?

   A. Washing soda is concentrated sal soda (sodium carbonate), a
phosphate-free laundry booster found in the detergent section of
supermarkets. Directions for cleaning plumbing traps and lines are
on the box of the Arm &AMP; Hammer product, called Arm &AMP; Hammer super
washing soda detergent booster. Other manufacturers also make it.
Washing soda is an effective heavy-duty cleaning alternative to
solvents.
</P>
<P>
   It is more caustic than baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), but if
after all this legwork (whew!) you can't find it, baking soda might
be nearly as effective.

   Q. I am looking at a house I would like to buy. It has 1,300
square feet of living space and electric heat. The owner said he
spends $1,100 for heat and hot water a year. I am skeptical of that
figure, but if I bought the house I would install hot-water heat
fired by gas. I learned that this would cost $6,500 to $9,500 to
install. Is that something reasonable to expect?
</P>
<P>
   STANLEY KRUMSHAK, Boston
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I too am suspicious of that electric heating and hot water
yearly cost. The cost of a new system and boiler sounds reasonable,
although you could put in a hot-air system and gas furnace for
somewhat less. A nonelectric heating system and hot water heating
could save you half of that $1,100. The savings would pay for the
new system in 12 years (low side) or 18 years (high side). Payoff
would be faster if you put in a less expensive hot-air system and
furnace. These payoff times are beyond the 10-year limit used to
gauge economic feasibility, but if you like the house and location,
it is worth doing. And maybe you can get the owner to knock off
something from the price because of this need to replace the
expensive electric heat.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The addition to my house has a roof with a 15-degree pitch,
asphalt shingles, and two roof windows set at 30 degrees. My
problem is noise from rain. The roof is well insulated. How can I
lessen that drumming on the roof and roof windows?
</P>
<P>
   WILLIAM ROBERTS, Rockland, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Nothing can be done about the roof itself because the rain is
impact noise, and to stop impact noise you have to put on a softer
surface. Can't you just see putting Astroturf on your roof? I don't
think the roof is as much of a culprit as the roof windows, which
act as a drum, echoing and reverberating every drop that falls.
</P>
<P>
   Try installing a Window Quilt at the ceiling line. You could
make it translucent, but you would have to open it for air. Window
quilts are secured tightly to the window frame and can help quite a
bit. They are sold in home goods and other stores. But don't expect
library silence. Or, you could set up a thin piece of wood,
insulated on the inside with 1-inch rigid foam insulation, that
could be screwed or fastened to the bottom of the opening. It might
be a little awkward to put up and down, but if it works, who cares?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am thinking of replacing my fir gutters with aluminum
gutters, and I'd like a heavy-duty gutter. How do I know I'm
getting a heavy-duty one? I'd like to hang them myself. Is that
practical? How much would the sections have to overlap?
</P>
<P>
   RICHARD STEPHAN, Swampscott, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Thickness of gutters is described by gauge. Roofers and
gutter installers can show you heavy-duty ones; the handyman's
roofer recently suggested a heavy-duty gutter in a certain place,
heavy enough to lean a ladder against. I haven't checked it out
with the ladder yet; I trust my roofer. It might be a little
tougher to get a heavy-duty gutter at a store.
</P>
<P>
   You certainly can do it yourself. There are a few rules to
follow. For starters, the sections generally do not overlap; they
butt end to end, secured with a fastener and mastic.
</P>
<P>
   Second, a gutter should slope about 116 inch per foot.
</P>
<P>
   Third, the gutter should be in the right position for water to
drip into the center, not too near the front edge and not too near
the back edge. To determine that position, lay a board on the roof
so that it overhangs by a foot or two. The front edge of the gutter
should be within half an inch of this board.
</P>
<P>
   You can hang the gutter with strap hangers, hangers that fit
into the gutter itself, or with a spike and ferrule. The spike goes
through the gutter right at the top, into the fascia, preferably
into the end of a rafter. The ferrule fits inside the gutter so the
spike doesn't squeeze the gutter out of shape.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. A radiator leak wet a part of my carpet and backing. The leak
is fixed, but the carpet is exuding a chemical smell. How can I get
rid of that smell?
</P>
<P>
   JOHN PAUPLIS, Wayland, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Let the carpet and the pad dry out thoroughly; you may have
to lift the rug to get at the pad. Putting a fan on the rug will
hasten drying. Lots of ventilation will, too. If that does not
improve things, you can have the carpet cleaned. Another
possibility is to cut out the pad that got wet and substitute a new
piece of pad.

   Director Bernardo Bertolucci makes two kinds of movies: those,
like ``The Last Emperor'' and ``Little Buddha,'' which are readily
accessible to American audiences, and those, like ``The Sheltering
Sky'' and ``The Conformist,'' where you must find your way into the
film.
</P>
<P>
   Bertolucci's new drama, ``Besieged,'' is one of the latter. If
you want to gain a sense of this film, you must meet it half way if
not three-quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besieged'' opens in Africa with a series of images that look
like an anti-travelogue: pictures of an unhappy people and a
threatening military.
</P>
<P>
   After a 15-minute wander, the film moves to Rome, where
Shandurai (Thandie Newton) studies at the university while working
as a maid to a reclusive pianist, Mr. Kinsky (David Thewlis).
</P>
<P>
   For another 15 minutes, we are taken through scenes from their
daily lives, again almost without dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Then Kinsky suddenly announces that he's in love and wants
Shandurai to marry him, knowing practically nothing about her or
her African culture.
</P>
<P>
   That might be Bertolucci's point, that Europe and Africa are
separated by a cultural divide wider than the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, their behavior turns even more inexplicable, when
Shandurai learns that her long-suffering husband is to be released
from an African prison and will join her in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Besieged'' is an impressionistic film conveyed with a
minimum of talking, plot or explanation, there is not much else to
fill the spaces left by the silence of speech and story. Even
Bertolucci the artist cannot make much of repeated scenes of people
entering a metro or walking down a city street.
</P>
<P>
   The African music is the film's most attractive element, but
even that is explored in a minimal fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you have a cultivated taste for European cinema, you may
find Bertolucci's tolerance for his own laxity a bit too
dispiriting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besieged'' is predominantly in English, with subtitles when it
is not. The film is rated R for brief nudity and sex. 2 stars. &QL;

WHEN TRAGEDY STRIKES, RECALL LIFE'S BLESSINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA FRAZIER ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We've had a lot of drama in our lives during the past few weeks.
I've spun the emotional wheel of fortune and landed on grief, fear
and joy.
</P>
<P>
   My only prize was the sunrise of each new day, which brought
with it the vague promise of another chance at happiness.
</P>
<P>
   First, my father-in-law, Andy, had a stroke. His body had
already been ravaged by a previous stroke, hypertension, failing
kidneys and diabetes. He lapsed into a coma and was placed on life
support. At 65, this is not the retirement one anticipates.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, my mother was involved in a terrible car
accident. Her car was hit at an intersection, and it didn't stop
spinning until it wrapped around a pole like a yo-yo in fate's
palm.
</P>
<P>
   A frantic phone call from my sister at 8 a.m. catapulted me from
my office to a hospital in Fort Worth, where my mother lay in the
emergency room, battered and bruised, and, remarkably, alive.
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting how these things all happen in rapid
succession. We seem to become human dominoes, waiting for disaster
to topple us. My sister was supposed to get married the weekend
after my mother's accident. Two days later, as a matter of fact.
</P>
<P>
   Andy was removed from life support on the day of my mother's
accident. We waited and anticipated. They put a ``Do Not
Resuscitate'' sign on Andy's door.
</P>
<P>
   It felt as if they had put that same sign on the rest of our
lives. But I smiled anyway. I later smiled at my mother's bedside
as she vowed to walk down the aisle at the wedding. I kept smiling
for my family as we sat at the hospital in San Antonio praying and
hoping for Andy's doctors to say they had made a mistake and he'd
be all right. I smiled for my friends as they voiced their concern
and compassion. I smiled, smiled, smiled.
</P>
<P>
   With the aid of a cane and my two sons, Mom did walk down that
aisle as scheduled. A few days later, Andy's soul walked away from
his paralyzed body to what I believe is a better place.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on our way back from Andy's funeral, a big truck slammed
into the back of our vehicle. Can you believe it? Do you ever have
periods like this in your life? Don't you just want to scream,
``That's enough! I've had all I can take. Give me a break!''
</P>
<P>
   As I sat there on the side of the highway, waiting for the state
troopers, I thought about everything that had happened. Then I
thought about everything that could have happened. And do you know
what I did then?
</P>
<P>
   I picked myself up, hugged my frightened family and I smiled,
smiled, smiled.
</P>

CITY MAGAZINES BARE IT, AND GRIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since it's June, it must be time for a parade of pulchritude on
the covers of America's city magazines. This month's Boston
magazine features an exceedingly fit model in a tiny two-piece suit
advertising ``Summer Pleasures.'' Chicago magazine's summer issue
is graced by bikini-clad Gabrielle Reece, the statuesque volleyball
star. The cover girl for San Diego Magazine is Playboy's Miss July
1998 Lisa Dergan striking a come-hither pose in one of the season's
``hot summer swimsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   For the slick city mags, long accused of showcasing perky
``bimbos'' on their covers, it seems that nothing sells like skin.
Well not exactly, say those who understand the magazines' typically
upscale 40-something audience.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Dowden, director of the City and Regional Magazine
Association, said his group recently solicited examples of best-
and worst-selling covers. The sure-fire winners are such city mag
chestnuts as top restaurants, top doctors, and best buys. In other
words, it's the service journalism, not the hot model, that really
sells. In fact, skimpy swimsuit models are usually there to dress
up a service story on ``the best weekend getaways,'' says Dowden,
at least half-seriously.
</P>
<P>
   At Boston magazine, editor Craig Unger has downplayed sexy
covers; the June 1998 ``Summer Pleasures'' issue featured only the
head of a female model. The current cover, he says, ``is one of the
rare times we went for a professional model. We specifically sought
a model who's athletic.'' The model (the exotic-sounding Olanna) is
supposed to connect the reader to such strenuous fun as hiking and
sea kayaking. ``Our history has been that actual words matter more
than the image,'' says Unger. But he's already fielded a dozen
complaints that the midriff-baring Olanna is too skinny.
</P>
<P>
   On Chicago's cover, the 6-foot-3-inch Reece is not simply eye
candy, explains editor Richard Babcock. She's part of the summer
``User's Guide,'' because she actually instructs readers on how to
spike a volleyball. ``There are endless ways to convey good
feelings about the summer season and someone in a swimsuit is one
way,'' he says, presumably with a smile on his face.
</P>
<P>
   In Southern California, where it's summer half the year, Los
Angeles magazine did its sun-and-fun issue in May and cut right to
the chase in the June edition. ``The Sex Issue!'' features a
provocative cover shot of actress Calista Flockhart perched atop a
naked man and includes stories on lap dance parties and
partner-swapping bacchanals.
</P>
<P>
   Editor-in-chief Spencer Beck says the winning formula is to
``get a big star and get a huge service'' cover. (He obviously
considers sex a form of service journalism.) ``I'm a strong
believer that sex sells,'' he declares. ``This is the first (sex
issue) and I'm gonna do it every year because you cannot find the
magazine'' on the newsstands.
</P>
<P>
   So where must one live to escape the city magazines' fascination
with the flesh? How about the City of Brotherly Love where new
Philadelphia magazine editor Stephen Fried tried a counterintuitive
twist. The June ``Great Summer Drives'' cover is pure family
values, with an illustration of dad, mom, junior, and Rover off
road-tripping in the red Mustang. ``We wanted to do something
differently,'' Fried says. ``I think our readers appreciate strong
service and they want the magazine to be interesting and
surprising.''
</P>
<P>
   But Philly may not be a bikini-free zone after all since Fried
is planning a sand-and-sea issue for July. Asked about the cover,
he offers a hint: ``It could involve twins.''
</P>

   At a time when former Cincinnati Enquirer reporter Mike
Gallagher squeals on his confidential informant and fired CNN
producer April Oliver sues a confidential source, it's actually
refreshing to hear a judge order two reporters to jail for keeping
mum about the people who fed them crucial information.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened in former 1996 Olympic bombing suspect
Richard Jewell's long-running libel suit against the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution. In response to Judge John Mather's June 3
order that reporters Kathy Scruggs and Ron Martz be jailed for
failing to reveal law enforcement sources who provided information
about the Jewell investigation, the defendants' attorney Peter
Canfield filed a notice of appeal with the state Court of Appeals
effectively staying their sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Canfield argues that the reporters should not have to reveal
sources because their stories were accurate and because the court
has not examined the viability of Jewell's claims. ``The trial
judge has never looked at the merits of this lawsuit,'' says
Canfield. ``The order puts the cart before the horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his clients are actually prepared to sit behind bars if
the appeal fails, Canfield says, ``I don't think it really serves
our interest to comment.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to instill pride and stability in local journalism, about
two dozen of the Connecticut-based Thomson newspaper chain's mostly
small-market papers are recruiting and training citizens with no
journalism experience to become reporters. (Thomson senior vice
president for reader and product development Terry Quinn estimates
they'll start at an average salary in the high teens.)
</P>
<P>
   The fond hope is that the grass-roots recruits will already be
engaged in civic life. ``We do not feel the current journalism
school system services the smaller community newspapers,'' says
Quinn, noting that ambitious young reporters rarely make an
``emotional investment'' to smaller papers. ``One of the areas
we're preaching is bringing more passion to our communities.''

IPO IQ: PRIMER ON INITIAL OFFERINGS BREAKS DOWN RISKS,
OPPORTUNITIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA McUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you love roller-coaster investing, consider the IPO.
</P>
<P>
   Buying stock in a company's initial public offering is not for
the weak-hearted, financial writer Tom Taulli says. But the
potential to make money is astronomical.
</P>
<P>
   Consider amazon.com, the online bookstore that is the No. 1
distributor of books in the world. The initial offering price of
its IPO was $18. A few years later, it reached a high of $208 per
share.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the story of Amgen, a drug maker, whose IPO started
out in 1983 at $1.50 per share. The stock now sells for $70.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart, Home Depot and Southwest Bankcorp. of Texas are also
examples of successful IPOs.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a dangerous downside to these little gems. Some
IPOs soar 50 percent on their first day, and then proceed on a wild
death spiral downward, wiping out investors' money. Other IPOs
never seem to get off the ground, and then sizzle and die.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investing in IPOs can be a wild ride,'' admits Taulli, who
writes about such investing for ``Barron's'' and other print media,
appears on CNN and CNBC and writes columns for online investment
publications such as ``Microsoft Investor.''
</P>
<P>
   But Taulli adds that some sense of order can be brought to the
risky investment through patience and research. He shares his
expertise on the subject in ``Investing In IPOs'' (Bloomberg Press,
264 pages, $).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fact that IPOs make one of the best places in the
financial markets to find huge gainers,'' he writes. ``There's
enormous upside if you can manage to pick the winners at the right
time.''
</P>
<P>
   And if you're still nervous about looking into such investments
to diversify your portfolio, consider this: ``Chances are that you
have already participated in the IPO market and don't realize it,''
Taulli writes.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that mutual funds are the biggest purchasers of
IPOs. Fidelity's mutual funds, for example, make up 10 percent of
the IPO market share in the United States, Taulli explains.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you own mutual funds, you likely own IPOs,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   So how do you go about picking the golden winners from the
dismal losers? One key is to stay informed.
</P>
<P>
   Taulli recommends print publications such as The Wall Street
Journal and Barron's to get you familiar with what IPOs are coming
up. Online services such as The Internet Stock Report and
Thestreet.com and databases such as Bloomberg Financial Markets and
IPO Central will provide you with the latest filings,
registrations, pricing and aftermarket performance.
</P>
<P>
   The first place Taulli says he goes to investigate an IPO is the
Electronic Data Gathering Analysis and Retrieval online database of
financial filings developed by the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, EDGAR has every company's prospectus, which
holds ``most of the specifics you need to evaluate an IPO,'' Taulli
writes. The documents have become more reader-friendly recently
with new SEC rules calling for ``plain English'' in drafting a
prospectus.
</P>
<P>
   Taulli provides an analysis of all the information sources, and
then breaks down the major industries with the hottest IPOs, namely
technology, biotech, finance and retail. He also devotes a chapter
to foreign IPOs, IPO mutual funds and online or virtual IPOs.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the basic primer descriptions for a novice investor,
Taulli provides insight for those with more financial savvy.
</P>
<P>
   For example, while discussing risk factors of IPOs, he notes
that if more than 50 percent of the proceeds for an IPO are
earmarked for outstanding debts, which would be noted in the
prospectus, ``chances are that the company has dismal growth
prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Taulli writes that an IPO stock offering below $5 per
share is considered a ``penny stock'' and labeled ``extremely
risky.''

   ``The Single Best Investment: Achieve Lasting Wealth with Low
Risk, Steady Growth Stocks''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Adams Media Corp., $21.95
</P>
<P>
   Consider this: There are 8,000 mutual funds today, compared with
less than 1,000 in 1975, and there are more than 20,000 domestic
stocks, compared with 6,000 just 20 years ago. That alone can make
individual investors pull out their hair. Lowell Miller says he has
evaluated it all in the 25 years he has been an investment adviser,
and his best advice is this: Find a select group of stocks in
steady, moderate growth companies with consistent returns, minimal
risk and little price fluctuation _ and you'll make the best return
possible.

   CASSETT-EXHIBIT (Washington) _ ``Women should be someone and not
something,'' the American artist Mary Cassatt (1844-1926) once
wrote, emphatically underlining her words. And she dedicated a long
career to fleshing out this conviction through art. Her efforts
come across with a quiet, though sometimes surprisingly passionate
force in ``Mary Cassatt: Modern Woman,'' a succinct survey of her
paintings and prints at the National Gallery of Art in Washington.
The show, which has appeared in Chicago and Boston, is the first
comprehensive look at Cassatt's work in nearly 30 years. And it
marks yet another step in evaluating an artist who was herself a
someone _ indeed, several someones _ to be reckoned with. By
Holland Cotter.

   PLANET-EARTH (New York) _ Over more than a century, scientists
and explorers from the American Museum of Natural History have
searched the world and returned with arresting examples of life in
all its diversity: dinosaurs from Montana to Mongolia, birds and
butterflies, artifacts of exotic cultures from here to the South
Sea. For the last four years, their quest has been to collect the
stuff of Earth itself and bring it back for a new exhibition
illustrating the planet's 4.5 billion-year history. Now the
collections have been studied, winnowed and arranged for display in
the museum's newest permanent exhibit, the Gottesman Hall of Planet
Earth, which opens Saturday. By John Noble Wilford.

   TANGO-MANIA (New York) _ The Argentine tango is not unlike
chess. It is serious; it takes discipline; it must be studied hard
to be done well. It is elegant and formal, passionate and intimate.
It is about power and vulnerability. It is both a dance and a
metaphor. And to its captives, it can become a magnificent
obsession. By Janny Scott.

REMEMBRANCE OF THONGS PAST? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So many people have experienced deja vu, being certain that
something is unknown and yet perceiving it as familiar. Is there an
opposite of deja vu? When you know for sure you've been there, done
that, seen something, met somebody before but you can't remember
anything about it?
</P>
<P>
   Cleaning the bookshelves I found dozens of books I'm positive
I've read but can't remember reading. I just re-read Muriel Spark's
``The Ballad of Peckham Rye.'' How could I forget such a wonderful
novel?
</P>
<P>
   When reverse deja vu happens with people the results are not as
happy. You run into someone you're sure you know and she yammers on
about the most intimate details of your life while you stand there
thinking: Who is this person? And how does she know I no longer
have a gallbladder? This sort of thing isn't strictly a function of
aging. Something similar used to happen in school. I'd study like
mad, then sit down for the exam and find I'd forgotten everything.
Maybe it's nothing mysterious, just simple stupidity.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it may be, it's too bad it can't be utilized
selectively because I'd like to forget some of the hideous things
I've eaten lately. You never know when you'll find yourself trapped
in a desperate eating situation. In an airport. In a hospital
cafeteria. At the FleetCenter. Held captive on a highway most
people will eat anything, which is how I found myself at Hot Dog
City on the Mass. Pike, ordering a dog with the works. Talk about
desperate eating. I'd like to forget the taste, the texture, the
aftermath. But I can't.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many people, I worry too much about what I eat. We've
all been conditioned. Just about every food comes with nutritional
particulars, even if the food in question isn't remotely
nutritious. What sort of nutritional information could possibly
pertain to a bag of taco chips? Except maybe a warning: ``Eating
these may be hazardous to your hips.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday's newspaper arrived with a free sample of Wow!
potato chips, a new product made with the miracle fatless fat
substitute Olestra. The only miraculous thing about Olestra is that
anybody is willing to eat it. Small print on the bag warned that
Olestra ``may cause abdominal cramping and loose stools.'' Maybe
that's why they named it Wow! But please, spare us the details.
Couldn't they just put a line on the bag that reads, ``Eating these
may make you sick,'' and leave it at that?
</P>
<P>
   Men's Fitness appears in my mailbox every month, for reasons
that are not entirely clear. Not that I'm complaining, because it's
a big, lovable hunk of a magazine, and I read it avidly for the
insights it provides into the male psyche. Many of the stories are
all but identical to the stories you'll find in women's magazines,
but couched in different terms, to wit: ``Before you start cutting
calories, cut the crap out of your diet.''
</P>
<P>
   You'd never see that sort of language in a woman's magazine,
which is too bad. That no-nonsense advice might come in handy next
time I'm tempted by Hot Dog City.
</P>
<P>
   Bulletin: This is Ergonomics For Everyday Living Week,
proclaimed by Cynthia Dunning Michels of Longwood, Fla., creator of
the first ergonomically engineered underwear for men, ETU Original
Briefs. Ergonomics, in case you're wondering, are design factors
intended to maximize comfort, function, and safety. Maybe Michels
will give some thought to ergonomically engineered underwear for
women. Tuesday's Wall Street Journal had a lengthy report on the
growing popularity of thong underwear in post-Monica America. (I
guess that's why they call the Journal ``The Daily Diary of the
American Dream.'') The thong may be sexy, but it's definitely not
ergonomically sound.

A GREAT ADVENTURE: 40 YEARS TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was 11 at night.
</P>
<P>
   I was standing in the bedroom, stripping off my clothes as fast
as I could. In my rush, I kicked off my shoes, pulled off my shirt,
and dropped my slacks on the floor. Behind me, my husband was
unbuckling his belt. He tore off his watch, stepped out of his
pants, and soon was as naked as I was. I'd already turned on the
shower, and as I stepped into the warm water, Jack was right behind
me, holding a bottle of Bloody Mary mix.
</P>
<P>
   Is this any way for a couple who's just celebrated their 40th
anniversary to behave? Can passion, with all its youthful urgency,
survive so many years of child-raising, house maintenance, and
bodily wear and tear? Are Jack and I an exception to the rule that
the original blazing fires of love eventually settle into a quiet
congenial glow?
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely not.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that our dog, instead of doing what she'd been put
outside to do, had decided to pursue a passing skunk, with
predictable results. Pandora was drooling skunk spray from her
mouth, emitting an odor that was permeating every inch of our
house. With each jerk of misery, she wiped a thin film of spray on
our walls, a door jamb, a chair. With every moment wasted, drops of
spray fell on our floors, seeping into the rugs. For two people
prepared to go to bed after a long day, it was so awful that we
found ourselves laughing as we slathered the chastened dog with Dr.
Bronner's pure Castile soap and spicy tomato juice.
</P>
<P>
   With 30 people arriving the next day for what would be a
skunk-scented celebration in honor of my son-in-law's having
completed his PhD, we had a choice.
</P>
<P>
   It was either laugh or shoot ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Then, while most of us were outside during the party, the dog
got up on our dining room table for the first time in her life and
ate a cake designed to feed 30, then topped it off with three dozen
cookies. The vet had no suggestions other than to keep a close eye
on her and see what happened. Because our house has an open floor
plan, and because the dog barked incessantly when we tied her
outside on her run, see it we did. For three days, the dog ejected
various disgusting substances out of both orifices at all hours of
the day and night in every conceivable undesirable location in our
house.
</P>
<P>
   I never thought about coping with daily disasters when I married
Jack. You know how it is: a head full of daydreams. I anticipated
romance, admiration, and fun. I looked forward to conversations,
shared interests, and exciting adventures. And there has been some
element of each of those in our 40 years together.
</P>
<P>
   But when you hear the dog retching at the foot of your bed as
you lie warm and relaxed under the covers at 4 a.m., there is
nothing more conducive to loving feelings than hearing your husband
say in a voice that is wonderfully calm and unperturbed, ``I'll get
it this time, hon.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first 24 hours, we went through every towel in the house.
Jack took charge of washing them. The dog messed on a small
Oriental carpet in the wee hours of the morning. Jack cleaned it
and hung it outside to air. I felt not only gratitude but a melting
of all resentments and an upwelling of overwhelming affection.
</P>
<P>
   I probably wouldn't have said this 20 years ago, but if Prince
Charming himself had ridden up on his horse to rescue me, I would
have sent him away. What fantasy can compare to having a person by
your side who assumes an equal share of the unpleasant realities of
daily life?
</P>
<P>
   After 40 years, let me offer a definition of romance, apart from
the usual flowers and candy. Let a man cheerfully clear the table
and smile when helping make the bed. Have him get a kick out of
coaching his son's T-ball team or look forward to reading a story
to his daughter at bedtime. A woman's heart begins to flutter when
the man beside her is also unpacking the groceries.
</P>
<P>
   A woman's soul embraces the man who has taken the day off from
work to accompany her to a routine but distressing medical
procedure. There is nothing more soul-stirring than turning to
another who is also reaching out to you.
</P>
<P>
   After 40 years, love may no longer rage like a bonfire, but the
heat generated by glances of understanding and frequent gestures of
support can keep one warm for a lifetime.

</P>
<P>
   It has become a rite of spring.
</P>
<P>
   Every graduation season, some community tests the limits of
church-state relations by sponsoring school prayer or allowing a
sectarian graduation sermon to be preached.
</P>
<P>
   Despite repeated court rulings that the state cannot promote
religion in public education, school-prayer advocates continue to
argue their case.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect many Americans find this tiresome -- either because
they agree with the Supreme Court or recognize that the
school-prayer rulings will not be reversed.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the argument misses the point. Throughout American
history, there exists a more subtle -- and often more powerful --
relationship between education and religion.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with European settlement, Americans have prized
literacy. The earliest cultural impulses for education were
religious ones. The Puritans, who envisioned Massachusetts as a
``Bible Commonwealth,'' believed that God's people had to be able
to read God's book. To that end, they brought books across the
ocean, started printing houses, established libraries, and founded
Harvard College.
</P>
<P>
   In 1647, they passed the ``old deluder Satan'' law that
established universal education to teach children to read the
Scriptures lest they fall prey to the wiles of the Devil.
</P>
<P>
   By 1700, 95 percent of the men (and 60 percent of the women) in
New England could read. Although literacy rates were lower in other
regions, evidence exists that a majority of American colonists
could read the King James Bible and other simple texts.
</P>
<P>
   Reading was considered a spiritual exercise. If individuals
could read the Bible for themselves, they could interpret scripture
and make common-sense choices regarding truth.
</P>
<P>
   As the colonies formed a new nation, denominations heeded the
call to create an educated citizenry. Before the Civil War,
Protestants alone founded 130 colleges. At these institutions, as
with schools of every level, the Bible formed the core of the
curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   Although some schools, such as the University of Virginia, were
established on secular principles, most early American education
was a religious enterprise. Perhaps because of the close link
between literacy and faith, American religious beliefs have been
substantially shaped by scriptures.
</P>
<P>
   Not every culture sees reading this way. Some depend on oral
tradition or ritual to teach religious values. Although Americans
can be oddly anti-intellectual, we remain a bookish lot when it
comes to faith.
</P>
<P>
   However, the relationship between religion and reading has
changed over time. Literacy no longer focuses solely on the Bible.
That does not mean, however, that education is a strictly secular
enterprise. If one employs a broader definition of ``scripture,''
teaching can be seen as still fundamentally a spiritual vocation.
</P>
<P>
   Even early in American history, not every colonist was a
literate Christian. Before the Europeans, native religions
understood myth and nature as sacred texts.
</P>
<P>
   And the Europeans themselves did not prove uniformly orthodox in
their interpretation of the Bible. Although some hewed closely to
traditional Christianity, others departed so radically that they
wrote their own scriptures. Some adopted other religion's sacred
texts.
</P>
<P>
   Still others were never Christian at all. Jews, Buddhists and
Hindus bought their own holy books to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Despite claims to the contrary, the United States was never a
purely biblical culture. Many sacred texts shaped American
religious experience. The Bible often stood predominate but never
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the link between reading and faith, most successful
American religions have emphasized holy books. Traditional world
religions teach their books such as the Koran or Bhagavad Gita.
Home-grown faiths wrote their own sacred texts. Where would
Mormonism be without the Book of Mormon? Or Christian Science
without ``Science and Health''? Newer religions often base their
claims on divinely inspired texts.
</P>
<P>
   Even political documents, such as the Declaration of
Independence, take on quasi-scriptural status. American religion --
traditional, new, or civil -- is book religion.
</P>
<P>
   To recognize that religion birthed much of American education,
and that education itself is broadly religious, does not violate
the separation of church and state. Although Protestants
established this relationship in America, nearly every religion
here now depends on sacred scripture to form faith. Education
reflects the pluralism -- rather than the particularity -- of
American religion.
</P>
<P>
   Educators, by teaching reading, interpretation and critical
theory, enable people to evaluate competing religious claims.
Teachers are doorkeepers to a wide variety of faiths, ethical
systems, and moral claims.
</P>
<P>
   The state need not ``permit'' religion in the public schools. It
is already there -- in all its confusing and glorious American
diversity.
</P>
<P>
   And schools, as has always been the case, have a profoundly
religious vocation: To teach, as in the words of the ``old deluder
Satan'' law, ``That Learning may not be buried in the graves of our
fore-fathers in Church and Commonwealth.''

Hindus bought their own holy books to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Despite claims to the contrary, the United States was never a
purely biblical culture. Many sacred texts shaped American
religious experience. The Bible often stood predominate but never
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the link between reading and faith, most successful
American religions have emphasized holy books. Traditional world
religions teach their books such as the Koran or Bhagavad Gita.
Home-grown faiths wrote their own sacred texts. Where would
Mormonism be without the Book of Mormon? Or Christian Science
without ``Science and Health''? Newer religions often base their
claims on divinely inspired texts.
</P>
<P>
   Even political documents, such as the Declaration of
Independence, take on quasi-scriptural status. American religion --
traditional, new, or civil -- is book religion.
</P>
<P>
   To recognize that religion birthed much of American education,
and that education itself is broadly religious, does not violate
the separation of church and state. Although Protestants
established this relationship in America, nearly every religion
here now depends on sacred scripture to form faith. Education
reflects the pluralism -- rather than the particularity -- of
American religion.
</P>
<P>
   Educators, by teaching reading, interpretation and critical
theory, enable people to evaluate competing religious claims.
Teachers are doorkeepers to a wide variety of faiths, ethical
systems, and moral claims.
</P>
<P>
   The state need not ``permit'' religion in the public schools. It
is already there -- in all its confusing and glorious American
diversity.
</P>
<P>
   And schools, as has always been the case, have a profoundly
religious vocation: To teach, as in the words of the ``old deluder
Satan'' law, ``That Learning may not be buried in the graves of our
fore-fathers in Church and Commonwealth.''

</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BELLA ENGLISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Germaine Greer is sprawled out on the king-size bed
at the Pierre Hotel, all 6 feet of her. She has good legs and she
knows it, showing them off to maximum advantage in a short black
dress, black tights, and black pumps. The photographer has asked
her to do this and that, and she obliges him quite politely. Here
she is, leaning back and laughing uproariously, legs up
revealingly. There she is, lying down in beach-blanket pose.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise there, since she once sat for a close-up shot of her
privates for a porn rag she helped found in the 1960s. (``That
issue is unobtainable anywhere in the world,'' she sniffs. ``The
idea was that all the editors would expose themselves as ruthlessly
as we exposed others. But the men didn't do it.'')
</P>
<P>
   But back to June of 1999. Would she consider going next door to
Barney's and posing at the cosmetics counter, where all those
trendy young men make up all those gorgeous young women in the
latest colors?
</P>
<P>
   Not bloody likely. ``Do you know the thing about being 60?'' she
asks, sitting straight up on the bed, eyes flashing. ``They don't
even want to put makeup on you.'' She launches into a story about
going to Bloomingdale's the day before. ``This woman was squirting
perfume all over people. I was all ready to say no thank you when
she turns away from me and goes toward a young woman. I'm
invisible. I could come in glittering with diamonds from head to
foot and they would go over to the younger girls who don't know if
they have $12 to put together. I'm invisible,'' she repeats.
</P>
<P>
   Germaine Greer is anything but. Thirty years after ``The Female
Eunuch'' created an international sensation with its frank analysis
of the bleak condition of women, she has written its sequel, a book
she vowed she would never write. In ``The Whole Woman,'' Greer
maintains that things are bleaker than ever for women. The book has
stirred controversy on both sides of the Atlantic: in England,
where Greer lives, and in America, where she is now on book tour.
</P>
<P>
   British reviewers have wondered, to quote one headline, whether
``Germaine is germane.'' American feminists have berated her for
being sloppy, anti-male, and contradictory. Camille Paglia called
the book ``exasperatingly disjointed and scattershot.'' The New
York Times ended its review with: `` `The Whole Woman' is a
castrated book.''
</P>
<P>
   A major complaint about Greer is that she is inconsistent, a
trait she displays consistently during a recent interview in her
hotel room. One minute she is saying she doesn't read her reviews:
``I can't. They'd do me in.'' The next minute, she's dismissing
Camille Paglia as ``an odd girl'' because of Paglia's negative
review of her book. ``She used to be on my side. I've defended her
on untenable grounds because I thought she was an original
feminist. She liked me,'' she adds acidly, ``when she thought no
one else liked me.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's her current love interest. This is a man for whom
she made a compilation tape before she flew to the States, so that
he would have something to remember her by. This is the woman who
declared that she gave up sex a long time ago, who proclaimed
publicly that ``no sex is better than bad sex.'' (Penises, she
claims, are overrated.) And this is the very same woman who was
married for three weeks in 1968, during which time she says she
cheated on her husband seven times.
</P>
<P>
   Of love, she says, ``I gave it my best shot. I spent the best
years of my life waiting for the phone to ring.''
</P>
<P>
   This country-Western lament, from one of the world's leading
feminists?
</P>
<P>
   She continues: ``I gave up on the whole business of sex 10 or 12
years ago. The first year was very hard. I got used to a life
without love. I found all the people I had neglected and all the
causes I'd neglected and I felt really happy and centered in my
life. I knew the one thing I had to worry about was falling in
love. I also knew that some day, I would turn a corner and there he
would be.''
</P>
<P>
   He _ whoever he is _ was indeed around the corner. ``Was he
worth it?'' she asks. ``Yes. Was he an embarrassment? Yes. Was he
someone else's? Yes. Was he manipulative? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, what happened to him? ``He's still out of jail,'' she says
impishly. ``I've ended it.'' A minute later, she adds: ``No, I'm
not sure it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   In her introduction to ``The Whole Woman,'' Greer asserts that
she wrote the book because in the 30 years since ``The Female
Eunuch,'' women's lives have become fuller but tougher. ``When `The
Female Eunuch' was written our daughters were not cutting or
starving themselves. . . . It's time to get angry again.''
</P>
<P>
   There are people who would probably swear in a court of law that
Greer has never stopped being angry. Still, she's hardly a
humorless feminist. She can be downright hilarious, but God forbid
she aim her mordant humor at you. After one writer annoyed her,
Greer, referring to the columnist's lip-stained logo, stated that
``lipstick must rot the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the secretary of state is not spared: Madeleine Albright,
she opines, should stay away from short skirts, especially when
seated on couches next to heads of state. ``There are certain
things I cannot take,'' she says. ``She's always wearing these
short skirts and she's so grossly fat. She must spend more time
eating than thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask her what she'd do differently in her life and she pauses
before stating, seriously: ``I wouldn't have bunions.''
</P>
<P>
   In person and in her book, she shows little patience with
feminists of both her generation and the next. It was bad enough
that her colleagues started asserting that feminism had gone too
far. Then the young ones got uppity. ``When the lifestyle feminists
chimed in that feminism had gone just far enough in giving them the
right to `have it all,' i.e., money, sex, and fashion, it would
have been inexcusable to remain silent,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Remaining silent is one thing Greer has never been accused of.
In her new book, she takes on everything from men (``to be male is
to be a kind of idiot savant, full of queer obsessions about
fetishistic activities and fantasy goals . . . '') to high heels
(``the high-heeled shoe itself is a marvelously contradictory item;
it brings a woman to a man's height but makes sure she cannot keep
up with him'').

THE `EVOLUTION' OF MARTINA McBRIDE  
 
By RICK MITCHELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Martina McBride's latest album, ``Evolution,'' opens with a tape
of the singer at age 7 belting out Little Jimmy Dickens' Grand Ole
Opry favorite ``I'm Little But I'm Loud.'' The recording was made
on a cassette recorder at a 4-H Club convention in Manhattan, Kan.,
not far from the farm where McBride grew up in tiny Sharon, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put that on there because it was really representative of
what I did when I was a kid,'' McBride said. ``I'd go around, and
my dad would play guitar and I would sing. It's just this little
piece of history that somehow has survived.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 25 years later, McBride is still little at 5-foot-4 and
barely 100 pounds. She's still loud, too.
</P>
<P>
   As anyone who's heard her hits _ such as ``Independence Day''
and ``A Broken Wing'' _ can attest, McBride can hold her own with
the most powerful female country singers in Nashville, from Patty
Loveless and Wynonna Judd to Trisha Yearwood and Faith Hill.
</P>
<P>
   McBride was calling from the Money Pit studio in Nashville,
Tenn., where she was finishing the follow-up to ``Evolution.'' The
album is due in September, even though ``Evolution'' is still
hovering around the country Top 10 nearly two years after its
release.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really have to give credit to the songs,'' said McBride of
the album's remarkable staying power. ``Every song that we've put
out has been a hit. We've released six singles off the album.
That's pretty unusual, especially for country music. So I'm also
going to have to credit the record company for sticking with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But give the credit to McBride, too, and her co-producer, Paul
Worley, for finding those songs. They listened to more than 1,000
submissions to pick the dozen or so gems on the album.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, we have more artists than we've ever had, so the
demand for great songs has gone up,'' she said. ``But they're out
there. You just have to take the time to really search for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I set my standards pretty high when it comes to recording
material. In the past, I've put out some things that haven't
worked. With this album, I feel like I've finally been accepted at
radio. The good songs have gotten through. That doesn't always
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   McBride's career has been distinguished by her refusal to cut
the dumb little ditties that clutter too many Nashville releases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give the audience credit for their intelligence,'' she said.
``I think an audience wants to be entertained and doesn't want to
always have to think about something heavy. At the same time, I
think they want to hear intelligent lyrics. You need a balance.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the new album won't be a radical departure from
``Evolution,'' but it will represent a slightly more raw sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not quite as layered, not quite as textured, not quite so
produced, which is something I wanted to go for,'' said McBride,
who takes an active role in all aspects of the production of her
albums.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cut with a smaller band. We keep trying to add little
instrumental overdubs and they just don't fit. It is what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   McBride and her husband, sound engineer John McBride, moved to
Nashville in 1990 after working with Top 40 cover bands in Kansas.
John soon landed a job mixing sound for a young up-and-coming
country singer named Garth Brooks, and Martina tagged along on tour
selling T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   With the 1992 release of her debut album, ``The Time Has Come,''
McBride graduated to opening shows for Brooks. But it wasn't until
her 1993 album, ``The Way That I Am,'' that her career really took
off.
</P>
<P>
   The album included the hit ``Independence Day,'' a powerful song
about domestic violence as seen through the eyes of a young girl.
The video for the song was voted video of the year by the Country
Music Association _ the first time a female artist had won that
award.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Way That I Am'' was eventually certified platinum, as was
1995's ``Wild Angels.'' Prior to the release of Evolution, McBride
recorded ``Valentine,'' a duet with pop pianist Jim Brickman that
became a No. 1 adult contemporary hit. She also sang a hit country
duet with RCA label mate Clint Black called ``Still Holding On.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was the single ``Broken Wing'' that really sent folks
into the record stores with money in hand. Like ``Independence
Day,'' the song is about a woman in an abusive relationship. But
this time, the story has a happier ending; rather than burn down
the house, she departs through an open window.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, that song has a lot of symbolism,'' McBride said. ``The
window is symbolic for her flying away to freedom. I think what
it's saying is that even though this man tries to break her spirit,
he can't break her spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   The McBrides have two daughters: Delaney, 4, and Emma, 14
months. Both travel with mom and dad on the tour bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just a little family out there,'' McBride said. ``It's
great.''
</P>
<P>
   But with Delaney about to enter school, McBride has scaled back
her tour schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really easy to tour with a little baby, but 4-year-olds
kind of start missing home. She misses her things, and her bike,
and her yard, and her preschool.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always make your decisions based around the kids. Anyway,
that's how it is for me as a mother. When I was pregnant, I was
like, `I don't know how this is all gonna work.' And then once you
have the baby, you realize that, well, everything else just has to
fit around this.''
</P>
<P>
   McBride is proud to be part of the generation of female artists
that has finally leveled the playing field between men and women in
country music. While she's been outspoken about the shortcomings of
Nashville's factory approach to making country music, she's managed
to carve an independent space within that system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very satisfied with the music that I've made, and I
feel happy that it has been accepted. I've been able to get away
with making music that is original and thoughtful and production
that isn't typical at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest insult to country music is when someone puts a
steel guitar on there because they think they have to make it
`country.' That's kind of token. Put it on because that's what you
feel in your heart, not to try to fit a certain format.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Evolution'' contains a hidden last track. McBride overheard
daughter Delaney, then 2, singing ``Broken Wing'' in the kitchen
and turned on the tape recorder. Like her mom, she's little, but
she's loud.
</P>

   TAKE-BOS  
 NEW YORK: ... keep up with him'').  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The book has been most loudly criticized for its sections on
women's health. Legalized abortion, Greer writes, has enriched male
doctors and lawyers, while Pap smears, mammograms, and fertility
treatments are forms of female torture with few benefits. And then
there's the chapter on mutilation, in which she condemns plastic
surgery and episiotomies as butchery while offering a defense of
the African tradition of female circumcision: ``One man's
beautification is another man's mutilation.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the whole woman _ a creature who does not rely upon a man
for social status, doesn't have to be gorgeous, and can age with
stature _ Greer is still on the lookout. She mostly has found
``fractured lives,'' including, she says, her own. The closest she
came on her quest was the aboriginal women in the Northern
Territories and the Osage Indians in Oklahoma, whom she met while
teaching at the University of Tulsa from 1979 to 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Those women, Greer says, are ``strong and cunning'' because
they've had to be. ``But do women become great when men fail? Is
that the price of them becoming great? If so, it's sort of a
mournful grandeur. We don't really want our men to fail. Men who
fail are dangerous. Our prisons are full of them,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the recent rash of school shootings _ almost all of
them by boys _ Greer notes that ``we have to look after the boys.
Boys are crazy and girls are sane. I think men are weird. The XY
chromosome is damaged. It's a faulty chromosome.'' Men, she adds,
are ``either geniuses or dolts, and we love them either way.''
</P>
<P>
   It is this sort of comment that has led reviewers to label her
anti-male, a label that makes her bristle. ``This is not a
vitriolic attack on men,'' she says. ``The word `weird' is not a
bad word. I just despair of ever understanding them.''
</P>
<P>
   British writers have at times offered up the observation that if
she'd only had children, Greer wouldn't be so angry. ``I'd be
angrier,'' she snaps. ``I teach other people's children. I'm with
them all the time. They are my life.'' Her highest-achieving
students at Warwick University, in England, she says, all have
eating disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also know how they are being done over by guys,'' she says.
``I know how little they settle for in a relationship. If one of
these children were mine, I'd be murderous.''
</P>
<P>
   As for herself, Greer observes, ``I've been ripped off by men
all my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The next moment, contradiction strikes: ``I think I've been
really well-treated by men.''
</P>
<P>
   Greer, who underwent surgery in a futile attempt to conceive,
says that if she were a mother, she would ``eat my child alive,''
she would love it so much.
</P>
<P>
   Did she ever consider adoption? No way, not since she read a
book about a woman who had lost her child to adoption. ``You don't
adopt the child,'' she lectures, ``you adopt the mother and
child.''
</P>
<P>
   When people have asked what she wants for Christmas, she has
been known to respond: ``a mother and child.'' This search for
surrogate motherhood led her to yet another one of her periodic
public imbroglios. A few years ago, she wrote a column that ran in
a newspaper for the homeless in which she offered to shelter a
down-and-outer, preferably a pregnant woman or a mother and child.
Tabloid journalists disguised as homeless people turned up at her
door looking for the inside story on life with Britain's most
famous feminist.
</P>
<P>
   One fellow showed up and stayed for three days, then left
without so much as a goodbye, later writing an expose on her home,
with details on how he'd burrowed through her dresser drawers.
</P>
<P>
   Did Greer feel foolish? ``Well, it was rainy and he was on
crutches,'' she explains, then adds wryly: ``I did notice that his
boots were new.''
</P>
<P>
   Might her obsession with motherhood have anything to do with her
own mother, with whom she has a rocky relationship? Peggy Greer
lives in Australia, where she raised two daughters and a son. ``I
had a mad, daft mother,'' says Greer. ``Her family lived in a crack
in the Alps for 1,000 years and they all intermarried. These people
all got sent to Australia, and that's who I'm descended from.''
</P>
<P>
   When she last made the 12,000-mile trip to Australia, her mother
refused to see her. It is rumored that she has never read any of
her daughter's books. Greer once said that her mother had spent 70
years ``lying on the beach.''
</P>
<P>
   So Greer concludes that it may be a good thing she hasn't had
children, given her family tree. (Her deceased father was no
better, she says.) But she remains close to her sister and brother,
who live in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Greer lives in an old stone house on 3 acres in the
English countryside with eight geese, two goslings, two dogs, and
``one cat who is my husband.'' She is quite fond of her 13
godchildren and loves to cook for guests who drop in. At this point
in the interview, she shoos away the photographer, telling him not
to shoot her ``double chin.''
</P>
<P>
   She then grabs the slack skin and bunches it to the back of her
neck, giving herself an instant face lift. Is she ever tempted?
Hardly. Cosmetic surgery is one of her pet peeves. ``I just saw a
woman in Barney's whose implants were too big. They looked as
though they would leap off her chest and fly across the room,'' she
guffaws.
</P>
<P>
   Back to that food she loves to serve. She grows much of it
herself and is forever devoted to ``anyone who hoovers it up.'' But
she cautions women against getting into a habit of cooking for men.
``You realize you've just started digging a long ditch,'' she says.
``You're poaching asparagus and all he wants is a Big Mac. Let the
bugger have a Big Mac.''
</P>
<P>
   Which leads her _ heaven knows exactly how _ into a discourse on
men and their ``postorgasmic chill.'' Just when a woman is feeling
cuddly and emotional, she says, a man wants to get up for a smoke
or a shower.
</P>
<P>
   ``The finest time in your life was when you went to sleep in
someone's arms and woke up in the same position eight hours
later.'' She sighs wistfully. ``Sleeping in someone's arms is the
prize.''
</P>
<P>
   These days Greer is not enamored of American feminists. She
believes they stood by Bill Clinton above and beyond the call of
duty during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. ``English feminists were
not minded to give Clinton an easy ride,'' she says. ``They saw an
emotionally abused young woman. He should not have allowed himself
to be drawn into her fantasies.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does she fancy Hillary. ``I don't know why American
feminists let her appear as an icon. The only thing she's ever done
was marry this man.'' But, Greer is reminded, she is _ or was _ a
prominent attorney. ``She's a crook,'' Greer states flatly.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, Greer was giving a lecture at Oxford in which
she stated that white-collar women should consider having
blue-collar partners so that they wouldn't be in competition with
each other.
</P>
<P>
   A young man in the audience raised his hand. ``You said,''
mimics Greer, attempting a Southern drawl, ``that white-collar
women should have relationships with blue-collar guys. But would a
white-collar boy from Arkansas stand a chance with a lady like
you?''
</P>
<P>
   The man asking the question was a young Rhodes scholar named
Bill Clinton. ``I think I said to him, `Are you coming on to me?' I
was amazed,'' Greer says.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to discern the real Germaine Greer. Is she the
feminist warning of male oppression in the new millennium, or is
she the woman sitting around waiting for the phone to ring?

<TEXT>
<P>
   Have you talked to your computer lately?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not, if you're an average computer user. Although
there's plenty of software that lets computers understand the human
voice, most people stick to their old-fashioned keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   But if you don't talk to your own computer, you may talk to
somebody else's. Many businesses have phone systems that'll connect
you to the right person if you just say his name. Some retail
businesses, such as brokerage houses, will let you buy and sell
stocks with your lips instead of your fingers.
</P>
<P>
   While the average person may not use speech-enabled computers
today, busy professionals such as doctors, attorneys, and even
police officers are embracing them as a fast, reliable way to stay
on top of their paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   And as computers become ever smaller and more powerful, speech
control will be included in even the most ordinary devices. Already
there is a car radio that can be controlled by a driver's voice.
Someday home TV sets may work the same way _ along with every other
appliance in the house.
</P>
<P>
   As experts in computer speech recognition gathered in Boston
earlier this week for an industry conference, it's clear that
speech recognition is catching on in a big way _ just not the way
many people expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any new technology that you look at actually takes a while to
take off,'' says Roger Matus, vice president of Dragon Systems
Inc., one of several Boston-area firms at the forefront of speech
technology.
</P>
<P>
   That's been the pattern so far with speech-recognition software.
In recent years, companies including Dragon, IBM Corp., and
Burlington's Lernout &AMP; Hauspie have sold speech-recognition
software at retail. With computers in half the homes in America and
nearly every office, there would seem to be a vast market for such
software among users who've never learned to type.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, a mass market for these products has yet to appear.
According to market research firm PC Data Inc., speech-recognition
software makers sold just 775,000 units at retail last year, worth
$59.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, companies are rushing to deploy
speech-recognition systems that work in conjunction with telephone
systems. Industry-watcher William Meisel of TMA Associates in
Tarzana, Calif., estimates that more than $2 billion worth of such
software will be sold this year, and more than $36 billion by the
year 2003.
</P>
<P>
   William ``Ozzie'' Osbourne, manager of IBM's speech systems
group, says his company is investing heavily in speech-controlled
telephone products. Osbourne uses one every day _ an internal phone
directory. He can dial IBMNAME and say the name of any other IBM
employee, anywhere in the company. The computer recognizes the
name, looks up the number, and completes the call.
</P>
<P>
   Parlance Corp. of Medford has sold similar systems to about 100
companies, including The Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who are traveling love it,'' said sales executive Susan
Richards, ``because they can reach any colleague in the company by
dialing a single number.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston-based SpeechWorks Inc. produces more advanced speech
systems used by companies that sell by phone. For instance, the
Internet brokerage firm ETrade uses a SpeechWorks system to let
customers make stock trades from any phone, without ever speaking
to a human being.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Lightfoot, president of New York-based Foodline.com, is
using a SpeechWorks system to offer a telephone guide to New York
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the service isn't fast and easy to use,'' says Lightfoot,
``it's not going to be used.''
</P>
<P>
   So he rejected a system that might require a user to press 1 for
Italian food and 2 for French. Instead, the user just says ``I want
Italian food,'' and the software responds with a list of choices.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone-based speech software has to be able to recognize many
different voices and accents. On the other hand, most of these
systems are designed for a specific purpose, so they need to know
only a few hundred words.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, this same limitation applies to some very highly
technical activities, including medicine. The leading
speech-software firms have done quite well with customized software
for use by doctors.
</P>
<P>
   At Quincy Hospital, chief of emergency services Octavio Diaz and
a staff of nine doctors write up about 90 percent of patient
reports using medical transcription software sold by Lernout &AMP;
Hauspie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very user-friendly system once you get up and running
on it,'' said Diaz, who has been using speech-recognition software
for about 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   At Massachusetts General Hospital, clinical cardiologist John Le
vinson swears by his Dragon software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Filling out a visit form is like filling out a 1040 long form
for each patient,'' says Levinson. So he dictates patient
information instead of typing. ``Most doctors who have come through
my office and seen me use my system immediately want it.''
</P>
<P>
   Having found a stable market among doctors, firms such as
Lernout &AMP; Hauspie and Dragon are also tailoring custom
speech-recognition products for attorneys and even police officers
who hate filling out paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the makers of speech-recognition software are looking for
ways to make their technology indispensable to corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   Lernout &AMP; Hauspie's parent firm is based in Belgium, and many of
its engineers speak several languages. No surprise then that chief
executive Gaston Bastiaens is placing a big bet on a difficult
problem _ computers that not only recognize spoken words, but
instantly translate them from one language to another.
</P>
<P>
   Lernout &AMP; Hauspie says it's well on the way to solving this
problem. The company recently showed off a product called Global
Chat that instantly translated the words of a speaker from English
to German or another language. Not only does Global Chat display
the translation on a computer screen, but the computer actually
pronounces the words, in a surprisingly lifelike voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something no one else in the world can do except us,''
Bastiaens boasts. Global Chat, which requires corporate-grade
computing power, is set to go on sale this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Dragon is hard at work on an impressive new
trick of its own called ``audio mining.'' This software analyzes
recordings of human speech, identifies each word, and creates an
index. Thousands of firms record customer service calls to check up
on workers.
</P>
<P>
   But with audio mining, there'll be no need to actually listen to
the calls. Instead, the computer can detect when Operator 25 calls
a customer ``stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, when powerful computers become cheap enough, the
goal is to enable practically any electronic device to recognize
spoken words: a cell phone, for instance, or personal digital
assistants _ PDAs _ such as the 3Com Palm Pilot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to work extremely well in PDAs,'' says IBM's
Osbourne, ``because a keyboard is not practical.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some larger devices will eventually be well suited to
speech control. Osboure imagines a time when you'll never again
have to wrestle with setting your VCR. You'll just tell it to
record ``ER,'' and it will.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not there yet,'' says Osbourne. ``But this is the
future.''

STROKE TREATMENT BENEFITS ASSESSED;  
 DRUG HALTS CAUSE OF BLINDNESS IN MICE;  
 GENETIC LINK FOUND TO CORONARY SPASMS;  
 CANCER MAY INITIATE DISORDERS OF BRAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The benefits for stroke patients of quick treatment with
clot-busting drugs _ a greater chance of avoiding disability _ last
for at least a year afterward, according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
   The report in the New England Journal of Medicine is a followup
to a study published in 1995 showing that stroke patients who
received the drug, tissue plasminogen activator, or t-PA, were at
least 30 percent more likely than patients given a placebo to have
minimal or no disability three months after the stroke.
</P>
<P>
   T-PA and similar drugs dissolve clots that obstruct blood
vessels to the brain. Treatment has to be quick: The benefits were
limited to people who got the drug within three hours.
</P>
<P>
   The question was whether the good results would hold up over a
longer period. The report, from a number of collaborating medical
centers, said that the improved outcomes were sustained at six
months and 12 months after the stroke.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Drug halts cause of blindness in mice &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions are expressing
enthusiasm about a new drug that, in mice, completely halts the
abnormal growth of blood vessels in the eye that causes diabetic
retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration, two common
blinding diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have been searching for a way of stopping the growth
of blood vessels in or beneath the retina, the light-sensitive
layer at the back of the eye. The abnormal vessels often leak fluid
or blood and progressively destroy vision.
</P>
<P>
   The new drug, made by Novartis Ltd. Pharmaceuticals and labeled
PKC 412, blocks chemicals that foster angiogenesis, or the growth
of new blood vessels, said the scientists, headed by Dr. Peter A.
Campochiaro, a professor of ophthalmology and neuroscience at Johns
Hopkins. The results are published in the June issue of the
American Journal of Pathology.
</P>
<P>
   While results in mice do not necessarily predict the
effectiveness of a treatment in humans, Campochiaro said in a
statement, ``This is the first drug I've seen that has a
knock-your-socks-off kind of effect,'' adding that previously
studied drugs were only about 50 percent effective.
</P>
<P>
   Human trials of the drug could begin next year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Genetic link found to coronary spasms &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Coronary spasms _ contractions in blood vessels that can cause
chest pain or heart attacks _ are more likely to occur in some
people than others: for example, they're more common in Japanese
people.
</P>
<P>
   Until now there had been no explanation for this imbalance. This
week, Japanese researchers said they have found three gene
mutations that seem to predispose individuals to coronary spasms.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting in the journal Circulation, the scientists from
Kumamoto and Kyoto universities said that they found the mutations
in 30 percent of patients who had coronary spasms, but only in 7
percent of 161 people without them.
</P>
<P>
   The mutations affect a gene that helps regulate the production
of nitric oxide in the blood vessels of the heart, the coronary
arteries. Nitric oxide is an important chemical messenger that
signals blood vessels to relax and allow blood to flow more freely.
The finding could lead to new drug treatments for people who are
genetically predisposed to the spasms, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Cancer may initiate disorders of brain &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People with cancer sometimes suffer from brain and nerve
disorders caused when their immune system erroneously attacks the
brain while attempting to combat the cancer. The cancer may go
unnoticed for a long time as the cause of the brain problem.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are reporting in the New England Journal of Medicine
that testicular tumors are particularly prone to causing a brain
disorder that can manifest itself as depression, seizures, and
dementia.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists, from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center,
said they identified antibodies in the blood of 12 patients showing
that the immune system was attacking both the tumor and the brain,
and they say these antibodies could be used to diagnose suspected
cases of the disorder, called paraneoplastic limbic encephalitis.

RUMOR REFLECTS FEARS AND OPPORTUNITIES

<P>
   If I had to pay a nickel for every e-mail message I send, I'd
have to hock my computer and yours too. Yet just such a fate awaits
us all, if bill 602P is enacted into law.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to slap a nickel tax on each of the roughly 2
billion e-mail messages sent daily in the US. The money would go to
the Postal Service to make up for falling postage stamp revenue.
</P>
<P>
   I've gotten about 25 cents worth of e-mails concerning this
dreadful piece of legislation from worried readers who should
replace the batteries in their baloney detectors. For bill 602P is
a hoax. The Postal Service has no plan to tax the Internet. You can
look it up on their Web site--www.usps.gov. So many people have
called to complain that the Post Office has published a denial on
its home page.
</P>
<P>
   I won't mock those who fell for the prank; indeed, I understand
their panic. Never mind the seductive wonders of the Web. Good old
e-mail is still the Internet's most useful feature, especially
because it costs virtually nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the popularity of e-mail poses a challenge for delivery
companies. The Postal Service handled 101 billion pieces of
first-class mail last year, and made a tidy profit. But mail volume
is growing at a snail's pace, largely thanks to competition from
e-mail. It's not just a threat to first-class letters, either.
United Parcel Service ships 1.8 million airmail packages a day,
many of them documents, at rates of $7.50 and up. Much of this
material could be delivered by e-mail instead, draining millions in
UPS revenues.
</P>
<P>
   UPS isn't watching idly as a lucrative piece of their market
disappears. Instead the firm is pioneering a new market, selling
premium-quality e-mail at a premium price.
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't swap Yankee insults on a Boston Red Sox electronic
mailing list at $2.50 a pop. But you might pay that much to send
critical business documents with guaranteed delivery. Thousands of
people are doing it through a UPS service called Document Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   It's a clever concept that targets e-mail's chief flaws. For one
thing, e-mail is wildly insecure. Messages routinely pass through a
dozen or more computer systems, with the possibility of
interception at every point. You can protect yourself by using
encryption software to hide your message from snoops. But for this
to work, the recipient must have the same type of encryption
software. Otherwise, he won't be able to read the message either.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, how do you know if an e-mail arrived? Internet e-mail
won't tell you when your message is received. That's often critical
information in a business transaction or legal proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Document Exchange solves these problems with the help of the
World Wide Web. Documents aren't directly mailed to recipients.
Instead, you get an e-mail with a Web address inside. Go to this
Web page and you find a hyperlink to the document, which is stored
on a UPS computer. Click the link and the document streams onto
your own hard drive. There's no fussing with encryption; UPS takes
care of that automatically. And the UPS computer knows when the
recipient picks up the document, and sends a notice to the sender.
</P>
<P>
   There are other advantages to this method. For example, paper
documents come to your office or home, but the electronic versions
are available through any Internet-connected computer in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But would anybody pay $2.50 for this service, with extra
surcharges for files larger than 1.44 megabytes? UPS marketing
manager Paul Vassallo tells me that since they introduced the
product a year ago, it's gotten thousands of users and is turning a
profit.
</P>
<P>
   Sanjay Gupta, managing director of interactive marketing at
rival FedEx, says there's no future in this business, that some
company will eventually start offering the same service for free.
But the Postal Service doesn't think so. It's testing its own
premium e-mail product called Post Electronic Courier Service.
Which means there's a smidgeon of truth in the bill 602P hoax, and
the Postal Service may soon start charging for e-mail after all.

EBAY, MAKE WAY FOR SOTHEBY'S 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've heard the buzz about eBay and its various cyber clones,
Web sites where folks can bid on anything from Furbies to fishing
lures, from slot machines to synthetic pearls. To the uninitiated,
the idea of watching an on-line auction is about as exciting as
watching paint dry. Nevertheless, such sites have become a kind of
entertainment or sport. You don't buy items on eBay; you win them.
You're not a consumer; you're a collector, even if your object of
desire has the aesthetic value of a used tire (or, in fact, is a
used tire).
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, it seems, has turned into a great global garage
sale _ and the garage is about to go upscale.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few months, both Christie's and Sotheby's, the
prestigious international auction houses that handle million-dollar
works of art, are launching on-line auctions. And two other sites,
www.icollector.com and www.artnet.com, have been auctioning fine
art and antiques on line for about a year. These initiatives could
open up the art market to a broader array of collectors, folks who
have been intimidated by the rarefied atmosphere of conventional
auctions. But can these hidebound art institutions adapt to the
wild frontier of cyberspace?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our business began in 1744, and it hasn't changed much in 255
years,'' admits David Redden, executive vice president of Sotheby's
and the head of its Internet efforts. ``There are people who are
intimidated just crossing the threshold of Sotheby's, and they're
shy about walking into rather grand art dealers or antique stores,
too. The Internet allows people to break bread with the auction
house and the dealer while they're in their bedroom slippers.''
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's and Christie's, which command 39 percent of the $2
billion art market, bring their respected imprimatur to the on-line
auction world, plagued by tales of broken deals and rip-offs. The
auction chat rooms are full of sagas of disappearing bidders and
``priceless'' items that turn out to be worthless.
</P>
<P>
   Both top auction houses, along with icollector and artnet, offer
guarantees of authenticity on items sold on their sites. ``We've
heard the stories and the anecdotes, and we aim to offer a high
level of service and credibility,'' says Andrew Schoelkopf,
president of Christie's Internet Auctions. ``The on-line auction
business is going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to buy Elvis memorabilia on line; it's another
thing entirely to bid on a prized painting. ``I'm not suggesting a
$60 million Cezanne will be sold on the site, but there is no
question that good paintings are appropriate,'' says Redden.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's has already signed up almost 3,000 art dealers to
display and auction their collections on its site. The Barbara
Krakow Gallery on Newbury Street is one of them. ``This entire new
revolution is occurring, and I kind of want to be part of it,''
says Krakow. ``I remember a card I saw once that said, `Someday
your train will come in, and you'll be at the bus station.' That
freaked me out when I thought about auctions on line. I don't want
to miss the train.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, are happy enough to take the bus, thank you
very much. Bill Vose of the Vose Galleries is one dealer who opts
not to go on line. ``More people can see more paintings and get
into the art market, but I think for quality and condition it will
be a problem,'' he says. ``Paintings are individual, and there are
problems inherent in buying them. You have to see them; it's too
easy to fool around with a photograph. Caveat emptor: Let the buyer
beware.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, a high percentage of items sold at conventional
auctions are snapped up, sight unseen, by buyers calling in
telephone bids. The Internet, some dealers say, is just a different
technology. But the prices are often driven up by the thrill and
excitement of the live event, where the auctioneer is a kind of
performance artist who specializes in motivational patter. Can the
Internet really replicate that? Redden has been an auctioneer at
Sotheby's for 24 years, and he says virtual auctions can stimulate
the kind of nail-biting tension of a live sale. ``There can be
quite a bit of drama,'' says Redden, who is not afraid to admit
that he's bought plenty of things from such Internet auction sites
as eBay or amazon.com or yahoo.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a 10-year-old son who loves Pokeman, and we buy trading
cards on the sites,'' Redden adds. ``In the early morning, all my
son wants to do is jump on line. This is where the entertainment
comes in. I'll hear endless exclamations, like `Fantastic,'
`Awesome,' or `This rocks.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Schoelkopf of Christie's is less forthcoming about his on-line
activity, although he has purchased items from virtual auctions.
Pokeman? ``I wouldn't dream of telling you,'' he says, ``but I
certainly watched the sale close, and I enjoyed it a great deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Internet is spawning a new generation of collectors
who have never been to an auction house but are glued to their
screens. Clive Davidson, manager of a fast-food restaurant in
Glasgow, has set his alarm clock to monitor a sale in the middle of
the night. He's a frequent customer at icollector, the London-based
Internet company that offers wares from about 150 international
auction houses. ``It's convenient and not intimidating,'' says
Davidson, who has bought a gold coin, an art deco watch, and a
Muhammed Ali autograph. ``My mother and brother think it's daft,
but I just love it.''
</P>
<P>
   On-line auctions open up the field to enthusiasts who can't jet
off to London or New York for the latest offering of Hollywood
memorabilia or 19th-century furniture. ``We have one collector who
sends in his bids from an oil rig in the South China Sea,'' says
James Corsellis, managing director of icollector. The site offers
an art price guide and other information (or ``content'' in
cyberspeak) to assist buyers.
</P>
<P>
   But even if all the information in the world is available to
consumers, will fine art really find a niche on line? Some are
dubious. ``It's a very catchy idea, but I'm a bit bemused by it,''
says Malcolm Rogers, director of the Museum of Fine Arts. ``If
you're selling wristwatches or diamonds, that's different. But a
work of art is highly subjective. What you pay for it depends on
your personal response to it when you're in its presence.'' The MFA
never bids at auction unless a curator examines the work in person,
so the phenomenon is unlikely to affect major museums _ at least
for now.
</P>
<P>
   But the skeptics and enthusiasts alike concede that there is no
stopping the trend. It's anyone's guess how it will ultimately
affect the art market. ``If you ask the Internet folks to predict
anything beyond the next 18 months, they'll laugh at you,'' Redden
says. ``But we're creating a nation of collectors, and it's going
to spread to the rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;
</P>
<P>
   As the Internet matures, everybody is looking for credibility _
whether it be about visual art or tunes. Free music abounds in
cyberspace. The problem is: How do you find it?
</P>
<P>
   Staffers at RollingStone.com and TheSource.com are now listening
to music tracks submitted by unknown bands and featuring the most
promising talent on their Web pages. The venture adds credibility
to the MP3 format, the technology that lets users download
high-quality music.
</P>
<P>
   The Source has always had a column called ``Unsigned Hype,'' in
which it lauds unknown talent. ``This will allow us to reach more
people,'' says Source associate publisher Jeff Jones. ``We have 10
garbage bags full of tapes we still have to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the critics who now have to comb through those
electronic garbage bags? ``This is a good way for them to earn
their keep,'' says Tom Cohen of Rolling Stone. ``Actually, they're
excited. They're passionate about music.''

A RUMBLING RECOLLECTION OF HOT-ROD CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of them were the boys that mothers did not want their
daughters bringing home. After &UR;  &LR; all, they were mechanically
inclined and probably took shop, had grease under their nails, an
itch for speed, and an eye for life on the edge.
</P>
<P>
   Hot-rodders they called them and in the social pecking order
they were just a notch above gnarly bikers on their chopped up
Harleys and Indians. Never mind that many of them were mechanical
and design whizzes who would grow up to be engineers and
illustrators and writers and businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   The 1950s New England hot rod culture was a religion unto
itself, and a surprising one at that, given that most people think
California, and racing at Santa Ana or out near Edwards Air Force
Base, or Bonneville when they think of hot rods and racing. They
don't think of airport runways in Orange, Mass., or Sanford, Maine,
or Newington, N.H., and many other runways where National Hot Rod
Association races were held around New England.
</P>
<P>
   It was a culture of channeled cars, mechanical ingenuity and
inventiveness and it endures down to this day as hot rod clubs,
cruise nights, and individuals who remember keep its essence alive.
</P>
<P>
   And now, with the publication of ``Cool Cars, Square Roll Bars''
- subtitled ``Photos and Recollections of Fifties Hot Rodding in
New England - the New England branch of the religion has a bible.
</P>
<P>
   Written by brothers Arnold and Bernard Shuman, hot rodders who
went on to become, respectively, an automotive journalist and then
public relations guru for Mercedes Benz, and an illustrator, the
book provides a rumbling ramble, in words and photos, through 1950s
hot rodding.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, this is two books in one. The first, in columns of
words spilling down the left-hand pages, tells the story of 1950s
hot rodding. There are personal reminiscences, minutes from old
club meetings, interviews and news clippings.
</P>
<P>
   You read about the Bannister brothers, Ralph and Fran, and other
afficiandos of hot, channeled cars: Carroll Sleeper, Marvin
Rifchin, Skip LaJoie, Jack Hartney, Jack Crosby, Eleanor ``Ma''
Shagbotham, and the Sharrigan brothers, Shag and Mudd.
</P>
<P>
   And you read about the clubs all over New England: Rollin' Rims,
Cam Snappers, Drag-Lynx, Push Rods, Rockers, Cam Twisters, Gear
Eaters, Hot Heads, Piston Manglers, No-Mads, and Ty-Rods.
</P>
<P>
   And of the Ty-Rods, who had to reorganize in 1952-53 over a bad
image the club had built up, you read, ``They behaved like the
crazed teenage car junkies in the B movies shown at drive-ins.
Correctly costumed, right down to the cigarette pack rolled in the
T-shirt sleeve and engineer boots ... racing the five miles to
Sunshine Dairy ... they would posture, ogle the young girls ... and
eventually be thrown out by the owner.''
</P>
<P>
   Skip Readio, a Ty-Rod since 1978, acknowledges the old image but
points to that early `50s reorganization that kept the club alive.
It will hold its annual Ty-Rods' Old Timers Reunion this Sept. 13
at the Hudson, Mass., Elks Lodge. And, says Readio, the appearance
of ``Cool Cars...'' ``will help bring some of the intimacy back.''
</P>
<P>
   That is because, in addition to the written history contained in
the book, the photographic history is astounding.
</P>
<P>
   There are pictures of old club membership cards and emblems;
pictures of club members standing in groups; pictures of members
then and now.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly there are pictures of cars.
</P>
<P>
   Cars racing on airport runways or at New England Dragway.
</P>
<P>
   Cars built by young men who'd had glimpses of low-slung European
sports cars and decided they could make older American cars -
notably 1932-34 Fords - look much like that.
</P>
<P>
   Channel the cars to lower the bodies, add cycle fenders to cover
open wheels and, hopefully, find the grill from a newer pickup
truck and, voila, an American roadster.
</P>
<P>
   You can just imagine club members gathering with copies of this
book, looking up names, pouring over the pictures of cars they
owned or remember having belonged to others.
</P>
<P>
   Here is Pete Seferian's Olds V8 roadster with only three exhaust
pipes per side; or Dick Kelly's Chevy-powered '33 Ford coupe known
as ``The Merger;'' or Jerry Sheehan streaking down the strip at
Sanford, protected by a ``rollbar'' that the authors say he now
confesses was really just a piece of waterpipe he had bent around a
floor support in the basement; and Fran Bannister's distinctive `32
Ford roadster with its `39 Ford pickup truck grille.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the people in the book are gone, and so are many of the
cars. But as always, there are stories about what remains, or what
is rumored to remain. The book, with all its fine photos and
stories, and in the hands of hot rodders around New England, will
only fuel more stories.
</P>
<P>
   Stories like the tale of the Bannister roadster, which five
years ago, as Bannister lay dying, was strewn in pieces in
Haverhill.
</P>
<P>
   Bannister asked Tom Caruso, of Tommy Caruso's Specialized
Automotive in Tyngsboro, to please buy the car and restore it
himself - or at least make sure it went into the the hands of
someone who would do so. Two years later, Caruso got the car and
sold it to Larry Hook, a Rhode Islander hot rodder, who is having
the roadster meticulously restored, one bit of tangible history
restored, even as ``Cool Cars...'' continues to preserve the
memory, if not the metal, of those hot rod days.

BOOK TAKES A LOOK AT `CAPTAIN TRIPS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CRAIG MARINE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's been nearly four years since Jerry Garcia
left this mortal plane for parts unknown. For many, Garcia's death
from a heart attack as he lay in a California rehab facility,
trying once again to kick his heroin habit, left a void yet to be
filled.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you are a rabid fan or not, ``Garcia: An American Life''
(Viking; $34.95), by Blair Jackson, is a fascinating look at one of
the more complex and influential personalities to emerge from the
'60's maelstrom, a musician that Bob Dylan claimed ``had no
equal.'' The book is due to be released this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Deadheads will eat it up. There is enough detail about the
evolution of particular songs and the construction of the various
albums to fill a library. Add in meticulous set-lists from various
memorable concerts from the band's decades of touring _ and the
evaluation of particular nights' performances _ and it makes it
easier to figure out which Dead tapes the discriminating listener
might want to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   But there's still plenty here for the non-obsessed. By focusing
on one person, ``Garcia'' also serves as a detailed look into the
evolution of American culture, using Garcia and the band's
experiences to weave through the anything-goes exploration of the
'60's all the way through the ugly realities of addiction, failed
relationships, isolation and death.
</P>
<P>
   And man, do a lot of people die in this book. They don't call
them the Dead for nothing, apparently. The band loses more keyboard
players than Spinal Tap loses drummers. Enough, in fact, that when
pianist Bruce Hornsby was approached to join the group, he was
jokingly _ perhaps _ asked if his insurance was paid up.
</P>
<P>
   But it's Garcia's road to oblivion that makes for the most
compelling reading, even if you know the ending. The same attitude
that passes for fun early in the band's career _ liberal drug
ingestion in the name of ``mind expansion'' _ contributes to his
downward spiral, as the Dead entourage is always reluctant _ with a
few notable exceptions _ to call their ``Captain Trips'' on his
descent into junkiedom.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that the Dead was such a money-making corporation,
especially toward the end, and that scores of people's livelihoods
were linked to the band's touring schedule, it's easier to
understand this look-the-other-way attitude, even if it did
eventually kill the goose that laid the golden eggs.
</P>
<P>
   For all its tales of drug use and deterioration, however,
``Garcia'' manges to avoid the pratfalls of becoming a tawdry
snort-and-tell book. This is due largely to the author's extensive
interviewing, which adds depth to a story that most people only
know on the surface. Jackson was able to interview more than 100
people, with access to much of Garcia's family, friends, band
mates. He also claims to have had more personal interviews with
Garcia than any other journalist, though who knows who was keeping
count? Garcia died Aug. 9, 1995, in Forest Knolls, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a pastiche of anecdotes that are sometimes
remembered slightly differently by those involved, which adds to
the air of truthfulness of the book.
</P>
<P>
   The most interesting section is the beginning, chronicling
Garcia's emergence as a folkie, bluegrass-type picker who was swept
up in the confluence of the Beats and the evolving hippies.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Kesey's Merry Pranksters play a prominent role in the birth
of the new counterculture, with the Dead serving as the house band
for the Pranksters' famous Acid Tests.
</P>
<P>
   It is from this tripping, free-form atmosphere that the
essential Grateful Dead live concert experience is born, as the
band learns to noodle endlessly before maybe coming across a nugget
from which to take off on one of their extended jams. When it
works, it's otherworldly _ when it doesn't, it's some of the worst
stuff since the invention on the musical instrument. And that,
without much change, remained the basic Dead concert experience.
</P>
<P>
   Drummer Mickey Hart explained that the band was never in the
music business, they were in the transportation business. And in
truth, they were, largely because Garcia's musical acumen in so
many diverse stylings allowed them to explore territories more
often the realm of jazzmen like Ornette Coleman and John Coltrane.
But few who saw Garcia during his several junked-up phases will
forget his vacant stare, his lifeless shoe-gazing and his total
inability to transport anyone to the next song, let alone the next
dimension.
</P>
<P>
   In his defense, he was often bored. But then again, so are a lot
of people who toil on the clock in thankless jobs every day _ and
nobody is paying $35 to watch them work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Garcia'' seems a fair biography, though clearly told from a
fan's perspective. Still, Jackson doesn't let his admiration for
the man and the band get in the way of an honest accounting, which
is all a reader can ask for.

OPTIMISM PERVADES AT WEB NURTURER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Air whistled out of the Internet stock market a few weeks ago
and investors who have made money hand over fist began to wonder
out loud if the party was over.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a sad turn of events for your neighborhood day
trader. But what about a company whose entire business is based on
the ability to fund and nurture young Web enterprises, often
leading to an initial public stock offering? What about CMGI Inc.,
the Andover, Mass., company that has 40 young Internet companies
based in New England and around the country under its investment
wing?
</P>
<P>
   It's a question sure to come up in many discussions next week,
when CMGI makes presentations to large investor conferences hosted
by U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffrey on Monday and Bear Sterns Co. on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Those investors will surely hear a version of the official CMGI
line: a tougher, more discriminating Internet stock market will
highlight the strength of the company's system.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI has access to plenty of money and doesn't have to rush a
young company onto the public market before its time or under
difficult conditions. It's established skill at picking evolving
Internet fields will stand out when the market no longer writes
blank checks for young Web ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Another plus: the CMGI portfolio's keiretsu-style business
relationships interwoven between companies. In one case, Web site
Ancestry.com got funding from CMGI and subsquently outsourced its
site hosting chores to fellow portfolio company NaviSite and used
Adsmart, another CMGI-backed venture, to find advertising.
</P>
<P>
   But most importantly to CMGI, the Internet itself no longer has
anything to prove.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never been more optimistic about the Internet business
in general,'' said Bill White, CMGI's marketing director. ``We no
longer think it's a decision about the Internet economy. It's about
the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   CMGI has had its share of wild success helping Internet
companies go public. It's biggest score was the 80 percent of Lycos
Inc. it purchased for $2 million in 1995. Now drastically reduced
to about 20 percent by a 1996 IPO and subsequent stock sales, the
stake is worth more than $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI has millions more to invest in new companies and reviews
about 1,000 business plans every month. ``That says there's no
shortage of quality companies,'' said White.
</P>
<P>
   Investors will also see the IPO short list inside the CMGI
investment portfolio, 14 companies considered candidates for public
stock offerings over the next 24 months.
</P>
<P>
   That list is an eclectic mix of Internet enterprises, including
retailers, a business-to-business seller, marketing companies and
Web infrastructure providers.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the companies have already filed papers to start the IPO
process and brought blue-chip underwriters aboard to handle the
offering. An offering of Chemdex Corp. shares will be managed by
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and Goldman Sachs will lead the IPO of
Engage Technologies Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts like Ullas Naik of First Albany Corp. think both
Chemdex and Engage Technologies have the potential to be hot IPOs.
But two recent CMGI-related stock offerings, though higher than
their initial price, have fallen steeply off their highs.
</P>
<P>
   Silknet Software Inc. went public at 15 per share last month and
soared to 52 3/8 over its first weeks, but has since slipped back
to 31 7/8.
</P>
<P>
   Critical Path Corp. hit the market at 24 per share in March and
rocketed to 150 1/4 within two weeks. It finished Wednesday at 48
3/4.
</P>
<P>
   The softer Internet IPO market ``certainly has an impact and I
think you're seeing a little of that in the (CMGI) stock price,''
said Naik. ``The demand for new Internet-related IPOs waned and
that was reflected in CMGI's market capitalization.''
</P>
<P>
   CMGI stock, which peaked at a split-adjusted 151 per share in
April, recently dipped below 100 and has since bounced back to
finish at 105 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get the idea CMGI is turning into a value stock. The
company has a market value of $9.8 billion, while the public shares
of Internet companies it holds amounts to $1.7 billion. That means
investors are putting a value of about $8 billion on CMGI's private
investments under development and its ability to raise winners in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   Institutional investors who are CMGI fans aren't very worried
about the recent price slide. ``Companies like CMGI have to be
valued on what they will do over the next three to five years,''
said Fred Kobrick of Boston-based Kobrick funds. ``I think (the
recent stock decline) is totally irrelevant to CMGI, even if it
might buffer the stock price, because it's mission is to bring out
really great companies that will evolve into not just decent IPOs
but another Lycos every two or three years,'' said Kobrick.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI invests in new Net firm either as majority owners _
typically reserving 20 percent of the stock as incentives for
managers _ or through a series of venture funds it oversees. The
first two CMGI (at)ventures funds each invested about $35 million
of company money. The third fund raised $287 million, mostly from
outside investors.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI portfolio companies that could go public over the next two
years run the full gamut of venture funds and majority interests.
</P>
<P>
   They include:
</P>
<P>
   --Chemdex, which sells scientific supplies directly to labs.
Naik and other analyts consider it a model of Web
business-to-business ventures.
</P>
<P>
   --Engage, a marketing firm that can track preferences of
individual Internet visitors for clients.
</P>
<P>
   --MotherNature.com, a high-profile retailer of natural health
products.
</P>
<P>
   --Raging Bull, a popular financial information and chat room
site.
</P>
<P>
   --Furniture.com, an on-line furniture retailer highlighted in
this column last month.
</P>
<P>
   --Ancestry.com, a Web site that combs databases to help visitors
track their geneology.
</P>
<P>
   --NaviSite, an outsourcing company that hosts Web sites. It
attracted additional investments on Monday from Dell Computer Corp.
and Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   --ICast, a broadcasting venture recently launched with former
NBC Television Network president Neil Braun.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI officials declined to discuss the prospects for individual
investments, but said they had no doubt the stock market would
welcome new firms as they mature.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the IPO route will continue to be extremely available
for quality companies that are ready,'' said CMGI's White.

CHRYSLER'S GRACEFUL, SPORTY 300M 
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV.: A photo is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchases by calling 212-556-4204 or -1927.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think back to the mid-1950s and picture big steel: Cadillac,
Lincoln, and Chrysler. Dinosaurs roamed the roads.
</P>
<P>
   The Caddy was the Pteradactyl, winged and amazing because, big
as it was, it flew.
</P>
<P>
   The Lincoln, heavy and malevolent (``You're gonna drive me to
drinkin', If you don't quit drivin' that hotrod Lincoln'') was the
Tyrannosaurus Rex.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the blunt-nosed 1955 Chrysler 300, a
Stegosaurus of an automobile, heavy-clad yet capable of bursts of
straight-ahead speed: 127.580 miles per hour on the sands of
Daytona Beach, gulping gas through twin four-barrel carbs to feed a
331-cubic-inch, V-8 hemi. It was the first of Chrysler's 10-year
run of its 300 ``letter series'' cars.
</P>
<P>
   As history tells us, gasoline prices killed the dinosaurs.
</P>
<P>
   But now comes Chrysler with a new car in the letter series, the
300M.
</P>
<P>
   You've seen the ads for the new fleet of Chrysler cars: with
their winged insignia on the grilles, arranged in an arc, they look
like a flight wing ready for liftoff from some airfield in England.
</P>
<P>
   My most recent experiences with Chrysler products have hardly
been moments of grace. What I knew about them was that it is tough
to kill an old Chrysler in a demolition derby. They seem to run
forever even with the engine blowing oil and a punctured radiator
no longer supplying water to cool the engine. And those big square
bodies folded up only after repeated bludgeonings.
</P>
<P>
   So it was with some wonderful surprise that the 300M greeted me
with such grace.
</P>
<P>
   This car is Chrysler's attempt to put sport into a sedan and it
is a successful bid for what in this day and age is the relatively
reasonable price of $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Start at the nose, where the car begins low and curved,
Italianate in its styling as it flows up over sculpted headlamps, a
gracefully rising hood that eases into sloping windshield, and a
roofline that continues the rising wedge until it all ends abruptly
at a crisply chopped-off rear. This latter was carried out to keep
the car's length to 197.8 inches, short for a big sedan, but able
to fit in smaller garages outside the United States where Chrysler
hopes to sell lots of these models.
</P>
<P>
   The 300M is aimed at a younger, slightly more affluent driver
than its more standard luxury sedan, the LHS. That means the car
has to have some snap, and this one does, with an engine that is
remarkable in a car that does not cost $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   This powerplant is a 3.5-litre, 24-valve, aluminum V6 with
surprising oomph. Pull out to pass a truck on the highway and it
kicks in like a race car to hurtle you forward. It gives off more
of a whine than does, say, the Mercedes 2000 S Class we drove a few
weeks ago, with its deep basso rumble _ but at $50,000 less in
price, it's not a bad swap. Because of its coil-on-plug ignition
system and platinum-tipped spark plugs, this engine needs no tuning
before 100,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Add an optional, upgraded handling and suspension system to the
car and it is capable of nearly 150 miles per hour. As I said,
quite a six-cylinder engine, one that gets 18 miles per gallon city
and 27 on the highway.
</P>
<P>
   The transmission is a four-speed automatic with the plus-minus
click option for manual shifting that is becoming more and more
common.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, there is something decidedly modern, yet retro about the
300M. Maybe it is that sitting in black leather seats you look at
round analog guages that appear more Swiss Watch than car dash:
white backgrounds with stark black markings.
</P>
<P>
   This is a most comfortable car. The front seats have eight-way
power adjustments; the driver's seat moves back 2.2 inches
automatically to let you exit the car, but returns to its previous
driving position when you re-enter and turn the key.
</P>
<P>
   An optional ($315) Infinity 240-watt sound system _ tape deck,
CD changer, radio _ with nine speakers fills the car with sound and
Chrysler has managed to hide its antenna in the window (cutting
down the whistle of wind noise) and still get excellent reception
across both bands.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever was lost in chopping off the trunk for length is more
than made up for by its height, and by the fact that the 60-40
split rear seat drops to carry skis, golf clubs and other loads.
You can carry as many golf bags as you can golfers in this car.
</P>
<P>
   The big old Chryslers were known primarily for one thing:
straight ahead power. The 300M has all of that, but it is also
quite agile. There was no boat-like roll or yaw when I took it
through the climbing S-curves near my home where I like to
challenge handling.
</P>
<P>
   On the highway, it was nimble, moving quietly and gracefully in
and out of traffic, supported by big 17-inch wheels, fully
independent strut suspension, antilock disc brakes on all four
wheels and traction control.
</P>
<P>
   But what struck me most about this auto was the engine. I try
not to read any of the specs on a car before I drive it and after
my first spin in this one, had anyone asked me to guess on the
engine, I would have said, ``Nice and quiet little V8.'' When I
looked and saw the 6, I was pleasantly surprised.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The way the center console, beneath the cover, is ribbed and
ridged for tapes, CDs, and coins in a most simple way.
</P>
<P>
   --The automatic option on headlights, which turns them on if you
forget to as darkness falls or as you enter a tunnel, and also
fires them up if the windshield wipers go for more than 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The climate control panel situated above the sound system
controls. I kept turning up the fan when I thought I was reaching
for the volume dial.
</P>
<P>
   --The too-obviously-plastic lid surrounding the shift lever.
Chrysler put so much effort into the elegance of leather and mock
leather on every other surface it is hard to understand how one
more square foot of elegance would have added that much to price.

THE CHARM OF NORTHERN EXPOSURE   GOLF 
</HEADLINE>
 ENGLAND-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL HARBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is something special about getaway golf in northern New
England. The season is painfully short. Nevertheless, it is as
magnificent as it is brief.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike heading to Cape Cod, which demands that one travel over a
pair of often jammed bridges, there are many roads to the more than
200 golf destinations north of the Massachusetts border. The pace
on those roads is unlike that of Cape Cod in the summer as well. It
isn't stop-and-go Route 6 or bumper-to-bumper Route 28. The prelude
to the first tee at a northern New England course often is clear
highways and winding rural roads along stone-filled streams,
punctuated by the occasional covered bridge.
</P>
<P>
   You can make a day trip to some of this region's courses.
However, the best way to savor these rounds is with an overnight
expedition. Then, the only agenda after walking off the 18th green
is inspecting a picturesque sunset at your rental cottage and
listening to the Red Sox game from faraway Fenway via a portable
radio.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of golf runs the gamut, from championship tracts
like Sugarloaf in Maine's Carrabasset Valley to nine-hole
mom-and-pop operations. Conditions vary, too, from well-manicured
to hardscrabble.
</P>
<P>
   The region is steep in golf tradition. Golf has been played in
the northern woods since the 19th century. Scottish weavers brought
their native game to Skowhegan, Maine, in the 1880s, playing on a
rudimentary course that no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kebo Valley, nestled in Bar Harbor, exists today. It
opened in 1888, and is the eighth-oldest course in America. H.C.
Leeds, the first champion at The Country Club in Brookline and
designer of the Myopia Hunt Club course in South Hamilton, turned
Kebo Valley into a first-class golf destination at the turn of the
century. Millionaires and heads of state have graced the course.
One hole is even called the Taft Hole after the 27th president of
the United States, who once took 26 strokes on the par-4 17th,
which measures only 349 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont's golfing genealogy traces back to the earliest stages
of the game in America. In fact, the Dorset (Vt.) Field Club claims
golf was played there in 1886, a year before the Apple Tree Gang
came into existence at St. Andrews-on-the-Yonkers in New York. But
there is no written proof to further the claim. In New Hampshire,
golf was played as early as 1894 in New London by vacationing
Bostonians. Beaver Meadow, a course in West Concord, was the first
club established in New Hampshire in 1897. Now it is a
municipally-owned course.
</P>
<P>
   Maine has far more courses than New Hampshire or Vermont and
offers a great variety. The late Gene Sarazen, who spent many
summers in northern New England, thought Maine could become the
golfing Scotland of America because of the geographic similarities.
It never happened, but there are many jewels.
</P>
<P>
   If Sugarloaf were closer to civilization it would be the
people's choice as the best course in New England. Because it is
four hours from Boston, it remains a secret. Relatively few have
played it, but those who have rave about its beauty. There are no
weak holes on this Robert Trent Jones Jr. design. It is the only
course in northern New England worthy of a four-hour car ride. The
signature holes are the 10th and 11th, where the tees are 120 feet
above the landing area, offering dramatic views of the Presidential
mountain range.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the best way to make the trip to Sugarloaf is by breaking
up the long commute with golfing stopovers. On the way up, visit
Belgrade Lakes GC, just a few minutes out of Augusta. This is a new
course, the first effort in America by English architect Clive
Clark, and is destined to become one of the top tracts in the Pine
Tree State. It is unique for several reasons. It is walker
friendly. In fact, there are some 400 caddies registered at the
club. Also, it is cheaper to take a caddie than a cart. Another
nice thing about Belgrade Lakes is the tee times. They are spaced
15 minutes apart during the week and 12 minutes apart during the
weekend. ``There are no problems because of slow play,'' said
general manager Kyle Reed.
</P>
<P>
   On the way home, visit Dunegrass Golf Club in Old Orchard Beach.
It is worth the stop. If you ever played some of the great courses
at Myrtle Beach, S.C., such as Marsh Harbor, Oyster Bay, the
Heritage, or the Pearl, you will notice a similarity. The same
architect, Dan Maples, designed them. Dunegrass is Maples's only
work in New England. Another reason this trip is worthwhile is the
greens, some of the best you ever will roll a putt on.
</P>
<P>
   A must before any foray into Maine's backwoods is a copy of
TravelGolfMaine, a fee publication that gives an in-depth look at
the region. Its internet address is www.travelgolfmaine.com.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that all the best courses in northern New England
involve long rides, such as a trip to the Balsams Resort in
Dixville Notch, N.H. The Panoramic course is one of Donald Ross's
best efforts in that area. The master architect left his imprint in
the region, and it is surprising that the marketing geniuses at the
great resorts haven't created a Donald Ross Trail, a chain of
courses and stopovers for Ross aficionados. Besides the Panoramic
course at Balsams, you can tee it up at several Ross creations.
Visit Mount Washington CC and stay at the grand hotel. Then you
could head to Bethlehem and play his Maplewood course, a half-flat
and half-hilly tract with one truly memorable hole, the 16th, a
634-yard par-6. You could finish the trip with a visit to Lake
Sunapee, a Ross course that recently has been restored.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire courses vary, much like its landscape. There are
the mountaintop layouts, like the Balsams, as well as the flatter
courses of the Merrimack Valley. One enjoyable place is the Country
Club of New Hampshire in North Sutton, just minutes off of I-89. It
is the site of this week's New England Senior Open and offers
stay-and-play packages. In the 1970s it was selected among the top
75 public courses in America, and in recent years its owners, the
Friel family, have revitalized it.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to see a historic landmark, play Windham Country
Club. This Bill Flynn course just north of the Massachusetts border
is a terrific layout offering challenging shots on all 18 holes.
But when you tee it up on the par-3 sixth, the huge boulder behind
the green is a record-holder, the largest free-standing boulder in
the Western Hemisphere. It's called Butterfield Rock because there
was a hermit who years ago made the area beneath the rock his home.
Windham is close enough to Boston to be a great sneakaway day trip.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont golf is different from that in New Hampshire or Maine.
It is more pastoral. The only downside is that Red Sox fans will be
a minority because New Yorkers invade the Green Mountains every
July and August. Despite that, there are several places worthy of a
visit. There are the staples, such as Stratton Mountain, former
host of the LPGA McCall's Classic, a 27-hole facility with a
neighboring golf school that ranks with the best in the world.
Vermont is also the home of the Mount Snow Golf School, and for
many years Mount Snow was the site of the New England Open.
</P>
<P>
   There is Woodstock, also a Jones creation that plays in a valley
along a brook. The brook comes into play on 11 holes. Woodstock Inn
guests get a discount. Another interesting course is Rutland CC,
built it 1902 by George Low. He is not to be confused with his son
of the same name who played on the PGA Tour and was a renowned
putter. Low Sr. was runner-up in the 1899 US Open and worked for
many years as the head professional at Baltusrol. Later Wayne
Stiles and John van Kleek, underrated architects of the 1920s,
remodeled the existing course and added a second nine.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to stay and play at one resort that best will offer
the Green Mountain experience, it is the Equinox in Manchester. It
has been a stop for presidents and the rich from the days before
there was a golf course. The course was designed by Walter Travis
in the 1920s and was restored in 1991 by Rees Jones and renamed
Gleneagles. If there is one hole you will remember it is the par-4
(and aptly numbered) 13th. Locals call it ``the Volcano Hole''
because it is straight up and has caused the eruption of scores and
tempers.

LOSING IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lost and Found is a serious disaster recovery tool for Windows.
Like other data recovery tools, Lost And Found can find files after
they have been accidentally deleted or removed from the Windows
``recycler.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lost and Found can also recover files after a hard disk has
been scrambled by a computer virus, after somebody has reinstalled
a computer's operating system, or even after a hardware failure. No
office or serious home user should be without it.
</P>
<P>
   Data recovery programs used to be extremely popular back in the
early 1990s. Way back then, computers were less reliable, computer
users were less skilled, and there were so many bugs in the DOS
that computers routinely lost the contents of their floppy disks or
hard drives for no apparent reason. Back in the early '90s, many
computer users I knew would purchase a copy of Norton Disk Doctor
or Mace Utilities as a kind of insurance policy. Then, when
disaster inevitably struck, they were ready.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past few years, most data recovery tools have
evolved in a way that hasn't been entirely helpful: the programs
have gotten bigger and more powerful, but have lost their original
vision. For example, today Norton Utilities is a huge system that
includes a virus checker, a disk optimizer, and a program
``uninstaller.'' For data recovery, Norton can back up your
computer or make a ``rescue'' disk that has critical files and
information. If something later goes wrong with your computer, the
theory goes, you can use the ``rescue'' disk to make your computer
right. The problem with Norton Utilities is that you need to
purchase the program and install it before disaster strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Lost and Found takes a fundamentally different approach. Instead
of coming on a CD-ROM, Lost and Found comes on a floppy disk. If
something goes wrong with your computer's hard disk and you need
the data, just turn off your computer, insert the Lost and Found
floppy, and reboot. No installation is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Lost and Found comes with its own copy of DOS and a very
sophisticated program that will analyze your computer's hard drive,
help you find the data you are looking for, and write it to a set
of floppy disks. You then take these floppies to another computer
and run a special program that restores the data onto the good
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lost and Found can recover against many virus attacks
(including the dreaded Chernobyl virus), the main use of this
program is for recovering data after hardware failure. The
program's authors have worked closely with disk-drive manufacturers
to learn how to access the information on a hard drive at a very
low level. As a result, Lost and Found can frequently read disk
blocks that are inaccessible from Windows itself _ as well as from
other recovery programs.
</P>
<P>
   I found Lost and Found to be remarkably easy to use. The program
is also safe to use, since it doesn't modify the data on the hard
drive in any way: if you are not successful recovering your data
with one approach, you can try another without fear of permanently
altering the data on your disk. (Of course, since Lost and Found
doesn't repair your disk, you may still need a program such as
Norton Disk Doctor if you want to try to get your computer working
again without reformatting the hard disk and reloading your
operating system.)
</P>
<P>
   Recently acquired by PowerQuest (http://www.powerquest.com/),
Lost and Found is a relatively new product. But Lost and Found's
technology is based on a disk recovery product that has been used
for many years by both major corporations, such as Dell and
Microsoft, as well as disk drive recovery centers such as Driver
Savers (http://www.drivesavers.com/), On Track
(http://www.ontrack.com/), and Atlanta Computer Resource
(http://www.atl-datarecovery.com/). In fact, PowerQuest believes it
is these services, rather than simple utility programs such as
Norton, that are the real competitors for its program.
</P>
<P>
   Data recovery centers typically use a combination of software
and hardware to get data back after a disaster. Because of this
combination, they can do a much better job than software-only
systems such as Lost and Found. Using a center also costs a lot
more money _ hundred or even thousands of dollars, as opposed to
$60.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Lost and Found, PowerQuest also sells a more
advanced data recovery program called Search and Rescue. Besides
copying to floppies, Search and Rescue can also send the recovered
data to a networked file server, and it includes advanced search
features for scanning through lots of data very quickly. Search and
Rescue is priced at $150, but there are steep discounts for
businesses that want to purchase multiple copies for recovering
more than one machine.
</P>
<P>
   One of the applications for Search and Rescue has been law
enforcement. Cops and investigators equipped with this technology
have been able to execute search warrants on computers and recover
files after they have been deleted and allegedly ``destroyed'' by
suspects. According to the company, data recovered using these
programs has been invaluable in obtaining numerous convictions,
including several cases involving child pornography.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons these programs can be successful in
recovering data that has been intentionally destroyed is that the
Microsoft Windows ``format'' program doesn't actually erase the
computer's hard drive. Instead, the computer reads every block on
the hard disk to figure out which ones are good and which ones are
bad, but the only sectors that it writes are those for the
computer's root directory. All of the information is still left in
place.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, if you care about data security you might still
want to purchase a program such as Norton Utilities or Nuts and
Bolts. Both include data destruction programs that will repeatedly
overwrite unused blocks of your computer's hard drive. Once you've
run one of these programs, a data recovery program such as Lost and
Found is all but useless.

RECOGNIZING A STAR IN A GROWTH INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Landscape architect Joseph Hudak quips that he's been wondering
if the medal he's getting from the American Horticul-
</P>
<P>
   tural Society on Friday is the kind ``made of chocolate with a
foil wrapper.'' If it is, this is a sweet week for Boston's flower
power elite.
</P>
<P>
   It's been 18 years since the AHS, a national organization of
26,000 avid amateur gardeners and professional horticulturalists,
last came to Boston for its annual conference. Medals and national
recognition are being showered on the gathered stars of Boston's
garden scene.
</P>
<P>
   Hudak, well-known as a teacher and the author of five garden
books, will receive the society's 1999 Meritorious Service Award.
He will lecture on ``Gardening from One Millennium to the Next!''
</P>
<P>
   Both Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino and Michael Van Valkenburgh,
professor of landscape architecture at Harvard, are receiving
awards. Menino is getting the AHS 1999 Urban Beautification Award
for his ``Broom to Bloom'' program, intended to beautify the city
and its 15 neighborhoods by using public-private partnerships to
encourage green space adoptions and flower plantings.
</P>
<P>
   The AHS Communication Award will be presented Saturday to
Frances Tenenbaum of Cambridge, Mass., an editor at Houghton
Mifflin. By championing the reissuing of New Hampshire poet Celia
Thaxter's 1894 ``An Island Garden,'' with its important
Impressionistic watercolors by Childe Hassam, as well as other
gardening classics, Tenenbaum ``helped give Americans back their
horticultural history,'' in the words of Garden Book Club founder
Pam Lord.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Hudak's imprint
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For half a century, beginning with his 25-year tenure at the
fabled Olmsted Associates of Brookline, Mass., the nation's oldest
landscape design firm and now a National Historic Site, Hudak has
been making an imprint with good planting and design. He consulted
on the AHS headquarters master plan at River Farm in Alexandria,
Va. (once owned by George Washington). Hudak also landscaped the
former Prides Crossing farm of past AHS president Nathaniel ``Nat''
Dane and his wife, Arabella, who chairs one of this year's AHS
awards committees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We respect Joe tremendously,'' says Arabella Dane. ``He's
great in so many different dimensions. He's such a good teacher
that he brings out the best in everyone. And he sure knows his
plant material. I have all his books, and they're all marked up
because I've used them so much. They're great teaching tools.''
</P>
<P>
   These include the classic ``Gardening with Perennials Month by
Month,'' published by Timber Press, which has had a 25-year shelf
life, with revisions.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Hudak has been only slightly less ubiquitous than the
PJM rhododendron. He's a life member, board member, or trustee
emeritus of just about every major local horticultural
organization.
</P>
<P>
   As a teacher, he's well known among students who took his plant
identification and design courses at Harvard and Radcliffe between
1963 and 1983. He continues to teach throughout the region for the
National Council of State Garden Clubs' Landscape Design School and
other institutions.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A mecca
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For those who belong to horticultural organizations, all roads
eventually lead to Hudak's dead-end street in Weston, Mass., where
his home sits on a densely planted oasis amid a neighborhood of
unprepossessing lawns.
</P>
<P>
   Many landscape architects open their own yards to such tours
occasionally. But few gardens have been as tramped through as
Hudak's, thanks to his many affiliations.
</P>
<P>
   Last year alone, 1,500 visitors strolled through. ``That's 3,000
feet!'' Hudak exclaims. The Westwood Historical Society Garden Tour
attracted 550 people in May. The Tower Hill Garden Tour brought 600
in June. And in July, 100 members of the Perennial Plant
Association rode buses out from their national conference in
downtown Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had thousands. Every garden club. It's a lot of work.
The fussiness! You have to get everything just right. It's not like
you're hosting visiting dental hygienists. Gardeners know.''
</P>
<P>
   At 72, Hudak says he is not planning on retirement anytime soon.
His current projects include a new book, ``Design for Gardens,''
coming out next spring, a new edition of ``Shrubs in the
Landscape,'' coming out in 2001, and next year's ``Festival of
Flowers,'' the 25th anniversary celebration of the annual
International Design Symposium he helped found.
</P>
<P>
   For his 70th birthday, friends and clients donated a silver
trophy in his name to the Spring Flower Show of the Massachusetts
Horticultural Society. Though it's presented annually, the Hudak
trophy goes to an outstanding exhibit of herbaceous perennials.
</P>
<P>
   Philosophical approach
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hudak seems unimpressed by the current building and landscaping
frenzy. ``It's hard to say if this is the most affluent period I've
seen. There's always money around. But this is a splendiferous
period for people spending money. I hope the market stays up so
everyone gets paid!''
</P>
<P>
   Hudak may be insulated from the ups and downs of the stock
market more than most in his profession. Like the proverbial family
lawyer, he has been engaged for generations within some families.
It's not unknown for longtime clients to send him as a kind of
housewarming gift to consult with their grown children after a new
home purchase.
</P>
<P>
   Hudak's landscaping style is traditional, with an emphasis on
common sense. But whereas many landscape architects work with a few
dozen tried-and-true (and ho-hum?) plant varieties, Hudak's palette
is huge, and his practical knowledge of what will grow well here _
and what won't _ is unsurpassed.
</P>
<P>
   It is plants, after all, that excite him. From the time his
grandmother introduced him to gardening as a child in Pennsylvania,
``plants were always my life. I don't know why. I wanted to be a
hybridizer like Luther Burbank,'' he says with his trademark
``Ho-HO!'' hoot of laughter. ``That is, till I learned it took 20
years to find out if an ear of corn you bred did what you wanted it
to!''
</P>
<P>
   In an era when landscape design is breaking out of the
century-old Colonial Revival mold, Hudak remains a traditionalist.
Sun-drenched California minimalism and swimming pools with
``infinity edges'' that flow to the horizon are not for him.
``Contemporary is not the mood of New England. You see swimming
pools and ornamental grasses and great lawns in Architectural
Digest. But here people need variety, because we have too much of
the sameness of winter five months a year.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Hudak sometimes tries to talk clients out of swimming
pools. Too much upkeep for too few swimmable months. ``I tell them
it's easier to just join the country club.''

<P>
   One change he has contributed to is people's greatly increased
knowledge and sophistication about landscapes. ``It's because they
travel and they see things. Even on TV. Look at all the cable
shows!''
</P>
<P>
   The pastel garden is fading as people become more appreciative
of interesting foliage and brilliant color, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Year-round textural layering from many plant types with colorful
foliage plays an important role in Hudak's own 1-acre garden, which
begins as a narrow path at his front door that widens as it circles
around the house. Very carefully selected plants with leaves and
flowers of yellow come first: yellow barberry, a 24-foot-tall
euonymus alata compacta (``compact is a relative term'') with
yellow flowers, yellow azaleas, rare Japanese maples, Scotch broom,
a mysteriously variegated drumondii Norway maple, and many
different yellow-needled chamaecyparis.
</P>
<P>
   Then come the red plants, as the grass sward opens into a large,
tree-lined lawn dubbed ``the polo field.'' Here most of the floral
fireworks are displayed, as well as a zipper scar of new sod where
disruptive sewer work was done.
</P>
<P>
   The circle is completed with the quiet coda of another woodland
path, this time lovingly furnished with blue plants, such as select
hostas.
</P>
<P>
   Hudak seems relieved that the sewer work allowed him to beg off
on most garden tours this year. Except for the American Society of
Landscape Architects. They're having their national conference in
Boston in September. That means the grass has time to knit and
heal, and so the ASLA will be coming through. Ho-HO!

 &HT;    For Lecter fans, Harris serves up a worthy sequel
 &HT;    RESENDING FOR THOSE WHO NEED IT
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hide the chianti and fava beans. Hannibal Lecter, the
cannibalistic psychiatrist from Thomas Harris' best seller ``The
Silence of the Lambs'' is back. And he's as hungry as ever.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, it's Dr. Lecter who's on the menu.
</P>
<P>
   Don't ask.
</P>
<P>
   A million copies of Harris' long-awaited sequel, ``Hannibal,''
arrive in stores Tuesday, and the novel is a stunner. (Dino
DeLaurentiis has already paid $9 million for movie rights.) The
novel picks up seven years after Lecter escaped from custody and
Clarice Starling, the feisty young FBI trainee, disposed of
``Buffalo Bill,'' the serial killer who skinned his victims.
</P>
<P>
   Clarice is a full-fledged agent now, but she has made some
powerful enemies in the bureau. When a drug raid goes sour and
Clarice is forced to kill five people, including a woman carrying a
baby, she faces dismissal. But just when it looks as if her career
is over, she receives a letter from Lecter, and the manhunt for one
of the most vicious killers in history resumes.
</P>
<P>
   But Clarice is not the only one who wants to find Hannibal.
Mason Verger, the doctor's sixth victim, has offered $1 million to
anyone who kills Lecter and $3 million to anyone who captures him
alive.
</P>
<P>
   If you thought Hannibal was a monster, just wait until you meet
Verger. Paralyzed from the neck down and kept alive with a
respirator, the one-eyed Verger is faceless and lipless _ a result
of a little drug experiment Lecter employed in which Verger allowed
his face to be eaten by dogs.
</P>
<P>
   A wealthy sadist before he met Lecter, Verger plays mind games
with troubled children in a day care center in his mansion, feeds
crippled ornamental carp to the giant moray eel he keeps in an
aquarium and attempts to track his nemesis' movements via a
worldwide web. Verger plans to exact his revenge in a particularly
gruesome fashion by feeding Lecter slowly to a herd of omnivorous
pigs and filming his demise.
</P>
<P>
   Foiled for years in his efforts to capture the elusive
sociopath, Verger decides that the best way to draw Lecter out is
to set a trap with irresistible bait: Clarice Starling.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting manhunt is a thrill ride through a house of
horrors, from the scene of a nightmarish 15th-century murder in
Florence to the bizarre interior of Verger's Maryland estate.
Harris introduces a fascinating supporting cast that includes
Verger's sexually abused sister, a lesbian bodybuilder on steroids;
Barney, the hospital orderly who once cared for Lecter; and Paul
Krendler, a misogynist bureaucrat intent on destroying Clarice.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Harris takes us into the mind of Lecter to
revisit the traumatic event in World War II that spawned Hannibal
the Cannibal. Like Clarice, who is tortured by the childhood memory
of slaughtered lambs screaming, Lecter has his own demons that he
deals with by retreating into his ``memory palace,'' a mnemonic
system well-known to scholars in the Middle Ages.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the horror, Harris weaves in a wealth of artistic and
scientific details. In Florence, he has Lecter quoting Dante's
``Inferno'' to a group of scholars, listening to harpsichord
compositions by Henry VIII and expounding on the beauty of
Botticelli's art.
</P>
<P>
   Back in America, he has the doctor watching the film ``A Brief
History of Time'' and considering astrophysicist Stephen Hawking's
theory that at some point the universe would stop expanding and
events of the past could be reversed. A teacup that falls off a
table and breaks into pieces may gather itself back together. When
that happens, Lecter believes, dead relatives would be made whole
and nightmares would cease.
</P>
<P>
   Harris uses this image again in an ending as unsettling as any
in contemporary literature. Writing in language as bright and
precise as a surgeon's scalpel, Harris has created a world as
mysterious as Hannibal's memory palace and as disturbing as a Goya
painting. This is one book you don't want to read alone at night.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST LOOK: An excerpt from ``Hannibal''
</P>
<P>
   Starling turned and saw it all in a single image that would last
as long as she lived. Side by side on their stainless-steel tables
lay a deer and a man. From the deer projected a yellow arrow. The
arrow shaft and the antlers had held up the covering sheets like
tent poles.
</P>
<P>
   The man had a shorter, thicker yellow arrow through his head
transversely at the tips of his ears. He still wore one garment, a
reversed baseball cap, pinned to his head by the arrow.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at him, Starling suffered an absurd burp of laughter,
suppressed so fast it might have sounded like dismay. The similar
positions of the two bodies, on their sides instead of in the
anatomical position, revealed that they had been butchered almost
identically, the sirloin and loin removed with neatness and economy
along with the small filets that lie beneath the spine.
</P>
<P>
   Starling touched her lips with her knuckle. ... ``Dr.
Hollingsworth, were the livers missing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The deer's liver is missing. Mr. Barber's liver apparently
wasn't up to standard. ... The sweetbreads, yes, missing in both
cases. Agent Starling, nobody's said the name yet, have they?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Starling said. ``Not yet.

SCHOOL VOUCHERS AN ISSUE FOR THE SUPREME COURT

 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Many states are passing laws that allow parents to use public
funds to send their children to religious schools. Some courts are
declaring this trend constitutional, while others are not.
Ultimately, the Supreme Court will probably have to make a
decision.
 &HT;    Certainly, the most important advance has been in Florida, which
recently approved the first statewide school voucher plan in the
country. It is actually a small part of a much larger plan to
improve Florida schools by a unique route. Each school is to be
graded between an A and an F. Schools that improve are rewarded
$100 per pupil. Students attending schools receiving an F for two
years can transfer either to another public school or to a private
or parochial school.
 &HT;    In the first year, only four schools are failing. But within two
years as many as 200 schools with 156,000 students could be
eligible for vouchers.
 &HT;    Gov. Jeb Bush says the goal is to ''see that children learn a
year's worth of knowledge in a year's worth of time.''
 &HT;    The law provides $645 million added funding to reward improved
performance. There are rising standards of what schools are to
deliver.
 &HT;    But if a school is flunking, students will get ''opportunity
scholarships'' to get out, giving them and their parents a choice
that exists only for the affluent today.
 &HT;    The only other public voucher programs in America involve
limited numbers of poor children -- 6,000 in Milwaukee who get
$4,400 to go to the school of their choice and 4,200 students in
Cleveland.
 &HT;    Americans United for Separation of Church and State fought both
programs because they would ''directly pay religious schools for
programs that include and advance religion,'' said the Rev. Barry
Lynn, its president.
 &HT;    The Wisconsin Supreme Court disagreed, upholding the
constitutionality of Milwaukee's vouchers and the U.S. Supreme
Court declined last year to hear an appeal. On May 27, the Ohio
Supreme Court found no religious problem with Cleveland's program:
''Whatever link between government and religion is created by the
school voucher program is indirect, depending only on the genuinely
independent and private choice of individual parents, who act for
themselves and their children, not the government,'' it said.
 &HT;    However, Cleveland vouchers were found unconstitutional for a
technical reason that it was a rider on a 1,000-page budget bill.
This week the Ohio Senate passed a new bill that will re-authorize
the program but will limit its effect to children in grades K-5.
 &HT;    ''That will leave 281 poor children stranded who will be thrown
out of the program this fall,'' said David Zanotti, a voucher
advocate.
 &HT;    A much greater blow came from the U.S. First Circuit Court of
Appeals which ruled that vouchers for religious schools in Maine
are unconstitutional. For 200 years the parents of children in
rural counties without a high school received payments which they
could use to send their kids to a public school in a nearby county.
Two sets of parents who wanted to send them to a parochial school
sued, and lost.
 &HT;    The court ruled, ''The historic barrier that has existed between
church and state throughout the life of the Republic has up to the
present time acted as an insurmountable impediment to the direct
payment or subsidies by the state to sectarian ... schools.''
 &HT;    Barry Lynn applauded, noting this was ''the highest court ever
to hear a voucher case, and the justices found vouchers
unconstitutional. It is a monumental ruling in the battle over
taxpayer support of religious schools.''
 &HT;    Jay Sekulow, the attorney who argued the case on behalf of the
parents and the American Center for Law and Justice, said ''The
court treats religious people as if they are subservient to the
ideals of the republic.'' He called the decision ''anti-religious.
It is not neutrality but hostility.''
 &HT;    Four states have taken a different approach, giving parents tax
credits, typically of $500 for tuition paid for private or
parochial tuition. Minnesota was the first, then Iowa followed by
Illinois and Arizona in recent weeks.
 &HT;    By the end of the fourth year of Milwaukee's choice program,
students were performing 6 percent better in reading and 11 percent
higher in math. In Cleveland, scholarship students gained 5 points
on reading tests and 15 percent better in math. Attendance at 59
non-public schools averages 93 percent, much higher than public
schools.
 &HT;    Result: two of three parents are very satisfied. When
philanthropists created 40,000 scholarships to non-public schools,
1.25 million parents applied for them.
 &HT;    It is time for the U.S. Supreme Court to declare vouchers offer
equality of opportunity and freedom of religion. That's more
important than the vague fear that vouchers will ''establish
religion.''

<P>
   No war is to be revelled in, but the one that at last seems to
be drawing to a close in Kosovo leaves an especially bitter taste.
</P>
<P>
   Formally, we have won, since it is our leaders and our generals
who are dictating terms to those of the vanquished Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But historians will long argue whether this war should ever have
been fought; whether Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic made it
inevitable, or whether more skillful diplomacy might have avoided a
conflict that has compounded the tragedy it was supposed to
prevent.
</P>
<P>
   And, we are entitled to ask, was it a ``war'' at all? In a war,
do not two sides engage each other in battle, and both sides suffer
casualties?
</P>
<P>
   But Kosovo 1999 will feature on no regimental roll of honor.
This was among the very few wars fought not in pursuit of national
interests but for reasons of simple humanity. However, there is no
sense of triumph, or of virtue rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   There might have been, had NATO suffered some casualties or had

bombs.

shred of sympathy for the Serb commanders in the tent at Kumanovo,
obliged to surrender to an enemy they have barely seen, let alone

   All of which only reinforces our own obligation to spare no cost
or energy so that the refugees in whose name we fought this ``war''
can return home safely and in peace. &QL;

<P>
   No war is to be revelled in, but the one that at last seems to
be drawing to a close in Kosovo leaves an especially bitter taste.
</P>
<P>
   Formally, we have won, since it is our leaders and our generals
who are dictating terms to those of the vanquished Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   But historians will long argue whether this war should ever have
been fought; whether Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic made it
inevitable, or whether more skillful diplomacy might have avoided a
conflict that has compounded the tragedy it was supposed to
prevent.
</P>
<P>
   And, we are entitled to ask, was it a ``war'' at all? In a war,
do not two sides engage each other in battle, and both sides suffer
casualties?
</P>
<P>
   But Kosovo 1999 will feature on no regimental roll of honor.
This was among the very few wars fought not in pursuit of national
interests but for reasons of simple humanity. However, there is no
sense of triumph, or of virtue rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   There might have been, had NATO suffered some casualties or had
Milosevic _ architect of a decade of misery in the Balkans _ been
overthrown. But he has not been, despite a one-sided contest in
which the Allies have not lost a single life in battle.
</P>
<P>
   This has been war by remote control, carried out by deadly

<P>
   ``We'll dig up our dead and take them with us,'' a Kosovo Serb
from Pristina said this week, on hearing the terms of the peace
plan. ``There's no chance the Serbs will stay.''
</P>
<P>
   The sight of Serbs in Kosovo exhuming their ancestors may bury
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   When the Serbian leader overthrew his predecessor, Ivan
Stambolic, in 1987, it was for being ``soft'' on the Kosovo
question, and he became the idol of Serbia with his pledges to
crush the Albanians' hopes of taking Kosovo out of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has to sell his people a peace plan that ``soft'' old
Stambolic would never have dreamed of swallowing.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has performed U-turns before _ after the humiliating
defeat of the Croatians Serbs in 1995 and the subsequent Serb
exodus from Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   He may pull it off again, using his grip on Radio Televisija
Serbija to hammer home the message that only his stubborn
resistance saved Serbia from occupation by NATO. Out in the
provinces they may even believe it.
</P>
<P>
   But Milosevic will have to reconfigure his regime. The
ultranationalists of Vojislav Seselj's Radical party and the
Serbian Orthodox Church must go. But new partners must come on
board.
</P>
<P>
   Step forward the secular socialists of YUL (United Yugoslav
Left), a party run by Milosevic's wife, Mirjana, and maybe even Vuk
Draskovic, the eccentric leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement,
chucked out of the Serbian government at the start of the war for
his doveish statements.
</P>
<P>
   For all the rumors of military coups and talk of popular
disillusion, there is no obvious replacement for the man whose 12
years as leader have seen Serbia dragged ever deeper into an abyss.
</P>
<P>
   His rivals inside Serbia are a group of envious, quarrelsome
political dwarfs, and while they complain about his disasters, none
ever suggested following a different course in Croatia, Bosnia or
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect a revolt from within the ranks of the security
forces either. The army may be seething but the real power in
Serbia is Milosevic's large, well-armed paramilitary police. This
is the regime's Preatorian guard and it will sink or swim with its
paymaster.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest threat to Milosevic comes from the unlikely
quarter of Montenegro, Serbia's junior partner in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   He ought to have crushed that nut when he had the chance. Now he
must endure Montenegro's youthful president, Milo Djukanovic,
lecturing him about how stupid he was to take on NATO in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   Djukanovic plays with the idea of taking Montenegro out of
Yugoslavia. But he may decide the stay, now the Serbs are humbled,
and angle for the post of Yugoslav president himself. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA _ If cliches were permitted in places like Pristina,
city of fear would not be good enough.
</P>
<P>
   There are rifle shots in the empty streets, loud, close at hand,
from somewhere behind the 15th-century Imperial Mosque. There is
the constant roar of NATO jets and a thump of bombs in the hills
around Kosovo's capital that changes the air pressure on Marshal
Tito street.
</P>
<P>
   There are acres of looted houses, homes to the persecuted
Albanians, two of whom I met _ still I wonder at their courage _
walking down the Corso arm-in-arm, a husband and his pregnant wife
waiting for their day of liberation.
</P>
<P>
   And there are the Serbs, fearful of their future, unable to sell
their homes, tens of thousands of them, still unable to grasp what
Yugoslavia's ``peace'' with NATO really means.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Albanians are coming with NATO,'' a blond girl said.
``This will become an Albanian city.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO, of course, is quite unconcerned by the fate of Kosovo's
remaining 100,000 Serbs _ mostly civilians and innocent of the
crimes of Serb militiamen _ and is already talking blandly of their
``probable'' departure.
</P>
<P>
   First the Kosovo Albanians were ``ethnically cleansed'' by the
Serbs. And in a few days _ two weeks at most _ the Serbs will be
``ethnically cleansed'' by NATO's Albanian allies.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair have both promised to protect Serbs as well as Albanians in
this dark land. Both will fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moving around is not safe _ you have to know that,'' an army
major told us frankly.
</P>
<P>
   I have the impression that Pristina is already lost to the
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, there are the heroes. Two of them were the Albanian
couple and another was a reservist soldier called Zoren Brankovic
who runs the biggest key-cutting shop in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A big, bespectacled man with a large tummy that strained at his
army vest, Brankovic pointed to the single-story yellow-painted
house on Ruga Zejtaret with its ornate stucco work above the three
front windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was born here and I was born here and all the
Brankovic's lived in this small area,'' he said. And he pointed to
the mass of rubble at one end of the street _ NATO's work _ in
which his cousin had died.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I will never leave. This is my home _ my very own home
which belongs to our family. I have a brother here and a wife and
three sons and we want to live here with our Albanian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Albanian people of Pristina were never a problem _ the
money of the KLA and the mafia is the problem. Everyone came to my
shop _ Albanians, Turks, Serbs, Montenegrans...''
</P>
<P>
   But that was then, and this is now. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 475) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Walking past the bombed-out post office _ NATO's work again _ we
found Marjana and her boyfriend Nikola, arms draped around each
other, she holding a red-yellow rose on a long stem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I leave when this is my home and my country?'' she
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Nikola, who was at work in the Jugopetrol plant when NATO
destroyed it in April, talked about the Orthodox monastery at
Gracanina and admitted he wanted to marry Miljana with her long
brown hair and the rose which he had given her.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should never have stopped the war when they did,'' the
girl said suddenly. And there was another of those loud, echoing
rifle shots. Who was shooting at who, I asked?
</P>
<P>
   They shrugged. But I suspect their ignorance. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I have a shrewd, unpleasant suspicion that the Kosovo Liberation
Army are not waiting for NATO to enter Pristina to stake their
claim. I think they are already here, amid the houses of the
dispossessed, waiting to move before a single British paratrooper
marches down Marshal Tito Street.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, not far from Urosevac _ scarcely 15 miles from here _
the Israeli journalist Ron Ben-Yishai drove into an ambush Tuesday
morning, receiving a bullet wound in his leg along with his Serb
driver Ivan Cvejic.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA fired 20 bullets at a bus on the Pristina-Prizren road a
few hours later.
</P>
<P>
   So what life is left for the Serbs here? For mile after mile
Tuesday, I drove alone through an abandoned Kosovo on the road from
Raca, the Albanian homes long incinerated by the Serbs _ though one
was burning away in a field, a bright orange fire blooming from its
windows _ and just one Serb family sitting on the porch of their
cottage.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors are already moving through Pristina that the Serbian
government will not allow the 100,000 Serbs to leave Kosovo, that
the cities of central Serbia cannot absorb more refugees (Kraljevo,
they say, has already taken 6,000 to add to the thousands from
Krajina in 1995).
</P>
<P>
   A thunderstorm was darkening the skies as I approached Luzane
and fingers of lightening were touching the still bright, empty
meadows to the west. On the bombed-out bridge still lay the
skeleton of that terrible bus _ the Pristina-Nis bus that NATO
destroyed with a missile last month _ with its steel roof frame and
scorched iron seats and a boy's sodden left-hand boot on the road
beside it.
</P>
<P>
   Below, beside the river into which many of the dead were thrown
_ Serbs and Albanians alike _ I found a tangle of decaying clothes
and a spray of plastic flowers, bright crimson and yellow and
purple amid the real pale blue cornflowers of the riverbank, a
token of remembrance to the death of both Serbs and Albanians _ the
very last memorial to a Kosovo that might have been but never was.
</P>
<P>
   For they are still here, the Albanians; not many perhaps. But
the couple we stopped on the Corso Tuesday afternoon told _ between
frightened glances and the wife's nervous pleas to her husband to
stop talking and leave _ the story of the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend all our time in a flat,'' he said simply. ``Day and
night. We just stay in, that is all. We move from house to house,
from flat to flat, all the time, in case they come for us. My own
brother has disappeared. I've been to the Milosevic police to ask
where he is.''
</P>
<P>
   At this remark I drew in my breath, loudly. Kosovo is not a
place for the brave. ``No, I couldn't find him,'' the man muttered.
``I have lost my own brother.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife muttered desperately again, a young woman in a long red
dress with jewelry on her hands, newly pregnant, a child conceived
amid her people's nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   They turned away from us, the Albanian couple, and walked
quickly away, arm in arm, waiting for the tomorrow that they and
Zoren Brankovic, deep down in their hearts, fear more than they can
ever admit. &QL;

   PRISTINA _ If cliches were permitted in places like Pristina,
city of fear would not be good enough.
</P>
<P>
   There are rifle shots in the empty streets, loud, close at hand,
from somewhere behind the 15th-century Imperial Mosque. There is
the constant roar of NATO jets and a thump of bombs in the hills
around Kosovo's capital that changes the air pressure on Marshal
Tito street.
</P>
<P>
   There are acres of looted houses, homes to the persecuted
Albanians, two of whom I met _ still I wonder at their courage _
walking down the Corso arm-in-arm, a husband and his pregnant wife
waiting for their day of liberation.
</P>
<P>
   And there are the Serbs, fearful of their future, unable to sell
their homes, tens of thousands of them, still unable to grasp what
Yugoslavia's ``peace'' with NATO really means.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Albanians are coming with NATO,'' a blond girl said.
``This will become an Albanian city.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO, of course, is quite unconcerned by the fate of Kosovo's
remaining 100,000 Serbs _ mostly civilians and innocent of the
crimes of Serb militiamen _ and is already talking blandly of their
``probable'' departure.
</P>
<P>
   First the Kosovo Albanians were ``ethnically cleansed'' by the
Serbs. And in a few days _ two weeks at most _ the Serbs will be
``ethnically cleansed'' by NATO's Albanian allies.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. President Bill Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony
Blair have both promised to protect Serbs as well as Albanians in
this dark land. Both will fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moving around is not safe _ you have to know that,'' an army
major told us frankly.
</P>
<P>
   I have the impression that Pristina is already lost to the
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, there are the heroes. Two of them were the Albanian
couple and another was a reservist soldier called Zoren Brankovic
who runs the biggest key-cutting shop in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   A big, bespectacled man with a large tummy that strained at his
army vest, Brankovic pointed to the single-story yellow-painted
house on Ruga Zejtaret with its ornate stucco work above the three
front windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was born here and I was born here and all the
Brankovic's lived in this small area,'' he said. And he pointed to
the mass of rubble at one end of the street _ NATO's work _ in
which his cousin had died.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I will never leave. This is my home _ my very own home
which belongs to our family. I have a brother here and a wife and
three sons and we want to live here with our Albanian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Albanian people of Pristina were never a problem _ the
money of the KLA and the mafia is the problem. Everyone came to my
shop _ Albanians, Turks, Serbs, Montenegrans...''
</P>
<P>
   But that was then, and this is now. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (125-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 475) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Walking past the bombed-out post office _ NATO's work again _ we
found Marjana and her boyfriend Nikola, arms draped around each
other, she holding a red-yellow rose on a long stem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I leave when this is my home and my country?'' she
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Nikola, who was at work in the Jugopetrol plant when NATO
destroyed it in April, talked about the Orthodox monastery at
Gracanina and admitted he wanted to marry Miljana with her long
brown hair and the rose which he had given her.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should never have stopped the war when they did,'' the
girl said suddenly. And there was another of those loud, echoing
rifle shots. Who was shooting at who, I asked?
</P>
<P>
   They shrugged. But I suspect their ignorance. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I have a shrewd, unpleasant suspicion that the Kosovo Liberation
Army are not waiting for NATO to enter Pristina to stake their
claim. I think they are already here, amid the houses of the
dispossessed, waiting to move before a single British paratrooper
marches down Marshal Tito Street.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, not far from Urosevac _ scarcely 15 miles from here _
the Israeli journalist Ron Ben-Yishai drove into an ambush Tuesday
morning, receiving a bullet wound in his leg along with his Serb
driver Ivan Cvejic.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA fired 20 bullets at a bus on the Pristina-Prizren road a
few hours later.
</P>
<P>
   So what life is left for the Serbs here? For mile after mile
Tuesday, I drove alone through an abandoned Kosovo on the road from
Raca, the Albanian homes long incinerated by the Serbs _ though one
was burning away in a field, a bright orange fire blooming from its
windows _ and just one Serb family sitting on the porch of their
cottage.
</P>
<P>
   Rumors are already moving through Pristina that the Serbian
government will not allow the 100,000 Serbs to leave Kosovo, that
the cities of central Serbia cannot absorb more refugees (Kraljevo,
they say, has already taken 6,000 to add to the thousands from
Krajina in 1995).
</P>
<P>
   A thunderstorm was darkening the skies as I approached Luzane
and fingers of lightening were touching the still bright, empty
meadows to the west. On the bombed-out bridge still lay the
skeleton of that terrible bus _ the Pristina-Nis bus that NATO
destroyed with a missile last month _ with its steel roof frame and
scorched iron seats and a boy's sodden left-hand boot on the road
beside it.
</P>
<P>
   Below, beside the river into which many of the dead were thrown
_ Serbs and Albanians alike _ I found a tangle of decaying clothes
and a spray of plastic flowers, bright crimson and yellow and
purple amid the real pale blue cornflowers of the riverbank, a
token of remembrance to the death of both Serbs and Albanians _ the
very last memorial to a Kosovo that might have been but never was.
</P>
<P>
   For they are still here, the Albanians; not many perhaps. But
the couple we stopped on the Corso Tuesday afternoon told _ between
frightened glances and the wife's nervous pleas to her husband to
stop talking and leave _ the story of the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend all our time in a flat,'' he said simply. ``Day and
night. We just stay in, that is all. We move from house to house,
from flat to flat, all the time, in case they come for us. My own
brother has disappeared. I've been to the Milosevic police to ask
where he is.''
</P>
<P>
   At this remark I drew in my breath, loudly. Kosovo is not a
place for the brave. ``No, I couldn't find him,'' the man muttered.
``I have lost my own brother.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife muttered desperately again, a young woman in a long red
dress with jewelry on her hands, newly pregnant, a child conceived
amid her people's nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   They turned away from us, the Albanian couple, and walked
quickly away, arm in arm, waiting for the tomorrow that they and
Zoren Brankovic, deep down in their hearts, fear more than they can
ever admit. &QL;

<P>
   GRACANICA, KOSOVO _ In the visitor's book of the 14th-century
monastery of Gracanica Wednesday morning, a Serb called Blagujevic
wrote these words:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Jesus Christ and Lord of all Kosovo Serbs _ help the
Serbs to endure this justified struggle and to save their state of
Kosovo-Metohija _ and punish all the enemies who want to destroy
your people. Amen.''
</P>
<P>
   A NATO jet flew through the firmament high above us as we read
Blagujevic's prayer. There was a whisper and a low drum-roll of
sound that buried itself amid the high walls and candle-blackened
frescoes of Saint Sava and his father at Gracanica.
</P>
<P>
   At the door, four Yugoslav soldiers had arrived, one of them
with two crosses dangling on his chest along with his steel
military identification tag. They lay their Kalashnikov assault
rifles on top of each other by the ancient stone door and walked
silently into the church to pray for their families.
</P>
<P>
   So many prayers there are now as Kosovo's day of reckoning grows
nearer.
</P>
<P>
   An hour before, beside the Casablanca discotheque and the
monument to the eternal unity of Serbs and Kosovo Albanians _
Tito's little joke from the 1960s _ God was asked by Archbishop
Artemije of Decine to protect Kosovo's Serbs in the coming days of
darkness.
</P>
<P>
   The 600 Serb men, women and children _ unemployed factory
workers, soldiers with their rifles on their backs, girlfriends and
wives and old men who once loved Tito _ crossed themselves beneath
the dreary sun.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry of interior had banned this rally, they were told,
so they were meeting ``in the shrine of God, under the holy sky.''
</P>
<P>
   And what the Archbishop in his long black robe told them was
this: ``We will show our true patriotism for our holy places. Don't
be frightened. Don't leave your holy place empty. A wrong
historical step cannot be corrected... Whatever happens to us, we
must stay in our homes, our villages, in our cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Moma Trajkovic, who founded the Serbian Resistance Movement in
1989 in support of President Slobodan Milosevic _ though not any
more, dear reader, not any more _ delivered a message that was
directed at NATO and the Belgrade government as well as God.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sending a message to those who want to take revenge _
that revenge is not the answer,'' he shouted. ``Peace cannot be
achieved by revenge but only in a shared life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not for a war or for conflict but we will not be
slaughtered on our doorsteps like lambs. This is what we ask of
those who make decisions about this area _ to come between those
who would slaughter each other...
</P>
<P>
   ``Brothers and sisters, we intend before the whole world to
stay. Remaining in Kosovo is our only chance. Unfortunately, those
who brought us here will not allow us to fight. We want to organize
ourselves and to stay, no matter what the price, to stay in our
homes... If we leave Kosovo-Metohija, we shall never return,
ever.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 85 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 500) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To decode this message, God will have understood the lambs as a
reference to Muslim sacrifice, and the bit about ``those who make
decisions'' as an appeal to Milosevic and General Sir Michael
Jackson of the still virginal ``KFOR.''
</P>
<P>
   No hint, of course, as to why the returning Albanian refugees
might want to take revenge or do any lamb-like slaughtering. A
``shared life'' was not exactly on offer last month. Or even last
week. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once they had completed their prayers, we spoke with Ljuba and
his three soldier comrades from Toplica in the little cafe opposite
the gateway at Gracanica.
</P>
<P>
   They could not have known we were coming _ I only decided on the
trip to the monastery a few minutes earlier _ and it was we who
chose to talk to them.
</P>
<P>
   These were front-line soldiers under bombing, the voice of those
whom NATO _ whom we _ are still trying to kill in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   We ordered coffee and the men sat down nervously although not
without some eagerness to talk. Ljuba was the first to launch into
the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO are not fighting in uniform,'' he said. ``They are at war
against our sacred places, our factories, our bridges, our
kindergartens, our hospitals... The NATO soldiers don't have the
guts to look us in the eyes. They are cowards. We just pray to God
that they come and put their boots on our soil.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ljuba was still praying for the ground war that NATO plans to
avoid. A bombing war was not what he wanted. ``It's tough for
everybody,'' Ljuba's colleague Srdjan said. ``No parent can say:
`It's OK _ my son is in the war.' But they know we have to preserve
this.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed towards the monastery. ``My father told me before I
left for the war: `Don't be a coward.' I said to him: `Don't worry
_ I won't shame my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Ljuba _ the most talkative of the four and the most thoughtful _
wanted to explain their presence. ``We went to pray for our
families' health and to pray that the NATO bombers leave them
alone. The last thing I told my wife was `take care of our son.' He
is eight-and-a-half years old. His name is Stefan. She was crying.
Just a little.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was a war against Orthodox Christianity, Srdjan complained.
The Serbs were hated because they believed in forgiveness. So of
course, I mentioned the unmentionble: Albanians. And out it poured.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had everything _ more than any minority anywhere in the
world,'' Ljuba announced. ``But they cannot build their state on
Serbian soil. Would you allow Irish people to build their state in
Britain?''
</P>
<P>
   And the story followed its familiar course. The Albanian
villages had not been ``cleansed'' but were already deserted when
NATO attacked, the fires untended because of NATO bombs.
</P>
<P>
   But were there not _ I used the usual paraphrase _ some
``uncontrolled elements'' among the Serbs?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, against the terrorists, yes,'' Ljuba suddenly replied.
``Against those who were shooting at us, yes. But I love my wife
and children, I couldn't hurt a woman and child. Now the UCK (KLA)
fire at us from their own columns of refugees in order to provoke
us. But normal men cannot shoot at women and children.''
</P>
<P>
   These words of Ljuba must stand against the record of death
squads and executions and dispossession that the women and children
_ whom no ``normal man'' could shoot _ have spoken of after
crossing Kosovo's borders.
</P>
<P>
   It was therefore a double relief when Captain Nebojsa arrived, a
realist from Yugoslavia's Third Army and the only officer in the
little cafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the Croatian war,'' he said. ``This is much worse
because of the bombing. In Croatia, it was man-to-man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our army now is preparing for a withdrawal if the agreement is
signed. The civilians will go with us. They have started leaving
already. Those who decide to stay, I don't know what will happen to
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are confused. They talk to me. They say if all the army
withdraws, they will withdraw too.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for the KLA, there is no chance they will respect the
agreement because they have no chain of command and are fighting
each other for power. All along the roads now there are (KLA)
ambushes _ just in this last period, since the start of
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers know what this means. They know what has happened
here. And they read a message in the monastery of Gracanica. For
Kosovo's day of reckoning has been visible on the frescoes for
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at the faces of Saint Sava and his father Stefan, of
King Milutin and his tragic child bride Simonida. Every Serb is
shown the Arabic script that desecrates the holy vestments. And the
painted eyes of Sava and Stefan and Milutin and Simonida which,
centuries ago, under Muslim rule, were gouged out with knives. &QL;

   These were front-line soldiers under bombing, the voice of those
whom NATO _ whom we _ are still trying to kill in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   We ordered coffee and the men sat down nervously although not
without some eagerness to talk. Ljuba was the first to launch into
the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO are not fighting in uniform,'' he said. ``They are at war
against our sacred places, our factories, our bridges, our
kindergartens, our hospitals... The NATO soldiers don't have the
guts to look us in the eyes. They are cowards. We just pray to God
that they come and put their boots on our soil.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;

   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 150 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ljuba was still praying for the ground war that NATO plans to
avoid. A bombing war was not what he wanted. ``It's tough for
everybody,'' Ljuba's colleague Srdjan said. ``No parent can say:
`It's OK _ my son is in the war.' But they know we have to preserve
this.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed towards the monastery. ``My father told me before I
left for the war: `Don't be a coward.' I said to him: `Don't worry
_ I won't shame my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Ljuba _ the most talkative of the four and the most thoughtful _
wanted to explain their presence. ``We went to pray for our
families' health and to pray that the NATO bombers leave them
alone. The last thing I told my wife was `take care of our son.' He
is eight-and-a-half years old. His name is Stefan. She was crying.
Just a little.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was a war against Orthodox Christianity, Srdjan complained.
The Serbs were hated because they believed in forgiveness. So of
course, I mentioned the unmentionble: Albanians. And out it poured.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had everything _ more than any minority anywhere in the
world,'' Ljuba announced. ``But they cannot build their state on
Serbian soil. Would you allow Irish people to build their state in
Britain?''
</P>
<P>
   And the story followed its familiar course. The Albanian
villages had not been ``cleansed'' but were already deserted when
NATO attacked, the fires untended because of NATO bombs.
</P>
<P>
   But were there not _ I used the usual paraphrase _ some
``uncontrolled elements'' among the Serbs?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, against the terrorists, yes,'' Ljuba suddenly replied.
``Against those who were shooting at us, yes. But I love my wife
and children, I couldn't hurt a woman and child. Now the UCK (KLA)
fire at us from their own columns of refugees in order to provoke
us. But normal men cannot shoot at women and children.''
</P>
<P>
   These words of Ljuba must stand against the record of death
squads and executions and dispossession that the women and children
_ whom no ``normal man'' could shoot _ have spoken of after
crossing Kosovo's borders.
</P>
<P>
   It was therefore a double relief when Captain Nebojsa arrived, a
realist from Yugoslavia's Third Army and the only officer in the
little cafe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the Croatian war,'' he said. ``This is much worse
because of the bombing. In Croatia, it was man-to-man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our army now is preparing for a withdrawal if the agreement is
signed. The civilians will go with us. They have started leaving
already. Those who decide to stay, I don't know what will happen to
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are confused. They talk to me. They say if all the army
withdraws, they will withdraw too.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for the KLA, there is no chance they will respect the
agreement because they have no chain of command and are fighting
each other for power. All along the roads now there are (KLA)
ambushes _ just in this last period, since the start of
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers know what this means. They know what has happened
here. And they read a message in the monastery of Gracanica. For
Kosovo's day of reckoning has been visible on the frescoes for
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Take a look at the faces of Saint Sava and his father Stefan, of
King Milutin and his tragic child bride Simonida. Every Serb is
shown the Arabic script that desecrates the holy vestments. And the
painted eyes of Sava and Stefan and Milutin and Simonida which,
centuries ago, under Muslim rule, were gouged out with knives. &QL;

 &HT;    HOUSE VOTES TO PULL U.S. TROOPS OUT OF TROUBLED HAITI BY
YEAR-END
 &HT;    450&AMP;ADD

<P>
   MIAMI _ Even as it debates the future of peacekeeping forces in
Kosovo, the House has voted to end another U.S. military presence
-- this one in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   The measure that would pull U.S. troops from Haiti by Dec. 31,
approved late Wednesday, comes amid a rapidly deteriorating
security situation in Haiti that has prompted growing concerns over
the safety of U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our troops have been fired on in Haiti,'' said Rep. Porter
Goss, R-Fla., chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and a
key sponsor of the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haiti is a failure and is indicative of the administration's
foreign policy, which isn't very good,'' he added. ``Haiti is just
about as miserable a situation as there is anywhere on the globe
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials expressed disappointment with
the vote Thursday, saying it undercuts the president's ability to
deploy troops abroad for non-combat purposes.
</P>
<P>
   They said that continued gains in Haiti would require a
sustained U.S. commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. military presence has been an important contributor
to security in Haiti,'' a State Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted 227-198 to approve the amendment to the defense
spending bill, which would replace the permanent force with
``periodic, noncontinuous'' troop deployments. It also would
require the president to report to Congress when ordering such
deployments.
</P>
<P>
   After passage in the House, the bill will go to a House-Senate
conference committee for coordination with a Senate defense bill
passed last month.
</P>
<P>
   Many senators have been calling for an end to the American
military presence in Haiti, including Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who
chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Those increased calls for a troop withdrawal come on the heels
of a Cox Newspapers series in March that reviewed U.S. policy in
Haiti and found that little had been accomplished after spending
more than $2 billion on aid to the tiny island nation since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Gen. Charles Wilhelm, who leads the U.S. Southern
Command, testified before Congress that troops had been unable to
create stability in Haiti and that he feared for the troops'
safety. He recommended the permanent U.S. presence be ended.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton sent 20,000 troops to Haiti in 1994 to oust a
brutal military regime and restore Jean-Bertrand Aristide as
president. Today about 500 U.S. troops remain in Haiti to build
schools and perform other humanitarian tasks at a cost of $22
million a year. But about 175 of these troops do nothing but
protect the others.
</P>
<P>
   Political violence has intensified over the last few months,
presumably related to the power vacuum sparked when President Rene
Preval shut down Parliament on Jan. 11 in a controversial move to
end a political stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Cox Newspapers reported that dozens of U.S. soldiers
in Port-au-Prince had twice been sprayed with a flurry of bullets
on April 23.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
   On June 4, a jeep being used by civilian employees of the U.S.
support group was seized and torched by protesters in downtown
Port-au-Prince.

 &HT;    HOPE BRIGHTENS FOR SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM
 &HT;    270&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hope for a solution to Social Security's financial
problems brightened slightly during a congressional hearing
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the House Ways and Means Committee agreed to hold a
closed-door meeting to seek ``common ground'' for reform, although
they expressed concern over the willingness of President Clinton
and the GOP leadership to join them if a plan emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Without reform, Social Security will not be able to pay full
benefits after 2034.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning the second day of a two-day hearing on Social Security
reform, Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, the committee chairman, offered
an impassioned plea for action this year. He warned that reform
will be almost impossible once the 2000 election season begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The options are before us now,'' Archer said. ``Now is the
time to choose. Now is the best opportunity we will ever have. ...
The American people expect this of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, the panel's ranking Democrat,
said he welcomed the prospect of negotiating in private.
</P>
<P>
   ``An executive session ... is the only way to see how much we
can accomplish as a committee ... to find out not how far apart we
are, but how close we may be,'' Rangel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've made a giant step forward, because I think a lot
of Democrats and Republicans would just as soon this didn't come
up.'' he said. Rangel expressed concern that Republican leaders may
be unwilling to push a Social Security reform plan this year.
</P>
<P>
   Archer, however, noted a letter issued Wednesday by House
Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., expressing a desire for a
bipartisan solution.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Precisely how Social Security may be reformed is still very much
in doubt. Clinton has proposed using 62 percent of the projected
federal surplus to reduce the national debt, and earmark those
savings for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous bills would use a portion of the payroll tax to create
individual retirement accounts that would offset reductions in
Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Archer and Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fla., have offered a bill to
use the federal budget surplus to finance individual retirement
accounts that would help pay for benefits. That bill has not been
endorsed by the Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw noted that under their plan Social Security benefits _
including cost-of-living-adjustments _ would not be changed and
taxes would not be raised.
</P>
<P>
   At an earlier breakfast with reporters, Shaw noted that his bill
has been attacked by the far right for not going far enough to
replace the current program with individual accounts, while
Democratic proposals to set up some private accounts have been
criticized by the far left.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is: are we going to end up as road kill?'' Shaw
said. ``Republicans will be justifiably criticized if we don't move
a bill; the Democrats will be justifiably criticized if they kill a
bill'' without offering a viable alternative.

MARY CASSATT: FORCEFUL SPIRIT IN AN AGE OF INNOCENCE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Penn., Mass., Ill.)  (fb) 
 By HOLLAND COTTER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Women should be someone and not something,'' the
American artist Mary Cassatt (1844-1926) once wrote, emphatically
underlining her words. And she dedicated a long career to fleshing
out this conviction through art.
</P>
<P>
   Her efforts come across with a quiet, though sometimes
surprisingly passionate force in ``Mary Cassatt: Modern Woman,'' a
succinct survey of her paintings and prints at the National Gallery
of Art in Washington. The show, which has appeared in Chicago and
Boston, is the first comprehensive look at Cassatt's work in nearly
30 years. And it marks yet another step in evaluating an artist who
was herself a someone _ indeed, several someones _ to be reckoned
with.
</P>
<P>
   The first book on Cassatt, published in 1913 in France where she
spent most of her adult life, carried the subtitle ``painter of
children and mothers.'' The label was accurate _ the world depicted
in Cassatt's art is, with rare exceptions, a world without men _
but it also clouded her name with perfumed associations of ``lady
painter.''
</P>
<P>
   Feminist scholarship of the past quarter century has done much
to disperse that cloud and reveal a more reality-based view of the
artist. And what has emerged is a haute bourgeoise heroine, admired
for embodying particular qualities that the late 20th century finds
admirable.
</P>
<P>
   As an artist, Cassatt was a focused professional. As a woman,
she broke vocational ground. Politically, her thinking was
progressive, in a moderate, class-bound way. She was witty,
intelligent, with no obvious signs of disruptive personal quirks.
She has even come to feel like a contemporary, which means like a
desirable dinner partner: urbane, unsentimental, reticent without
being shy.
</P>
<P>
   This view of her is, in its turn, now being inflected and
refined, but the central facts of her biography are firm. Born in
Pittsburgh to a patrician Pennsylvania family, she studied painting
in Philadelphia, then in Europe. After she settled in Paris in
1874, her sister and parents moved, lock, stock and barrel, to join
her there.
</P>
<P>
   From the very start, she had an appetite for forward-looking
styles, as the Manet-inspired paintings on Spanish themes that open
the Washington show suggest. And when she encountered the work of
Edgar Degas and the Impressionists in Paris, she knew at once that
this was the art for her.
</P>
<P>
   She soon became an insider in the Impressionist circle, both as
an artist and an advocate. Socially well connected on both sides of
the Atlantic, she served for years as adviser to a fledging
generation of American collectors, steering them toward the best
new French art, and helping to shape future American museum
collections.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she kept a certain distance from her Parisian
peers. As a genteel, unmarried woman, cafes and dance halls were
off-limits to her, and the urban demimonde was an inappropriate
subject for art. So she painted what she knew: the carefully
controlled public universe of theater matinees and drives in the
park, the intimate realm of the drawing room and the garden.
</P>
<P>
   It is that vital, if circumscribed life that dominates the first
half of the exhibition. Most of her early Paris paintings are set
in the theater. Cassatt never depicts women onstage or backstage,
or for that matter anywhere outside the precincts of the private
box. Yet within that sequestered environment, figures like that
seen in ``Woman in a Loge'' (1878) can have an extravagant dramatic
presence.
</P>
<P>
   The painting's subject, with her iridescent pink dress and
auburn-gold hair, is a high-color confection set against a mirrored
wall in which the theater itself is reflected. A Degas or a Monet
might have turned her into a scintillating blur of shadow and
light. Cassatt doesn't do so. She maintains the figure's physical
integrity, confining virtuosic brushwork to interior passages of
the dress.
</P>
<P>
   In Cassatt's hands the woman, once thought to be Cassatt's older
sister, Lydia, is a distinctive personality. She has the blooming,
unguarded, slightly gauche charm of one of Henry James' American
heiresses, those smart young women who've never been told not to
show their teeth when they smiled, who don't notice or care that
their corsages are a bit bedraggled, who feel at home wherever they
land.
</P>
<P>
   Home is, in fact, another setting for many of Cassatt's
paintings from this time. In the picture ``Tea,'' a hostess and her
guest are concluding a visit in a fashionably color-coordinated
parlor; the stripes in the wallpaper look like soft, protective
bars. In her great, innovative series of Japanese-inspired color
prints, Cassatt turns the minutiae of domestic routine _ writing a
letter, being fitted for a dress _ into a secular Book of Hours.
</P>
<P>
   She often depicts women reading. In one painting, her
bespectacled mother concentrates on Le Figaro; in another, a sitter
in an 18th-century-style dress is absorbed in a magazine. Here, as
elsewhere, women pose for her, but their lives don't stop when they
do. Maybe that's why there is so little eye contact in her
paintings. Her subjects are too busy with thoughts and activities
of their own to care that they are being observed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A decisive shift in locale from theater to home is apparent in
the late 1870s. Cassatt's career was going well after her
much-noticed public debut in the 1879 Impressionist exhibition. But
Lydia had been diagnosed with kidney disease; Cassatt was devoting
most of her time to her sister and tenderly recording her decline.
</P>
<P>
   These portraits of Lydia, which have been grouped together by
the curator of the show in Washington, Nicolai Cikovsky Jr., are
often set outdoors, in a garden or park. In one of them, Lydia sits
on a bench crocheting. Her sallow face is protected by a lace
bonnet as frilly as a christening gown, but she stares anxiously at
her hands, as if she had just pricked her finger.
</P>
<P>
   In the painting ``Autumn,'' her face is again closely, almost
clinically observed, though her body is wrapped in a vivacious
foliage-colored shawl, a little miracle of free-form hatching in
which Cassatt demonstrates her Impressionist credentials. And in an
oil sketch done not long before her death in 1882, Lydia sits at a
distance from us, dressed in white, her features undefined, as if
she were merging with the parkland around her.
</P>
<P>
   After this period, Cassatt's attitudetoward art gradually
changed; she seemed to want more from it, or at least something
new. All along she had been a funny sort of French Impressionist,
often barely one at all. Degas was a central influence on her work,
and a friend for over 40 years. But she always referred to herself
as an American artist, and that's really what she was.
</P>
<P>
   Her figures, no matter what kind of painterly fireworks are
exploding around them, are as materially solid and specific as any
of John Singleton Copley's colonial portraits. Cassatt was a modern
painter the way Winslow Homer or Thomas Eakins (another
Philadelphian and born the same year) were modern painters, a
realist for whom realism came to imply something psychologically,
even spiritually expansive.
</P>
<P>
   All of this grows increasingly evident in her work from the late
1880s onward. Like many women of the era, she became interested in
spiritualism, with its quasi-scientific belief in a network of
concrete links between nature, people _ especially women and
children _ and the divine. And the figures in her paintings became
both more precisely defined and more emblematic.
</P>
<P>
   This trend was exemplified in the mural, now lost or destroyed,
that she created on commission for the Woman's Building at the
World's Columbian Exhibition in Chicago in 1893. Titled ``Modern
Woman,'' it was executed in a crisp, realist style, though its
central scene of nine female figures of various ages gathered in an
orchard and ritualistically harvesting the Fruits of Knowledge was
almost purely allegorical.
</P>
<P>
   Cassatt's mother died in 1895, and the artist was devastated.
Around that time, she turned her full attention to maternal images,
producing some of her most original work. A few images stick to a
symbolic mode. ``The Family,'' with its trio of mother, child and
mesmerized adolescent girl, echoes Italian Renaissance icons of the
mystical marriage of Saint Catherine. But other paintings project a
peculiarly claustrophobic, fleshy heat.
</P>
<P>
   In one, a women wears a rose-patterned dress that looks
blood-spattered; her drowsy, heavy child touches her face in a
chin-chucking gesture that has ancient erotic implications. In the
color print ``The Kiss,'' mother and baby are locked in a clinch
like lovers. In the 1896 ``Maternal Caress,'' a fat-cheeked infant
grasps a woman's face with ferocious concentration, as if about to
devour her.
</P>
<P>
   In a late painting, ``The Mirror'' (circa 1905), near the end of
the exhibition, many strands come together. Here the mother,
dressed in shades of yellow with a huge sunflower corsage, is as
exaggeratedly decorative a presence as the young woman in the
theater loge was 25 years earlier. She supports a nude,
post-toddler-age child on her lap. Together they hold up and
contemplate a small hand mirror.
</P>
<P>
   The vignette isn't simple. The sunflower is an emblem of
fecundity. The mirror (there was one behind the woman in the loge
too) is a time-honored symbol of vanity and vanitas, self-love and
loss. And the mother, with watchful detachment, seems to be
imparting a lesson to her child, whose reflected face looks
directly but tentatively out at us as if to say, ``I am a someone,
and so are you.''
</P>
<P>
   Cassatt learned this lesson in self-regard, one suspects, many
times in her life, and in ways that have yet to be fully explored
and appreciated. And it is that sense of continuing discovery _
both hers and ours _ that draw us back to her deceptively
undemonstrative art. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary Cassatt: Modern Woman'' remains at the National Gallery
of Art, Fourth Street at Constitution Avenue, NW, Washington,
through Sept. 6. The exhibition was organized by the Art Institute
of Chicago in collaboration with the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston,
and the National Gallery of Art. The show is sponsored by Aetna.  &QL;

 &HT;    GRAHAM PROPOSES PREVENTIVE CARE COVERAGE UNDER MEDICARE
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A bill to expand Medicare coverage of preventive
health care was introduced Thursday by Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's plan would expand Medicare coverage to three new areas:
annual screenings for hypertension and glaucoma, counseling for
tobacco cessation and hormone replacement therapy to reduce
osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Graham would provide Medicare coverage of
prescription drugs for conditions related to those preventive
areas. Currently, Medicare does not cover outpatient prescription
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   To keep Medicare's preventive benefits current, Graham
recommended a process that would require Congress to vote every
five years on a package of preventive benefit reforms that would be
recommended by the Institute of Medicine, part of the National
Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's bill also would earmark $100 million for research by
the National Institute of Aging on delaying the onset of
age-related impairments and $25 million for research related to
increasing the use and delivery of preventive benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Graham estimated his bill would cost up to $6 billion over five
years. He said that could be paid out of any money the federal
government might receive as a result of its planned suit against
tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Graham said, Medicare ought to be reformed by
looking first at what benefits should be provided rather than at
how to finance the program.

 NEON HAS LOST ITS `HI' PROFILE t   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Neon hit the ground running in 1994, its cheerful face
bearing the promise of fun times in a serious world.
</P>
<P>
   A youthful car designed for young people, the Dodge and Plymouth
Neon was another solid hit for Chrysler, which was awash in kudos
for everything from groundbreaking cab-forward sedans to
ground-pounding Viper sports cars.
</P>
<P>
   As well as being attractive to look at, the diminutive Neon
proved to be relatively roomy inside and drove with spunk. It was
noisy, though, and some complained about its rough ride and darty
road manners.
</P>
<P>
   And Neon never fulfilled its promise to be a reliable member of
the family, suffering from a number of shortcomings in build
quality and durability, and earning low grades in ``Consumer
Report''s' reliability ratings.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Neon's star has been fading in comparison with
such miniscule stalwarts as Honda Civic, still the undisputed
segment leader; Chevrolet Cavalier; Ford Escort; VW Golf; and
Saturn.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 Neon has been redesigned fore and aft to eliminate some
problems. Gone is the noise and roughness, and, hopefully, the
spotty repair record. But also gone is much of the charm and
character that made the Neon such a standout among subcompacts.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler has traded in Neon's quirky attitude for a shot of
refinement, a homogenizing process that certainly has improved the
little critter, but at the cost of its perky originality. It's
longer, wider and more substantial in nearly every way, but the
styling is fairly generic, easily mistaken for Honda.
</P>
<P>
   Its placidly bland face is very unlike the animated friendliness
of the previous version, and unlikely to be seen going ``Hi'' on
any billboards.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, once inside and headed down the road, it's easy to
forget that style and personality have been sacrificed for a more
grown-up car. Neon is no longer just kid stuff designed to attract
young people into buying their first vehicle from Chrysler (and
presumably becoming lifelong customers) but a fully formed small
car meant for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   The ride is much improved, more supple and refined, but still
with the quick steering that make the old model so much fun to rip
into the turns. The engine is still somewhat boomy, but not too bad
and definitely improved.
</P>
<P>
   The tester was equipped with a five-speed, which in my humble
opinion is the way to go in a small car with a four-cylinder
engine. Shifting felt smooth and direct, and acceleration is brisk.
The engine revs up to a high 6,500 redline, but just gets noisy and
hostile when pushed up there and obviously prefers to be shifted
sooner.
</P>
<P>
   The previously optional 150-horsepower engine seems to have
disappeared, but I'll wager that it comes back.
</P>
<P>
   The model designations and optional equipment are a complex
matter that takes some figuring. All I know is that our ES test car
included upgrades such as a nicer interior, a tachometer, fog
lamps, 15-inch wheels instead of 14, and some other convenience and
cosmetic upgrades, part of a $2,635 package. A combination package
of anti-lock brakes and traction control cost $740, and aluminum
wheels added another $355.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the Neon still exhibits the jewel-like quality of its
former self, our red ES test car looking quite snappy in the
driveway and standing out in traffic. The body is rattle-free and
feels tight as a drum.
</P>
<P>
   The body style looks somewhat like a smaller Dodge Stratus from
the side, with well-integrated full-frame doors and a nicely shaped
roof line. The front end looks nice, just not very distinctive, and
the rear has the sculpted, concave look of some of Chrysler's
bigger sedans.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, there's no coupe, for those who prefer a sportier small
car. Too bad.
</P>
<P>
   The interior does feel roomy, and the dashboard is functional
and interesting to look at, with a sharp-looking instrument panel
and trendy white-faced gauges.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is something about this interior that is
decidedly weird, and that's the windows. For front passengers,
they're standard electric windows, but in the back, they're manual
crank windows. This is a configuration that I've never seen before,
and which I find bizarre and mystifying.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sure somebody at Chrysler had this bright idea to save a few
bucks on each car, but it's a classic case of penny-wise and
pound-foolish. No one is going to favor this setup.
</P>
<P>
   But all told, Neon has grown up, turning into a nice, all-around
car, competing well in this high-volume segment, and offering some
decent accommodations at a budget price.
</P>
<P>
   But it has gone from distinctive to mainstream. Something lost,
something gained. Just don't expect it to say ``Hi.'' &QL;

 &HT;    WITNESSES TELL CONGRESS TO KEEP TITLE I FOR POOR CHILDREN
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government's biggest educational
program for poor children should be continued despite its
shortcomings, a wide array of witnesses told Congress on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``Title I'' because it is the first program in the
Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the $8 billion-a-year
program will expire unless the act is renewed within the next 15
months. More than 45,000 public and private schools with high
numbers of poor children use Title I funds for programs that range
from extra tutoring to computer-based instruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be reauthorized; the only question is what can be done
to improve it,'' said Chairman William Goodling, R-Pa., after his
House Committee on Education and the Workforce heard testimony from
skeptical state officials and enthusiastic representatives of
public-school teacher unions and the U.S. Catholic bishops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Title I has been a colossal failure,'' testified Roan
Garcia-Quintana, director of Title I programs for the Georgia
Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   ``No discernible difference could be found (by a massive study
in 1997) between children who received Title I services and
children of equivalent backgrounds who did not participate in the
program,'' Garcia-Quintana said. ``But I don't want Congress to
dump Title I. I want them to overhaul it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Chase, president of the National Education Association, was
less downbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Improvement has been insufficient, but it's there,'' said
Chase, who cited other studies and contended that changes made in
1994 will continue to increase the program's accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NEA opposes any efforts to alter significantly the
structure or direction of Title I,'' Chase said.
</P>
<P>
   The witnesses cold-shouldered many of the Clinton
administration's suggestions for imposing new, detailed
requirements on schools that accept Title I funds.
</P>
<P>
   States should be able to spend Title I funds any way they want
as long as they can show that they are improving the academic
performance of disadvantaged children, said Garcia-Quintana and
Cheri Pierson Yecke, Virginia's deputy secretary of education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're willing to step forward and accept the responsibility
for improving student achievement,'' Yecke said. ``All we ask is
the flexibility to use our funds as we see fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Randi Weingarten, vice president of the American Federation of
Teachers, and Chase liked Clinton's suggestion for tougher
standards for new teachers. But they were leery of his proposal
that the federal government require two years of college for any
aide whose duties include such instructional activity as one-on-one
tutoring.
</P>
<P>
   While about one-third of aides want to go on to become teachers,
two-thirds aren't interested in education other than vocational
training for their current job, Weingarten said.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying on behalf of the Catholic bishops, John Clark said,
``We also believe that the existing law addresses instructional
aides in an adequate fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   As the witnesses filed out of the hearing room, Goodling said,
``I thought some of them should have been a little more forthcoming
in talking about the failures of Title I. There have been a lot of
failures.''

JAPANESE YET NOT JAPANESE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On April 15, when most Americans were preoccupied with taxes,
more than 400 citizens of Nagoya, Japan, were lining up to be the
first to enter their city's new museum, the Nagoya/Boston Museum of
Fine Arts.
</P>
<P>
   In a novel arrangement, Nagoya has built a contemporary,
flexible museum space and is paying the Boston museum each year to
borrow works of art that curators of the two museums choose to show
for limited periods.
</P>
<P>
   One might have guessed the Japanese were lining up to see the
Boston museum's collection of Impressionists, which filled one
floor of the Nagoya museum, or its superb collection of
antiquities, also on loan.
</P>
<P>
   But many were on their way to study an early 17th-century
Japanese screen that had been in Boston for a century and would be
on loan only until early June.
</P>
<P>
   The six-panel screen, ``European King and Members of his
Court,'' was shown in its own room. The figures portrayed are
Western nobles in elaborate court dress in brilliant oranges and
reds.
</P>
<P>
   The men have beards and curly hair but their faces do not look
totally Western. The details are convincingly painted, but the work
looks odd; for one thing, none of the figures relate to each other.
They look like a parade of paper dolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This screen is highly unusual because it depicts Westerners
and was done under the influence of Western painting,'' said Anne
Nishimura Morse, associate curator of Asiatic art at the Boston
museum. ``But it was painted by Japanese. And they were not using
standard Japanese techniques.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese painters may have copied the figures from books
brought to Japan from Europe, Mrs. Morse explained, adding that by
the 1580s, the Jesuits had founded a painting school in Japan.
Jesuit missionaries arrived in Japan as early as 1549, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The screen shown in Nagoya is an example of Nanban, a work of
art created by Japanese that either imitates a Western form, like a
trunk, or is decorated with Western subject matter, like European
sailors. ``Nanban'' means ``southern barbarians,'' because
foreigners approached Japan from the south.
</P>
<P>
   Nanban art is a collecting specialty all its own. There are
museums of Nanban art in both Osaka and Kobe, Japan, and New York
City dealers like Leighton Longhi and Naga Antiques, which
specialize in Japanese art and antiques, usually have several
examples for sale at any given time. Nanban art even has its own
section in the catalog of Christie's London sale of ``Japanese Art
and Design,'' scheduled for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the Christie's sale is a huge lacquer chest with
elaborate shell inlay depicting rabbits, deer, turtles and an ox in
panels bordered in metal studwork.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hinton, director of the Japanese department at Christie's
London, said that the studs had no purpose. In copying a leather
trunk from Portugal, the Japanese put studs in the spots where they
would have anchored the leather pieces on the original trunk. The
trunk is a good example of how the Japanese borrowed a form, then
used their own materials and artistry. The piece is estimated to
sell for $65,000 to $81,000.
</P>
<P>
   Another lot consists of five tea bowls and saucers from the Edo
period designed with gold lacquer on a black ground. Again, the
saucers show a strong European influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Note the wide flat rim,'' Hinton said. ``It's not Japanese.
Sets like this from the 1680s are comparatively rare, though some
have been found in the inventories of English country houses like
Burghley House in Lincolnshire.'' Its estimate is $3,300 to $4,800.
</P>
<P>
   Nanban art reveals how Japanese artists reacted to Westerners on
first contact.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike China, which had periodic influxes of Islamic peoples for
2000 years, Japan was relatively isolated until the 1500s. It had
never been defeated at war and was not at all threatened by the
first Portuguese traders who arrived in 1541.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese were fascinated by foreign things,'' Longhi, the
New York dealer, said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the Portuguese and then the Dutch established trading ties.
Then Portuguese missionaries arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Christianity spread very rapidly in Japan, according to Shinichi
Tani, a professor who contributed to a catalog for a Nanban art
show at the Japan Society in 1972. By 1582 the number of Japanese
that had embraced Christianity had risen to 150,000, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese banned the practice of the Christian faith in 1613.
Nonetheless, the professor wrote, ``interest in European culture
was enhanced, and to some extent European manners and customs were
gradually absorbed into the life of the rulers, the local feudal
lords and the well-to-do. Thus a body of artists was gradually
created who expressed themselves in a European manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Nanban art appears in various media. The best examples are
folding Japanese screens that depict Portuguese galleons in detail.
Often the foreign ship is shown entering a Japanese port, with
welcoming dignitaries on shore.
</P>
<P>
   The Portuguese captains are usually tall and have long noses and
scraggly beards, and the crew typically includes a few African
sailors. The missionaries wear habits. Frequently the foreigners
have pale blue eyes and seem to be looking toward the sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Large quantities of these screens were made in the late 16th
century, when they became popular among the merchant class,'' said
James Marinaccio, of Naga Antiques in Manhattan. ``It was a time of
prosperity, and the merchants were furnishing their mansions.''
</P>
<P>
   Longhi said that Nanban screens were now fairly rare. He is
selling one that shows Japanese people greeting a black Portuguese
sailing ship docked at a Japanese port. On shore are an odd-looking
elephant and a tiger, neither of which was painted from life; they
look like Booth cartoons. There are Christian priests on the boat
and on shore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese exaggerated the physiognomy of Western people
because they weren't used to their pointed noses and long chins,''
Longhi said. ``They had to translate the idea that they were
foreigners.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese were also taken with Western dress, he said. ``Part
of the exoticism is in the Westerners' outfits,'' he said. ``The
Japanese adopted Western pantaloons in the early 17th century just
as they have American blue jeans in this century.''
</P>
<P>
   The screen is in excellent condition. Its price is $450,000.
</P>
<P>
   People have long speculated about why the Japanese embraced the
West so quickly in the 1860s, after Admiral Perry sailed in.
Perhaps they had never stopped thinking about Westerners, even
after the Tokagawa regime closed the borders in 1639.
</P>
<P>
   As Longhi said, ``Once you put ideas in someone's head, you
can't stop ideas by edict.''

A YOUNG BOY'S BATTLE WITH AIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By JON WERTHEIMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most beautiful sights you'll see on television this
month is the face of Travis Jeffries. All the joy of youth, and
some of the wisdom of age, glows from his 200-watt eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Travis, who was born with AIDS, lives in the Highbridge section
of the Bronx. In 1995, when Travis was 7, the filmmaker Richard
Kotuk began compiling his portrait, never knowing if this child
would survive. But the loving attention of his family, principally
his heroic grandmother, and of his unflinching medical team never
flagged.
</P>
<P>
   Travis thrives today. Kotuk died last year, shortly after
completing the hourlong documentary called simply ``Travis.'' It is
to be broadcast Friday night on WNET, Channel 13, as the first
installment of ``Reel New York,'' an eight-week series of films by
independent artists working in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Travis'' manages to distill this plague to the dimensions of
one life. And it demonstrates the power of that one life to affect
a hundred others.
</P>
<P>
   The film opens with Travis looking right into the camera and
saying: ``I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die.'' And a moment later: ``I
don't wanna die. D'you?'' If that doesn't get your attention, flip
back to the ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Travis himself, there are two other major figures in the
film. One is his grandmother, Geneva Jeffries, who has 11 children,
33 grandchildren and 7 great-grandchildren. She has spent a
lifetime as a domestic, tending to other families' needs. Now she
tends to Travis, after winning his custody from his mother, her
daughter Samantha, a drug abuser.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a hurting feeling, to see your child in misery,'' Mrs.
Jeffries says during one of Travis' setbacks. But she adds: ``You
want me to be sorry for myself? I'm not going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   She speaks directly to Kotuk, the narrator and off-screen
interviewer and the film's other big presence. Although unseen, he
frames people with his questions. When he asks Travis, who
understands that he inherited his disease, if he is angry at his
mother, the boy replies seriously: ``Why should I be mad at Mommy?
It's not her fault.''
</P>
<P>
   This from a boy who has taken more than 275 different drugs,
some of which prevented him from eating solid food for most of his
life. When the film ends with a scene of Travis, feeling well at
last, happily chomping his lunch in a restaurant, that moment is a
monument to hope.
</P>
<P>
   A postscript added last month reports that Samantha has
completed a rehabilitation program and has started a job, Mrs.
Jeffries has terminal cancer, and other family members are caring
for Travis. You may be moved to pray for them all. &QL;

   EDDIE IZZARD &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `Dress to Kill' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HBO, Saturday night at 11:30 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you notice about the British comic Eddie Izzard
_ after you notice that he's wearing high heels, blue nail polish
and lots of plum-colored lipstick _ is how smart he is. His
interests range from ancient history to society's latest offenses,
and his mind leaps from one to another in an
extreme-of-consciousness monologue.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few minutes he can hopscotch among topics including Pol
Pot, squirrels, gun control, ``Scooby Doo,'' perjury and the
Austro-Hungarian Empire.
</P>
<P>
   Izzard calls himself an ``executive transvestite,'' as opposed
to the weirdo kind. Many New Yorkers, executives and weirdos alike,
are still chuckling over his March 1998 visit with his
two-and-a-half-hour one-man show, ``Dress to Kill.''
</P>
<P>
   HBO's version, edited to 90 minutes, was taped in San Francisco
in September. He can be a bit offensive here and there. Mostly he's
hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   Grappling with the concept of original sin, he wonders what sort
is original? ``I poked a badger with a spoon.'' That's an original
sin, he declares, then decides that the penance for it must be
``say three Hail Marys and two Hello Dollys.''
</P>
<P>
   Izzard enjoys chiding Americans' ignorance. They don't remember
their own national anthem: ``The words are a bit fuzzy in the
middle.'' Nor do they remember their own national history. After
mentioning General Lafayette, he slyly admonishes: ``You don't know
who he is, do you? What is it? The Spanish-American War? The French
Banana War? What?''
</P>
<P>
   It's Izzard's war on pretense. Pretense loses. Viewers win. &QL;

HOME VIDEO: MARY PICKFORD; NEW RELEASES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mary Pickford, Power Broker
</P>
<P>
   She was ``America's sweetheart,'' all right, but under those
golden curls Mary Pickford, often cast as the tragic waif, had one
of the hardest heads in Hollywood. ``By 1914 or 1915, she was
pulling the strings, making the rules,'' said Elaina Archer, the
manager of the Mary Pickford Library in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   With Dennis Doros of Milestone Films, a New York distributor,
Ms. Archer helped choose six Pickford films for video release, five
of them for the first time on tape.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best known of these is ``Stella Maris'' (1918), in
which Pickford plays Unity Blake, a homely and much abused servant,
and Stella Maris, a gloriously radiant rich girl who, because she
is paralyzed, has been so sheltered from the woes of the world that
she reaches young womanhood unaware of things like war and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, Pickford was acquainted with the latter condition,
having at the age of 8 or so become a principal provider for a
theatrical family that was virtually destitute. In those days,
Pickford, who was born Gladys Louise Smith in 1893, developed a
kindly but tough Irish personality that, as ``adorable'' as she
was, found expression in roles as provider and aggressive champion
of the downtrodden.
</P>
<P>
   An example is ``Tess of the Storm Country'' (1922), one of the
six Milestone films, in which Pickford battles for the rights of a
group of squatters threatened by the rich man on the hill. ``Tess
is parallel to Mary as a person,'' Ms. Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Sparrows'' (1926), another Milestone release, she is Mama
Mollie, the oldest of a group of exploited children whom she leads
to freedom through the swamps. Two other films, ``Daddy-Long-Legs''
(1919) and ``My Best Girl'' (1927) cast her as, respectively, the
oldest child in an orphanage and a lowly shop clerk who falls for
the boss' son. ``Amarilly of Clothes-Line Alley'' (1918), the sixth
film, is set in an Irish tenement neighborhood in San Francisco and
celebrates Pickford's Irish roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was buying rights to the stories and hiring women to write
them,'' Ms. Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   As Little Mary in 1909, Pickford made $40 a week at the Biograph
Co. By 1916 she was making $10,000 a week. Later it was a million
dollars a year. In 1919, at age 26, she began United Artists with
Charlie Chaplin, D.W. Griffith and her husband, Douglas Fairbanks.
By then she had long chosen her own films and roles. ``There came a
point when Mary became powerful enough to hire her own directors,
casts, crews, everyone,'' Ms. Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually her career dried up in the 1930s when she turned 40,
in those days the death knell for a woman on screen, and didn't
fare that well in the talkies. She always drove a hard bargain.
Samuel Goldwyn said it took longer to negotiate a Pickford contract
than to make one of her films. ``She was generous,'' Ms. Archer
said, ``but she came from a hard background and she wasn't going to
be pushed around.''
</P>
<P>
   The tapes are $29.95 each or $124.95 for the set. Information:
(800) 603-1104.
</P>
<P>
   NEW VIDEO RELEASES
</P>
<P>
   ``Dancing at Lughnasa''
</P>
<P>
   As Kate Mundy, one of five unmarried sisters in a remote Irish
village in 1936, Meryl Streep turns even the simple act of peering
out a window into a haunting expression of loneliness. Without much
overarching action, Pat O'Connor's film, based on the play by Brian
Friel, becomes a collection of personal sea changes and splendidly
realized small moments among the women (Catherine McCormack, Kathy
Burke, Brid Brennan and Sophie Thompson are the other sisters).
Returning from his missionary's post in Africa, their brother,
Father Jack (Michael Gambon), offers a wider perspective, as does
Gerry (Rhys Ifans), the youngest sister Christina's boyfriend. As
he did in ``Circle of Friends,'' O'Connor, Janet Maslin wrote in
The New York Times, ``creates a quintessentially Irish
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   1998. Columbia Tri-Star. $99.36. 92 minutes. Closed captioned.
PG. Release date: June 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enemy of the State''
</P>
<P>
   Unwittingly stuck with a videotape showing the murder of a
congressman, the straight-shooting lawyer Robert Clayton Dean (Will
Smith) runs for his life. Seems the killing is tied to a scheme
hatched by a National Security Agency higher-up (Jon Voight) to
wire the entire country for surveillance. As it stands already, the
agency has Dean wired right down to his trousers, which he has to
get rid off at high speed if he's to shed his pursuers. With its
snazzy equipment and wild chases, Tony Scott's film keeps ``the
story moving faster than the speed of scrutiny'' (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   1998. Touchstone. $107.77. 127 minutes. Closed captioned. R.
Release date: June 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Faculty''
</P>
<P>
   An alien being takes over Herrington High School, turning its
faculty and student body into murderous zombies (which in most
cases is a distinct improvement). Only a small group of students,
all of them either very cool or very nerdy, are left to battle the
thing long enough to stab it to death with a syringe. Josh Hartnett
is the coolest as Zeke, who peddles condoms but has a feel for
science. Anyway, the performances are the thing in a sly if
mediocre sci-fi horror film that, like Frankenstein, ``plunders the
crypts of cinema for its body parts'' (Lawrence Van Gelder).
</P>
<P>
   1998. Dimension. $106.77. 102 minutes. Closed captioned. R.
Release date: June 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theory of Flight''
</P>
<P>
   Dying of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease),
the feisty Jane (Helena Bonham Carter) talks dirty and spends her
spare time watching hard-core pornography. Eager to lose her
virginity, she gets the help of Richard (Kenneth Branagh), a failed
painter who builds primitive flying machines. Richard, though,
never is more than an allegorical construction in a film that
``might be described as a disease-of-the-week movie with comic and
mythic pretensions'' (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   1998. New Line. $104.16. 99 minutes. Closed captioned. R.
</P>
<P>
   Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a
theater release at one time, appeared on television or been on
videocassette in earlier editions.
</P>
<P>
   ``FROM EARTH TO THE MOON.'' The 12-hour mini-series tracing the
Apollo project has been on DVD since November, and now is available
on videotape. Tom Hanks conceived the show, wrote part of it and
acted in one segment. And quite a show it is, having been nominated
for 17 Emmy Awards. 1998. HBO $89.92, six cassettes. 720 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``UN AIR DE FAMILLE.'' A wishfully jolly family birthday party
gradually turns acidic in Cedric Klapisch's film, which began as a
play and won Cesars (French Oscars) for its writers, Agnes Jaoui
and Jean-Pierre Bacri, and two of its actors, Jean-Pierre Darrousin
and Catherine Frot. Gathered in the family's restaurant, six
relatives, ruled over by a proper and quite awful bourgeois mother
(Claire Maurier), spar drolly at first but grow steadily more
contentious during an encounter that eventually levels everybody in
sight. Klapisch's film expertly frees the one-set play from visual
claustrophobia and has the same cast that performed the work
onstage, which is why, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times,
``they work so artfully as an ensemble and so evidently know their
characters inside out.'' 1998. Fox Lorber. 105 minutes. French with
English subtitles. No rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``BEHIND THE SCENES.'' Jazz percussionist and composer Max Roach
and photographer Carrie Mae Weems explain their art to children
(adults are welcome) in the PBS series. 1999. First Run Features.
$14.95 each. 30 minutes each. Information: (800) 488-6652. &QL;

`THE RED VIOLIN': THAT OLD FIDDLE SURE GOT AROUND 
</HEADLINE>
  (editors: production notes at end of review) 
 (bl)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A film score can artistically make or break a movie, especially
one _ like ``The Red Violin'' _ that aspires to a
loftier-than-average cultural tone.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the music swells in this extravagant time-traveling
costume drama tracing the 300-year life of a priceless hand-crafted
violin, ``The Red Violin'' begins to assume the intense emotional
colors of John Corigliano's ravishing score.
</P>
<P>
   As Joshua Bell's solo violin pirouettes above the churning
orchestrations, played by the London Philharmonia Orchestra under
Esa-Pekka Salonen, the actors' expressions begin to seem profound,
and an atmosphere of romantic exaltation co-opts the blunt,
flat-footed dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   But then the music subsides, and the movie clatters back down to
earth.
</P>
<P>
   For ``The Red Violin,'' directed by Francois Girard, who wrote
the screenplay with Don McKellar, is something coarser than its
music would have us believe. The story, which jumps around in time
and place, belongs to the Thousand-and-One-Nights genre of fanciful
yarn-spinning.
</P>
<P>
   Each episode is a gaudy historical tableau illustrating a
particular society's relationship to European classical music. Over
the course of three centuries, the violin makes its way from
17th-century Italy (Cremona) to 18th-century Austria (Vienna) to a
tribe of mountain-dwelling gypsies, to 19th-century England
(Oxford) to Communist China (Shanghai) and finally to contemporary
Canada (Montreal).
</P>
<P>
   To give the story a final fillip of suspense, Charles Morritz
(Samuel L. Jackson, badly miscast), a rude, unscrupulous New
York-based violin restorer, plays a high-stakes cat-and-mouse game
with the Montreal auction house that has hired him to restore the
instrument. He has discovered that it is the legendary ``red
violin,'' made in 1681 by the fictional Nicolo Bussotti (Carlo
Cecchi).
</P>
<P>
   The yarn begins at an auction in present-day Montreal where we
watch the sale of a Stradivarius violin for nearly $2 million. Next
up on the block is the newly restored red violin, which arrived at
the auction house in a shipment of goods from China. As the bidding
gets under way, the movie flashes back to late 17th-century Italy
where we see the instrument being ``born'' in the workshop of
Bussotti, a bullying master craftsman. We also meet his extremely
pregnant wife, Anna (Irene Grazioli), and Cesca (Anita Laurenzi),
the eagle-eyed old servant who, on the eve of Anna's giving birth,
insists on reading her employer's tarot cards.
</P>
<P>
   The story is structured around Cesca's turning up of the cards
one by one. Her enigmatic interpretation of each card predicts an
episode not in the life of Anna or the son she hopes to bear but of
the special, perfect violin Bussotti has made.
</P>
<P>
   The movie revels in cliches. One of the violin's first owners,
Kaspar Weiss (Christoph Koncz), is an angelic prodigy who cuddles
it in bed like a teddy bear and faints dead away (literally) during
an audition.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's giddiest set piece observes the silly romantic
posturings of England's greatest violinist, Frederick Pope (Jason
Flemyng), who suggests a flouncing hybrid of Liszt, Paganini and
Byron, and his George Sand-like lover, Victoria (Greta Scacchi).
One scene, in which Victoria awkwardly slavers over Frederick's
half-clothed body while he plays, is unintentionally farcical.
</P>
<P>
   Scenes set in Shanghai during Mao Tse-tung's Cultural
Revolution, in which Western cultural artifacts are tossed into a
bonfire, also come off as cartoonish distillations of history. And
when the movie isn't dishing out this sort of instant history, it
spends too much energy bending the narrative to create teasing
little plot twists that aren't worth the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Violin'' wants to make a grand statement about the
mystical power (both celestial and demonic) of great music. But
give or take some scattered musical moments, the frame in which
that message is couched is too kitschy to let that vision catch
fire.

`JUST A LITTLE HARMLESS SEX': FALLOUT WHEN MARS AND VENUS COLLIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those who can't get enough of the romantic and sexual
travails of 20- and 30-somethings in the customary half-hour
television sitcom format, the super-size version has arrived under
the title ``Just a Little Harmless Sex.''
</P>
<P>
   It is well cast, well acted and thoroughly inconsequential.
</P>
<P>
   But it has a gimmick.
</P>
<P>
   In the first two-thirds of the film, according to its publicity,
the buddy talk was written by a man and the girl talk by a woman.
When the sexes finally come together for the finale, the writers _
Roger Mills and Marti Noxon _ collaborated.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Rick Rosenthal, whose credits include ``Bad Boys''
and ``Russkies,'' this prosaic romantic comedy hangs off a sexual
misadventure involving Alan (Robert Mailhouse), as he is driving
home to his wife in a downpour after a night at a topless bar with
his buddies, Danny (Jonathan Silverman) and Brent (William
Ragsdale).
</P>
<P>
   Spying a young woman drenched beside her disabled sports car, he
gives her a lift and she promptly gives him oral sex. In a moment
they are surrounded by police cars. The damsel in distress turns
out to be a prostitute. Alan's wife, Laura (Alison Eastwood, Clint
Eastwood's daughter), is informed of his arrest and asked to post
bail, and Alan's marriage is fractured.
</P>
<P>
   Most of ``Just a Little Harmless Sex'' cuts back and forth
between the remorseful Alan and his friends and Laura and her
friends discussing this crisis and exchanging confidences,
including their own problems with relationships and sex.
</P>
<P>
   Danny, an opportunistic lawyer, is angrily separated from his
wife, the nonorgasmic Terrianne (Jessica Lundy), who is one of
Laura's friends and who is convinced he cheated on her. Brent, a
sportswriter, has no girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Terrianne, Laura's best friend is the seemingly mousy
Allison (Kimberly Williams) who turns out to be nothing of the sort
once she sheds her eyeglasses, dons black, has a few drinks and
starts dancing at the HiJinx, the club where everybody eventually
winds up.
</P>
<P>
   And on the fringes of all the angst is Laura's mother, Elaine
(Lauren Hutton), playing a latter-day Mrs. Robinson as she dazzles
all the overgrown adolescent males with her knowing, indulgent
smiles; her overwhelming self-confidence and her unabashed
flirtatiousness.
</P>
<P>
   But on the big screen, ``Just a Little Harmless Sex'' looks like
just a little more television.
</P>
<P>

POLICE CHIEF DEFIES GUN RULE AT SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANITA WADHWANI  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The San Francisco police chief defied a school
board vote to restrict the authority of police officers to carry
weapons on school campuses, saying that only he will decide whether
to ``arm or disarm'' officers.
</P>
<P>
   The rule was part of the ``Safe Schools'' package approved by
the San Francisco Unified School District board Tuesday night. The
measure also requires school staff members to contact
administrators before calling the police when there is a problem
with a student, unless the pupil has broken the law or poses a
threat.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Fred Lau, with the backing of Mayor Willie Brown,
said Wednesday he asked the city attorney to look into the legality
of the school district resolution.
</P>
<P>
   School board members and civil rights activists, meanwhile,
stood their ground, saying the policy was appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been unfairly portrayed as something that limits
police presence on campus and endangers students,'' said Renee
Saucedo, a lawyer with La Raza Centro Legal, which supported the
school board measure. ``But if you read the resolution, it becomes
clear that the reason for it is to protect the civil rights of
students.''
</P>
<P>
   La Raza Centro Legal, a San Francisco public interest law firm,
began advocating such a measure when it started seeing clients as
young as 12 who said they were hauled before police officers in
their schools over routine disciplinary matters. The students,
Saucedo alleged, were disproportionately black and Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   School board member Steve Phillips, who proposed the resolution,
said: ``The issue is systemic. If we disproportionately
discriminate against African-American children in our schools, then
that would extend to police officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said the purpose of the gun restriction was ``to set up
guidelines so that staff don't call the police in situations where
their presence is just not appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lau said his department's 50-year-old school programs are
popular with students, teachers and the police and have earned
national recognition. Posting officers at many campuses in the city
is just one aspect of the Police Department's campus programs.
</P>
<P>
   Officers also take students on fishing and camping trips, among
other activities, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our officers describe these jobs as being a family and
community responsibility,'' Lau said. ``If there are any
allegations of mistreatment of students, then they have not been
brought to my attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Lau pledged to move forward with plans to place more additional
officers in high schools. The mayor included money for the
personnel in the city budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``The safety of our schools is paramount,'' said Ron Vincent, a
spokesman for the mayor. ``We stand firmly behind the San Francisco
Police Department on this.''
</P>
<P>
   The California Teachers Association did not take a formal
position on the resolution. However, the union's local president,
Ken Mitchell, voiced concern that the new reporting procedures
might conflict with the California Education Code mandate that
teachers report all violent incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We support any effort to create safe environments for teachers
and students, but teachers must be able to report violent incidents
to police,'' Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. James Dudley of the Police Department's juvenile division
had urged the school board not to vote on the measure until the
police had a chance to review it.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote on the ``Safe Schools'' measure, Dudley
criticized the decision, saying it would keep officers in the dark
about potential acts of violence or troubled youths. He also said
the district didn't have the authority to govern police practices
on school grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they refuse to have us on campus with guns, I don't know
who that will benefit,'' Dudley said.

AT THE MOVIES: `MAGNOLIA' SECRECY; RARE HOLLYWOOD EPIC; HOPE FROM
`STAR WARS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Look Who's Not Talking
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ April Grace is understandably thrilled at getting
the biggest break in her acting career, a part opposite Tom Cruise
in the movie ``Magnolia,'' and she expresses delight at being able
to talk with a reporter about her breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   What part does she play? ``I'm not supposed to say that,'' Ms.
Grace said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, what kind of character is it? ``I can't really answer
that, either,'' she said, smiling awkwardly, ``other than to say
she's a really intense woman.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so what was it like working with Cruise?
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll have to ask the studio,'' said Ms. Grace, clearly eager
to share but feeling constrained. ``But I can tell you it was a
great experience. It was a great group of people to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   Some filmmakers court publicity with a maddening persistence,
and then there are those whose movies seem like shadows of rumors.
``Eyes Wide Shut,'' directed by Stanley Kubrick and starring Cruise
and Nicole Kidman, is one such film. Another is ``Magnolia,''
written and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, whose last film was
``Boogie Nights,'' about a group of kindly pornographers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Magnolia,'' which is being produced by New Line, is scheduled
for release at Christmas, but don't tell anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has been obsessively secretive about the movie _ in
part, people who know him say, because he felt his last movie was
misrepresented in the press before its release _ and Ms. Grace, 32,
who has made appearances in the film ``Playing by Heart'' and on
television in ``Chicago Hope'' and ``NYPD Blue,'' has had to take
an oath of silence, along with everyone else. She is an exuberant
woman, and the effort is an obvious strain, but she plays the part.
</P>
<P>
   Over lunch, at which she nibbled about three leaves of a caesar
salad, she spoke energetically about the difficulties of being a
black actress in Hollywood, about her love of singing, about the
tendency of directors to cast her as a crack addict and about
growing up in Florida, but passed when the subject of her movie
came up. She had company.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Kingsley, Cruise's publicity agent, said: ``He's just not
talking about it. This is an unbilled performance. He just wanted
to work with the director.''
</P>
<P>
   Bumble Ward, Anderson's public relations agent, commented: ``All
I can tell you is it's an ensemble piece set in present-day San
Fernando Valley. We can't say anything further because it's so
complicated. He's not talking about the movie yet.''
</P>
<P>
   But some intensive sleuthing produced the following. The movie
is a fragmentary drama about several different relationships, a
group of loose threads that eventually pull together. Cruise's
relationship with Ms. Grace's character, named Guinevere, is
dissected slowly.
</P>
<P>
   The movie also stars William H. Macy, Julianne Moore, Jason
Robards, John C. Reilly, Philip Baker Hall and Felicity Huffman,
among others. Anderson wrote the script and directed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grace did let out one slip. Of Anderson, she said, ``He's a
wonderful director to work for.''
</P>
<P>
   A Violin's Story
</P>
<P>
   Epic films are not exactly the order of the day in Hollywood,
where the focus tends to be, with few exceptions, on teen flicks
(``Austin Powers''), scatological humor for younger audiences
(``Austin Powers'') and the wizardry of special effects (``Star
Wars'').
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason, anyway, why ``The Red Violin'' stands out.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which opens in New York and Los Angeles on Friday,
spans three centuries and three continents. It is filled with
passion and drama, thievery, an early death, greed, suspense,
injustice, betrayal and more passion and drama. There are gypsies,
Maoists, monks and millionaires. It is, in short, one of the most
ambitious movies to come out this year, so it is understandable
that it took five years for its director, Francois Girard, to make.
</P>
<P>
   All that for what the 36-year-old Girard described as a
metaphor. ``It's about a very central human obsession,'' he said.
``We are all trying to leave some proof or some traces of our
presence here.''
</P>
<P>
   In more ways than one. The movie appears to be an effort by
Girard, who made ``Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould,'' to
leave a mark as a filmmaker with a sweeping vision. And the story
itself is about immortality, of a sort.
</P>
<P>
   Girard, who was also the co-author of ``The Red Violin,'' said
the film took root from a conversation he had with a friend in
London in 1994, he said. They discussed the idea of how an object
travels through time and came up with the notion of a story with a
nonlinear chronology. ``Fragmented time and space, those are the
prerogative of the filmmaker,'' Girard said.
</P>
<P>
   The movie follows the journey of a famous violin through its
history, telling the story of the enduring love that inspired the
creation of the violin by Nicolo Bussotti (Carlo Cecchi) in
17th-century Italy. He intends the violin to be a gift for his
soon-to-be-born son. When the child and his wife die during the
birth, he imbues the instrument with his grief and aspirations, and
these qualities then infect the lives of each of the instrument's
later owners.
</P>
<P>
   In contemporary Montreal, the violin is up for auction, and a
dogged researcher, Charles Morritz (Samuel L. Jackson), explores
its history and past owners. The movie is a dramatization of what
he discovers, as the violin journeys from Italy to an Austrian
monastery, to London in 1893, via some gypsies, to China in the
thrall of Mao's Cultural Revolution, where it is almost destroyed
before being rescued by Xiang Pei (Sylvia Chang).
</P>
<P>
   Once the Cultural Revolution has passed, the violin is sent to
Montreal to be auctioned, with heirs of all its previous owners
present to try to buy it back. But now it has infected Jackson's
character with its passion, and a new adventure begins just as the
movie ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I identify with Charles Morritz,'' Girard said. ``He's the man
through whom I'm looking at the violin and all the things it
represents.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``It's about how can love survive.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for Weirdness
</P>
<P>
   The runaway success of ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom
Menace'' has been particularly good news for Rob Burman. It is not
just that the latest installment in the Star Wars series is
breaking box office records but that this is the first time in a
while that a major special-effects-driven movie has done so
spectacularly well, particularly one with characters that look so
odd.
</P>
<P>
   Odd is good for Burman because he and Sticks and Stones, the
company he runs with his wife, specialize in unusual makeup design,
and they are struggling with a recession in movie production.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say that we're coming up on the second worst year
in our history, and we've been doing this for more than 20 years''
Burman said. ``It can't last forever, I'm sure, but I would say out
of 35 competitors in Los Angeles, three have jobs right now.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that his own company had ballooned to about 22
employees at its peak several years ago and that it is now down to
just him and his wife. The American economy may be booming, but
Hollywood is hurting.
</P>
<P>
   To get inflated costs under control, most studios are cutting
back on the number of movies they produce and on the overall
budgets. Walt Disney Co., for instance, has said it is cutting as
much as $600 million from its annual moviemaking budgets.
</P>
<P>
   This is having a pronounced impact, particularly on the
thousands of little companies that provide services from catering
to makeup. Jack Kyser, an economist with the Los Angeles Economic
Development Corp., said that California state figures show
employment in the movie industry in Los Angeles has declined from a
peak of 142,500 in February 1998 to 127,200 as of April 1999, the
latest period for which figures are available, and that the decline
is continuing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a very pronounced slowdown and it just goes on,''
Kyser said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that there were 637 feature movies initiated in Los
Angeles County in 1997 and 510 last year. This year he estimates
there will be about 480 based on current trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole production cost structure has gotten out of hand,
and this is the response,'' Kyser said. ``Our feeling is you'll see
another employment slowdown this year and very likely in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the slowdown is more pronounced than the official
figures show because many small companies provide services that do
not show up in the state data.
</P>
<P>
   Burman said he hoped that the success of ``Star Wars'' will
encourage more big budget pictures with creatures and the like,
requiring elaborate makeup. ``No more of these romantic comedy
clones, please,'' he said.

 &HT;    WITNESSES TELL CONGRESS TO KEEP TITLE I FOR POOR CHILDREN
 &HT;    Eds: Corrects day in lede to Thursday.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government's biggest educational
program for poor children should be continued despite its
shortcomings, a wide array of witnesses told Congress on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``Title I'' because it is the first program in the
Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the $8 billion-a-year
program will expire unless the act is renewed within the next 15
months. More than 45,000 public and private schools with high
numbers of poor children use Title I funds for programs that range
from extra tutoring to computer-based instruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be reauthorized; the only question is what can be done
to improve it,'' said Chairman William Goodling, R-Pa., after his
House Committee on Education and the Workforce heard testimony from
skeptical state officials and enthusiastic representatives of
public-school teacher unions and the U.S. Catholic bishops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Title I has been a colossal failure,'' testified Roan
Garcia-Quintana, director of Title I programs for the Georgia
Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   ``No discernible difference could be found (by a massive study
in 1997) between children who received Title I services and
children of equivalent backgrounds who did not participate in the
program,'' Garcia-Quintana said. ``But I don't want Congress to
dump Title I. I want them to overhaul it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Chase, president of the National Education Association, was
less downbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Improvement has been insufficient, but it's there,'' said
Chase, who cited other studies and contended that changes made in
1994 will continue to increase the program's accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NEA opposes any efforts to alter significantly the
structure or direction of Title I,'' Chase said.
</P>
<P>
   The witnesses cold-shouldered many of the Clinton
administration's suggestions for imposing new, detailed
requirements on schools that accept Title I funds.
</P>
<P>
   States should be able to spend Title I funds any way they want
as long as they can show that they are improving the academic
performance of disadvantaged children, said Garcia-Quintana and
Cheri Pierson Yecke, Virginia's deputy secretary of education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're willing to step forward and accept the responsibility
for improving student achievement,'' Yecke said. ``All we ask is
the flexibility to use our funds as we see fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Randi Weingarten, vice president of the American Federation of
Teachers, and Chase liked Clinton's suggestion for tougher
standards for new teachers. But they were leery of his proposal
that the federal government require two years of college for any
aide whose duties include such instructional activity as one-on-one
tutoring.
</P>
<P>
   While about one-third of aides want to go on to become teachers,
two-thirds aren't interested in education other than vocational
training for their current job, Weingarten said.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying on behalf of the Catholic bishops, John Clark said,
``We also believe that the existing law addresses instructional
aides in an adequate fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   As the witnesses filed out of the hearing room, Goodling said,
``I thought some of them should have been a little more forthcoming
in talking about the failures of Title I. There have been a lot of
failures.''

 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Over more than a century, scientists and explorers
from the American Museum of Natural History have searched the world
and returned with arresting examples of life in all its diversity:
dinosaurs from Montana to Mongolia, birds and butterflies,
artifacts of exotic cultures from here to the South Sea. For the
last four years, their quest has been to collect the stuff of Earth
itself and bring it back for a new exhibition illustrating the
planet's 4.5 billion-year history.
</P>
<P>
   On 28 acquisition expeditions, museum teams collected 82 tons of
rock and ore, ranging from granite and sandstone to gold and
platinum. The oldest, a zircon crystal from Australia, is nearly
4.3 billion years old. The youngest, a chunk of sulfur, was picked
up the same day it solidified in an Indonesian volcano. The rarest
and most intriguing to scientists are sulfide chimneys that rise
from volcanic vents on the sea floor, where some of the first forms
of life may have emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Now the collections have been studied, winnowed and arranged for
display in the museum's newest permanent exhibit, the Gottesman
Hall of Planet Earth, which opens Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Showing off the exhibit, museum president Ellen Futter declared
that this was a ``never-before assembled global array'' of
specimens integrated with ``the most innovative multimedia
technology ever created for a museum hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone expecting to find the usual drab pieces of rock under
glass should be pleasantly surprised. Huge slabs of stone, highly
polished and touchable, draw attention to the ingrained beauty and
surging dynamism of geology. Video and other graphics offer crisp
explanations. A result is an awakening to the motions and changes
of the restless world underlying and supporting life.
</P>
<P>
   The intent, said Ms. Futter, was ``to convey both the majesty of
earth and its dynamic, seething innards that yield such cataclysmic
explosions as earthquakes, volcanoes, tornadoes, hurricanes and the
like, while also presenting the latest, still emerging theories of
the origins of life on earth and the possibilities of life
beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   To this end, as Dr. Edmond Mathez, a geologist and the chief
curator of the hall, explained, the exhibit is organized around
five fundamental questions: How has earth evolved? Why are there
ocean basins, continents and mountains? How do scientists read
rocks? What causes climate and climate change? Why is earth
habitable?
</P>
<P>
   In the center of it all, for rest, contemplation and
perspective, is a 30-seat granite amphitheater where visitors can
look up at an enormous earth globe. It appears to be rotating
slowly as a projection system inside the globe shows the planet's
surface as seen from space. Stay for 12 minutes and see the
familiar landscapes change. The clouds disperse, then continental
vegetation disappears and finally all the blue water of the oceans
drains away. The bare, rugged earth stands revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Off to one side is the ``Earth Event Wall.'' This is an
electronic bulletin board bearing news of recent storms,
earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, illustrated with television and
computer-generated animation. The display is to be updated
regularly, providing expert interpretations of how these events
illustrate the world's geologic forces.
</P>
<P>
   At the north end of the hall is another focal point, a large
video screen exploding with scenes of rampaging lava, rivers
overflowing and glaciers carving terrain. The experience can be
visceral. As the sounds of an earthquake fill the hall, those
sitting on nearby benches feel the rumble. From one bench it is
possible to see the consequences in the face of a crystalline rock.
Its layers are offset more than a foot by the slippage of a fault
during a major quake.
</P>
<P>
   Children and not a few grown-ups will enjoy stamping their feet
and seeing the tremor, their own ``earthquake,'' recorded as a
jagged spike on a seismograph.
</P>
<P>
   On display also is one of the world's best records of climate
change, an ice core from Greenland. The ice is a 115,000-year
archive of atmospheric gases, dust and other chemicals from the
time the snow first fell. A chart shows the effects in the ice of
the eruption of Vesuvius in A.D. 79 and the Clean Air Act in the
United States, beginning in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the rock specimens can be viewed as a natural art form
as well as a lesson in geology. The rippling folds exposed in one
rock cutaway are a graceful show of how seemingly brittle material
can flow, given enough time and heat. The rock is in easy, tempting
reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can touch,'' Mathez said. ``This is a very tactile hall.''
</P>
<P>
   One approaches a polished specimen of banded iron from Ontario,
2.7 billion years old, with the same impulse. Fingers run over the
dark red streaks of jasper. Helpful labels explain the deeper
meaning. When single-celled organisms began supplying oxygen to
earth's atmosphere, iron and silica minerals emerged out of the
ocean. The red bands in the rock stopped forming once the
atmosphere and ocean were saturated with free oxygen. Here, then,
were rocks telling of this fateful transition in an evolving earth.
</P>
<P>
   Another display brings together two sandstones that were, so to
speak, separated after birth. They were deposited at the same time
near each other, but then the spreading Atlantic Ocean came between
them, one rock residing in Scotland and the other ending up near
Monticello, N.Y. It was a striking illustration of continental
drift through the shifting of crustal plates, the process known as
plate tectonics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The present is the key to the past,'' said James Hutton, the
18th-century Scotsman who was among the first to recognize the
principles of modern geology. His contributions are acknowledged
and explained in one corner of the hall.
</P>
<P>
   The museum advertises that the rock specimens and 11 full-scale
models of classic outcroppings were gathered from 25 countries. But
geologists take special pride in some tall heaps of rock,
resembling smelting slag, that they sent a robotic vehicle to the
bottom of the Pacific Ocean to collect.
</P>
<P>
   These are the sulfide chimneys, also known as black smokers
because they are formed as dark, mineral-laden hot water billows
from vents in the sea floor. The museum said these are the first
such chimneys ever collected while they were still hot and teeming
with strange life. An expedition by the museum and the University
of Washington brought them to the surface last summer off the coast
of British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   It is the microbial and other forms of life found thriving on
the chimneys that especially intrigue scientists. These organisms
flourish in the absence of sunlight, living on chemicals at
crushing pressures. Scientists theorize that early life on earth
could have arisen at such places, and life on other planets just
might exist in similarly harsh environments.
</P>
<P>
   Standing before the stark columns of dark rock, Mathez said,
``This is where the biosphere and geosphere meet in a profound
way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hall of Planet Earth was developed with the financial
support of David S. and Ruth L. Gottesman and was designed by Ralph
Appelbaum Associates. It is the first half of the Rose Center for
Earth and Space, designed by Polshek Partnership Architects. A new
planetarium and hall devoted to cosmology is scheduled to open
early next year.
</P>
<P>
   For the American Museum of Natural History, today the world,
next year the universe.

 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of Barry
Sonnenfeld directing Will Smith in a scene from ``Wild Wild
West.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Knife Guy. Helmet Head. Shovel Guy. Spike Head.
 &HT;    Barry Sonnenfeld couldn't believe the movie call sheet on the
wall.
 &HT;    ``I looked at it and thought, `What poor, pathetic guy has to
direct a movie with guys like that?''' Sonnenfeld says, laughing.
``Then I realized it was me.''
 &HT;    Sonnenfeld may feel pathetic, but he isn't poor _ having
pocketed substantial paydays for two ``Addams Family'' pictures and
a little something called ``Men in Black'' a couple of years ago.
And, as those titles would suggest, he's no stranger to the
outlandish, the weird or even the altogether ooky, either.
 &HT;    Shovel Guy and Spike Head couldn't be in better hands.
 &HT;    And their film, ``Wild Wild West,'' isn't looking bad itself.
Opening on June 30, the film reteams Sonnenfeld with ``MiB'' star
Will Smith for the big-screen, $100 million version of the
ultra-cool-for-its-day Robert Conrad television series of the same
name.
 &HT;    For those who may not have caught the show in reruns _ and it's
hard to find _ Smith stars as 19th-century secret agent James West,
while Kevin Kline plays Artemus Gordon, West's reluctant partner
and a master of disguise. Kenneth Branagh hams it up as the
villainous Dr. Arliss Loveless, with Salma Hayek adding heat as the
mysterious entertainer, Rita Escobar.
 &HT;    So what's up with Spike Head and his buddies?
 &HT;    ``I'm very comfortable with comedy and visual FX,'' Sonnenfeld
explains, ``but late in the game we decided we wanted to shoot a
sequence with Will in the belly of this 80-foot-tall mechanical
tarantula, a fight sequence with a bunch of Dr. Loveless's
henchmen.
 &HT;    ``I never thought I could pull off a big fight that involves a
certain amount of martial arts and a certain amount of people
slugging each other, with Will beating these four guys,'' the
director admits. ``I was afraid I wouldn't be able to, tonally,
make a big slugfest fit in with the rest of the movie.
 &HT;    ``Working with Will, we created a sequence that has tremendous
energy and fighting and chains and kicking and leaping but that,
tonally, is also incredibly funny and keeping within the context of
the character we created for Will,'' he says.
 &HT;    ``I never thought I'd be able to pull it out. It was a huge
challenge for me.''
 &HT;    Actually, the whole film seems pretty challenging. After all,
the television show on which it's based _ think James Bond meets
``Gunsmoke'' _ ended 30 years ago. A hot property it's not. And
it's not as if there's an obvious audience for your basic
sci-fi/spy/Western action/comedy/drama,
 &HT;    So why why ``West?''
 &HT;    ``Two reasons,'' Sonnenfeld booms by telephone from a Los
Angeles editing bay, where he's racing to complete ``West'' in time
for its opening.
 &HT;    ``Growing up, `Wild Wild West' was my favorite television
show,'' he recalls. ``I watched it, along with `Man from
U.N.C.L.E,' almost every week with my dad. For me, ``Wild Wild
West' was the perfect show. It had Bond and it had women with
cleavage, in dresses, who looked sexy.
 &HT;    ``Then I was at Sony one day talking to them about the marketing
of `Men in Black' and Will's partner, James Lasseter, came up to me
and said, `There's a ``Wild Wild West'' script floating around.
What would you think of doing it with Will?'''
 &HT;    Sonnenfeld chuckles at the memory.
 &HT;    ``I love working with Will,'' he says, ``and what he did for me
as it relates to `Wild Wild West' was to take something that had
been on television and flip it, twist it and make it feel quirky
and different from just a feature version of the show.
 &HT;    ``I got to do my favorite show with my favorite actor.''
 &HT;    OK, but what what is this thing? A comedy? A sci-fi epic? An
action/adventure?
 &HT;    The director thinks it's a ... well, actually, even he's not
sure.
 &HT;    ``The first time I showed it to Kevin, he and I were on an
airplane together,'' the 46-year-old Sonnenfeld says. ``I had a
cassette of the film in a very rough state. We got done watching
it, and Kevin said, `I've never seen a movie like this before.'
 &HT;    ``It's very hard to categorize,'' he says. ``It's sci-fi, sort
of. It's Jules Verne-like, in that we made sure that all the sci-fi
elements could exist in 1869.
 &HT;    ``That was a very cool challenge for (production designer) Bo
Welch and myself,'' he says excitedly. ``For this 80-foot, walking
tarantula, we desperately tried to make it look like it was burning
coal and leaking oil and was state-of-the-art for 1869. The idea
was to make it all seem as if you're watching a sci-fi film from
100 years ago.
 &HT;    ``The film is also funny,'' he adds, ``but sometimes comedy can
be the enemy of action _ and it's also full of action, which can
often be the enemy of comedy.
 &HT;    ``I hope _ I pray _ that somehow we've pulled off this synthesis
of genres.''

 &HT;    CLINTON: FINISH THE JOB, BUILD THE PEACE IN KOSOVO, BALKANS
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-MAIN-0611.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Grasping victory in one hand and fresh risks in the
other, President Clinton said Thursday that ``inhumanity'' was
defeated in Kosovo but additional costs must be borne to secure the
peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past four months, we have seen some of the worst
inhumanity in our lifetime,'' Clinton said, referring to atrocities
and terror inflicted upon ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have a moment of hope,'' Clinton told reporters at the
White House, less than two hours after U.S. and allied pilots
suspended air strikes against Yugoslavia after 78 days of attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to finish the job,'' he said, ``and build the peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Bracing the country for years of peacekeeping operations
involving thousands of U.S. troops, Clinton declined to set a date
certain for bringing American forces home from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should put a timetable on it,'' Clinton said.
``We will define our objectives and proceed to implement them.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made clear, though, that he expects Europe to bear the
lion's share of the costs of helping to rebuild the war-shattered
Balkans and knitting the region back into the fabric of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect that most of the money would come through
Europe, because most of the costs of this campaign, the air
campaign, have been borne by the United States,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't quarrel with that; we had the capacity, and we did
what we should have done,'' said Clinton. ``But I don't want us to
get into a haggling situation either,'' over how much countries
should pony up for Balkans reconstruction aid.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Balkans recovery would be impeded so long as Serb
leader Slobodan Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia, remains in
power in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how Serbia can participate in that unless they
have a leadership that is committed to a multi-ethnic,
multi-religious democracy and to genuine democracy and human
rights,'' said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The message was clear: Serbia, Yugoslavia's main republic, can
expect little assistance beyond basic humanitarian aid from the
United States and Europe until Milosevic leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   After months in which Serb troops, police and paramilitary thugs
have forced more than a million ethnic Albanians to flee their
homes in Kosovo, Clinton said the U.S. peacekeeping commitment
there is open ended.
</P>
<P>
   That approach differed sharply from Clinton's pledge in December
1995 that U.S. peacekeepers would remain in Bosnia for only one
year. There are still 6,200 U.S. troops in Bosnia, part of a larger
NATO peacekeeping force there of some 31,000. There are no plans to
remove the force.
</P>
<P>
   Some 7,000 U.S. troops are staging to deploy into Kosovo as part
of a larger NATO force expected to crest near 50,000 forces.

`AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME': FAB, FUNNY, BUT SLIGHTLY
FADED
</HEADLINE>
  (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There may come a time when even Austin Powers tires of the words
``Oh, behave,'' but it isn't here yet. The sequel with the fab
title ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' is several love
beads short of its predecessor, but some of that was bound to
happen once Austin's novelty dimmed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an oversupply of bathroom jokes and scattered scenes
that play like outtakes, this is still a crafty, intermittently
hilarious comedy that deserves its place alongside Bill, Ted,
Wayne, Garth, Ace, Mary and the Waterboy in the Smart-Stupid Hall
of Fame. Mike Myers' neo-Sellers multiple-personality act
guarantees that.
</P>
<P>
   In a cheerful hit-or-miss laugh-in that plays like ``The Three
Faces of Mike,'' Myers slips back into party mode as the happily
delusional nerd and hedonist of the title. He grins gamely once
again as the man who made bad teeth adorable and restored the word
``shag'' to its former glory.
</P>
<P>
   Myers wrote the screenplay with Michael McCullers for a
candy-colored, amiably slapdash film directed by Jay Roach.
</P>
<P>
   Even the credit sequence shows that this franchise's sense of
fun hasn't faded. Wearing nothing but his dead-animal chest pelt
while scampering through a hotel, Austin shields himself with
enough metaphorical edibles (two hams covering his posterior,
phallic anything, etc.) to recapture the first film's giddiness
immediately. It doesn't hurt that the very first thing on screen
here is a poke at ``Star Wars,'' with a couple of others waiting in
the wings.
</P>
<P>
   The new film nominally centers on the possible destruction of
Washington and a plot to steal Austin's mojo. (That term, as
loosely defined here, is whatever makes one sway when Marvin Gaye
sings ``Let's Get It On.'') But the real stealing comes from
Austin's nemesis and alter ego, Dr. Evil, who emerges again as
Myers' most inspired creation. If Austin is lovable for his wishful
studliness (``I put the  &UR; grrrr &LR;  in swinger, baby''), and for not
having any idea how nutty it is, Dr. Evil is an even more
recognizable bundle of neuroses. He's the peevish but endearing
villain who shows how easy it is to think like a large impatient
baby, whether bossing his underlings or plotting to rule the world.
</P>
<P>
   After the newlywed Austin is alarmed to find that his bride
(Elizabeth Hurley, in a brief, delicious cameo) can be made to
speak Spanish with a remote control, he reverts to his
man-of-the-world mode and winds up with Heather Graham's Felicity
Shagwell as his new companion. In hot pants or a macrame dress, Ms.
Graham also makes terrific eye candy, but she doesn't share Ms.
Hurley's quick-witted air of being in on the joke.
</P>
<P>
   Felicity, Austin and the 1969 Carnaby Street setting for much of
the film are essentially one-note inventions. (Incidentally, at 95
minutes, the film still has enough water-treading time for Burt
Bacharach and Elvis Costello to do a musical number in its swinging
London locale.)
</P>
<P>
   But the film's Dr. Evil scenes have more to work with. While
Seth Green plays an even funnier version of Dr. Evil's surly
teen-age son than he did the first time (the two turn up on a ``My
Father Is Evil, and He Wants to Take Over the World'' segment for
Jerry Springer), ``The Spy Who Shagged Me'' also provides an added
element of sibling rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   It gives Dr. Evil a new favorite in the form of a tiny,
worshipful clone named Mini-Me (Verne J. Troyer) who wordlessly
mimics every Evil gesture, even that smirky way of making mock
quotation marks with his fingers. Dr. Evil, whose tantrums often
leave him hilariously tongue tied (``You're the Diet Coke of Evil!
Just one calorie! Not evil enough!''), naturally prefers the
slavish copy to the offspring who talks back.
</P>
<P>
   Uncanny as Myers can be while squaring off against himself in
Austin vs. Evil confrontations, he becomes even more so in the
id-like third persona of a drooling, loutish Scotsman. Pumped up to
Jabba the Hutt proportions by the Stan Winston Studio, this
scatological slob plays as perhaps a nightmarish overreaction to
too many viewings of ``Trainspotting,'' or just a gross-out gambit
to win the hearts of teen-age boys. Though Myers shows his
versatility from behind the blubber, the film's wit is not
heightened by the joke about the Scotsman's stool sample.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Spy Who Shagged Me'' mostly does a good job of paring down
and improving the first film's minor characters. Frau Farbissina
(Mindy Sterling), whose Yiddish name is perfect for her sourpuss
demeanor, is magically transformed into Dr. Evil's love slave
midway through the story. (``I can't let my feelings for you
interfere with my taking over the world,'' he tells her solemnly.
``You know that.'') The character named Mustafa (Will Ferrell)
remains accident prone.
</P>
<P>
   And Dr. Evil's sidekick No. 2 is again played by Robert Wagner
in present-day scenes, but he spends much of the film being Rob
Lowe in 1969. Lowe's deadpan impersonation of Wagner is one of the
film's sly little pleasures.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more sure-fire comic routines here, at least for the
film's target audience, is one in silhouette that has Austin and
Felicity horrifying onlookers with, among other things, a gerbil
and an umbrella. And presuming that nothing delights the true
Austin Powers fan more than a penis joke, the film has special fun
with synonyms. Cameo appearances by Woody Harrelson and Willie
Nelson come in handy.
</P>

`MOAB IS MY WASHPOT': A REBELLIOUS YOUNG WEED, AND HOW HE GREW
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(fb) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his best-selling first novel, ``The Liar'' (1993), Stephen
Fry created an antic portrait of a feckless schoolboy named Adrian
Healey who is described, quite admiringly it must be said, as ``a
fraud, a charlatan and a liar.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar self-portrait emerges in Fry's enormously entertaining
new autobiography, ``Moab Is My Washpot,'' which chronicles the
first 20 years of his life, from his childhood in rural England
through his departure for Cambridge University in 1977. One
schoolmaster describes him as ``feckless, fickle, flamboyant and
evasive.'' Another says, ``for colossal nerve, for sheer, ruddy
cheek, I have never met anyone to match you.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Stephen, we quickly learn, is brilliant, bookish and
rebellious, the sort of teen-ager who can complete the London Times
crossword puzzle faster than most adults, likes to memorize the
Guinness Book of Records for fun and routinely torments his
teachers with willfully smart-aleck questions. He also happens to
be a compulsive thief whose penchant for pilfering candy and pocket
money gives way to a wild spending spree fueled by stolen credit
cards. The prank will land the 18-year-old Fry in jail and
temporarily derail his academic career.
</P>
<P>
   Although Fry points out that ``the story of a sensitive young
weed struggling to grow up in the robust thicket of an English
public school'' was ``done to death, in the earlier part of this
century in novels, memoirs and autobiographies,'' his own account
of his schoolboy travails is so engaging, so idiosyncratic, so
larky, as he might say, that the reader never for a moment feels a
sense of deja vu.
</P>
<P>
   In fact ``Washpot'' bears about the same resemblance to the
conventional memoir as ``Tristram Shandy'' does to the traditional
novel: Fry does not merely employ digressions as a narrative
technique; he positively revels in them as a minor art form.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he sounds like a chatty talk show guest, discussing
the future of the monarchy (he thinks it's worth keeping, because
without it ``Britain would suddenly have no absurd minor blemish to
blame for its failures'') and the seniority system in English
public schools (``No one in life, not the wartiest old dame in
Arles, not the wrinkledest, stoopingest Cossack, not the
pony-tailedest, venerablest old Mandarin in China, not Methuselah
himself, will ever be older than a group of seniors at school'').
At other times he plays the philosopher, musing about the
relationship between sex and love and explicating E.M. Forster's
observation that the English suffer from ``undeveloped hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the dominant voice in this book _ as in Fry's novels
(``The Liar,'' ``The Hippopotamus'') and acting performances
(``Peter's Friends,'' ``Jeeves and Wooster'') _ is comic, by turns
insolent and witty, ribald and pugnacious, but Fry also
demonstrates his ability to write earnestly about the
transgressions of his youth and his youthful crushes. Indeed much
of the narrative tension in this memoir springs from the contrast
between the two Frys who appear in its pages _ the young Fry (or
``small Fry,'' as he might put it), who seemed to bounce from one
misadventure to another, like a ricocheting ball in a pinball
machine; and the older Fry, who shakes his head in chagrin and
bemusement at his earlier self.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike so many American memoirists, Fry does not psychoanalyze
himself or his parents, nor does he blame the things that happened
to him as a boy (being shipped off to boarding school at the age of
8, being beaten by teachers and violated by a schoolmate) for his
later run-ins with the law. His reminiscences are animated not by
anger or indignation, but by a genial sense of regret, his
portraits informed by an elegiac if irreverent nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   He draws a lovely, gently shaded portrait of his childhood in
rural England, conjuring up a world of badminton lawns, old family
retainers and crumbling Victorian houses with dubious plumbing (the
bottom of the water tank ``had been alive with bright red
nematodes''). He describes his mother as being ``more cheerful than
Pickwick, Pollyanna and Mrs. Tiggywinkle on a sunny day in
Happyville''; his father, as possessing a Sherlock Holmes-like
mind, combining ``dreamy abstraction with ruthless logic and an
infinite capacity for taking pains.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the young Fry, he comes across as a painfully
self-conscious boy, an outsider by virtue of his physical
awkwardness and self-loathing as well as his Jewishness and
homosexuality, a skinny, underdeveloped boy who was terrified of
showering with the other boys after sports, who was terrified of
having to sing in music class. All this ``wretched 13-year-old''
had, he writes now, was ``his anger, his fury, his verbal
arrogance, his pride,'' and so he learned to use words as a means
of saving himself ``from bullying, mockery and rejection.''
</P>
<P>
   Fry's account of his progression through a series of boarding
schools, his sad-funny reminiscences of his discovery of love, his
memories of childhood humiliations (having his dead mole upstaged
by a live donkey during a classroom show-and-tell presentation) and
childhood triumphs (stealing some sweets from a drawer in the
headmaster's study), his rapturous discovery of literature and his
more tentative discovery of sex, all combine to make an engagingly
rueful memoir and to whet the reader's appetite for the sequel that
will presumably bring the author's life up to date.

   One of the oddities of learning to tango is how much time you
spend walking, endlessly, forward and backward, this way and that
in the merciless glare of the dance studio mirrors. The instructor
glides on an invisible balance beam; the student teeters and
galumphs. It is like starting chess by steering the rooks back and
forth across the board, again and again.
</P>
<P>
   The Argentine tango is not unlike chess, an instructor once told
me. It is serious; it takes discipline; it must be studied hard to
be done well. It is elegant and formal, passionate and intimate. It
is about power and vulnerability. It is both a dance and a
metaphor. And to its captives, it can become a magnificent
obsession.
</P>
<P>
   I admit I never harbored the illusion that I was born to tango.
I figure I am too Anglo, too Saxon, not enough something else. I
did learn the box step from a society lady who taught dancing to
velveteened preadolescents, and, before my wedding, I learned swing
in a rush. But if I had ever considered the tango, I would have
assumed I was hard-wired for other things.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, I set out to defy destiny. In a city where one can
tango in a different club nearly every night of the week and where
the tango has spawned a small subculture all its own, I joined the
shifting group of New Yorkers who turn out every Thursday evening
for the beginning Argentine tango class at Stepping Out, a midtown
Manhattan dance studio.
</P>
<P>
   Week after week, I hurried up Broadway at dusk and reported for
duty, amid the swing/lindy classes and just down the corridor from
the gay and lesbian two-step class. There, I would wrestle with my
walking, practice my foot patterns and shuffle tentatively around
the dance floor in the arms of a succession of often equally addled
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, I began to learn a few things about the tango. It can
be danced small and simply, or with ferocious theatricality. At its
best, people describe the experience as somewhere between
meditation and sex. It demands immediate intimacy. As Angel
Figueroa, a dancer and one of the owners of Stepping Out, put it
delicately, ``You're literally plastered up against somebody's
body.''
</P>
<P>
   I also learned that for many people, the tango becomes a
consuming passion. Sarah La Rocca was an art teacher in her late
20s in Washington when she saw a dancer named Fabian Salas tango.
Moved to tears, she began taking private lessons from him four
times a week. She started traveling around the world to take
lessons, then quit her job and moved to Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
   For months, she lived the nocturnal life of an expatriate
American tango bum. Like others, she would rise in the midafternoon
to practice the tango, take a class in the evening and go out for
coffee and then to a tango club. She would arrive after midnight
and stay until 6 A.M., eat breakfast and go home to bed. When her
money ran short, she said, she taught English to bank executives.
</P>
<P>
   In the clubs, she saw people whose lives seemed to be held
hostage by the tango: the same women, in the same seats, waiting
for the same men. They looked like zombies, liberated only by
dancing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `God protect me from becoming like that,'' ' La
Rocca recalled recently. She returned to the United States in late
1997 and now works, and teaches tango, in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something about tango, about the listening to each
other in tango, that creates a really moving experience,'' La Rocca
said. ``It's not that it happens every night. But when it does
happen, it's very powerful and it keeps you looking for it. It's
almost like love at first sight, in a way; it's like a physical
love at first sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be two people who don't even know each other, who don't
even have a common language,'' added La Rocca, who is now in her
early 30s. ``It's almost like this meditative state where two
people can transmit feeling to each other without even speaking.
It's an extraordinary thing and I've never met anyone who could
explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, though, my own tangoing felt desultory. I couldn't
reconcile the tango I had seen in movies with my fretful
circumnavigation of the studio floor. I kept being reminded of math
class _ that unsettling sensation that whatever I was learning was
stored so precariously in my brain it would spill out my ear if I
shook my head.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking enlightenment, I telephoned Paul Pellicoro, the
42-year-old owner of the dance studio Dancesport, who taught Al
Pacino to tango for the movie ``Scent of a Woman.'' The unfortunate
thing about dance schools is that people end up thinking about
their feet, Pellicoro said. You have to take your brains out of
your legs, he told me, and let them respond.
</P>
<P>
   To get my brains out of my legs, I made an appointment with
Pellicoro. (He had also assured me I could not write about learning
to tango without taking a lesson from him.) I delivered myself to
Dancesport at the appointed hour. Ride the elevator to the third
floor, a receptionist told me, and look for the only good-looking
man.
</P>
<P>
   The doors glided open into a mirrored studio with a
honey-colored floor. Off in the distance was the good-looking man.
He was plastered up against the body of a statuesque amazon in a
silk chiffon, leopard-print dress slit up the side, its neckline
and spaghetti straps only partially containing a most voluminous
chest.
</P>
<P>
   Jacked up on high heels, she had her head thrown back, long,
straight hair streaming down her back. Her eyes were shut tight in
apparent ecstasy. Pellicoro, dark haired and lithe, was maneuvering
her effortlessly around the floor, their legs entangling and
disentangling, to the mournful strains of tango music, which has
been called the Latin blues.
</P>
<P>
   His student was, she would tell me later, Marilyn Cole Lownes.
Now 48, she introduced herself as ``the only British Playmate of
the Year.'' She had seen Pellicoro perform the tango at a Manhattan
restaurant, Il Campanello, and had become his disciple. ``It gets
into your blood,'' she said. ``It gets into your bones.''
</P>
<P>
   Then I was up.
</P>
<P>
   We began by walking, of course. Then, almost imperceptibly, we
were dancing. Or, he was dancing and I was along for the ride,
being guided lightly around the floor, given small physical clues
to change direction, speed up, slow down, pause. Pellicoro likes to
describe the tango as ``elegant, organized stumbling to music.''
</P>
<P>
   Lean into me, he said. Press with your _ he paused _ your
sternum. I found myself tilted slightly forward, sternum pressing,
weight on the balls of my feet. Bring your ear toward me, as if I'm
going to tell you something, he said. My cheek was on his shoulder,
then on his chest. Don't think about your feet, he reminded me. As
though I was thinking about my feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best dancers really very rarely learn it through
schools,'' said Pellicoro, who said his mother, a lindy hop dancer
from Levittown, L.I., was forever scooping him up and dancing with
him as a child. ``They learn an outline, but the best dancers are
sometimes the worst students. They don't listen to the teacher.
They let things happen intuitively and naturally.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can write volumes on what happens in the body before the
foot even takes a step,'' he had told me. ``Experience is something
that can't be replaced. I can go and say to you everything about
this step. But until you feel it _ `Oh, that's what I have to
feel!' It's like describing what an orange tastes like. You've got
to eat an orange.''
</P>
<P>
   That was some kind of orange.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The recent history of Argentine tango classes in New York City
begins in 1985, the year that ``Tango Argentino'' arrived on
Broadway and exposed many audiences for the first time to the dance
_ not the stiff, rose-in-the-teeth version but what Pellicoro
characterizes as something more organic, more natural, cheek to
cheek, the way Americans once danced the fox trot.
</P>
<P>
   The cast included many of Argentina's leading tango dancers.
Marooned in New York City for months on end, some moonlighted by
teaching the tango. New York City dance teachers were among the
first to sign up. Then they took the tango back to their schools
and began teaching civilians. People seemed hungry to learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something I had never seen before,'' said Diane L.
Lachtrupp, a dancer who owns Stepping Out with Figueroa. ``The
music was compelling and haunting. And the relationship between the
dancers was different. There is a kind of restrained passion. It is
intimate on a very different level than how we were brought up in
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   In my case, I approached my first class with trepidation. I
would have the wrong shoes, the wrong body. Scariest of all, I was
going by myself. But the crowd of about 30 men and women who
wandered into the well-worn studio at 8 p.m. looked reassuringly
motley. I alone seemed to have assumed this was a club to which I
could never belong.
</P>
<P>
   We began by walking. This, too, was reassuring; even I can walk,
most of the time. Then we took a partner and walked around, facing
each other, leaning forward, hands touching. The ``followers'' (a
euphemism for females, mostly) were told not to move until the
``leaders'' indicated it was time. Then on to the ``partnership
hold'' and our first foot patterns on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Every week, we changed partners often, rotating counterclockwise
in the circle of people. For the first weeks, I was usually
stumbling along with someone considerably more accomplished than
myself. ``Don't anticipate!'' one leader hissed at me with
startling vehemence. Another confided to me gravely, ``Tango is a
conversation between two bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   A few complexities of the tango:
</P>
<P>
   The tango is not danced to a particular rhythm; as Lachtrupp put
it, ``You dance to the melody and your own heart.'' Leader and
follower are not a mirror image; they often do different steps.
</P>
<P>
   The tango is not danced on the spot, like swing or mambo; the
dancers travel. So a leader must learn ``floorcraft,'' the art of
maneuvering in traffic. And a follower must learn trust.
</P>
<P>
   A beginning tango student might learn how to get around an empty
dance floor in a lesson or two, Lachtrupp told me later. But it
takes at least six months to become comfortable and confident, she
said. A student learning another dance might pick up a half dozen
steps in an hourlong lesson, Figueroa said; a tango student will
learn one or two.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, I discovered that many in the Thursday night crowd
were perennial beginners who had opted not to advance to the
intermediate level. When I asked why people repeated the same class
over and over, one man explained patiently that he was too stupid
to move on. Another told me glumly, ``I used to be smart, when I
was younger.''
</P>
<P>
   The key was obviously practice. Esther Neale, 51, spent months
screwing up her courage to sign up for beginning tango. Now, she
goes out to dance at clubs three times a week, takes private and
group lessons and has a regular tango partner who takes her to
workshops and comes by her apartment after work so they can
practice.
</P>
<P>
   As for me, life kept interfering with my progress. My children
considered it treason that I would spend Thursday evenings with
anyone other than them, which made it difficult to follow the
teachers' advice to stay after class for the 90-minute tango
practice, return for the tango parties, attend weekend workshops
and stay out half the night at clubs.
</P>
<P>
   One Thursday night recently, I got on the subway and hurtled
home by 7 p.m. Sometime around 8:30, I wondered fleetingly what
bodily conversation I was missing. Would it have been one of those
nights that La Rocca talked about? Maybe, maybe not. Then I went
back to my other life. After all, I had tasted the orange.

COURT TELLS ANTI-LOITERING LAW TO MOVE ALONG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday struck down a
Chicago anti-loitering law targeted at breaking the grip of street
gangs on inner-city neighborhoods, ruling that the ordinance failed
to explain to those arrested what they were doing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The 1992 law, which resulted in more than 45,000 arrests in the
three years it was enforced, permitted police to arrest not only
suspected gang members, but also anyone else who, standing with
``no apparent purpose'' on a public street near a gang member,
defied a police order to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to imagine how a Chicagoan standing in a
public place with a group of people would know if he or she had an
`apparent purpose,''' Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the
court.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens was joined by Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M.
Kennedy, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G.
Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, Kennedy and Breyer wrote separate opinions explaining
their views.
</P>
<P>
   The court's 6-3 ruling was consistent with several Supreme Court
decisions from the 1970s that ended or severely curtailed vagrancy
and loitering laws that were once common in American cities.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the court's rejection of the Chicago ordinance, law
enforcement and municipal government associations said the
differing opinions of the justices left open the possibility that a
less vague law could pass constitutional scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State Solicitor Edward B. ``Ned' Foley, who helped write a
friend-of-court brief for the city of Chicago, pointed out that
O'Connor's opinion ``laid out a blueprint'' that would allow a
different version of the law to be found constitutional. He added
that Breyer agreed with that blueprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want loitering laws to be more defined, and that's a
whole different ballgame than saying they shouldn't exist,'' Foley
said.
</P>
<P>
   In her opinion, O'Connor said a better definition for the term
``loiter'' might be lingering in one spot ``with no apparent
purpose other than to establish control over identifiable areas, to
intimidate others from entering those areas, or to conceal illegal
activities.''
</P>
<P>
   The city of Chicago defined loitering as ``remaining in any one
place with no apparent purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois Supreme Court struck down the law in 1997, calling
it an ``arbitrary restriction on personal liberties'' and ruling
that it gave police officers too much discretion in deciding
whether there had been a violation.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court affirms the state
court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said the court recognized the ``serious and difficult''
problems faced by Chicago citizens in their fight against street
gangs but believed that the city had gone too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this instance, the city has enacted an ordinance that
affords too much discretion to the police and too little notice to
citizens who wish to use the public streets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, the court's only Chicago native, said the law allowed
police to tell people to move on without asking why they were
standing around.
</P>
<P>
   ``It matters not whether the reason that a gang member and his
father, for example, might loiter near Wrigley Field is to rob an
unsuspecting fan or just to get a glimpse of Sammy Sosa leaving the
ballpark,'' he said, referring to the Chicago Cubs' homerun hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``In either, if their purpose is not apparent to a nearby police
officer, she (the officer) may _ indeed, she `shall' _ order them
to disperse.''
</P>
<P>
   In unusually strong words, Justice Antonin Scalia disagreed with
the majority opinion, calling it ``simply wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The citizens of Chicago have decided that depriving themselves
of the freedom to `hang out' with a gang member is necessary to
eliminate pervasive gang crime and intimidation _ and that the
elimination of the one is worth the deprivation of the other,''
said Scalia, who was joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist and
Justice Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, 31 states, the National League of
Cities, U.S. Mayors Conference and National Governors Association
sided with Chicago and urged the court to reinstate the ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   The law's opponents included the NAACP and other civil rights
groups, the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty and the
National Black Police Association.

MAN GETS 60 YEARS FOR GIVING DAUGHTER COCAINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROGER CROTEAU  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRAUNFELS, Texas _ A Texas jury, deciding in a
precedent-setting verdict that cocaine is a deadly weapon,
convicted a man late Wednesday of giving the narcotic to his
teen-age daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors in Comal County returned the verdict in less than an
hour and sentenced Johnny Rodriguez, 43, of New Braunfels, to 60
years in prison and ordered him to pay a $10,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   After the verdict was announced, Rodriguez's sister, Margaret
Cabell, sent the daughter sobbing from the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you are happy ... sending your father to prison,''
Cabell called after her.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-year-old daughter testified that her father gave her
cocaine when she was 14. The testimony was key to the case.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the first time Texas prosecutors have sought a finding
that cocaine is a deadly weapon _ a decision they expect to be
appealed. If it's upheld, the case could mean enhanced penalties in
other drug trials.
</P>
<P>
   Use of a deadly weapon in the commission of a crime carries
stiffer penalties in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In his closing argument, Comal County District Attorney Dib
Waldrip told jurors in this community northwest of San Antonio:
``We have an opportunity today to close a loophole in the law and
at the same time close the manhole cover on the sewer of society.''
</P>
<P>
   Waldrip said that to find that cocaine was a deadly weapon,
jurors only had to agree that the drug ``in the manner of its use
is capable of causing death or serious bodily injury.''
</P>
<P>
   In her testimony, the daughter said her father gave her cocaine
20 to 30 times between January and September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt secure because I was around him, and he was my dad, so
I did it,'' she said. ``At first I liked it, because my dad gave it
to me.''
</P>
<P>
   She appeared to carefully avoid making eye contact with her
father during her testimony. She stayed calm nearly the entire
time, only choking a couple times, especially when she told the
jury she still loves her father.
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyer Brent Free characterized Rodriguez's daughter as
a liar who used drugs, who was suspended from school and who was
kicked out of a drug rehabilitation center.
</P>
<P>
   Free said the girl made up the story at the prompting of
Rodriguez's former wife, the girl's mother, to get back at him for
not paying child support.
</P>
<P>
   Free also said common sense would lead to the conclusion that
cocaine wasn't a deadly weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mere delivery of a controlled substance is not the use of
a deadly weapon,'' he argued.
</P>
<P>
   By ruling that a deadly weapon was used, the jury ensured that
Rodriguez will have to serve at least half his sentence before
being eligible for parole.
</P>
<P>
   Without that finding, he would have to serve one-quarter of his
sentence, and possibly less if he received credit for good behavior
while in prison.

  (Eds: The word `star' in parens should be replaced by the symbol.)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in
New York City. The word ``star'' denotes a highly recommended film
or series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   Now Playing
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``BESIEGED,'' starring Thandie Newton and David Thewlis.
Directed by Bernardo Bertolucci (R, 92 minutes). Like all
Bertolucci films, this love story of an expatriate African woman
(Ms. Newton), fleeing an oppressive military regime, and the
reclusive British pianist ( Thewlis) for whom she works as a
housekeeper in Rome is a visual jewel. Based on a short story by
James Lasdun, ``Besieged'' is a film of few words and powerful
images _ especially of a military coup in a poor African country.
The love is sealed through an extraordinary act of self-sacrifice
and a deepening appreciation of each other's tastes in music. If
this elliptical movie leaves too much unsaid, it has strong
understated performances by its two stars (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``THE BUENA VISTA SOCIAL CLUB,'' with Ibrahim Ferrer,
Compay Segundo and Ry Cooder. Directed by Wim Wenders (not rated,
106 minutes). When the American guitarist and producer Ry Cooder
assembled a group of all-but-forgotten Cuban musicians to record an
album, no one expected that the record would become a phenomenon,
selling more than a million copies worldwide and revitalizing the
Cuban music scene. Wenders' ebullient documentary follows the group
on tour from Amsterdam to New York and includes interviews with the
group's main members. The music pulsates, and the pictures of
Havana compare the city's grand but faded architecture with the
musicians' weatherbeaten faces (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``ELECTION,'' &UR;  &LR; starring Matthew Broderick and Reese
Witherspoon. Directed by Alexander Payne (R, 105 minutes). From the
acerbically funny director of ``Citizen Ruth'' comes this caustic
satire of the American electoral process in a high school setting.
Its leading candidate, Tracy Flick, played tartly by Ms.
Witherspoon, has a mother who sought tactical advice for Tracy from
Connie Chung and Elizabeth Dole. Broderick plays the hapless
good-guy teacher who thinks this wicked little front-runner needs
to be stopped. And Chris Klein plays Tracy's reluctant opponent in
a style best described as early Keanu. With a lovely ear for
hypocritical conversation, the screenplay specializes in keeping
all the characters a few beats off what they actually mean (Janet
Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (star) &UR;  &LR; ``ENTRAPMENT,'' starring Sean Connery and Catherine
Zeta-Jones. Directed by Jon Amiel (PG-13, 105 minutes). This glossy
caper summons the days when being a thief was the profession of
choice among debonair movie heroes. Heroines: As the great-looking
insurance investigator who is supposedly investigating Connery's
glamorous super-burglar, Ms. Zeta-Jones makes a smashing gymnast
and heist expert in her own right. No need to believe the
outlandish details of the story; there's enough verve and charisma
to the stars to make the escapade easy on the eyes. The action
sequence, in which the stars hang off the side of the world's
largest skyscraper, is a vertiginous show stopper. Here's a nice
bonus: Nobody gets killed (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``ETERNITY AND A DAY,'' &UR;  &LR;  starring Bruno Ganz. Directed
by Theo Angelopoulos (not rated, 132 minutes). Winner of the Palme
d'Or at last year's Cannes International Film Festival, this
dreamy, lulling film is the haunting poetic valedictory of a man
spending his last day on earth. As his memory leads him across the
landscape of his life, Ganz's soulful Greek writer drifts through
his past as he seeks his life's meaning. The film's visual style is
less magnificently grandiose than the director's ``Ulysses' Gaze,''
but it roams from mood to mood with a fluid, liberating assurance.
It's a style that's both trance-inducing and filled with
unutterable emotion (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``LIMBO,'' &UR;  &LR; starring Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and
David Strathairn. Directed by John Sayles (R, 126 minutes). Part
survivalist drama, part satirical portrait of contemporary Alaska,
Sayles' powerful new film is almost as vast as the great outdoors
it contemplates. Ms. Mastrantonio, as a well-traveled folk-rock
singer working Alaskan lounges, and Strathairn, as the brooding
local fisherman with whom she becomes involved, make one of the
most compelling adult couples to be seen in an American film in
quite some time. When they find themselves castaways along with her
teen-age daughter on a remote Alaskan island, the movie becomes
both a suspense thriller and a sorrowful meditation on survivalism,
civilization and the ties that bind. Though marred by an abrupt
ending and glaring literary devices, ``Limbo'' is eminently
worthwhile (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``THE LOSS OF SEXUAL INNOCENCE,'' starring Julian Sands,
Femi Ogunbanjo and Hanne Klintoe. Written and directed by Mike
Figgis (R, 101 minutes). Figgis' visually ravishing cinematic tone
poem retells the Adam and Eve story (Adam is black and Eve is
white), interspersing it with semi-autobiographical reveries of the
director's early childhood in Kenya and his teen-age and adult
years in northern England. The strands are drawn together in a
final scene of violence and betrayal set at a film shoot in Tunisia
and reminiscent of Antonioni's film ``The Passenger.'' The film is
moody verging on melancholy, the storytelling elliptical, its view
of eroticism menacing rather than joyful. Though marred by
pretentious symbolism and an overall vagueness, this film has many
spellbinding moments (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE MATRIX,'' &UR;  &LR; starring Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne.
Directed by Andy and Larry Wachowski (R, 120 minutes). The
time-traveling story steeped in virtual reality will be all but
incomprehensible to anyone but techno freaks. And the film borrows
unapologetically from other sci-fi extravaganzas, with a big debt
to ``The X-Files'' in the paranoia department. But the storytelling
is intricately bizarre and the special effects are indeed special,
notably when it comes to midair martial arts with a gravity-defying
gusto. And Reeves shows that you can look like a Prada model while
behaving like an action hero. One of the main stars here is Bill
Pope, the cinematographer. He and the Wachowskis provide a
couch-potato epiphany; while the characters seem to be performing
marvelous feats, they're often lying stock-still in the grip of
virtual reality (Maslin).

 Undated:: virtual reality (Maslin).  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM,'' &UR;  &LR; starring Kevin Kline and
Michelle Pfeiffer. Directed by Michael Hoffman (PG-13, 115
minutes). This is potluck Shakespeare, with a wildly uneven range
of performances and no clear style holding them together. Rather
than wonder why the actors are wrestling with bicycles in
19th-century Tuscany (a setting used much less enchantingly than it
might have been), it's best to focus on the most comfortably
Shakespearean performances and not wonder what Ms. Flockhart is
doing here. Kline makes a perfect Bottom, Everett slinks
seductively through Oberon's role and Ms. Pfeiffer makes an
appropriately gorgeous fairy queen. The younger cast members are
largely used as window dressing for the Leo-Does-Romeo set
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE MUMMY,'' &UR;  &LR; starring Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, Arnold
Vosloo and John Hannah. Directed by Stephen Sommers (PG-13, 134
minutes). More like a video game than a movie, this incoherent
spoof (very loosely based on the 1932 Boris Karloff horror
classic), overloaded with cheesy special effects, suggests an
unwieldy hybrid of ``Raiders of the Lost Ark'' and ``Abbott and
Costello Meet the Mummy'' via ``Night of the Living Dead.'' The
intrepid adventurers who disturb an ancient Egyptian crypt that
carries a fearful curse are Fraser (playing a swashbuckling
American in the Foreign Legion), Ms. Weisz (as a plucky, wide-eyed
English librarian) and Hannah (as her twitty older brother). It's
all played for laughs. The only scary moments involve swarming
scarabs that burrow under the skin and do awful ``Alien''-like
things (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``NOTTING HILL,'' starring Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant.
Directed by Roger Michell (PG-13, 105 minutes). The most romantic
notion here may be that a Hollywood star as famous as Ms. Roberts
might be out, unassisted, browsing for a book. But it's enough to
bring her together with Grant's bashful bookseller and let two
extraordinarily charming actors play out an intelligent flirtation.
As written by Richard Curtis with frequent wit and welcome echoes
of his ``Four Weddings and a Funeral,'' this is a bright, winsome
romantic comedy that's as teasing as the characters themselves,
inviting the audience to ponder the movie star's burdens of being
world famous and desperately attractive (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE,'' &UR;  &LR;  starring Joseph Fiennes and
Gwyneth Paltrow. Directed by John Madden (R, 113 minutes). A witty,
sexy and merrily literate delight, with an exhilaratingly clever
premise that only gets better as the film unfolds. The screenplay,
originating as Marc Norman's brainstorm and turned by Tom Stoppard
into razor-sharp dialogue, dares to imagine whatever it likes about
the link between Shakespeare's artistic passions and his mad
yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty. Meanwhile, this
tirelessly inventive comedy envisions an Elizabethan theater
fraught with the same backbiting and conniving we enjoy today and
has great fun presenting the creation of ``Romeo and Juliet,''
glitches and all. Fiennes and Ms. Paltrow make a fine, tempestuous
duo, and she gives the first great, fully realized starring
performance of her career (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``STAR WARS: EPISODE I _ THE PHANTOM MENACE,'' &UR;  &LR; starring
Liam Neeson. Directed by George Lucas (PG-13, 132 minutes).
Stripped of hype and breathless expectations, Lucas' first
installment offers a happy surprise: it's up to snuff. It sustains
the gee-whiz spirit of the series and offers a swashbuckling
extra-galactic getaway, creating illusions that are even more
plausible than the kitchen-raiding raptors of ``Jurassic Park.''
While the human stars here are indeed reduced to playing action
figures, they are upstaged by amazing backdrops and hordes of
crazily lifelike space beings as the Lewis Carroll in Lucas is
given free rein. The ``Star Wars'' franchise was funnier and
scrappier when it was new. But it simply wasn't capable of this
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``TEA WITH MUSSOLINI,'' &UR;  &LR; starring Cher, Dame Judi Dench, Joan
Plowright, Dame Maggie Smith and Lily Tomlin. Directed by Franco
Zeffirelli (PG, 117 minutes). The screen divas (especially Dame
Maggie) who give ``Tea With Mussolini'' a patina of class obviously
relish chewing the scenery in this sudsy historical drama (adapted
from a chapter of Zeffirelli's autobiography) about a circle of
English expatriate women living in Florence on the eve of World War
II. Dame Maggie, a quintessential British snob, is the leader of
the pack, nicknamed the Scorpioni, whose comfortable lives are
shattered when the Fascists rise to power and they find themselves
carted off to another city where they are held under house arrest.
Cher is her usual likable self as a free-spending, free-loving
wealthy American heiress and art collector who befriends the group
(Holden).
</P>
<P>
   (star) ``THE WINSLOW BOY,'' &UR;  &LR; starring Nigel Hawthorne, Rebecca
Pidgeon and Jeremy Northam. Written and directed by David Mamet (G,
110 minutes). Terence Rattigan's play about the 1910 schoolboy's
trial that created a furor in England has been artfully pared down
to its essentials in this stately and deliberate adaptation. Played
with unusually effective restraint by a fine, meticulous cast, it
works as a precisely calibrated war of nerves in which the family
of a cadet accused of theft is quietly staggered by the
consequences of that accusation. Benoit Delhomme's cinematography
is beautifully lucid and painterly. Ms. Pidgeon's defiantly arch
acting style sets the film's tone and gives her suffragist
character a sharp edge (Maslin). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Film Series
</P>
<P>
   ``MAD MASQUERADE: VALENTINO, FAIRBANKS, BARRYMORE AND CHANEY IN
THE JAZZ AGE.'' It's back to the jazz age, silent films, piano
accompaniments and stars like Rudolph Valentino, Douglas Fairbanks,
John Barrymore and Lon Chaney in this series, which begins tomorrow
at the American Museum of the Moving Image. Billed as a
retro-retrospective, the series, which runs through June 27,
examines the evolution of the screen image of these stars by means
of a dozen movies that span the years from 1915 to 1928. Among them
are ``The Lamb'' (1915), starring Fairbanks, which opens the series
at 2 p.m. Saturday, followed at 4:30 by ``Dr. Jekyll and Hyde''
(1920), starring Barrymore. Other films in the series include ``The
Sheik'' (1921), with Valentino; ``He Who Gets Slapped'' (1924) and
``Phantom of the Opera'' (1925), both with Chaney, and ``The Three
Musketeers'' (1921) and ``The Thief of Bagdad'' (1924), both with
Fairbanks. The series is based on ``The Mad Masquerade: Stardom and
Masculinity in the Jazz Age,'' by the film historian Gaylyn
Studlar, who will introduce ``The Lamb.'' Admission: $8.50 for
adults; $5.50 for those over 65 and students with ID; $4.50 for
children from 5 to 18, and free to children under 4. Information:
(718) 784-0077.

 &HT;    INTERNET ECONOMY BEATS EXPECTATIONS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The booming domestic Internet economy now rivals or
exceeds the revenues of such veteran sectors as autos, energy
utilities and telecommunications, a major academic study concluded
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The study estimates that the Internet economy grew by 174
percent a year between 1995 and 1998 to reach $301 billion, at the
same time that the nation's gross domestic product was expanding at
a compounded annual rate of 2.8 percent to reach $7.5 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers concluded that the U.S. domestic Internet
economy ``by itself is one of the major economies in the world.''
If it were a nation, it would rank just behind Switzerland and
ahead of Argentina in terms of gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   ``In less than a decade we've done what other industries have
done in 100 years,'' said John Chambers, chief executive officer of
Cisco Systems Inc., a major provider of Internet routing equipment
that sponsored the path-breaking University of Texas survey.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas researchers said they compiled their results by
observing 3,100 U.S. companies that generate all or part of their
revenues from Internet products or services.
</P>
<P>
   As defined by the researchers, the Internet economy is made up
of companies that directly generate all or some part of their
revenues from Internet-related products and services, such as
Cisco, Dell Computer and IBM Corp.
</P>
<P>
   To this group, they added both pure Internet sellers such as
Amazon.com and eToys.com, and also measured the cyberspace business
of such traditional firms as L.L. Bean.
</P>
<P>
   The team found that electronic commerce, the most readily
visible component of the Internet economy, generated $102 billion
of revenue in the United States in 1998. It also estimated that the
average revenue per Internet employee was $250,000 last year,
against an overall U.S. average of $160,000 for non-Internet
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The $301 billion overall value placed on the Internet economy
contrasts favorably with autos (at $350 billion),
telecommunications ($270 billion) and utilities ($223 billion) but
still does not come close to rivaling the banking sector at $7.9
trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Commerce Department said it will begin
tracking annual consumer sales across the Internet. But the figures
from last year's activity will not be available until mid-2000.
Earlier studies placed current Internet sales at about 1 per cent
of all retail sales.
</P>
<P>
   With the promise of continued financing from Cisco, the research
team plans to create a quarterly index of the Internet economy and
to expand their survey to other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers said he had been trotting around the globe lately in an
effort to show top government and business leaders how the Internet
is rapidly transforming their own economies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've recently met with (British Prime Minister) Tony Blair and
(Chinese President) Jiang Zemin,'' Chambers noted. ``Four years
ago, when I traveled abroad, I'd consider myself fortunate if I
could get a few minutes with a company's chief information
officer.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Cisco's fortunes have risen to a current market
capitalization of some $175 billion, placing it as the fastest
growing firm ever to be listed on the Nasdaq exchange. Such
reserves proved more than ample to underwrite the work Andrew
Whinston and Anitesh Burua, two senior professors from the
University of Texas Graduate School of Business, who came here from
Austin to present their findings.

`OUT OF SEASON': A PROMISING BEGINNING

<P>
   Will Micki and Roberta become lovers? Will Micki and Roberta be
together when ``Out of Season'' reaches its conclusion?
</P>
<P>
   Never for a moment are the answers in doubt in this serious,
competent and unsurprising debut film, made by Jeannette Buck as a
thesis project for her master's degree in fine arts at Ohio
University.
</P>
<P>
   Set in Cape May, N.J., in the months after the tourists have
gone, the story, written by Kim McNabb, a co-producer, tells of a
lesbian, Micki Silva (Carol Monda), a wary, rolling stone of a
professional photographer who comes to town to take care of her
kindly old uncle, Charlie (Dennis Fecteau).
</P>
<P>
   Micki has only reluctantly accepted the assignment from her
family. She is not the epitome of warmth, says she knows how to
cook only one dish and is uncomfortable attending to a dying man,
even one who has his good days.
</P>
<P>
   But when Micki lays eyes on Roberta (Joy Kelly), a lesbian who
works as a short-order cook at a coffee shop and is also a devoted
friend of Charlie's, she is determined to establish a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Micki and the 40-ish Roberta, who is both warm and wise, spar
through a good part of the film. Roberta senses that Micki doesn't
plan to stay around for long and isn't eager to encourage her. But
Micki presses on, while the wheezing, coughing, bearded Charlie,
like a benevolent old Santa Claus, referees, manipulates and
ultimately blesses their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently working on a shoestring budget, Ms. Buck takes
advantage of the physical and natural attractiveness of Cape May,
avoids easy sentiment, resists the impulse to transform the
difficult Micki into a sudden bundle of radiant charm and lets Ms.
Kelly shine as a worthy object of love.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of Season,'' which opens oday at the Quad Cinema, is a
modest movie but a promising beginning.
</P>

NASCAR STRANGLEHOLD: EIGHT TEAMS DOMINATING RACING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also CAR-NASCAR-KENSETH) 
(mk) 
 BY PATRICK ZIER   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you ask the people who promote NASCAR, most will tell you
this has been a competitive Winston Cup season.
</P>
<P>
   They can quote stats like nine different winners in 13 events,
35 different cars that have led laps, and a margin of victory that
averages out to just over a second in most races.
</P>
<P>
   But numbers don't always tell the whole story. While the numbers
imply that most races turn into heated battles, that is not always
the case.
</P>
<P>
   If there is competition, it is a competition among the few,
especially when it comes to winning.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last five years, and over the last three in particular,
eight teams and drivers have dominated Winston Cup.
</P>
<P>
   And while there is evidence that some, like Rusty Wallace, Dale
Earnhardt and Terry Labonte, are slipping, for the most part, these
eight teams rule.
</P>
<P>
   They are the cars driven by Jeff Burton, Earnhardt, Jeff Gordon,
Dale Jarrett, Bobby Labonte, Terry Labonte, Mark Martin and
Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon has won the Winston Cup three times, 1995, '97 and '98;
Terry Labonte won in 1996; and Jarrett is leading this year.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, seven of the eight are in the top eight in points.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, five of the eight finished in the top eight. In 1996,
six of the eight were in the top eight in points and in 1997 and
1998 seven of the eight were in the top eight, with Wallace ninth
in '97 and Terry Labonte ninth in '98.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly in the last three years, when Burton came of age
after joining Jack Roush's multicar team in 1996, this group has
had a stranglehold on Winston Cup racing.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, these eight drivers have won 12 of the 13
races.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, they won 30 of 33, and in 1996, they won 27 of 32.
</P>
<P>
   Even within the group itself, over the last three years there
has been a dominant clique of four _ Gordon, Burton, Jarrett and
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   That group has won eight of the 13 races so far, and between
them, the foursome has won 57 of 78 races since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, still a tigerish competitor at 40, says you could break
it down even more this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just coincidence that it's been more competitive,''
Martin said. ``Gordon has had problems in a number of races he
could have won and didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burton won three and could have won more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could easily have been the Jeff Gordon and Jeff Burton
show, but it hasn't, and that's good for the sport,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, another veteran who has not been quite as strong as he
once was but who still seems determined to battle with the best,
says it's difficult to jump into Winston Cup and become a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starting a team is nothing,'' Wallace said. ``Getting a team
and buying equipment is one thing, but your key thing is the engine
deal and your driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only drivers that are consistently successful are the
drivers that know how to tell their crew chiefs what to do with
their car and guide them along.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said Gordon has ``this unbelievable communication'' with
his crew chief, Ray Evernham. ``Gordon could just blink his eye and
Evernham knows what he means,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of relationship I used to have with Jimmy
Makar when I first started and now I feel I'm pretty close to that
with my guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Developing the relationship between the driver and the crew
chief, along with the chassis guy, is the toughest thing in the
world,'' Wallace declared.
</P>
<P>
   Makar is now Bobby Labonte's crew chief and supervising a
two-car team that features Labonte and Tony Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is a rookie, Stewart is one of a few drivers who may
succeed in breaking the stranglehold of the elite eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a very capable effort from Stewart and Bobby
Labonte,'' Martin said, ``but it's still pretty much like any other
year.''

`CHANGE': A NEW BAND INVIGORATES CHICK COREA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's no question that Chick Corea's recently formed band,
Origin, has invigorated him. There's so much and so many different
kinds of jazz writing on ``Change'' (Stretch/Concord), his new
album that it sounds like a competitive young band leader angling
for his first precious shot of attention, rather than a figure who
has been well known for 30 years and weathered one conceptual
overhaul after another.
</P>
<P>
   Origin _ a New York crew including the saxophonists Steve Wilson
and Bob Sheppard, the bassist Avishai Cohen, the trombonist Steve
Davis and the drummer Jeff Ballard _ is precise, relentlessly
playful with melody and rhythmically alert as it negotiates the
tango, flamenco, blues and splintered-melody mazes. (One number,
``L.A. Scenes,'' sounds like a cross between Eric Dolphy and
particularly evocative crime-film soundtrack music.) The structure
of many of the arrangements is staggered: A quiet, pedaled solo
piano passage segues into a saxophone-trombone duet that leads to a
line for double-bass and bass clarinet.
</P>
<P>
   A result is that the tunes create their own forward motion,
never stalling in the round-robin soloing that bedevils so much
mainstream jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Corea gets his say, though, especially in the trio ballad
``Compassion,'' and in uptempo pieces his fluid, skating lines skid
to a shuddering stop on dark chords. It's smart, exacting music.

KENSETH READIES FOR WINSTON MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also CAR-NASCAR-TEAMS) 
(mk) 
 By PATRICK ZIER   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Matt Kenseth has made his choice. Now, he can only hope it's the
right one.
</P>
<P>
   Kenseth, 27, has announced he will move from the Busch Series to
Winston Cup next year in a car owned by Jack Roush and Mark Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Almost up to the final minute, General Motors worked hard to
keep Kenseth, now in a Chevy, from defecting to Roush and Ford.
</P>
<P>
   According to reports, three Winston Cup car owners, including
Richard Childress and Joe Gibbs, made a run at Kenseth in an effort
to lure him away from Roush.
</P>
<P>
   But in part because Martin has become a mentor to him, Kenseth
stuck to his earlier commitment.
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt Kenseth will succeed in Winston Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Some say he is, potentially, a better driver than his good
friend Dale Earnhardt Jr., who will also move full time to Winston
Cup in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain. Kenseth will make the jump without the
kind of scrutiny, or the kind of pressure, that will fall on Little
E.
</P>
<P>
   That should help.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he made the right decision by joining Roush, though,
remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, it can be argued that Roush owns the top Ford
multicar team. It can also be argued that he owns the worst.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Roush runs five cars, with at least one, driven by
Kevin Lepage, in danger of losing its sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   That's because of the five Roush cars, two, driven by Martin and
Jeff Burton under the charge of Buddy Parrott, run extremely well,
while the other three don't perform at all.
</P>
<P>
   Because Martin is Roush's top driver and because he has a stake
in the Kenseth operation, one would think Kenseth will get the kind
of help he needs to be successful.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no guarantees. While in theory, the five Roush
entries all have equal access to parts and information, clearly,
they do not work together.
</P>
<P>
   After winning the Coca-Cola 600 recently, Burton made the
following comment while talking about rivals Bobby Labonte and Tony
Stewart:
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we have helped that team become better by being an
example of how a two-car team can operate,'' Burton said.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, plans are for Kenseth to be housed with one of
Roush's other cars, not Martin and Burton.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps his association with Martin will ensure that he will
not be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   That will be critical, because by itself, doing well in the
Busch Series has not guaranteed success at the Winston Cup level,
and unless Kenseth gets the best Roush has to offer he is going to
struggle, no matter how much potential he has.

THE SERMON IN THE SLUDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes appear at end of review.)  
(DW) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Logorrhea isn't just a word in a spelling bee.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the term that describes the condition that reduces
the preachy and artistically questionable ``Noah's Archives'' to
sludge.
</P>
<P>
   Playing through June 26 at the Ohio Theater in SoHo, this
sophomoric play by Stephen Spoonamore is an enterprise of Ransom
Productions, whose publicity describes it as a nonprofit theater
company that uses corporate money to finance consciousness-raising
theatrical productions and turns over the proceeds to active
grass-roots organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In this case the beneficiary is said to be Riverkeeper, an
organization devoted to protecting the ecological integrity of the
Hudson River watershed by tracking down and stopping polluters.
</P>
<P>
   With a pedigree like that, little wonder that ``Noah's
Archives,'' directed by Darcy Marta, plays like a clumsy
infomercial whose underlying message is ``Be good to planet
Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Essentially the play is a story of the second coming of Noah's
Ark. A flood that sweeps away the 20th-century characters for more
than three years aboard an ark with Noah, his son Shem and a
menagerie of 36,341 species of unseen creatures serves as the
medium for telling audiences to cast aside selfish concerns and
preserve the environment.
</P>
<P>
   This long-winded sermon, which taps the talents of actors who
deserve better but never invests its ideas with genuine drama or
intellectual conflict, begins in a Canal Street bar on a rainy
night.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the gathering storm comes a motley crowd, including Shem
and his shaggy father, as well as a group of young women and men,
all without dates. Through the first act these characters deliver
what might be construed as philosophical stand-up comedy routines
about their sex lives, if wit or humor graced the monologues.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally Shem reveals himself as a man with a past and
relates the history of Canal Street (a canal filled in with old
arks, he says), and at the end of the first act, as the storm
gathers intensity and the characters pair off, the bar is swept
away on the rising waters.
</P>
<P>
   In the second act, with all the women pregnant, the war between
the sexes still raging and the bar-as-ark adrift and leaking
dangerously, Shem is still expounding on ecological perils and now
trying as well to read God's mind.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, a three-piece band furnishes interludes of
lively music.
</P>
<P>
   Like the band on ``Titanic,'' these musicians can't save
``Noah's Archives'' from sinking.

THE BOREDOMS: PROFUNDITY VIA REPETITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Boredoms, from Osaka, Japan, were
semi-demi-famous in the early 1990s for playing miniatures _
writhing, howling, spasmic, cartoon art-punk built on split-second
timing. But even the most outre rock band in the world has become
more patient with age: It's now after continuity and profundity,
and the Boredoms have figured out that repetition is the quickest
route to the profound in popular music.
</P>
<P>
   The band's remarkable set at the South Street Seaport Atrium on
Wednesday night, part of the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival, operated
like gospel music at its most urgent: It set up a short chant over
a sea of rhythm, repeating it endlessly, bringing the energy level
up higher and higher until you thought it had to stop or mutate.
But the chant continued. And continued. And continued.
</P>
<P>
   The set began with organ tones, and the drummer Yoshimi chanted
a phrase, sitting between two other drummers (one with the standard
drums replaced by congas and bongos); the singer Yamantaka Eye
answered her. Suddenly, all three drummers hit their cymbals
together and began to pound out a two-beat rhythm in lock step; the
pieces rocked back and forth between two chords, with the bassist
and guitarist seesawing their parts.
</P>
<P>
   Eye used to flail his rail-thin body around in a kind of parody
of martial arts movement; on Wednesday, under a long tangle of
dreadlocks, he stayed in one place and shook. He raised his eyes
prayerfully to the ceiling and then lowered them back to the crowd,
positioned next to a table of electronic effects to modulate his
voice, and chanted short-syllable words swathed in echo. The first
mesmerizing piece lasted 40 minutes; later moments had similarity
to the Grateful Dead's ``Space'' concert interludes and the
chugging bliss of German art-rock from the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   These were simple formulas similar to what is heard on the
band's most recent album, ``Super Ae'' (Birdman), and the band put
everything into making it work.
</P>
<P>
   Preceding the Boredoms was an off-the-cuff improvised set by
John Zorn on saxophone, Fred Frith on guitar, Bill Laswell on bass
and Dave Lombardo on drums. The first three are old friends, hubs
of the early '80s experimental-music scene that made the Knitting
Factory (and thus the Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival) possible;
Lombardo, the former drummer from the death-metal band Slayer,
should have been the odd man out.
</P>
<P>
   But their first encounter as a quartet was completely functional
_ even warm and touching in places, in a funny way _ and Lombardo
was much of the reason why.
</P>
<P>
   He set the tone, playing stomps festooned with galloping
double-bass drum palpitations, and even, at one point, the rhythm
from James Brown's ``Cold Sweat''; the others fell into natural
patterns around him. Frith tapped his guitar strings with
paintbrushes and tiny chains; Zorn howled and blasted through the
alto saxophone, and Laswell played giant, greasy, fuzzy bass lines.

MAGMA: A BAND CLEARLY FROM EARTH (MORE PRECISELY, FRANCE) 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The progressive rock of the 1970s was a magnificent
paradox: meticulously ordered music that carried out some of rock's
most off-the-wall impulses. It threw together romantic pop and
modernist dissonance, complex structures and stretches of
improvisation, ethereal reveries and earthy stomps, all in
arbitrary proportions that showed off musicians' memories as much
as they served the songs. Magma, a French band that played its
first New York concert since 1973 at Wetlands on Tuesday night,
took those attributes to its own extreme.
</P>
<P>
   While progressive rock bands were always inventing fantasy
worlds and science-fiction legends, Magma also came up with a new
language, Kobaian, to depict a myth that placed Earth and Kobaia in
the midst of interplanetary strife. It made a handy framework for
music with epic ambitions; Wednesday's 90-minute set included four
songs. The music, first recorded by Magma in the early '70s, was
still recognizably from Earth, and Europe in particular.
</P>
<P>
   The current group includes two of Magma's core members from the
'70s, Christian Vander on drums and his wife, Stella Vander, on
vocals and keyboard. Vander, Magma's leader and songwriter, had
classical piano training and jazz inclinations; outside Magma,
which broke up for the first time in 1977, he has made jazz and
jazz-rock albums.
</P>
<P>
   At Wetlands, each song was a suite with recurring movements,
near-symphonic crescendos, speed-fingered melody lines and plenty
of idiom hopping. When Vander sang, in a robust baritone, his
melodies started as a kind of operatic recitative and turned into a
babble like scat singing. There were bombastic fuzz-toned marches,
brisk trio jazz passages (with Emmanuel Borghi on electric piano),
virtuosic dialogues between instruments and voices, and long,
circuitous buildups that started with airy vocal harmonies and
added the muscularity of a rock band.
</P>
<P>
   The music glimmered, crunched, sprinted and exulted, drawing
power from the possibility that at any moment it could take another
tangent.

NEWSPAPER BANS CERTAIN GUN ADS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKELAND, Fla. _ From 9 mm pistols complete with 15-round clips
to a weapon called a .223-caliber Bushmaster, classified
advertising sections in newspapers have been a fertile hunting
ground for gun seekers.
</P>
<P>
   But no more for The Ledger in Lakeland.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a moral dilemma in providing a forum for such sales,
Ledger publisher Don Whitworth said the newspaper would no longer
accept advertisements for assault weapons and handguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we have a right to bear arms,'' said Whitworth, who
goes on quail hunts three or four times a year. ``I also believe in
responsible gun ownership. But I'm opposed to a free market for
weapons such as cheap Saturday night specials or assault weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ledger's gun advertising policy is thought to be one of the
first of its kind in the state, said Dick Shelton, executive
director of the Florida Press Association.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, nine newspapers that responded to a 1997 survey said
they had restrictions on classified advertising for guns. The
survey was conducted by Editor &AMP; Publisher magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In Lakeland, handgun and assault weapon advertising will be
banned as a result of a series of events, Whitworth said.
</P>
<P>
   _ A fatal shooting in the newspaper's lobby in the early 1980s
in which an employee was killed by a man who then shot himself. At
the time, Whitworth ended up assisting medical personnel.
</P>
<P>
   _ The killing of a 4-year-old and three Tampa area law
enforcement officers in a daylong shooting rampage last year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Florida voters' deciding last November to authorize more
police background checks at gun shows and flea markets.
</P>
<P>
   _ The high school carnage caused by students with weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The new advertisement policy was slammed by some gun defenders
and cheered by others. Some said the policy doesn't go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the next time I am looking for a gun I'll buy another
newspaper,'' said Michael Baxter, owner of Sunshine Taxidermy in
Lakeland, which preserves fish, hogs, deer and other prey. Baxter
said he depends on a gun, a Rottweiler and an alarm system to
protect his business from burglars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I commend the publisher for the decision,'' said criminology
expert Risdon Slate, an associate professor at Florida Southern
College in Lakeland. ``I don't think that newspapers should be
facilitating that kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Slate said that the media should refuse to identify juveniles
who commit horrible crimes, such as the mass slaughter in
Littleton, Col. ``I don't think these people should have their
names in the newspaper,'' said Slate. Cut back on the opportunity
to become famous for dastardly acts, he said, and crime might be
reduced.
</P>
<P>
   State voters last year approved a constitutional revision giving
counties the right to require that all gun sales _ not just those
by dealers _ be subject to background checks. Several counties in
Florida have adopted such requirements, although Polk, where
Lakeland is located, has not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laws have been passed to ensure that only responsible
individuals can purchase weapons,'' said Whitworth. ``Well, I
happen to agree with those laws.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ledger doesn't want to be a party to the sale of certain
weapons where the buyer might otherwise be unable to obtain a
weapon, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to help anyone beat the system,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Whitworth said the policy would not necessarily ban all ads for
gun shows, which are popular in Polk County. But he said if the ad
included the availability of a .44 magnum, it would not be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   He did not estimate the amount of revenue potentially lost
because of the decision but said it was not a factor.

CATHAY PACIFIC AIR REACHES DEAL WITH PILOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WAYNE ARNOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ Less than a day before a deadline to sign new
contracts or be dismissed, pilots at Cathay Pacific Airways agreed
Thursday to pay cuts in return for being let back into the cockpits
of Cathay's cargo planes for the first time in almost four years.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which surprised analysts, ended a bitter 11-month
deadlock that left more than half the Hong Kong carrier's flights
grounded this month as pilots staged an unofficial sickout.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long-term benefits of the agreement will far outweigh some
of the short-term pain that we've had to suffer,'' said Tony Tyler,
Cathay's director of corporate development. After two long
negotiating sessions Wednesday evening and Thursday,
representatives of Cathay's roughly 1,300 cockpit crew members were
set to take the agreement to an extraordinary meeting of members
Thursday night for ratification. They could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's government welcomed the deal. Cathay's flight
cancellations had disrupted business travel out of the city,
leading some analysts to speculate that the economy could suffer.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler said the union had agreed to salary reductions for senior
pilots of between 7 percent and 22 percent in return for stock
options. Cathay estimates the cuts will save it roughly $1.4
billion (Hong Kong), or $180.5 million (U.S.), over the next 10
years. In return, the airline agreed to larger raises for junior
pilots and to leave benefits unchanged for three years, Tyler said.
</P>
<P>
   But the most interesting concession by the carrier was an
agreement to put its pilots back in cargo planes. The airline began
contracting cargo flights to a subsidiary in 1995 to cut costs. The
move embittered Cathay's pilots, who said it diminished their
ability to accrue seniority.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler said no pilots from the subsidiary would lose their jobs
with the return of the Cathay pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the union ratifies the agreement, the pilots still must
notify the airline of their acceptance individually by noon Friday
under a management-imposed deadline. Pilots also have the option of
resigning in return for a severance bonus.
</P>
<P>
   The airline imposed the deadline late last month and threatened
to lay off any pilots who refused either option. Cathay's ultimatum
provoked a rash of sick leaves by pilots who said they were too
anxious to fly. Analysts estimated the airline was losing $30
million (Hong Kong), or $3.9 million (U.S.), a day in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots had also threatened to call a strike vote if any were
dismissed. That threat appears to have abated for the time being,
but one analyst said the airline would not recover immediately as a
work force scattered around the globe gradually returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will obviously take some work to get the business back in
operation considering so many flights were canceled,'' said Peter
Negline, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in Hong Kong. Cathay
also must cancel charter flight arrangements with 13 different
airlines it had made to carry passengers stranded by its pilotless
planes.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry experts warned that the months of rancor had left
pilots so bitter that some would choose to leave the airline Friday
despite the agreement. Even those who come back to work might still
find ways to vent their frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pilots who fly smart are saving an airline thousands and
thousands of dollars every day,'' said Jim Eckes, managing director
of Indoswiss Aviation, an airline consulting firm in Hong Kong.
``If these people lose their ambition to save the company money,
Cathay will end up bearing losses that you can't point to.'' Tyler
said he was confident the pilots' new stock options would keep them
mindful of profits. &QL;

LEARNING THAT KARATE'S BLOWS GO HAND IN HAND WITH MANNERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I admit to having aimed a premeditated kick at the
head of a lawyer named Brent Stevens. He promptly hit me three
times.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, we bowed politely to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Our fight took place under the critical stare of Masataka Mori,
a director of the Japan Karate Association and its chief instructor
in North America. At the Shotokan Karate-do of New York, his modest
dojo, or training hall, on Manhattan's Upper West Side, Mori
teaches a karate as classically Japanese as anything found east of
Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   Sweating for an hour or so under the tutelage of Mori, who holds
a stratospheric eighth-degree black belt rank, is like visiting
Japan without having to buy an airline ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Before each class, lawyers, police officers and teachers fall to
their knees to mop the floor with damp rags. The commands are given
in Japanese. Classes begin and end with meditation and ceremonial
bows. A late arrival must kneel, awaiting Mori's eventual
invitation to join the class.
</P>
<P>
   And black belts who perform sloppily may feel the chastening
sting of Mori's shinai _ a swordlike bamboo stick _ on the
offending foot or arm.
</P>
<P>
   For Mori, karate is not about mayhem, but about balance, focus
and proper breathing. Karate's roots, he said, lie in the same
Japanese traditions as kendo, the art of sword fighting, or
ikebana, the art of flower arranging.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the philosophy of karate,'' Mori said. ``It stresses
manners, sincerity, modesty and courage, truthfulness and respect.
I do not believe you will find these in all other sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Yasunobu Ohama, a lightning-fast young black belt who learned
his karate techniques at his father's dojo in Osaka, said
traditional masters like Mori were getting harder to find, even in
Japan. ``He is a Japanese samurai,'' Ohama said respectfully.
</P>
<P>
   Every karate dojo assumes the personality of its sensei, or
teacher. Mori preaches perseverance, arguing that in defeat lie the
seeds of future victory. ``There are people who become trapped in
their daily tasks, who do not strive beyond their routine,'' he
said. ``If they were to train in the rigors of karate, I believe
they would be able to overcome this situation.''
</P>
<P>
   His gospel of constant striving attracts serious black belts
along with white-belted novices. ``I think the idea of trying to
make yourself better with every technique and every move makes you
realize your continuing imperfections,'' said David Eng-Wong, a
teachers' union representative who was promoted recently to
san-dan, or third-degree black belt. ``And Sensei Mori is always
good for keeping you humble.''
</P>
<P>
   For the likes of Brent Stevens and me, karate becomes our way of
sweating away tension and cleansing the mind of the week's
accumulated frustrations. ``It's a stress-reliever for me,'' said
Stevens, who drives in from Montclair, N.J., to train under Mori on
weeknights and Saturdays. ``If I go three days without training, I
get uptight.''
</P>
<P>
   I took up karate to improve my coordination for rock climbing
and skiing, two sports that I try to keep up when I escape the
city. On evenings or weekends when I can't get away, karate has
become a satisfying solution for cross-training.
</P>
<P>
   Even before I earned my black belt, I became engrossed in a
martial art whose shadowy roots extend back at least eight
centuries to the fighting monks of the Shaolin temple in central
China. Their self-defense techniques migrated to other parts of
Asia, notably Okinawa. According to tradition, after the island's
overlords banned the carrying of weapons, Okinawans refined their
unarmed combat.
</P>
<P>
   Gichin Funikoshi, an Okinawan expert born in 1869, exported
karate to the rest of Japan in the early 20th century. Before his
death in 1957 at the age of 88, he helped found the Japan Karate
Association and promulgated shotokan karate as a sport and a way of
life. Shotokan means ``Shoto's dojo.'' Shoto was the pen name
Funikoshi used for his calligraphy, said Isami Shiroma, a
fifth-degree degree black belt from Okinawa who helps teach when
Mori is away in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Funikoshi's portrait hangs reverentially in the dojo, flanked by
faded Japanese and American flags.
</P>
<P>
   While just about everyone claims to know what karate is, not
many have seen it done correctly. Karate, meaning ``empty hand'' in
Japanese, employs a devastating combination of punches, kicks and
elbow or knee strikes. It generates dynamic power by contracting
and expanding the body, adding torque by rotating the hips. Its
kime, or focus, unleashes maximum force against areas like the
solar plexus where an opponent is most vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It requires explosive power at the moment of focus,'' Mori
explained.
</P>
<P>
   He made us maintain shotokan's distinctively low stance, which
strengthens the leg muscles. Constant kicking and punching work the
cardiovascular system as thoroughly as any aerobics class.
Extensive stretching beforehand minimizes injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karate involves training the entire body, not just one part,''
Mori said. Sometimes his classes end with situps or pushups, but he
frowns upon lifting weights. ``The movement of your body and the
kicking or blocking techniques become slower,'' Mori said.
``Because your muscles are tight, you will not be able to move as
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   He led us through the typical Japanese curriculum of kihon, or
fundamentals; kata, or balletlike drills, and kumite, or sparring.
</P>
<P>
   Kihon involves learning to make weapons of the body's hard
surfaces. A leg, for example, can be employed quite differently to
deliver a snap kick, a thrust kick, a roundhouse kick or a back
kick.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Kata is a vigorous sequence of blocks and counterattacks against
imaginary opponents from all directions. Each kata must be
memorized and may number as many as 65 moves, some so subtle that
even experts debate what they mean.
</P>
<P>
   Kumite is the fighting itself, taught in stages to prevent
students from hurting each other or themselves. Mori does not let
anyone progress to free-fighting without grasping the basics. Even
here, punches or kicks must be controlled, stopping just short of
an opponent's face or stomach. In the heat of a tournament, of
course, kumite can turn rough.
</P>
<P>
   The belt grading creates an incentive to improve. The Japan
Karate Association recognizes two grades of white, three grades of
green and three grades of brown belt. It takes three to five years
of constant training to reach basic black belt.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some other styles of karate, the Japan Karate Association
has the advantage of accrediting dojos around the world. This gives
the belts earned international status and lets you train on
business trips and vacations at dojos in other cities or countries.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is potentially lethal, karate is controlled by strict
etiquette. Even on a dojo floor glistening with sweat, Mori demands
that courtesy prevail, and his glare is enough to chastise anyone
stepping out of line.
</P>
<P>
   He exhorted us to concentrate on our opponents, release the
tension from shoulders and arms and breathe lightly. ``Breathe
through your navel,'' he said. The celebrated kiai, or explosive
yell that accompanies a punch or kick, has the purpose of focusing
power as well as startling the opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If fear makes your breathing erratic, if you tense your
shoulders or open your mouth while breathing, you give away your
breathing to your opponent and you are no longer in the dominating
position,'' Mori said. ``Breathing has to be natural, like weeping
willow branches in the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Mori's persistent tutelage, we practiced maximizing the
power of our punches by pulling back one arm as the other shot
forward, and our kicks by snapping back the leg like a whip. He had
us slide forward without stomping by pushing off with the back
foot. He tolerated no timid or indecisive moves, insisting that
each blow be focused before proceeding to the next block or punch.
He even nagged us about keeping our fists clenched tightly to avoid
fracturing knuckles or fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Mori is no easy taskmaster, but his insistence on perfection has
earned scores of trophies for his students in tournament
competition. Most other karate teachers give prominent display to
their tournament trophies. At Mori's dojo, they sit crammed on a
back shelf of the men's dressing room, stored under plastic
sheeting to keep from gathering dust.
</P>
<P>
   Winning, Mori told us, should be apparent in his students'
demeanor. We concluded every class by kneeling to recite after him
the dojo kun, or traditional rules of the Japan Karate Association:
``Seek perfection of character. Be faithful. Endeavor. Respect
others, and refrain from violent behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   The quality of a dojo is reflected in its attention to
beginners. Every black belt, after all, started out as a white
belt. Mori has achieved one of the highest ranks in the Japan
Karate Association, but is unusual in liking to teach beginners
himself. About one-third of them sign up for self-defense; the
others, he said, seek karate to improve themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Mori, who moves with a grace belying his 66 years, saw no reason
why anyone should quit. ``In Japan and other countries, the elderly
will not stop training,'' he said. ``They will concentrate their
heart and soul on the spiritual aspect of karate.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, karate has another advantage. Richard Roach, a retired
Wall Street stockbroker in his 60s, has been training with Mori for
years. Leaving a bar one night last year, Roach was accosted by
four muggers. He fought back until his assailants fled, leaving him
with his watch and wallet _ and a broken hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years Sensei Mori kept telling me to keep my fists
closed,'' he confessed with chagrin. ``Now I know why.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Masataka Mori's dojo, the Shotokan Karate-do of New York, is on
the fourth floor at 2121 Broadway, between 74th and 75th Streets,
in Manhattan, (212) 799-5500. In Brooklyn, Shu Takahashi, a
sixth-degree black belt instructor for the Japan Karate
Association, teaches at 565 Fifth Ave., between 15th and 16th
Streets, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 768-9345.

`RETURN WITH HONOR': TRUE TALES OF HEROISM FROM VIETNAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Return With Honor,'' Freida Lee Mock and Terry Sanders'
gripping documentary film about U.S. pilots shot down over North
Vietnam, signifies a major shift in the screen image of the Vietnam
veteran. Until recently, that image, formed by dozens of Hollywood
films steeped in anti-war angst, tended to portray the Vietnam
veteran as a tormented lost soul, the permanently damaged survivor
of a nihilistic hell too terrible to be put into words.
</P>
<P>
   Now the pendulum has swung. In the era of ``Saving Private
Ryan'' (Tom Hanks is credited as ``presenting'' ``Return With
Honor'') and Tom Brokaw's book, ``The Greatest Generation,'' a
traditional image of American heroism has recrystallized in the
popular imagination.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Return With Honor,'' more than 20 veteran airmen describe
their captivity in precise, detailed and remarkably calm
reminiscences that make that hell seem absolutely real. The lessons
they've learned, far from being nihilistic, are lessons in
physical, emotional and spiritual self-preservation and renewal.
</P>
<P>
   How they survived with such apparent equanimity is a testament
to their training (many are graduates of the U.S. Air Force
Academy), unwavering patriotism, powerful sense of brotherhood and
native ingenuity. Everyone who speaks in the film (including the
half-dozen loyal wives who waited for as long as eight and a half
years for their husbands' return) emerges burnished with glory.
</P>
<P>
   The heroism they share is of a classic American sort: stoic,
dutiful, utterly lacking in grandiosity, but deeply emotional
beneath a dignified surface. When tears come, they flash suddenly
in the eyes and the voice begins to break. An instant later,
emotional control is restored.
</P>
<P>
   The stories they tell are inspiring, sometimes astounding, and
most importantly, true.
</P>
<P>
   There is Comdr. Jeremiah Denton, a prisoner of war for more than
seven years who foiled his captors by blinking the word ``torture''
in Morse code when placed before newsmen and told to make a
``confession.'' There is Lt. Comdr. Richard Stratton who, when put
in front of news cameras, embarrassed the North Vietnamese by
pretending to be a brainwashed North Vietnamese version of ``The
Manchurian Candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   There is Seaman Douglas Hegdahl, who mastered a memory technique
that enabled him, when released and debriefed, to reel off the
names of all 268 American prisoners of war. And there is Lt. John
McGrath, a self-taught artist who kept himself sane by drawing on
the wall with his own pus and blood.
</P>
<P>
   The movie visits the prison in Hanoi where many of the pilots
were held, a grim medieval fortress with meat hooks on the ceiling
and rusted iron shackles on the floor. We hear about an
excruciating torture nicknamed ``the Vietnamese rope trick,'' in
which prisoners were tightly bound with ropes that cut off the
circulation to their limbs and dislocated their shoulders. Once
prisoners were ``broken'' during interrogations, they were asked to
divulge information they usually didn't have and were forced to
invent.
</P>
<P>
   But after the death of Ho Chi Minh in 1969, the use of torture
was largely suspended and prison conditions improved somewhat.
Although the prisoners were isolated from one another, they
developed a communications code (based on dividing 25 of the 26
letters of the alphabet into five rows) and methodically tapping on
the walls of their cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Return With Honor'' has two happy endings. The first, about
halfway through the film, follows a group of liberated pilots to
the plane carrying them home. Then the movie doubles back to tell
more war stories. The second and final happy ending shows the
actual reunions of several aviators and their families in San
Francisco in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The interviews are accompanied by vintage newsreels and scenes
from North Vietnamese archives, including one of American prisoners
paraded through the streets of Hanoi and pelted with abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In remembering the American anti-war movement, ``Return With
Honor'' treads gingerly. The issue of whether or not the Vietnam
war should have been waged at all is barely addressed. But we do
learn that television coverage of antiwar demonstrations was shown
by the North Vietnamese to the prisoners to try to demoralize them.
Whatever emotions these scenes may have stirred is not mentioned
except for a certain confusion.
</P>
<P>
   Unabashedly patriotic but without flagrant flag-waving, ``Return
With Honor'' is a celebration of courage.

EXUBERANT AMERICANA THAT'S NOT ALL-AMERICAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Wednesday, Christopher Wheeldon made his debut in
``Fancy Free'' at New York City Ballet, and Jose Manuel Carreno
appeared for the first time in ``Push Comes to Shove'' at American
Ballet Theater.
</P>
<P>
   These major debuts in major companies performing the same night
at Lincoln Center could well lead one to ponder the meaning of a
word like Americana. In the 1930s and early '40s, when nationalism
in the arts was at its peak, the term was associated with a
glorification of the open frontier. Nation building was the task
and opportunity beckoned in many dance works, especially if they
had scores by Aaron Copland (``Billy the Kid,'' ``Rodeo'' and
``Appalachian Spring'').
</P>
<P>
   In 1944 Jerome Robbins broke with this pattern. He was concerned
not with the American myth but American reality. ``Fancy Free,'' to
music by Leonard Bernstein, showed three sailors meeting three
young women in New York during World War II. But it was not only
Robbins' content that was peculiarly American. It was also the
style and execution of his choreography, ballet that had a
vernacular flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Twyla Tharp was very much in this line of descent when she
created ``Push Comes to Shove'' for Ballet Theater in 1976.
Although plotless, the piece is American in spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, you don't have to be American to dance these works.
Wheeldon is British and Carreno is Cuban. Unsurprisingly, Wheeldon
was given the lyrical solo of the middle sailor in ``Fancy Free.''
His youthful exuberance, mischievous demeanor and ability to
sustain an innocent look made him a natural for the poetic gob
flanked by two streetwise friends.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gold was superb and precise in his bravura as the tipsy
fellow, and Damian Woetzel danced almost too well. He needs to tone
down his overall aggressiveness in the role and to dispense with
the bump-and-grind pelvis in his rhumba. On the other hand, his
lusty pursuit of Pascale van Kipnis in the ballroom duet had a fine
live-for-the-moment passion. Ms. van Kipnis matched him on her own
ground. Deanna McBrearty was too bland as the big-city girl with
the red bag while Aura Dixon was a shade too bold in a cameo role.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the evening at the Metropolitan Opera House, Carreno
looked at ease in Mikhail Baryshnikov's original role in ``Push,''
capturing its staccato dynamics but also adding a flush luxuriance
to the style.
</P>
<P>
   Carreno was very funny here, as were Giuseppe Picone and Irina
Dvorovenko, with Ashley Tuttle and Yan Chen as the other soloists.
The ballet's emphasis has changed. There are fewer mock bows, and
there is no longer the sensational virtuosity once offered by
Baryshnikov and his immediate successors in the role, Danilo
Radojevic, Kirk Peterson and Gil Boggs. Boggs gave his farewell
performance earlier in the evening in ``Airs.'' His versatility and
excellence will be remembered.

 &HT;    KOSOVO RESETTLING TO TAKE MONTHS, REFUGEES ANXIOUS TO FIND
HOMES, FAMILIES
 &HT;    500&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-MAIN.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW

<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ With a Yugoslav troop withdrawal from Kosovo
beginning Thursday, ethnic Albanian refugees here were cautious
about a return to a land of minefields and destroyed villages. But,
patience will be hard for young Riza Rudaj.
</P>
<P>
   On May 4, the 15-year-old saw Serb police drag his father from
the driver's seat of a tractor in the exodus from southern Kosovo.
He has not seen him since.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have any time to speak to us at all . . . If I tried
to speak to him I could have been killed,'' Rudaj said near the
squalid tenement where he has stayed for five weeks. ``It seems
like five years have passed here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rudaj, sporting a University of Nevada-Las Vegas T-shirt and
a vest decorated with pictures of the rock band Metallica, knows he
must wait. His Kosovo might not be safe yet and his return will be
part of a massive and complicated months-long resettlement.
</P>
<P>
   With NATO air strikes on Yugoslavia suspended and Serb-led
Yugoslav troops beating a path out of the war-torn province under
the military technical agreement that requires their withdrawal,
U.N. officials were trying to figure out how and when to reverse a
humanitarian effort that is even now still under construction.
</P>
<P>
   No refugees came into Albania from Kosovo Thursday, but
construction continued at refugee camps to take care of a shelter
shortage. About 125 refugees were transferred from Kukes, just over
the border from Kosovo, to reunite with families hours away in
southern Albania.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The first step to any resettlement will start with a major
military operation. A 5,000-man ``battle group'' with tanks and
artillery was headed north through Albania Thursday. The troops
should enter southwestern Kosovo by Sunday, after comparable forces
from other NATO countries, including the United States, have
entered from Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   Military planners said the NATO troops will enter step-by-step
on the heels of the Serb withdrawal. The Serbs have 11 days to
leave the province entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not interested in leaving any sort of vacuum, so as
soon as Serb troops leave, we will enter,'' said Col. Helge
Erikson, spokesman for the NATO force in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Troops will be followed by aid workers, who will begin assessing
the living conditions and prospects for return. As they try to
avoid Serb-planted landmines, they will give top priority to
finding people hiding in the mountains who may be facing severe
malnutrition. Also, the U.N. estimates that half the houses in
Kosovo are damaged or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Returnees from Albania pose special problems. First, it has the
most refugees, nearly half a million. Second, the crumbling roads
through Albania's mountain passes make any mass movement slow. That
is one reason the first NATO troop movements into Kosovo will come
from neighboring Macedonia, which has easier terrain and better
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Rupert Colville, spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR), said about half the refugees may have to wait
until as late as next year for their return.
</P>
<P>
   He said some recent international refugee movements have been
larger in sheer numbers, but Kosovo ``is shaping up to be one of
the most complex, logistically.''
</P>
<P>
   Aimed at helping the refugees understand and be patient, the
United Nations is preparing a massive leaflet and information
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Most seem to understand, at least for now, that landmines,
possible booby-traps, damaged water systems and roads, could make
for a slow return. Most have heard that their homes have been
looted or burned.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only when the U.N. tells us to go back we will go back,''
said 80-year-old Azem Basha, a refugee from north of Prizren in
Kosovo province. But, he hopes it will be soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to go back to my land. Even if there is nothing
there, I will set up a tent . . . and live in that,'' he said.

   Ain't Nothin' But a Flap
</P>
<P>
   If only the television show had been this interesting ...
</P>
<P>
   Broadway was positively atwitter this week with talk of lawyers,
sales and suspicious speeches, a drama that many spectators agreed
far surpassed the suspense generated Sunday by the Tony Awards
broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the list was the saga of ``It Ain't Nothin' but the
Blues,'' which continued to prove that for sure-fire success,
nothing beats a protest. After its production number was cut from
the Tony show on CBS, the revue made headlines citywide and had its
biggest week at the box office, taking in more than $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy ``has certainly brought us a great deal of
attention and sympathy,'' said Eric Krebs, the lead producer. ``But
I think it would be wrong to consider that this makes everything
OK''
</P>
<P>
   As for possible legal remedies, the show has retained a lawyer,
Bert Fields, and Krebs said discussions continued for some sort of
compensation from Tony Awards Productions, the partnership of the
two organizations that run the awards, the League of American
Theaters and Producers and the American Theater Wing. The
production company has already agreed to pay the ``Blues''
producers for the cost of rehearsing and transporting the cast for
the Tony broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, one Tony official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said several efforts were being made to help ``Blues,''
including asking Rosie O'Donnell to talk it up on her television
show. A number from the musical was on David Letterman's CBS show
on Wednesday. Other options being pursued include additional
appearances on CBS as well as at a performance on Sunday for
President Clinton at Ford's Theater in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exposure is what they want,'' the official said. ``And we're
trying to make that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   For the musicals that did appear, there were immediate benefits:
``Fosse'' took in about $250,000 on Monday, and ``Annie Get Your
Gun'' sold nearly $200,000 worth of tickets. That represented large
increases for both shows.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the complaints about the handling of the show were
crystallized in a letter sent by director Harold Prince to several
high-ranking members of the wing and the league. Saying that the
broadcast was generally handled like ``an entertainment on the
Carnival Cruise Line,'' Prince also upbraided Tony officials for
scheduling a lifetime achievement award for actress Uta Hagen
before the broadcast began.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is downright insulting to relegate one of our
greatest actresses to a segment off camera,'' Prince wrote. He also
suggested the entire broadcast should be on PBS, which carried its
first hour, rather than CBS.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't appear likely. The Tonys have a contract with CBS
through 2004, and Tony officials say this year's broadcast had not
put that in jeopardy. As for Ms. Hagen, Keith Sherman, a spokesman
for the Tonys, said that a recap of her award was to have been
included in the CBS portion, but that the segment was cut because
of time.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Sherman declined to comment on Prince's letter,
although Prince said the Tony administrators had responded
personally.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere wags were positing ``X-Files''-style conspiracies
around the fact that David Richenthal, lead producer of ``Death of
a Salesman,'' somehow had his speech for the telecast on a
prompter! What did this mean? Did Richenthal know in advance that
his show had won? Was the fix in?
</P>
<P>
   No, Richenthal said, although a global consortium of
gossip-famished alien hybrids might not believe it.
</P>
<P>
   The prompter incident was more mundane, Richenthal said. While
sitting in the Gershwin Theater studying his speech before the
broadcast, he said, he was approached by a television technician
who asked if he wanted the text on a prompter. He said sure, and
voila, it was done.
</P>
<P>
   But in explaining his computerized cue cards, Richenthal offered
one slightly cryptic prediction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe,'' he intoned, ``in future years, this will become a
trend.''
</P>
<P>
   For Sale, Again
</P>
<P>
   The Biltmore Theater is back on the block.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago the landmark theater at 261 W. 47th St. was
supposed to be sold by the Nederlander Organization to a developer,
Joseph Moinian, who said he planned to build a 43-story hotel on
the site of the theater and five adjacent buildings.
</P>
<P>
   But in late April, said Howard Rubenstein, a spokesman for the
Nederlanders, Moinian failed to arrive at a meeting arranged to
close the deal and defaulted on a $1 million deposit.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the contract it was stated that time was of the essence,''
Rubenstein said. ``Not only didn't he deliver the check, he didn't
even show.''
</P>
<P>
   Moinian, however, has sued the Nederlanders in state Supreme
Court in Manhattan, arguing that the organization improperly
terminated the contract and kept the deposit, said Menachem J.
Kastner, Moinian's lawyer. The lawsuit seeks $35 million in damages
and enforcement of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Rubenstein called the suit frivolous and said the theater and
the five other buildings were still for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The 948-seat theater, built in 1925, was once the home of
productions of the musical ``Hair'' and ``Barefoot in the Park.''
But it has sat empty and decaying for more than a decade. The
interior, with neoclassical detail and an unusual horseshoe-shaped
auditorium, was designated as a landmark in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Along the Way
</P>
<P>
   _ Woody Harrelson is confirmed for a November revival of ``The
Rainmaker,'' by N. Richard Nash, produced by the Roundabout Theater
Co. Scott Ellis directs.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the department of now it can be told: ``Epic Proportions,''
a comedy by Larry Coen and David Crane, will be the next tenant of
the Helen Hayes Theater, soon to be vacated by ``Night Must Fall.''
Kristin Chenoweth, a Tony winner in ``You're a Good Man, Charlie
Brown,'' will star.
</P>
<P>
   _ Corin Redgrave will read from ``The British on Broadway,'' a
book by Elizabeth Sharland about the English influence on early New
York theater, on Monday at the Barnes &AMP; Noble store on 66th Street
and Broadway.

WHILE A ROMAN GALLERY REMODELS, CARAVAGGIO VISITS HARTFORD
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN.: Conn.)  (fb) 
 By GRACE GLUECK    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whatever their inconvenience to the local public, museum
renovations are great for the circulation of masterpieces. They
enable people who live elsewhere to see works that might otherwise
elude them. Right now, for instance, because the Capitoline Picture
Gallery in Rome _ part of the oldest public museum in the world _
is refurbishing several of its rooms, museumgoers on this side of
the Atlantic can view one of its greatest masterpieces, the
sensual, much debated ``St. John the Baptist'' (1600) by
Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio (1573-1610).
</P>
<P>
   Never before exhibited outside of Rome, the Caravaggio appears
along with 20 other Renaissance and Baroque works in an all-star
show called ``Caravaggio's `St. John' and Masterpieces From the
Capitoline Museum in Rome,'' at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford,
Conn. Caravaggio's illustrious colleagues in the show include
Pietro da Cortona, Domenichino, Dosso Dossi, Il Guercino, Lorenzo
Lotto, Guido Reni, Veronese and Simon Vouet.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition is part of a continuing Caravaggio saga for the
Atheneum, which has developed a special relationship with the
museums of Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Last year in Hartford, ``Caravaggio and His Italian Followers:
From the Collections of the National Gallery of Ancient Art in
Rome'' celebrated the Atheneum's return to Italy of a painting by
the 16th-century Mannerist Jacopo Zucchi. The painting had been
bought in Paris in 1965, but it was later discovered that the work
had been looted from the Italian Embassy in Berlin at the close of
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Atheneum is rich in early Italian art, including a
Caravaggio, ``The Ecstasy of St. Francis'' (1595). Acquired in
1943, it was the first work by this artist to enter a museum in the
United States. (In 1930, the Atheneum was the first museum in the
United States to present a show of Italian Baroque paintings.)
</P>
<P>
   And it just so happens that the Atheneum owns a work _ done in
1749 by Giovanni Paolo Panini _ depicting the enormous collection
of Cardinal Gonzaga (1690-1756), who founded the Capitoline Picture
Gallery. In the current show, the slightly exaggerated Panini view
of the palatial Gonzaga galleries, whose walls are plastered with
masterpieces, is next to a portrait of the cardinal himself, a man
of a girth to match his collection. The portrait, which belongs to
the Capitoline, was done in the mid-1740s by Pierre Subleyras.
</P>
<P>
   The show's centerpiece is the challenging Caravaggio, ``St. John
the Baptist,'' painted around 1600 and hung in the Capitoline
Picture Gallery since 1750. Painted with the sharp contrasts of
light and dark that characterize the artist's work, it depicts a
naked youth embracing a ram while turning a slyly smiling face to
the viewer.
</P>
<P>
   There may be some naughty innuendo here, but scholarly debate
has focused on whether the traditional identification of the
subject as John the Baptist is correct. One reason is the fact that
John's traditional attribute is a lamb, not a ram.
</P>
<P>
   A recent proposal, however, suggests that the subject is really
Isaac, who, about to be sacrificed by his own father, Abraham, is
saved by God and happily greets the ram that will be killed in his
stead. The semireclining pose of the youth, incidentally, is
derived from a similar one of a boy in Michelangelo's epic for the
Sistine Chapel ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is a small assemblage, occupying only two galleries,
the show has a number of other paintings _ selected from the
Capitoline collections by Peter C. Sutton, director of the
Wadsworth, and Eric Zafran, curator of its European paintings _
that will stop you in your tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Domenichino's operatic ``Sybil'' (1622) is a high-flown Baroque
fantasy, with an abundance of florid drapery, that shows the Sybil
wearing a sultan's turban, her chubby wide-eyed face with bee-stung
lips turned up as if in search of cues. Stripped of finery and
posed a little differently, she would bear a distinct resemblance
to Guido Reni's ``St. Sebastian'' (1615), whose chubby, wide-eyed
face is resolutely heavenward as arrows pierce his naked torso.
</P>
<P>
   Garofalo's ``Annunciation'' (1528) is an exquisite rendering of
one of the most hackneyed subjects in art history, a grand,
columned interior with the Virgin kneeling in prayer as a princely
Archangel Gabriel arrives on jumbo wings to make his startling
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Of the secular paintings in the show, an undated, unfinished one
thought to be a self-portrait by Velazquez ranks high for its
fierce, almost belligerent intensity of expression. Two other
likenesses, besides Subleyras' unsparing fleshscape of Cardinal
Gonzaga, are compelling.
</P>
<P>
   One is Lorenzo Lotto's ``Portrait of a Crossbowman'' (1551-52),
a dark, slightly menacing rendition of an earringed sportsman
holding a crossbow meant for business. The other is Bartolomeo
Passerotti's ``Portrait of a Man With a Dog'' (1585), an endearing
view of a handsome young man in a high velvet hat and lace ruff who
looks earnestly at the viewer as he clasps to his chest a
tan-spotted setter.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be overlooked are two charming small Roman landscapes by
the Dutch-born Gaspar Van Wittel, both done around 1680. Unlike the
romanticized landscape fantasies common to Italian art of the 17th
century, these are unidealized documentaries seen through a
northern European eye, an approach important in setting the style
of modern landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``View of the Temple of Vesta'' shows an old pagan temple
converted to a church in a run-down neighborhood. ``View of the
Broken Bridge'' depicts the ruin of a rebuilt bridge dating back to
the second century A.D., with the busy banks of the Tiber in the
foreground.
</P>
<P>
   As a kind of lagniappe to the Capitoline show, the Atheneum has
put up some Baroque examples from its own collection, including
works by Vouet, Reni, Claude Lorrain, Bernardo Strozzi, Salvatore
Rosa, Jusepe de Ribera and others that fortunately managed to make
their way to Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   A word about the Capitoline Picture Gallery, whose fine
collection of paintings dates from the 14th to the 17th centuries,
with the emphasis on 17th-century Italian examples. It stands on
Capitoline Hill as part of an older museum complex in the
Michelangelo-designed Piazza del Campidoglio, dominated by a bronze
equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius dating from Imperial days.
</P>
<P>
   The Picture Gallery was opened in 1749 through the joint efforts
of Pope Benedict XIV and Cardinal Gonzaga, his shrewd,
hard-bargaining Secretary of State, a collector and patron of the
arts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1748 and 1750, bent on preventing the dispersal of paintings
to foreign collections, and giving Roman art students the
opportunity to study works of the past, Gonzaga secured for the
Picture Gallery significant parts of two big Roman collections,
those of the Sachetti and Pio families.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the gallery, which now belongs to the city of Rome,
has seen its holdings vastly expanded, by gifts and purchases, not
only of paintings but also of porcelains, tapestries and furniture.
The gallery continues to make acquisitions: the Subleyras portrait
of Cardinal Gonzaga came in 1995 from a private collection.

   YUGOSLAVIA-KOZOVO CRISIS
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MAIN _ SKOPJE, Macedonia _ With NATO airstrikes
suspended, peacekeeping forces began flooding into Macedonia as a
prelude to moving into Kosovo to enforce compliance with a peace
deal there. As Serb troops began withdrawing from the embattled
province, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic went on national
television to proclaim victory. Story will wrap in all major
developments. (Albright, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   w/KOSOVO-MACEDONIA _ SKOPJE, Macedonia _ You would think that
refugees and peacekeepers would be excited that they will soon be
moving into Kosovo. But among ethnic Albanian refugees, the mood
here is surprisingly subdued. They are extremely apprehensive over
whether it's safe to return and at the notion of what they will
find in their abandoned villages. And members of the U.S. 82nd
Airborne Division aren't overly eager. Many of them express concern
that they are moving into a dangerous situation. And they are
chafing at playing the role of peacekeeper after having been
trained in the art of war. (Kunstel/Albright, Cox News Service).

   KOSOVO-ALBANIA _ KUKES, Albania _ Refugees here are just

until next year. (Kaplow, Cox News Service).

<P>
   KOSOVO-AIRWAR _ WASHINGTON _ After 78 days, nearly 35,000
sorties and more than 20,000 bombs, the U.S.-led NATO air strikes
against Yugoslavia were suspended on Thursday without a single
combat fatality for the allies. There has never been an air
campaign like it, said Defense Secretary William Cohen, who called
the campaign ``an extraordinary achievement in the history of air
warfare.'' Pilots flew high and let lasers, satellites and infrared
scanners guide 2,000-pound bombs to their targets miles away.
Despite advances in tactics and technology that put this air war a
full generation ahead of what was seen during the Gulf War,
Operation Allied Force was dogged by two of the oldest variables in
the history of battle: weather and terrain. And it ended without
solving the debate over whether wars can be won from the air alone.
(Deans, Cox News Service).

<P>
   KOSOVO-CLINTON _ WASHINGTON _ Grasping victory in one hand and

</P>
<P>
   risks in the other, President Clinton said Thursday that
``inhumanity'' was defeated in Kosovo but additional costs must be
borne to secure the peace. ``In the past four months, we have seen
some of the worst inhumanity in our lifetime,'' Clinton said,
referring to atrocities and terror inflicted upon ethnic Albanians
in Kosovo. ``We now have a moment of hope,'' Clinton told reporters
at the White House, less than two hours after U.S. and allied
pilots suspended air strikes against Yugoslavia after 78 days of
attacks. ``We have to finish the job,'' he said, ``and build the
peace.'' Bracing the country for years of peacekeeping operations
involving thousands of U.S. troops, Clinton declined to set a date
certain for bringing American forces home from Kosovo. (Deans, Cox

   MEXICO-KILLING _ MEXICO CITY _ At first Paco Stanley's murder
was seen as the most glaring example yet of vicious, random crime
in this metropolis. Television anchors and fans of the famous comic
wept, assuming Stanley was an innocent victim of an assault on a
Mexico City street Monday. Political opponents of the city's mayor
saw a chance to weaken his presidential aspirations, wasting no
time in attacking him for failing to stem crime. But now it appears
that Stanley's killing could spotlight the pervasiveness of drugs
in Mexico _ their use and trafficking _ rather than street crime.
Police reports confirmed that Sanchez had cocaine in his body and a
stash of the drug in his car, where he was killed execution-style.
Unconfirmed allegations are flying that he consorted with one of
Mexico's most notorious cocaine traffickers and that he may have
owed $300,000 on a drug shipment. The killing has also made a
mockery of Stanley's employer, TeleAzteca, a network that had been
sponsoring a ``Say no to drugs'' campaign. (Ferriss, Cox News
Service).

<P>
   HAITI-TROOPS _ MIAMI _ Nearly five years after the United States
invaded Haiti to restore democracy, the U.S. House of Reps. is
expected to vote Wednesday on whether to end the permanent U.S.
military presence there. A growing number of lawmakers are
demanding the withdrawal of the remaining 500-member U.S. Support
Group in light of a rapidly deteriorating security situation in
Haiti that has left even military leaders concerned about the
safety of U.S. troops. The House will be voting on an amendment
proposed by Rep. Porter Goss (R-Fla.) and Rep. Ben Gilman (R-N.Y.)

   GA-LOTTERY _ATLANTA _ With three weeks to go, Georgia will
probably become the first state to post six straight years of
lottery sales increases. The lottery could also top $2 billion for
the first time this year. Also, the Georgia Lottery's Cash 3 game
had a triple hit (444) again Monday, the 8th or 9th triple hit this
year, which means the lottery probably won't fulfill its lawful
requirement to return 35 percent of revenue to the state for

   BAPTISTS _ ATLANTA _ In the days before their annual meeting in
Atlanta, Southern Baptists plan to blitz the city with evangelism,
door-to-door and in revival-style worship. This comes at a time
when the denomination recently admitted losing members for the
first time in decades. (Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   CHURCH-RAISING _ Members of Gateway Baptist Church in Dawson
County, Ga., have spent three years meeting in a school. All that
changes next week (June 7) when they and members of a special
Baptist ministry, Builders for Christ, build a structure for the
faith community. In the tradition of an Amish barn raising, the
facility will rise quickly, in just four days, according to
Gateway's pastor, the Rev. Ray Rhodes Jr. Everyone will help out _
parents, children, builders from West Virgnia, South Carolina,
North Carolina and Georgia. (White, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   MISS-GOV _ Gov. Kirk Fordice, whose love life has been the talk

in a restaurant while his wife was out of town, said Thursday he is
getting divorced and will marry his junior high school sweetheart.

litigation, plus an update on where the litigation stands. Marler
is speculating this will be the first E. coli case to go to trial
(all the others have been settled for huge sums), because White
Water's liability is a little less clear than that of meat
manufacturers and Jack in the Box. (Guthrie/Miller, Atlanta

   BUSHGALLERY _ Out in the Hill Country, they're getting ready for
Friday's opening of the Bush Gallery at the National Museum of the
Pacific War. The former president's story is one of dozens of
wartime accounts told through photos and artifacts. Organizers say
the museum is the only one in the country dedicated to the Pacific
War. The governor's dad will be in Fredericksburg for Friday's
opening. (Kelley, Austin American-Statesman).

   PLANE _ After crash-landing her plane in Sylvia Graham's front
yard, the student pilot knocks on the door and asks to use the
phone to call 911. And, also, could she please have a towel because
she's bleeding. The student pilot was treated at the hospital for
minor injuries. The plane is badly damaged. Graham, who was reading
the paper with her husband when they heard a loud noise they
thought was thunder, didn't get to see the plane in her yard at
2111 Lake Bass Circle. They were evacuated. (Coyle, Palm Beach

   ``On a related subject, Signore Pazzi, I must confess to you:
I'm giving serious thought to eating your wife.'' _ Hannibal Lecter
speaks.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven years after he last appeared in print and eight years
after his movie alter ego told Clarice Starling, ``I'm having an
old friend for dinner,'' Dr. Hannibal Lecter finally comes out of
hiding as 1 million copies of ``Hannibal'' are hitting bookstores
nationwide in what the publishing industry is saying is the closest
thing they'll ever have to a ``Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans of ``Hannibal the Cannibal'' have waited more than a decade
for the reclusive Thomas Harris to finally produce a sequel to
``The Silence of the Lambs,'' and they'll be lining up to find out
what's been going on with one of the most popular villains in
modern American fiction.
</P>
<P>
   If you like to dine on literary mayhem, you will not be
disappointed. This 484-page excursion into lunacy drips with blood
and entrails and is almost gleefully gross, as life on the run has
left the devilish Dr. Lecter with quite the appetite.
</P>
<P>
   He's so hungry he could eat a corpse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hannibal'' picks up seven years after FBI Special Agent
Clarice Starling forged a slightly erotic and deeply disturbing
bond with Dr. Hannibal ``the Cannibal'' Lecter _ a relationship
that provided young Starling with the information she needed to
find the infamous serial killer Jame Gumb.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out the splashy bust was the worst thing possible for a
female agent trying to launch a career in the macho FBI. Starling
has spent the last seven years on one dangerous, low-rent stakeout
after another _ and when she kills five people in a botched drug
raid caught by television news cameras, she's practically forced
off the job. Not even her soon-to-retire, burned-out mentor Jack
Crawford (Scott Glenn in the movie) can do much to help.
</P>
<P>
   As for Starling's old friend Dr. Lecter, he's the subject of
much speculation on the Internet and he's become something of a
cult hero _ his annotated and signed copy of Alexandre Dumas'
``Dictionary of Cuisine'' has been auctioned to a private collector
for $16,000 _ but the authorities aren't even close to catching
him.
</P>
<P>
   Mason Verger, on the other hand, is moving in for the kill.
</P>
<P>
   Verger, one of Dr. Lecter's earliest victims, remains alive
despite having one lidless eye, no nose or lips and a paralyzed
body. Living on a respirator in a specially designed room on his
compound in Maryland, Verger's mind is even more grotesque than his
hideous physical appearance. Drawing on his connections within the
U.S. government and his limitless supply of funds, Verger is
hatching a plan to kidnap Lecter and feed him slowly to a team of
specially bred wild boars, if you can believe it.
</P>
<P>
   While the character of Verger is a vividly drawn architect of
pure evil, he's also close to being comically absurd. Harris aims
high with his depictions of horror and his explorations into the
chambers of Lecter's mind _ he's like Stephen King with advanced
degrees in history and fine arts _ but he veers dangerously close
to self-parody with the scenes involving the killing pigs, and he's
sure to have some readers howling with anger and/or retching with
disgust over a dinner scene featuring a guest whose skull is
unscrewed so Hannibal can scoop out some appetizers for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   There are also nice moments of intentional humor, as when the
sophisticated Dr. Lecter must wear a Toronto Maple Leafs warmup
suit and sit in coach class in order to blend in with a crass tour
group. Faced with the prospect of an in-flight dinner, Lecter is
mortified. Here is a man who has dined on a census taker's liver
and a nurse's tongue, among other delicacies, but ``there are
limits: he cannot eat this airline swill.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say ``Hannibal'' is pure camp. Partially because
we cannot help but hear the voices of the great team of Anthony
Hopkins and Jodie Foster from the movie, Hannibal and Clarice
remain a compelling, star-crossed couple who share a connection of
almost elegant tenderness _ not to mention childhood scars that are
more alike than any outsider would imagine. Their connection is
strange, sweet and sick.
</P>
<P>
   That said, ``Hannibal'' is by no means a horror classic. While
Harris delivers some chilling moments, I can't imagine that most
readers will be satisfied with the ultimate fates of Starling and
Lecter. We might have been better off had the two parted for good
with ``Silence,'' reuniting only in our imaginations.

GORE STARTS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN TRAILING REPUBLICAN CHALLENGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 13)   (EDS: Filed in ``w'' and ``p'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Al Gore will be far from Washington's corridors of
power, his natural stomping ground, when he announces the start of
his official presidential campaign Wednesday at the Smith County
courthouse in Carthage, Tenn,
</P>
<P>
   Anxious to avoid the label of Beltway insider and trying to put
some subtle distance between the Clinton administration and his own
presidential campaign, Gore chose to make his announcement in
Carthage where his late father, Sen. Albert Gore Sr., D-Tenn., ran
a 250-acre farm and where his mother Pauline Gore still lives.
</P>
<P>
   In speeches, the younger Gore wistfully recalls spending summers
there hosing down hog manure and plowing a steep hillside behind a
mule team.
</P>
<P>
   But the reality is that Gore was born and raised in Washington
where he resided in a posh hotel, attended an elite private school
and developed his reputation as a wooden, somewhat gaffe-prone
speaker, partial to blue suits and other Washington trappings.
</P>
<P>
   By this measure, Gore at this stage is competing less with
fellow Democratic contender Bill Bradley and the Republicans than
with himself. But his supporters hope that Gore's Tennessee
campaign initiation on Wednesday _ followed by quick visits to
Iowa, New Hampshire, New York, Los Angeles and Seattle _ will help
wipe the slate clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is well known by American public but he's not known
well,'' said Mark Mellman, a Washington-based pollster and
political consultant who backs Gore. ``He needs to fill out the
picture and tell people who he is, what he's done and what he
intends to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore starts his campaign for the Democratic nomination in 2000
at a significant disadvantage. While he is comfortably ahead of
Bradley, most polls put him at least 10 percentage points behind
the Republican front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush. Gore also
trails former American Red Cross president Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign is waiting in the wings and Gore's
announcement trip could prove to be a key juncture for the former
senator from New Jersey. ``The only shot Bradley has is if Gore
fails to connect to people,'' said one Democrat who has advised
Bradley. ``If he does, that's it; Gore's the nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross Baker, a political science professor at Rutgers University,
said that polls have only limited value this far away from the
November 2000 election. ``Rumors of (Gore's) demise are
premature,'' he said, recalling how President Bush also struggled
as a vice president early in the 1988 election, but went on to
cream Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Against the negatives, Baker said, Gore can boast of eight years
of high-level governmental experience as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways he redefined and revitalized the office, moving it
away from its traditional status as political bone yard, according
to Baker. ``Gore is not a potted palm,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months Gore has spiced up his speaking style,
sometimes adopting the cadences of a Baptist preacher to articulate
his contrast of Republicans and Democrats. (``We say legislate.
They say investigate.'')
</P>
<P>
   And he attempted to cut through the political thicket last month
in Iowa by laying out his education plan, a program that calls for
smaller high schools, tough discipline, standards for teachers and
_ a long-time Gore theme _ connecting classrooms and libraries to
``the information superhighway.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also reached out into Republican territory, telling a
Salvation Army meeting in Atlanta last month that he supports
federal grants to so-called faith-based organizations that work on
homelessness, drug addiction, youth violence and other social ills.
</P>
<P>
   And he is winning the all-important money chase. In the first
three months of the year, Gore's campaign led all other
presidential hopefuls by raising $8.9 million. Bush followed in
second place with $7.6 million over the same time period.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the ledger, Gore is likely to be dogged by
memories of some recent verbal gaffes.
</P>
<P>
   For example, his remark in a CNN interview in March that he
``took the initiative in creating the Internet'' won him headlines
and derisive Republican press releases.
</P>
<P>
   A similar reaction has greeted Gore's emphasis on his down-home
Tennessee links and the downplaying of his privileged Washington
D.C. upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore emerged unscathed from the various congressional
probes of how President Clinton and Democrats financed the 1996
election, some of embarrassing episodes might come back to haunt
him, such as his 1996 visit to the Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda
Heights, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhist monks and nuns there were straw donors for campaign
contributions illegally funneled from the temple, but Gore
contended that he was unaware of any wrongdoing at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Another is Gore's defense of making 52 campaign fundraising
phone calls from his White House office despite federal law
prohibiting political fundraising on government property.
</P>
<P>
   At a now-famous 1997 press conference, Gore used the phrase ``no

GORE STARTS PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN TRAILING REPUBLICAN CHALLENGERS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Al Gore will be far from Washington's corridors of
power, his natural stomping ground, when he announces the start of
his official presidential campaign Wednesday at the Smith County
courthouse in Carthage, Tenn,
</P>
<P>
   Anxious to avoid the label of Beltway insider and trying to put
some subtle distance between the Clinton administration and his own
presidential campaign, Gore chose to make his announcement in
Carthage where his late father, Sen. Albert Gore Sr., D-Tenn., ran
a 250-acre farm and where his mother Pauline Gore still lives.
</P>
<P>
   In speeches, the younger Gore wistfully recalls spending summers
there hosing down hog manure and plowing a steep hillside behind a
mule team.
</P>
<P>
   But the reality is that Gore was born and raised in Washington
where he resided in a posh hotel, attended an elite private school
and developed his reputation as a wooden, somewhat gaffe-prone
speaker, partial to blue suits and other Washington trappings.
</P>
<P>
   By this measure, Gore at this stage is competing less with
fellow Democratic contender Bill Bradley and the Republicans than
with himself. But his supporters hope that Gore's Tennessee
campaign initiation on Wednesday _ followed by quick visits to
Iowa, New Hampshire, New York, Los Angeles and Seattle _ will help
wipe the slate clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is well known by American public but he's not known
well,'' said Mark Mellman, a Washington-based pollster and
political consultant who backs Gore. ``He needs to fill out the
picture and tell people who he is, what he's done and what he
intends to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore starts his campaign for the Democratic nomination in 2000
at a significant disadvantage. While he is comfortably ahead of
Bradley, most polls put him at least 10 percentage points behind
the Republican front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush. Gore also
trails former American Red Cross president Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign is waiting in the wings and Gore's
announcement trip could prove to be a key juncture for the former
senator from New Jersey. ``The only shot Bradley has is if Gore
fails to connect to people,'' said one Democrat who has advised
Bradley. ``If he does, that's it; Gore's the nominee.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross Baker, a political science professor at Rutgers University,
said that polls have only limited value this far away from the
November 2000 election. ``Rumors of (Gore's) demise are
premature,'' he said, recalling how President Bush also struggled
as a vice president early in the 1988 election, but went on to
cream Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the Democratic nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Against the negatives, Baker said, Gore can boast of eight years
of high-level governmental experience as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways he redefined and revitalized the office, moving it
away from its traditional status as political bone yard, according
to Baker. ``Gore is not a potted palm,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months Gore has spiced up his speaking style,
sometimes adopting the cadences of a Baptist preacher to articulate
his contrast of Republicans and Democrats. (``We say legislate.
They say investigate.'')
</P>
<P>
   And he attempted to cut through the political thicket last month
in Iowa by laying out his education plan, a program that calls for
smaller high schools, tough discipline, standards for teachers and
_ a long-time Gore theme _ connecting classrooms and libraries to
``the information superhighway.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also reached out into Republican territory, telling a
Salvation Army meeting in Atlanta last month that he supports
federal grants to so-called faith-based organizations that work on
homelessness, drug addiction, youth violence and other social ills.
</P>
<P>
   And he is winning the all-important money chase. In the first
three months of the year, Gore's campaign led all other
presidential hopefuls by raising $8.9 million. Bush followed in
second place with $7.6 million over the same time period.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the ledger, Gore is likely to be dogged by
memories of some recent verbal gaffes.
</P>
<P>
   For example, his remark in a CNN interview in March that he
``took the initiative in creating the Internet'' won him headlines
and derisive Republican press releases.
</P>
<P>
   A similar reaction has greeted Gore's emphasis on his down-home
Tennessee links and the downplaying of his privileged Washington
D.C. upbringing.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore emerged unscathed from the various congressional
probes of how President Clinton and Democrats financed the 1996
election, some of embarrassing episodes might come back to haunt
him, such as his 1996 visit to the Hsi Lai Temple in Hacienda
Heights, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Buddhist monks and nuns there were straw donors for campaign
contributions illegally funneled from the temple, but Gore
contended that he was unaware of any wrongdoing at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Another is Gore's defense of making 52 campaign fundraising
phone calls from his White House office despite federal law
prohibiting political fundraising on government property.
</P>
<P>
   At a now-famous 1997 press conference, Gore used the phrase ``no
controlling legal authority'' seven times in insisting to reporters
that there was no law that made such calls illegal.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the question of whether Gore can overcome the
negative side of Clinton's legacy _ everything from the Whitewater
real estate imbroglio to questionable fundraising to the Monica
Lewinsky sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's closely associated with Clinton and he seems to be
carrying Clinton's negative baggage,'' said George Edwards III,
director of the Center for Presidential Studies at Texas A&AMP;M. ``It
has nothing to do with personality. People just might not want a
third Clinton term.''
</P>
<P>

Democrats complaining anonymously that the effort to get Gore into

</P>
<P>
   Even President Clinton took a few whacks at Gore, telling the

</P>
<P>
   To tighten up his organization, Gore gave his campaign's reins

 &HT;    DEMOCRATIC PARTY LEADERS ATTACK BUSH'S RECORD, TIES TO CONGRESS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The leaders of the Democratic National Committee
assaulted the record of George W. Bush with unusual ferocity
Thursday and sought to link the Texas governor with the Republican
leaders of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The attack prompted a suggestion from the Bush's presidential
campaign that Democrats are ``pushing the panic button'' over his
commanding lead in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   DNC co-chairs Roy Romer and Joe Andrews spoke at a breakfast
with reporters just two days before Bush's much-anticipated first
trip to Iowa and New Hampshire as a prospective candidate for the
2000 Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   They frequently drew comparisons with Vice President Al Gore,
contending that Gore's extensive experience, personal integrity and
commitment to successful economic policies made him a better choice
for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Romer characterized Bush's cautious support for the NATO-led
bombing in Kosovo to ``hiding in the bushes'' at the Alamo. Andrews
compared the well-financed Bush campaign to the Titanic, ready to
``hit the iceberg'' of public scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   In their comments and in a a 13-page review of his career they
distributed, they belittled the record Bush has compiled during his
five years as governor.
</P>
<P>
   Romer credited Bush with cutting taxes and improving education
in the Lone Star state. But he said nearly every governor could
make the same claim as a result of a national economy strengthened
by the economic policies of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is in a a group of 30 to 40 governors that have
done fairly well in handling good times,'' Romer said.
</P>
<P>
   The party leaders also sought to link Bush to the Republican
leadership in Congress, which has been in disarray over budget
priorities, education and gun control legislation in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ``has been anointed by the establishment'' of the
Republican Party, and the GOP's budget priorities reflect a
``reckless public policy,'' Romer said, citing a proposed cut in
Head Start funding that would result in 50,000 children cut from
the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Republican candidate for president cannot avoid some
responsibility for what that party is doing,'' he added. That is
especially true for Bush, he said, because 114 Republican House
members have endorsed his presidential bid, an unprecedented number
at such an early stage in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   They include Majority Leader Dick Armey and Majority Whip Tom
DeLay, fellow Texans whose conservative views do not fit
comfortably into the governor's mold of ``compassionate
conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   Romer said Bush should be forced to explain to voters how he
would get his ``compadres from Texas'' to abandon the GOP's current
budget and to line up behind spending that ``the rest of America
wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Beckwith, chief spokesman for the Bush presidential
campaign, said the attack suggested that Democrats ``long to return
to the Newt Gingrich days when they could raise money by making him
into a bogeyman on every issue that came up.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckwith said Democrats ``have to realize they've got to deal
with George Bush now, not with some congressional fright mask that
they manage to create.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that with Bush continuing to lead Gore in polls by
substantial margins, ``there is a whiff of desperation in the air
at the DNC'' for ``such big guns to be out attacking'' Bush at this
stage of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to think that they're pushing the panic button very,
very early,'' Beckwith said.

SAN FRANCISCO WEIGHS SAFETY OF ARMADILLO MEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL DOUGAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Armadillos are in San Francisco, and city health
officials have learned what every Texas school kid already knows:
Armadillos, like humans, can contract leprosy.
</P>
<P>
   The carapaced critters are turning up in Chinatown food stores,
waiting for an adventurous gourmet to take out his or her wallet
and surprise the family at dinner time.
</P>
<P>
   Also called Hansen's disease, leprosy is a progressive ailment
that causes hideous deformations, though it is now treatable and
less prone to scar those who have it.
</P>
<P>
   Who eats armadillos? ``Aggies, mostly,'' said Texas biologist
Jerry Cook, in a wry reference to students at Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   A tour of Chinatown Wednesday failed to find any armadillos on
display, but there were two in the freezer at a market on Stockton
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Employees declined to be interviewed, but many passersby stopped
to examine one of the frozen beasts after it had been purchased and
removed from the bag on the sidewalk outside. (At $5.99 a pound,
this armadillo cost $37.50.) Some shoppers said they had eaten
armadillo in China, mostly in soup.
</P>
<P>
   Several Chinatown butchers said they had carried armadillo in
the past, but stopped because they were under the impression it had
been banned. It has not.
</P>
<P>
   What is the connection between armadillos and leprosy? ``I know
that they are susceptible to it, and I know they are used as a
laboratory animal in studying the disease,'' Cook said. ``But
there's a long distance between susceptibility and carrying.''
</P>
<P>
   Can leprosy be transmitted from armadillos to humans? ``The only
studies that have been done suggest that people who handle
armadillos _ wildlife biologists or people who trap them _ have a
slightly higher rate of leprosy than people who have never been
exposed to armadillos,'' said Jane Mahlow, a physician with the
Texas Department of Health. ``The supposition is that people can
catch it from armadillos, although it's never been definitively
proven.''
</P>
<P>
   A separate study determined that a higher percentage of leprosy
patients in Los Angeles had been exposed to armadillos than those
in a control group, said Robert Gelbert, a clinical professor at
the University of California at San Francisco. Gelbert has spent
much of his life studying leprosy for the U.S. Public Health
Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one believes that armadillos are a major source of
transmission of leprosy,'' he said. ``It spreads from person to
person by nasal droplets, perhaps it gets into the soil or what
have you. But armadillos could play a role.''
</P>
<P>
   Health officials are combing Chinatown markets and restaurants
to find out how much armadillo meat is being sold in San Francisco
and where it comes from, said Ben Gayle of the city Health
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that it's confined to the Chinatown community,
but that's where we got our first lead from,'' Gayle said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Is it in the genes?
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps the water?
</P>
<P>
   As he prepared for his first campaign swing outside of Texas,
Gov. George W. Bush tied himself this week into the same
no-new-taxes knot that politically strangled his father.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't necessary and it wasn't wise.
</P>
<P>
   He promised to ``oppose and veto any increase in individual or
corporate marginal income tax rates or individual or corporate
income tax hikes.'' Unless he has adopted President Clinton's style
of splitting legal hairs, this seems to rule out taxes that are
often paraded as something else, such as user fees, gasoline taxes
and tobacco fines.
</P>
<P>
   Why did Bush do this? He's so far ahead in the presidential
polls he could have survived the pressure on him from tax-cut
radicals demanding he take the rigid pledge already made by his
less popular rivals. So far, they need him more than he needs them.
He can write his own script; he doesn't have to take orders or play
copy-cat.
</P>
<P>
   New Hampshire, the first primary state, loves low taxes.
Genuflecting to that sentiment is expected of GOP contenders.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, New Hampshire isn't the nation. In poll after poll,
voters put issues that require government activism, such as better
education and protection of Social Security, ahead of tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   So far the primaries are not Bush's biggest problem. No
Republican contender comes within a mile of him.
</P>
<P>
   At this rate, his problem will be the general election in
November 2000, facing Vice President Al Gore. (Trust me: it won't
be ex-Sen. Bill Bradley).
</P>
<P>
   Bush beats Gore in the trial heats at the moment, but a savvy
sitting vice president is no patsy. And with Monica gone and the
Kosovo war crisis fading, Gore may well wriggle clear of the worst
Clinton administration baggage and advance his own agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush is playing it safe by hewing to GOP tax cut
orthodoxy, voters don't yet know much about him. He has forfeited
an opportunity to project an image of a truly independent, new
breed Republican who could overcome the partisan polarization in
Washington and keep the country moving. Sadly and suddenly, he
looks like the same old scorpion out of the same old bottle.
</P>
<P>
   There is more to governing than being a skinflint and lowering
taxes, as Bush knows.
</P>
<P>
   That's what he has been getting at with his emphasis on
``compassionate conservatism.'' A president is not just a stingy
national bookkeeper. He is supposed to help government better serve
its people, which means backing policies and projects that cost
money and must be paid for somehow.
</P>
<P>
   Remember when Texas Sen. Phil Gramm crowed after a government
shutdown following the 1995 budget stalemate that nobody would miss
the bureaucrats? Well, it turned out people did miss them and the
services they provided. His GOP presidential candidacy evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale
carried only one state in 1984 after admitting he would hike taxes,
no politician has dared to confess favoring that means of
revenue-raising. But to go so far in the other direction as to
eliminate in advance a potential financial tool that may later be
required to keep the budget balanced or perpetuate badly needed
programs is equally foolish.
</P>
<P>
   Only two months ago, the younger Bush indicated he had learned a
lesson from his father's bad experience. During the 1988 GOP
convention President Bush had vowed, ``Read my lips: No new
taxes.'' But two years later, he was forced to break that promise
to reach a budget agreement with the Democratic-controlled Congress
aimed at stimulating the economy and fending off a recession that
threatened his re-election. The president lost to Bill Clinton four
years later at least in part because his opponents mocked him for
that reversal.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether his father's big mistake was in making the promise
or in breaking it, George W. Bush replied, ``I think making it, for
certain. Once he made it and broke it, it cost him a lot of
credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   But now George W. has voluntarily walked into the same verbal
trap. He has needlessly limited his operational options. After all,
a little user fee here and a tobacco tax there are not going to
drive voters screaming into the hills.
</P>
<P>
   And the trap comes with a new catch. Why should voters believe
he'll stick to his promise when his father couldn't do so? There's
an old saying: Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on
me.
</P>
<P>
   The tax-cutting ideologues who persuaded Bush to do this contend
that he won't be caught in the same bind as his father because
times have changed. The nation is prosperous, the federal budget
has a surplus and tax-cutting Republicans control Congress.
</P>
<P>
   So what? The economic and political conditions that prevail
today may be gone tomorrow. Prosperity can wane. The GOP can lose
control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   No, Bush has taken a reckless, unprovoked risk. And since he has
matched the other GOP candidates in a no-new-taxes pledge, the
primary campaign issues will inevitably move to stickier areas.
</P>
<P>
   How to divide the federal pie without increased revenues? How to
boost military spending without touching Social Security and
slam-dunking the federal budget? Whose favorite domestic program is
to go?
</P>
<P>
   The fun has only begun.

   KOSOVO-RDP (Brussels) _ NATO suspended the bombing of Yugoslavia
Thursday afternoon, after confirming that Serbian troops had begun
withdrawing from Kosovo hours earlier. The halt after 78 days set
the stage for a United Nations Security Council resolution that
permits 50,000 international peacekeepers to move in on Friday to
help a million and a half ethnic Albanian refugees try to go home.

<P>
   KOSOVO-FORCE (Skopje, Yugoslavia) _ NATO Thursday night abrubtly
scrubbed plans for a dawn entry into Kosovo by British
paratroopers, putting its peacekeeping operation on at least a
24-hour hold. The plan, which had been kept secret, was quietly
cancelled tonight, as was a technical and logistical briefing that
had been scheduled earlier in the day, at which NATO officers had
said they would outline the deployment of the various forces,
predominantly British, French, Italian and American at this point,
and their schedule for entering Kosovo behind the departing Serb
forces. By John Kifner.

   KOSOVO-SERBIA (Podujevo, Yugoslavia) _ As the long army convoy
roared out of Kosovo Thursday, beginning a defeated Serbia's
painful retreat from its historical heartland, a military policeman
in his black beret snapped a salute to each passing vehicle, tears
streaming down his face. Small knots of Serbs gathered quietly on
Podujevo's streetcorners in the wearying sun as the long column
moved past. Soldiers rode in military trucks and civilian busses,
and in passenger cars of every kind. Trucks full of stretchers
moved past, then portable kitchens and armored personnel carriers.
The Serbs stood shocked, pale and still, as if their blood was
draining into the gutter. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-ALBANIA (Kukes, Albania) _ There were shouts of joy in
the refugee camps last night as Kosovar Albanians crowded around
radios to hear the news of peace in the Balkans. But on Thursday
morning after, most said that they were too frightened for now to
rush back across the border and would wait for assurances from NATO
and humanitarian agencies that Kosovo was safe. Some said they
expected to remain in the camps for as long as two more months,
even though many are only an hour's drive from home. By Elisabeth
Bumiller.

</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-MILOSEVIC (Belgrade) _ President Slobodan Milosevic spoke
to his people Thursday in a televised address, wishing them a happy
peace and calling the servicemen who died heroes, who gave their
lives in the struggle for freedom and dignity. ''The aggression is
over. Happy peace to us all,'' he said, standing stiffly in his
trademark blue suit by the fireplace of a state room in the White
Palace. It was his first speech to the public since last October
and the first time he has attempted to justify the conflict with
NATO to the people of Serbia. By Carlotta Gill.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-U.S.-TROOPS (Petrovic, Macedonia) _ More than 3,000
American ground troops poured into dusty, makeshift camps near the
airport here Thursday, as the United States scrambled to amass its
contribution to a peacekeeping operation in Kosovo fraught with
risks and uncertain support back home. By Steven Lee Myers.

SERBS IN HEAVILY ALBANIAN CITY FEAR REVENGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PODUJEVO, Yugoslavia _ As the long army convoy roared out of
Kosovo Thursday, beginning a defeated Serbia's painful retreat from
its historical heartland, a military policeman in his black beret
snapped a salute to each passing vehicle, tears streaming down his
face.
</P>
<P>
   Small knots of Serbs gathered quietly on Podujevo's street
corners in the wearying sun as the long column moved past. Soldiers
rode in military trucks and civilian buses, and in passenger cars
of every kind. Trucks full of stretchers moved past, then portable
kitchens and armored personnel carriers. The Serbs stood shocked,
pale and still, as if their blood was draining into the gutter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all we have,'' one man said quietly. ``There's no one
here now to defend us. Now they'll try to cut my throat any way
they want.''
</P>
<P>
   He fears revenge from the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army, he
said, gesturing toward this city's burned and looted streets.
Podujevo was 95 percent Albanian before this passionate and
murderous war of expulsion, threat and panic began. Most of this
city's 1,500 or so Serbs have already left, and Vukasin Zivaljevic
was planning to leave Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got until the evening to pack my stuff and get out,'' he
said, beginning to shake. ``Because tonight I think the KLA will
come back to town.''
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs in the municipal building, Srbislav Bisercic, head of
the Podujevo administration, tried to persuade Serbs to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's futile,'' he told a foreign reporter. ``I told you months
ago what would happen, that all the Serbs here would leave. It's
easy for the Serbs in Pristina or Srbica or Kosovo Polje or
Gnjilane to stay; it's like Serbia for them. It's very difficult to
be a Serb in Podujevo.''
</P>
<P>
   Bisercic, a competent and imposing man, is furious that the
arrangements between NATO and Yugoslavia have left a vacuum that is
sucking the Serbs out of Podujevo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Yugoslav army and police are leaving and where are the
troops of the United Nations?'' he asked. ``They should be here now
to protect and guarantee the security and free movement of both the
Serbs and the Albanians. Of course there is panic among the people
now. They're terrified, they're afraid of revenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Slobodan Milenkovic, the head of the local chapter of the
Yugoslav Red Cross, had the first drink of his life on Thursday.
``For 53 years I haven't drunk a drop,'' he said, spilling some
raki, the local plum brandy, from his shaking hands. He downed it
quickly, then Bisercic poured him another.
</P>
<P>
   Milenkovic has worked for the Red Cross for nine years, and
before a foreigner, he began to plead his case. ``Of course the big
majority of the help is for the Albanians, because they are the
majority here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Just Wednesday, he said, he helped city officials bring 205
Albanians, mostly women and children, into town from the burned-out
village of Metohija, where they were living out in the open and
unable to get enough supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Albanians return us one part of the good, we local
Serbs will be fine,'' Milenkovic said. ``But one part of the
Albanians prepare a real revenge, and everyone knows it. It doesn't
matter who is guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked who, then, is responsible for the devastation of the
Albanian areas of Podujevo, Milenkovic insisted: ``Outsiders.'' He
said plaintively: ``We were scared ourselves of these people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bisercic said that local Serbs did not do the damage, but did
not deny that it was an organized rampage to drive the Albanians
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The policy is the policy,'' he said finally, throwing up his
hands. ``And policy is like a prostitute, and it doesn't have a
soul.''
</P>
<P>
   On the wall of his office, Bisercic has a calendar from the
Socialist Party of Serbia, the ruling party of President Slobodan
Milosevic. Sparkling young people ride a jeep on a beach, looking
like an ad for the Gap. It is a surreal touch in this dingy office,
where the bulky, ancient police radio is silent and cigarette ash
dusts everything, and where Bisercic knows that his power _ and
that of his president _ is quickly slipping away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we Serbs will start to speak English,'' he suddenly said,
laughing bitterly. But Bisercic, who has always packed a pistol,
says he will stay in Podujevo no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   Vuceta Djordjevic, 52, is in a hurry. He wants to pack his house
and his family and go, by Friday at the latest. He lives in a small
mixed village two miles from here called Perane, and he will move
his wife, three children and six grandchildren to Kursumlija,
outside Kosovo, where he has relatives.
</P>
<P>
   If he can, he says, he'll take his pigs and cattle, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born here, and my father and my grandfather,''
Djordjevic said, wringing his scarred farmer's hands.
</P>
<P>
   The Albanians are gone from Perane, their homes and stables
burned and trashed, and Djordjevic, who says he did nothing bad to
anyone, is afraid to be home when they return _ or more precisely,
when the fighters of the KLA return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I'm afraid of the KLA coming down from the forest,''
he said. ``The KLA used to dig their trenches on my land. Now we
have no army and no police and no guards, and who will guarantee my
safety? The international forces are not here to guarantee
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Djordjevic, like Milenkovic, will go but says he wants to come
back. ``Where else have I to live?'' he asks. ``I have no other
house. The graves of my parents are here, and of my grandparents.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Late Wednesday night in Pristina, as the news spread about the
coming withdrawal of the Yugoslav army, people shot thousands of
rounds of ammunition into the air.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, at the Corzo cafe, where many Albanians
also take a morning espresso, the song on the sound system pleaded:
``Stay! Don't run away. Please! Just for one more day. Don't be
walking away.''
</P>
<P>
   A young Yugoslav soldier, Stevan Lazarevic, said he mostly felt
sad _ at the loss of friends, at the stupidity of the war. ``No one
here feels defeated,'' he said. ``But there is a lot of anger at
Belgrade, at people who can't live without elevators and water for
more than a few days.''
</P>
<P>
   He was awaiting orders, but he would go home to Nis, he said.
And he was proud of his service, and of his comrades.
</P>
<P>
   A former soldier, Sasa, who served seven months last year in
Kosovo and now works for a Western news agency, said he was
relieved to be alive. But he was also completely depressed, he
said. ``It's not just the loss of Kosovo, which no foreigner can
really understand. It's all the death and pain. I saw 250 dead
civilians with my own eyes, killed by NATO bombs, and it will be
offensive to hear NATO come in and talk of humanism and morality.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the roads, stretching beyond the destroyed homes and shops
and farms, the meadows blaze with lavender and red flowers.
</P>
<P>
   The red flowers are known as ``bozur,'' and are said to
represent the Serbian blood that has flowed in the defense of
Kosovo. ``This whole land is watered with blood, Serb and
Albanian,'' said a mobilized soldier, hitching a ride, glad to have
survived this latest bloodletting and sure that it will not be the
last.
</P>
<P>
   At the Gazimestan monument on Thursday, on Kosovo Polje, ``the
field of blackbirds,'' where the Serbs lost to the Turks and
founded their national myth, weeds are growing between the tan
stones. The Serbian restaurant there is destroyed, its windows
gaping.
</P>
<P>
   This is where, in 1989, a gray party secretary from the capital
of Belgrade, Slobodan Milosevic, catapulted to power when he
promised thousands of anxious Serbs that ``no one will beat you
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a visitor stepped carefully, looking for land
mines. On the monument, stuck into an iron Serbian sword, lay one
bozur flower, faded to a pale orange by the sun.

MOST REFUGEES ARE WARY ON RETURNING TO KOSOVO RIGHT AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

   KUKES, Albania _ There were shouts of joy in the refugee camps
Wednesday night as Kosovar Albanians crowded around radios to hear
news of peace in the Balkans. But Thursday morning after, most said
they were too frightened to rush back across the border for now.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, many refugees said they would wait for assurances from
NATO and aid agencies that Kosovo was safe. Some said they expected
to remain in the camps for as long as two more months, even though
many are only an hour's drive from home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo should be empty of Serbian police _ then we'll go,''
said Sanije Sopaj, 37, who arrived here by tractor with her husband
and four children on May 5. ``And we're also scared of land
mines.''
</P>
<P>
   Other refugees, chiefly men who were forced to leave wives and
children in Kosovo, said they would go back as soon as the border
opened, possibly within days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will walk in after NATO,'' said Hajrullah Smakiqi, 41, who
was imprisoned for a month in Kosovo and does not know what
happened to his wife since being separated from her by Serbian
police on April 25. ``I am sure when I go back, I will cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Rupert Colville, a spokesman for the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees, said Thursday that aid agencies cannot
stop people from going back to Kosovo before it is safe, but if
they do it will be ``complete chaos,'' and ``at their own risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency estimates that about half of the 785,000 refugees in
countries and provinces neighboring Kosovo will return within three
months.
</P>
<P>
   The peace agreement brought cautious hope to the the 120,000
refugees at the seven camps in this crumbling border town, who have
tried their best to settle into a semblance of normal life.
</P>
<P>
   Schools in at least two camps started Monday, but without books,
paper, pencils and any other supplies. Babies have been born and
birthdays celebrated. Crudely made swing sets and volleyball courts
have been set up.
</P>
<P>
   Refugees who were doctors, nurses and teachers back in Kosovo
have become doctors, nurses and teachers in the camps. Children who
never knew each other before, like Violeta Sopaj and Albulena
Hoxhaj, both 10, have become close friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go back to Kosovo, I will miss her and she will miss
me,'' said Albulena, who was walking around her camp holding hands
with Violeta. Both went to school Thursday at their camp outside of
town run by Doctors Without Borders and the United Nations, where
678 students in grades 1 through 8 went to classes for three hours
in large, very warm tents.
</P>
<P>
   The second grade of 23 students was taught by Vlora Hamzam, 26,
a second grade teacher in Kosovo, who said she was happy to have
work, even though it is as a volunteer. ``It's very, very good for
us to do something,'' she said. ``I'm in contact with children
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Her 23 extraordinarily well behaved students sat on the rocky
red dirt inside the floorless tent, then stood one by one to recite
multiplication tables. When one boy got all the way through his 5's
without a hitch, Ms. Hamzam praised him as he took a bow.
</P>
<P>
   By and large, the people in the refugee camps are the poorer
Albanians of Kosovo _ those with money have rented houses and
apartments here _ but there are exceptions. Nadire Hasani, 42, who
designs traditional Albanian clothes for weddings and celebrations,
and whose husband owns a coffee bar in the city of Mitrovica, said
in her tent that ``never in my life did I sleep on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   She wore an old T-shirt and a long, brown skirt. ``You can't
imagine how I looked in Kosovo,'' she said. ``Color in my hair _
very elegant.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hasani offered her visitor coffee in a china cup she had
bought in town, and showed the cans of Norwegian herring and
packages of Italian pasta _ capellini and spaghetti _ that she
receives from the camp. Food is distributed twice a day, at 10 a.m.
and 3 p.m., chiefly canned fish, meat and bean soup.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hasani's daughter, Vjollca, 17, brought out pictures of
family vacations on the beach in Montenegro and of her high school
class. When she said she missed her friends, her mother's eyes
filled with tears.
</P>
<P>
   The Hasanis were ordered out of their home by Serbian police on
April 14 and fled to the home of an aunt in a nearby village. But
within a day the police had surrounded the village, shooting and
burning homes, and the Hasanis got in their car and entered the
convoy heading for the border. They crossed over on April 18,
unsure they would ever be back.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came into Kukes I told my father that if I'm going to
die here it's better that you should bring my body to Kosovo,''
Vjollca Hasani said. ``I don't want my grave to be in Albania.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hasanis looked into renting an apartment in town, but
decided it was too expensive _ refugees complain that local
Albanians are charging exorbitant rates _ and that they would feel
more secure with other Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest problems with the camp, Ms. Hasani said, is
boredom. ``We clean tents,'' Ms. Hasani said. ``We eat. We walk
around. We wash clothes. We wait to make phone calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Although physical conditions in the camps are still hot, dusty
and basic, and some, like one run by the Italian government, have
foul-smelling latrines, Ms. Hasani said the peace agreement has
allowed her to tolerate life here, at least at this moment, until
she can return home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want to be sure that the landmines are gone,'' she
said. ``Until now, we have been impatient. But now we know NATO
will go inside. Now it's not a problem. We can be patient and
wait.''

   AUSTIN, Texas _ There are good reasons why mainstream audiences
don't clamor to see a John Sayles movie. He's drawn to commercially
inert subject matter, from rankled labor unions to obscure Irish
folklore, on which he heaps sociopolitical freight that causes
old-fashioned entertainment to wheeze and buckle. Moviegoers, bless
their souls, know a chore when they see one.
</P>
<P>
   What the masses risk missing are films of singular, if raw,
compassion and often cutting social insight. For all his noble
pretensions, Sayles' films are finally about people and place. In
works as varied as ``Matewan,'' ``Passion Fish'' and ``Lone Star,''
he alights on universal truths and reveals stuff about us we aren't
always prepared to embrace in the relaxing gloom of the movie
house.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as engaging as Sayles' films are, they always feel slightly
lumpy, forced, attenuated. Like Paul Schrader _ another
intellectual striving for artistic grace _ Sayles' boldfaced themes
don't always dovetail with his narrative ambitions. He has yet to
make a perfect picture.
</P>
<P>
   His new drama, ``Limbo,'' is far from perfect, but it pulls you
in with its storytelling risks and bumps, its unpredictable arc,
its maddeningly rough edges. The story, frankly, is a mess, and
Sayles throws structure and consistency of tone to the wind.
</P>
<P>
   The title ``Limbo'' is vintage Sayles, a ponderous thematic cue
to the condition of the main characters' fissured lives. Set in
contemporary Juneau, Alaska, the story starts wide, encompassing an
Altmanesque menagerie of chattering characters. The scope slowly
tapers, until the third act, where we're left in the intimate
company of single-mother Donna (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), her
teen-age daughter Noelle (Vanessa Martinez), and Joe Gastineau
(David Strathairn). In a dramatic snap that feels misplaced here,
the trio has been marooned on a small, uninhabited island in the
Alaskan wilderness, and this is where they will stay until the
final, perplexing frame.
</P>
<P>
   Sayles has made two movies here and pushed them into an uneasy
marriage of social critique and domestic rumblings. The switch is
jarring but oddly compelling.
</P>
<P>
   Sayles has real feeling for regional flavors, and he begins
``Limbo'' exerting this knack (with fine help from veteran
cinematographer Haskell Wexler). Right off, he places Alaska's
mushrooming tourist industry in his editorial cross hairs and
illustrates how traditional Alaskan vocations, like fishing and
lumber, are being blotted out. Sayles' instinct for platitudes, and
his ineptitude at irony, blare in these scenes. In condescending
tones we hear about the Disney-fication of the region _ including
tin-eared quips at the expense of geriatric cruise-ship passengers
_ and we're even subjected to a stop-the-action-dead jeremiad from
a disgruntled fishery worker.
</P>
<P>
   Sayles' rote soapbox liberalism abruptly gives way to the story
of frazzled bar singer Donna; her petulant daughter, who's had
enough of her mother's flaky love life; and the man who quietly
enters their lives. If not for the commanding performance of
Mastrantonio as the good but distracted mother and newcomer
Martinez's fiercely persuasive turn as Noelle, this slice of the
story would languish in domestic banality. The actors make it
consistently fresh and interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Strathairn's Joe is haunted by a fishing accident he was a part
of 25 years ago, in which two men were killed. He has shriveled
into himself, tiptoeing life's sidelines _ drifting in limbo. He is
painfully reticent, his rugged face a mask of melancholy and shame.
He looks halfway between a brood and a beaten-dog flinch. It's a
great and affecting performance.
</P>
<P>
   When the three of them become stranded for a long time in the
freezing woods, courtesy of twists I'll leave alone, they are given
the time and enforced intimacy with which to unpack and sort their
tangled problems.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lengthy stretch of the movie, and it feels tacked on,
like pants that don't fit. Several interludes showing Noelle
reading aloud from a diary she finds in a derelict forest dwelling
simply don't work and reveal Sayles' schematic writing and a
tone-deafness for hard emotional truths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Limbo's'' rash ending will annoy some people as much as it
leaves others (myself included) in a state of liberated expectation
_ something few movies would trust to leave with an audience. It
doesn't so much show its ending as it does deposit it.
</P>
<P>
   The end works because the key plot strands have been resolved;
the characters have changed. Any other conclusion would have been
pat or, worse, overwrought. Its sheer unorthodoxy, much like the
whole of the film, is its own payoff.

 &HT;    Horror scripts finance Sayles' own ideas
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ During ``QTIII,'' the film festival thrown here
by Quentin Tarantino in February, Tarantino screened the 1980
B-horror curiosity ``Alligator.'' The movie, dreadful but harmless,
was a fatuous genre piece whose thin camp patina quickly curdled
into I-get-the-joke tedium. With predictable hyperbole, Tarantino
championed the virtues of ``Alligator,'' not the least of which was
the witty, fist-tight script by John Sayles.
</P>
<P>
   Around that time in his career, under contract to B-movie
impresario Roger Corman, one could argue Sayles harbored a perverse
penchant for flesh-snarfing beasts. Besides ``Alligators,'' he
wrote the 1978 ``Jaws'' spoof ``Piranha'' and 1980's werewolf orgy
``The Howling.'' Of course, as the active quintessence of American
independent filmmaking, Sayles has gone on to write and direct (and
edit and act in) such respectable adult fare as ``Matewan,''
``Passion Fish'' and ``Lone Star.''
</P>
<P>
   (Although this didn't stop him from hiring out his writing
talents for ``Mimic,'' Guillermo Del Toro's 1997 shriek-fest about
_ chomp, gulp _ mutant cockroaches that prey on humans.)
</P>
<P>
   Paychecks from the horror movies (blood money?) have enabled
Sayles to finance his own films, beginning with the $40,000 ``Big
Chill'' precursor ``The Return of the Secaucus Seven'' in 1980.
Films quivering with an earnest social consciousness followed,
including ``The Brother From Another Planet,'' ``Eight Men Out,''
``City of Hope'' and last year's somewhat lugubrious ``Men With
Guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with a well-developed sense of social justice and
political rectitude, Sayles consistently demonstrates a probing
interest in the ethnography of disparate cultural regions. His
films have perceptively painted the social textures and human
dynamics of the American inner city, Irish coast, Mexican border,
Deep South and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Limbo,'' Sayles' 12th film as writer-director, Alaska is
the latest frontier the filmmaker charts. The film, an existential
drama about three people trapped in the Alaskan wilds, begins as a
pointed commentary on the region's shift from a trove of natural
resources to a tawdry tourist playground. Opening today, the film
stars Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Sayles' regulars David
Strathairn and Kris Kristofferson.
</P>
<P>
   Sayles got the idea when he and his producer/life partner Maggie
Renzi visited Alaska 11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's less than a million people in Alaska, yet it's our
largest state,'' says Sayles about what drew him there. ``It's
still a place where most of the people I meet were not born there.
They came there and they're doing something or being something that
never would have been possible in the lower 48. ... It's changing
very rapidly, and a lot of the first third of the movie deals with
that.''
</P>
<P>
   At 48, the sometime novelist remains one of Hollywood's most
sought-after script doctors. In 1995, he lost an arbitration fight
with the Writer's Guild of America to receive screen credit for his
rewrite of ``Apollo 13''; Texas scribes William Broyles Jr. and Al
Reinert got credit. He also takes small roles in others' films,
including Jonathan Demme's ``Something Wild'' and Spike Lee's
``Malcolm X.'' This mercenary work allows Sayles to make his own
movies, on which he demands, and enjoys, the right to final cut.
</P>
<P>
   We recently spoke with Sayles by phone from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Unlike some of your recent films, ``Limbo'' seems more
concerned with existential quandaries, as opposed to social and
political issues.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah. I think of it as a movie about the concept of risk. For
me what limbo represents, going on the Catholic version I was given
growing up, is that it's infinite, there's no end to it, and it's
between heaven and hell. I think a lot of people live in these
kinds of personal limbos, where it's not hell, it's not that awful,
but the fear of falling into some kind of hell, the fear of
failure, is so great that they don't get themselves out of a bad
marriage or a job they hate. In order to get out of that kind of
limbo, you do have to risk. Real risk is when you don't know how
it's going to turn out.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did the Alaskan setting provide ample opportunity for social
and economic commentary?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, I think it's unavoidable. If you talk about a place you
have to show what the place is like and what's happening to it.
It's a good metaphor for what's happening to the characters. Here's
a place that even 15 years ago an awful lot of the jobs were all
men. An awful lot of the jobs were jobs that called for physical
risk. You were a lumberjack or a commercial fisherman or you worked
on the oil pipeline. More and more, those jobs are being phased-out
or the risk is being regulated out of them and the jobs are in the
tourist industry, where you're selling the illusion of risk.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You do considerable research for your films; ``Lone Star''
and ``Men With Guns'' come to mind. Did you do much on the Alaskan
way of life?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'll have an idea for something and I'll know something about
the place, so I'll read about it and whatever. In the last several
movies I've gone to the place just before I've written the script.
I have the story in my head so I'm able to go there almost as a
reporter with a shopping list of facts and conversations I want to
have with local people. The last thing I do is when we get to the
place with a written screenplay and the budget, I'll select various
people in the community and show them the script and ask them if
there's anything that strikes them as being totally inaccurate. We
get a lot of good information from people. Sometimes it's something
that just affects the art director or the costume person. For
instance, I originally had (David Strathairn's character) being a
purse seiner (a type of fisherman), which requires a bigger boat.
And local people said if he's just getting back into fishing and
he's throwing this thing back together really quickly, it's much
more likely he'd be a gill-netter, which is much simpler. That kind
of stuff is very useful.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Was it a great visual feast out there?
</P>
<P>
   A: I keep saying it's the only movie where I've had to yell
``cut'' because there were whales breaching in the background,
upstaging our actors. It's a place where you can truly turn 360
degrees and not see anything man-made. And we were only 40 miles
out of the capital city. You can take a 10-minute walk from
downtown Juneau and be attacked by a bear. Nature is that close to
civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Your films are sometimes criticized for being preachy and
didactic. ``Limbo'' seems to steer away from heavy pamphleteering.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah, but you know, that's just b.s., so ... (Laughs.) It
doesn't steer away from it, it's just harder for someone to say
that about the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Critics have their opinions, but what in your own words
interests you as a storyteller and filmmaker?
</P>
<P>
   A: I really have never thought of what I've done as a career.
I've just done one movie at a time. I'm certainly interested in
community and the fact that in the United States we really don't
live in a traditional society. It's always been a place where
people are more mobile, where people tend not to do the same thing
their fathers and grandfathers did for a living. We're a young
country and most of our history has been since the time of mass
communications. So I find that people find and build communities
that aren't necessarily based on geography. You live in a big city
and you don't know the people in your apartment building, but you
may be into poetry and you know every place where people read
poetry. That's your community.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it still hard to get a film made?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think it is. We've been very lucky with the last couple.
With ``Lone Star'' I was working as a writer for Castle Rock and
they asked if I had anything I wanted to direct, and I said no, but
that I could in a couple of weeks. In the case of ``Limbo,'' we
just went to Sony and said, ``Here's a screenplay, here's a budget,
are you interested?'' In the case of something much less commercial
like ``Men With Guns'' I just started making that with my own
money, and luckily the producers were able to find investors to
take me off the hook. I've made 12 movies now, so people have a
track record to look at. That both helps us and hurts us. We've
never made anybody $100 million. On the other hand, our movies have
come in on budget and some people have really liked them and
they've been pretty much what the screenplay said they were going
to be, so you know what you're getting into as an investor.

THE ANCIENT CHINESE ART OF PLACEMENT  
 (ADV: EMBARGOED FOR SATURDAY, MAY 12) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
By JAIMEE ROSE  
c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Do you know where your trash cans are?
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the sink,'' ``my neighbor's back yard'' and ``duh'' are
not viable answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My love corner,'' ``my career area'' and ``my wealth
quadrant'' are.
</P>
<P>
   According to feng shui, an ancient Chinese art of placement and
decorating that divides the home into nine areas that represent
aspects of life, the location of unsightly junk cans could be the
culprit behind caustic spouses or cooled creativity.
</P>
<P>
   Simply said, wherever there's clutter in the home, there's
clutter in one's life. Thus, according to feng shui masters, a
trash can in the creativity area is writer's block explained.
</P>
<P>
   Today, we reveal how to make the house a home shui home.
</P>
<P>
   First, a quick lesson in the basics.
</P>
<P>
   Feng shui (pronounced fung shway) has been around for 3,000
years. As with any age-old idea, it has branched out and been
interpreted many different ways, resulting in a number of
``schools'' of thought. For our purposes, we will use the intuitive
school.
</P>
<P>
   Feng shui is based on the flow of ``chi,'' or energy. When chi
is allowed to flow freely through the home, it creates a healthy,
happy atmosphere for inhabitants. When chi is blocked by unpleasing
or messy objects, it cuts the good vibes.
</P>
<P>
   Sounding a little karma-crazy? Take it from Scottsdale's Karen
Way, doctor of sociology turned feng shui master: This stuff works.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basically a self-fulfilling prophecy,'' she says. ``What
we surround ourselves with reflects who we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to the trash-can-placement issue.
</P>
<P>
   Way suggests placing items in areas symbolically. If the goal is
to feel more unified with a spouse, hang art selected together in
the marriage corner. If better health is a priority, place a
vibrant plant in that area. If making a good name for oneself is
needed, purge the fame and reputation quadrant of all trash cans.
</P>
<P>
   The quadrants of feng shui that represent aspects of the human
experience are mapped on an octagon shape called the bagua map,
which is to be laid over the floor plan of the home to determine
which areas fall into these categories.
</P>
<P>
   The bagua and feng shui can be applied to gardens, office
cubicles and even cars, but today, home is where our heart is.
</P>
<P>
   Because Arizona homes are about as likely to be shaped like a
stop sign as they are to be made out of anything other than stucco,
Way has supplied a square bagua, courtesy of the Western School of
Feng Shui in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   The squares each are associated with a certain color, and the
five anchoring squares have been assigned one of feng shui's five
foremost materials: earth, water, wood, fire and metal.
</P>
<P>
   Those designations have been around for three millennia, so Way
isn't sure how they came about. But most of them tend to echo the
feelings that are ideal in those areas of life.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to have all of the materials and colors balanced,
leading to a balanced life, but if you're seeking to enhance a
certain area, a little more of the recommended color or material
would be appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Feng shui has been experiencing a revival as of late. It now has
its own magazine, its own section in the bookstore, and a rash of
Internet sites dedicated to the ancient art.
</P>
<P>
   Way believes feng shui's new forest of followers sought it out
because the '80s were about excess and the '90s are about
clutter-free simplicity, which is at the heart of feng shui.
</P>
<P>
   And now, a step-by-step, square-by-square guide to making the
home karma-compatible:
</P>
<P>
   - We'll start with the entrance quadrant, which contains the
career, knowledge/self-cultivation, and helpful people/travel
squares. Align this side of the map with the front of your house,
or the side facing the street. If your front door happens to be on
the side, that's OK. You will just enter into a different area.
</P>
<P>
   The center quadrant often contains the garage. As Way says,
``there's nowhere to hide from feng shui eyes,'' so keep it clean.
And don't be afraid to hang pictures on the walls. She's seen it
done.
</P>
<P>
   The front, center square signifies the career. Pay extra
attention to this square if you're starting a new job, want a new
job or are looking for volunteer work.
</P>
<P>
   Obstacles, such as protruding furniture in this area, are bad.
They symbolize obstacles in the career path. Water, such as from a
miniature fountain, is the chief element in this area and is good.
It equals the flow of success. Make sure it flows toward the house
and not away from it. The key colors in this area are appropriately
powerful: black, navy blue, anything dark in tone. Think power
suit.
</P>
<P>
   - Moving clockwise, we come to the knowledge/self-cultivation
area. Enhance this section if you are in school, counseling, or
want a more peaceful mind or lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Do's in this segment are books, tapes or any other study
materials. This segment is associated with mountains, and blacks,
blues and greens. Think of those mountainous ``success'' posters
embraced by self-help gurus. They're great wall decorations for
this area.
</P>
<P>
   - Health/family is next. If your in-laws are making you nuts,
your health could use a boost, or sports are on the agenda, pay
extra attention here. Put up a few photos of the in-laws in
question. Healthy plants, according to Way, will help you feel
better, as will fresh flowers of all colors. Wood, not
surprisingly, is the key element. Blues and greens are the colors.
Family pictures should occupy the walls. Fountain Hills resident
Sharon Braverman's key family members are her dogs, whose furry
mugs are framed in this area.
</P>
<P>
   - Moving on, we stop in wealth/prosperity. If you need more of
this (and who doesn't?), listen up. Items that ``call the chi,'' or
get the energy flow really excited, are appropriate here, Way says.
Examples of chi enhancers are wind chimes, windsocks and flags.
</P>
<P>
   Display valuable possessions, such as antiques or art here _
even better if they're blue, purple or red. Water flow is key here,
too; it symbolizes cash flow. A pretty ``prosperity bowl'' is
another idea _ fill it with 20- and 100-dollar bills. It is
believed that if you have money in your presence, you'll have money
in your wallet.
</P>
<P>
   - Fame/reputation follows wealth. Here's a good place for a
trophy case, things relating to fire such as candles or bright
lights, and reds. Think of the bright lights of Broadway. If you've
got a fave celeb, display his or her mug here.
</P>
<P>
   - Next comes love/marriage, Way's specialty. Focus here if you
want to improve relationships with others or your personal self or
start a new relationship. She says posters or pictures of that
special someone should go here. If he or she doesn't exist, cut out
Mr. Right from a magazine. This is all about self-affirmation.
</P>
<P>
   Pairs of things are good _ doves, hearts, dolphins or other
symbols of love. Colors should range in the Valentine's Day
spectrum _ pinks, red, white, peach. Honeymoon mementos should be
located here.
</P>
<P>
   If equality among partners is an issue, make sure each partner
has his or her own night stand, and make sure they're the same
size.
</P>
<P>
   - First came love, paired with marriage, now we've come to the
baby in the baby carriage, or the children/creativity square,
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Writer's block sufferers, pay at tention. Baby-hungry couples,
read on. This area should be attended to. Posters, paintings or
collages of or by children are good for the walls here. Art that
stimulates creative juices is another option. White and pastels _
think nursery _ are the colors. Metal _ think creativity conducting
_ is the material; use it in furniture or picture frames.
</P>
<P>
   - Travel/helpful people is next. If mentors are needed or a
vacation is coming up, this should be an area of emphasis. Statues
of angels or other famous helpers are good decorations. Travel
posters are good. Gray, white and black are the colors. Religious
books would be intelligently located here.
</P>
<P>
   - Last is the center square. Way has been called to
consultations by people who feel ``scattered,'' and she often finds
that the reason is an unstable center. Ground it with the earth
element, which is key here. Yellows and earth tones are
appropriate; a display of pretty pottery also could be nice.
</P>
<P>
   Try to make the center a peaceful place. Sometimes, the center
of a home is occupied by an intersection of rooms. This can be hard
to stabilize, but be sure to know where the center is and keep it
clear of clutter. If you have a floor that is tiled, you're set in
this area, as tile generally is made of earth or clay.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Way recommends hanging a desert landscape painting on
one of the intersecting walls, or trying some earth-colored chi
enhancers. Just be sure to recognize it, keep it organized, and try
to incorporate earth elements.
</P>
<P>
   This brings us to the end of our feng shui tour.
</P>
<P>
   And remember, as you take your own home tour, to strive for
balance of all of the elements _ earth, water, wind, fire and
metal. This will keep the chi flowing and your good karma going.
Emphasize things you like, but don't leave out others.
</P>
<P>
   If your house overall lacks the element of fire, including
candles or red tones, you'll lack energy. Too much energy? Cool it
off by adding water.
</P>
<P>
   Balanced feng shui leads to a balanced life, according to Way,
but she stresses this:
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get from A to Z without working the letters in
between. I cannot guarantee that feng shui will bring husbands
back, make (people) rich, or make a fabulous career fall onto their
laps.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What I can guarantee is that feng shui can make their homes a
haven _ a springboard from which they can make positive changes in
their lives and create the results they want.''
</P>

 &HT;    `Get Real' tells truth with humor
 &HT;    By Alison Macor
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ ``I came late to sex,'' says Steven Carter (Ben
Silverstone) in Simon Shore's infectious film ``Get Real.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nearly 10,'' he tells us, and as we watch the opening
shots of a young Steven swinging on the playground, we get a
familiar montage of images that has become cinematic shorthand for
kids learning about sexual intercourse: squirming students in
health class, hilariously brief conversations between parents and
their children, and bungled explanations whispered between
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   But for all its familiarity, ``Get Real'' is an insightful,
often original film about coming-of-age and coming out in
contemporary middle-class Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``A queer John Hughes movie'' is how one savvy viewer described
the film. ``Get Real'' has all the appeal of Hughes' comical high
school scenarios, but with a gay main character and a better
ending. Also, Patrick Wilde's script subtly addresses class issues
that are either overdramatized or often completely absent in most
movies set in high school.
</P>
<P>
   Although he may have come late to sex, Steven realized he was
gay at the tender age of 11. His perceptiveness is all the more
poignant when we see him sitting nervously on a park bench hoping
to ``meet'' someone outside the men's bathroom. When he actually
does make contact, it turns out to be with the sexually confused
school stud (Brad Gorton).
</P>
<P>
   Balancing out Steven's low-key sense of humor is his
over-the-top next-door neighbor and best friend, Linda (Charlotte
Brittain), who would be perfect for the next John Waters movie.
Linda is a refreshingly secure, zaftig young woman who enjoys
dressing up: Camryn Manheim for the junior set. Linda nearly makes
the movie, and when matched with the engaging Steven, ``Get Real''
becomes that rare thing, a high school movie with characters you
actually like.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get Real'' is also the title of an essay that Steven writes as
a member of the school magazine. Without revealing his identity,
Steven details what it's like to be a gay teen-ager in the 1990s,
particularly difficult in a culture renowned for its stiff upper
lip. This essay represents Steven's reality more accurately than
the article he submits for a newspaper competition in which each
entrant must explain what it means to be a contemporary teen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get Real'' languishes during the bits of business needed to
flesh out the larger story, and it uses a rather workmanlike
approach to deal with miscellaneous supporting characters. But the
film's finest moment is its climactic outing, set appropriately
enough in the school auditorium. The scene is reminiscent of the
revelatory sequence in ``In &AMP; Out,'' when Kevin Kline's character
reveals his sexual orientation to a salivating audience ready for
full disclosure. In keeping with the tone of ``In &AMP; Out,'' Kline's
unveiling is played for laughs, but in ``Get Real,'' the more
realistic response to Steven's admission reverberates profoundly.
</P>
<P>
   The final scenes of ``Get Real'' are a vicarious thrill for
anyone who's ever suffered through high school's indignities. What
makes the conclusion so satisfying, though, is Steven's triumph in
making a private battle public.

 &HT;    'Powers' on best behavior
 &HT;    By Chris Garcia
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Mike Myers knows how to milk a joke till it's
chapped. It's a trick he learned in his years at ``Saturday Night
Live,'' where even the lamest gags are stretched, wrung, diced and
cannibalized. And their poor corpses aren't buried. They're turned
into movies.
</P>
<P>
   Myers milks hard in ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me,''
the tonic, joyously crude sequel to 1997's hit James Bond spoof
``Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery,'' which introduced
us to the era-hopping British secret agent.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky for him, that's part of the joke _ to watch Myers and his
motley screenmates ride funny bits until they sputter into the
comic ether. The embarrassed characters just stand there, looking
around like dogs who've wet the carpet, letting out limp, residual
chuckles. Then, as if nothing happened, they troop on to the next
set-up.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the snaggle-toothed agent may dissent, but ``The Spy Who
Shagged Me'' surpasses its predecessor. Overstuffed with wink-nods
and iconoclastic glee (see the pasting Starbucks takes), the new
movie contains more self-reflexive moments like the above. It also
is looser and more wackily ambitious. The writing is savvier and
the jokes funnier, even if the phallic visual puns and fecal
enthusiasm bludgeon instead of tickle. Myers' vanity affair seems
to profit from co-writer Michael McCullers, a former ``SNL''
scribe. Jay Roach returns to direct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shagged'' starts where the first ``Austin Powers'' left off _
in Powers' heavily trafficked bedroom, naturally. It's 1999 and
Powers, a trollish figure who's all fur and epileptic twitches, is
basking in postcoital fumes with token babe-heroine Vanessa
Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley). When she exposes that she isn't what
she seems by literally blowing up yet another spy-flick cliche,
Powers turns to us, beams those donkey teeth and exclaims, ``That
means I'm single again!''
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for him and us, except that his nemesis, Dr.
Evil (also played by Myers), is responsible for this turn of
events. Which means Dr. Evil is no longer drifting through space in
his Bob's Big Boy vessel and has returned to Earth to vaporize the
joint. Better yet, Dr. Evil has contrived a time machine, in which
he travels back to 1969 to steal Powers' ``mojo'' _ the key to the
spy's unquenchable libido.
</P>
<P>
   British intelligence, led by Basil Exposition (Michael York,
dignity in tact), one-ups Evil with a time-traveling Volkswagen
Bug. To foil the bald baddie, Powers takes it for a spin, right
back to his own swinging '60s. He lands in his London pad, a garish
den of Warholian decadence, where ``Laugh-In'' go-go girls writhe
to Steppenwolf and the Guess Who.
</P>
<P>
   Here Powers hooks up with CIA operative and walking
double-entendre Felicity Shagwell, played by a game but underused
Heather Graham, whose tiny head can hardly contain her blank,
Keane-painting orbs.
</P>
<P>
   Myers gives equal screen time to Dr. Evil, who looks like Uncle
Fester carved from wax. He's a bizarre invention, feyly fellating a
manicured pinky while gurgling baby-talk. Myers also provides him
two hilarious henchman _ an obese Scottish spy named Fat Bastard
(played by Myers, amazingly) and a botched one-eighth-size Dr. Evil
clone, whom he calls Mini-Me (Texas actor Verne Troyer).
</P>
<P>
   ``Shagged'' is great, rude fun, splashed in Blow-Pop colors. I
didn't find the slight comedy half as gut-busting as some
spectators at a preview show (I've never rocked in my chair,
slapped my thigh and made ostrich noises before), but it did
provide an amusing buzz for the rest of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, some of these merry young men were busy connecting
the synaptic dots between the rash of satirical allusions and nods
to the first movie, which go well beyond Myers' creative vocabulary
(``shagadelic,'' etc.).
</P>
<P>
   Like the ``Airplane!'' series, ``Powers'' is scorched-earth
parody. The crossfire hits an encyclopedia of pop culture: ``Star
Wars,'' Willie Nelson, ``The Exorcist,'' ``The Island of Dr.
Moreau,'' the Chili's baby-back ribs jingle, ``The Great Santini''
and Chaplin's ``The Great Dictator'' (ingeniously melded in one
scene), all-purpose punchline Jerry Springer, and, of course, the
entire James Bond canon _ from Ursula Andress' white bikini in
``Dr. No'' to the climactic space sequence in ``Moonraker.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in this jungle of jokes, the comedy breathes. And
``Powers'' fans can rejoice: From the way this one ends, there's
gonna be a third.

MILOSEVIC WISHES SERBS A ``HAPPY PEACE'' 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ President Slobodan Milosevic spoke to his
people on Thursday in a televised address, wishing them a happy
peace and calling the servicemen who died heroes who gave their
lives for freedom and dignity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aggression is over, happy peace to us all,'' he said
standing stiffly in his trademark blue suit by the fireplace of a
state room in the White Palace. It was his first speech to the
public since October and the only time he has personally addressed
the people of Serbia on the conflict with NATO. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He also gave the first exact figures of Serbian troop fatalities
in the 11 weeks of bombing _ 462 army soldiers and 114 members of
the police forces. ``We shall never be able to repay them,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has spoken of much higher casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The president also praised ordinary people for their part. ``The
entire people participated in this war, from babies in hospitals to
intensive-care patients, to soldiers in air-defense positions and
soldiers on the border,'' he said. ``The people are the hero of
this war. This may be the shortest way to sum up this war.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly aware of the growing internal criticism that he put the
country through an ordeal for nothing, Milosevic did not claim
victory. But his speech was a careful presentation of successes of
the people, not of the government or leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never gave up Kosovo,'' he said, sticking to the pledge
often repeated at rallies over the last year. Territorial integrity
and sovereignty are guaranteed, and the United Nations' involvement
is assured, he added.
</P>
<P>
   He claimed responsibility for bringing the United Nations to the
world stage as the foremost organization of world power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have defended the only multiethnic society left over as a
remnant of former Yugoslavia,'' Milosevic said. ``This is another
great achievement of our defense.''
</P>
<P>
   He made no mention of NATO troops' arriving in Kosovo, but
promised his people that those forces would serve peace regardless
of their origin, a stark change from the usual government
vilification of NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   Looking forward to the enormous job of reconstructing the
country, Milosevic examined the extraordinary unity that rallied
the Serbian people. ``Never before have our people been so
united,'' he said, ``and never in our history did we have less
cowards who fled the country to await the war's end abroad in
safety.''
</P>
<P>
   That may have been a criticism of the leader of the Democratic
Party, Zoran Djindjic, who spent much of the war in Montenegro
after have received death threats here.
</P>
<P>
   Growing animated, Milosevic said: ``We shall begin rebuilding
our bridges immediately, our factories, our roads. The work ahead
will require great mobilization. I wish all citizens of Yugoslavia
much joy and success in reconstruction of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   As the people of Belgrade relaxed in the sunshine and admitted
their relief that the war was over, Milosevic's political rivals
were calling news conferences and issuing statements, agitating for
change.
</P>
<P>
   Goran Svilanovic, leader of the Civic Alliance, the most liberal
democratic opposition party, if one of the smallest, called for the
federal Assembly to convene to discuss Milosevic's responsibility
for this ``tragic war'' and hold a vote of no confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Former Deputy Prime Minister Vuk Draskovic called for broad
changes in the government and for the expulsion of anti-West
elements. Draskovic, who is widely thought to be negotiating to
return to the government, is trying to oust the extreme
nationalists of the Radical Party from the government coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The radicals' leader, Vojislav Seselj, has threatened to leave
the government when foreign troops enter Kosovo. He is apparently
negotiating with the government. Thursday he said that his party
would make a decision on Monday.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The heat wave will subside in the Carolinas on Friday as a push
of ocean-cooled air from the Northeast arrives. Low clouds and
drizzle will persist along the shore where onshore breezes will be
brisk, especially from Cape Hatteras to central Delaware. A large
disturbance south of Cape Cod will progress toward the Middle
Atlantic coast perhaps leading to duller weather this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   A ridge of high pressure stretching from the Grand Banks to
eastern Pennsylvania will provide very pleasant conditions along
the Northeast coast with low humidity, abundant sunshine and an
active sea breeze. Farther inland, the return circulation around
the high will direct very warm and more humid air from the Ohio
Valley along the west slopes of the Appalachians into the St.
Lawrence Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Thundershowers will drench many parts of northern Florida,
Georgia and Alabama as a weak disturbance progresses slowly
northwestward. Tropical air will cover the southern Plains, lower
Mississippi and Ohio Valleys. Thunderstorms will develop in a few
places.
</P>
<P>
   The boundary with a cooler air mass will be active with several
clusters of thunderstorms from Kansas to Wisconsin. Showers will
linger over the western Dakotas and northeastern Rockies. Some
sunshine will be seen in the eastern Dakotas and northern
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure in Washington state will promote sunny skies and a
significant warming trend for the West. Light onshore winds will
keep patches of fog along the Pacific coast. The Southwest will
return to seasonal heat.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Back-door Front
</P>
<P>
   After temperatures flirted with 100 degrees at Boston on Monday,
readings floundered in the 60s on Thursday in the wake of a
back-door cold front, a moniker bestowed on cold fronts which move
southwestward along the Atlantic seaboard. Such a direction is
contrary to the east-southeast movement of most cold fronts (hence
the name ``back-door''). The chill behind a back-door front is
enhanced as winds from the northeast pass over cool Atlantic
waters. Some New Englanders ascribe the name ``sea turn'' to
back-door fronts, for the chilly ocean winds that follow in its
wake. &QL;

LAWMAKERS RENEW CALLS FOR MORE BORDER AGENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Kenedy County is CQ.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawmakers on a House immigration panel called on
the Clinton administration to step up efforts to hire more Border
Patrol agents amid testimony Thursday from ranchers who said the
daily influx of illegal immigrants is causing an increase in
vandalism and burglary.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, chairman of the House Judiciary
subcommittee on Immigration and Claims, said the problems would
only ``worsen with grave consequences'' without more agents and
more deportations of illegal residents.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, said more Border Patrol agents
are needed but said it was ``preposterous'' to assert that illegal
immigration had significantly worsened in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no crisis in immigration,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Vance, who lives about a mile north of the U.S.-Mexico
border in Douglas, Ariz., said that until about five years ago he
would see an occasional person entering the United States from
Mexico. Now, he said, he sees dozens of people crossing the
unguarded border near his ranch each night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been burglarized, had a truck stolen and property
vandalized,'' Vance told a subcommittee hearing attended by Smith
and Lee. ``The area along the Mexican border has become a no-man's
land where lawlessness prevails.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously this situation cannot continue,'' Smith said. He and
other lawmakers from Texas and California have criticized the
Clinton administration in recent weeks for failing to achieve a net
gain of 1,000 Border Patrol agents this year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Congress passed a law mandating the net addition of
1,000 new Border Patrol agents each year through 2001. The idea was
to double the force from 5,000 to 10,000 over five years.
</P>
<P>
   But the Immigration and Naturalization Service _ which oversees
the Border Patrol _ is only expected to achieve a net gain of 200
to 400 agents this budget year. The INS plans to hire between 1,000
and 1,200 agents but is expected to lose 800 agents through
attrition. The 1999 budget year ends Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The INS has about 8,000 Border Patrol agents.
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials have acknowledged that the problems described
by ranchers and other people living near the border exist and noted
that they have increased the overall number of Border Patrol
officers in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Chulick, an INS spokeswoman, said in an interview that
the agency has had problems recruiting and retaining personnel
because of strong economy and the relatively low $23,000 starting
salary.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin Armstrong, a rancher in Kenedy County, Texas, also spoke
of an increase in the flow of illegal immigrants through his
county, which is on the Gulf Coast, and of an increase vandalism
and burglary attributed to the illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   But he also was concerned about the welfare of the illegal
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toll on illegals themselves is appalling,'' he said,
telling the panel that the body of a 44-year-old Mexican woman was
found near his ranch earlier Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he said, ``six illegals were run over and killed
while sleeping on the rails adjacent to our pasture and in March,
12 illegal aliens were severely injured, one of them permanently
paralyzed, when the Suburban they were being smuggled in turned
over and crashed through our ranch fence.''
</P>
<P>
   The INS estimates that there are about 5 million people live in
the United States illegally, with about 2 million living in
California and 700,000 in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Some 275,000 people illegally enter the United States each year.
About 40 percent of them enter the United States at border
checkpoints with temporary visas but remain here.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   The hearing devolved into an immigrant-bashing session when an
auto mechanic from South Central Los Angeles testified that his
``American culture was being phased out.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry Anderson, the mechanic, complained that illegal immigrants
from Mexico have taken over his once largely African-American
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have chickens, goats, laundry hung out in front and corn
growing in the front yard,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith cut Anderson's testimony short.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be very cautious about a using a broad brush'' to
describe immigration, Lee said. ``All of us came from somewhere
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee recently introduced legislation that would raise the
starting salary of agents from about $23,000 to $33,000 annually.
Similar legislation is pending the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the Senate Appropriations subcommittee for
Commerce, Justice and State Departments approved an additional $83
million to hire 1,000 new Border Patrol agents next year.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said the money could also be
used to provide bonuses to attract new agents and reward
experienced ones.

   KOSOVO-RDP (Brussels) _ NATO suspended the bombing of Yugoslavia

   KOSOVO-SERBIA (Podujevo, Yugoslavia) _ As the long army convoy
roared out of Kosovo Thursday, beginning a defeated Serbia's
painful retreat from its historical heartland, a military policeman
in his black beret snapped a salute to each passing vehicle, tears
streaming down his face. Small knots of Serbs gathered quietly on
Podujevo's streetcorners in the wearying sun as the long column
moved past. Soldiers rode in military trucks and civilian busses,
and in passenger cars of every kind. Trucks full of stretchers
moved past, then portable kitchens and armored personnel carriers.
The Serbs stood shocked, pale and still, as if their blood was
draining into the gutter. By Steven Erlanger.

   SOC-HAMM-PROFILE (Undated) _ Mia Hamm is considered the world's
best female soccer player, a woman born in 1972, the year of Title
IX, the federal law aimed at prohibiting discrimination against
athletes on the basis of gender. And now, at 27, Hamm represents
for many the full realization of sports opportunity for women. At

ARGENTINE AIDE SAYS FOREIGN INVESTORS' WORRIES DRIVE UP RATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Argentina's undersecretary of finance said here
Thursday that foreign investors still seemed to be uncomfortable
about Latin America, leaving interest rates ``unusually high'' in
the region.
</P>
<P>
   But, at the same time, he argued that Argentina could weather a
rise in short-term interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   In the Treasury market, bond prices fell and long-term interest
rates moved higher after Japan reported surprisingly strong
economic growth in the first quarter, leading some investors to
worry that a revival of global growth would ignite inflation in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   With many investors already expecting the Fed to raise the
overnight lending rate between banks at the end of the month, the
yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose to 6.06 percent
Thursday, the highest in more than a year, from 6.02 percent
Wednesday; the price, which moves in the opposite direction, fell
14/32, to 88 30/32.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the Commerce Department is scheduled to release its
retail sales report for May. If the report is strong, as some
forecasters expect, it might help drive interest rates higher
because it will be another sign that the economy is not slowing
enough to curb inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In an address to money managers at a bond conference held by
J.P. Morgan Securities in New York, Miguel Alberto Kiguel, the
Argentine undersecretary of finance, noted that the spreads between
interest rates on Latin American debt and those on comparable U.S.
Treasuries ``are higher than historical levels.'' And, he said,
that spread reflected ``a level of discomfort about the region that
does not fit with the fundamentals of the region.''
</P>
<P>
   He also acknowledged being asked tough questions by foreign
investors, including ``What other shock might come?'' Kiguel did
not make any predictions, but did say, ``My concern is, when will
the international situation improve and help Argentina?''
</P>
<P>
   He said that these spreads had begun to widen again recently
after the Fed said in mid-May that it was leaning toward raising
rates if inflation barometers continued to rise and the economy did
not slow down. ``The Fed is making them more nervous,'' Kiguel said
of investors.
</P>
<P>
   According to bond indexes kept by J.P. Morgan, the spread
between Latin American bonds and comparable U.S. Treasuries is now
8.74 percentage points, up from 7.65 before the Fed said it had
shifted its bias toward a rate increase.
</P>
<P>
   In Argentina, the spread is up to 7.59 percentage points, from
6.60, according to the index, while the spread in Brazil has jumped
to 10.41 percentage points, from 9.20 in May.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, a jump in U.S. interest rates has been bad for
emerging markets because it raises a country's cost of borrowing
and can drive foreign investors away. Flows of foreign capital into
Argentina have been a key engine of the nation's economic cycle, he
said, ``so what happens to interest rates in the region will be
critical.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a rate increase that slows U.S. economic growth
will also curb growth in Latin America as Americans buy fewer of
the region's exports.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Kiguel expressed these concerns, he said that a rate
increase by the Fed _ seemingly expected by most analysts when its
policy makers meet June 29 and 30 _ would not have a significant
negative effect.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he argued, if it was clear that the Fed would raise
rates only a half-point in two steps _ and the U.S. economy began
to show signs of slowing _ then the spread between Argentine and
Treasury rates should narrow more than enough to offset the rate
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Luis Daza, the managing director for emerging markets at
J.P. Morgan Securities, forecast continuing volatility in those
markets as investors await the Fed's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Daza said, ``when the threat of inflation is
eliminated,'' he is predicting an emerging-markets rally. In three
months, he expects the spread in the Morgan index to narrow to 9
percentage points, and to just 6.5 percentage points in 12 months.
The spread is now 11.33 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Kiguel said that Argentina still needed to raise $2.1 billion
from global debt markets this year.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, Argentina should have no problem doing this,
``even in a rough environment.'' &QL;

SUCCESSFUL ANTI-MISSILE TEST PUTS PRESSURE ON DEFENSE CONTRACTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With Thursday's first successful intercept of an
incoming ballistic missile, defense contractor Lockheed-Martin
Corp. is under intense pressure to repeat the results in three
upcoming tests that carry $60 million worth of penalties for
failure.
</P>
<P>
   The giant defense firm must achieve a total of three successful
tests of its $4 billion THAAD anti-missile system.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed has until July 16 to make a second intercept using the
Theater High-Altitude Area Defense system; failure means the firm
would owe the Pentagon $20 million in penalties, according to Bob
Hunt, an Army spokesman in Huntsville, Ala., where the THAAD system
is managed.
</P>
<P>
   The firm must score a third success at knocking a missile from
the sky with a THAAD missile by Oct. 16, or the Pentagon will
collect another $20 million. The company then gets until Jan. 16 to
score a third hit or lose $20 million more.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed-Martin has already paid the Pentagon $15 million for
failing to achieve a successful test in March.
</P>
<P>
   The successful hit took place at 7:19 a.m. EDT Thursday over the
White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. According to the Pentagon,
a modified Minuteman II target missile was launched to simulate an
Iraqi Scud ballistic missile.
</P>
<P>
   As THAAD ground-based radars tracked the weapon across the sky,
a THAAD missile was fired 120 miles to the south. Seven minutes
later it struck and destroyed the Minuteman II in a fiery blaze.
</P>
<P>
   The success comes after a checkered history. Since the test
program began in 1995, the weapon has failed to intercept targets
on all six previous tests.
</P>
<P>
   The Army has a lot riding on THAAD, which is being developed as
the military's primary weapon for protecting troops from theater
ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Pentagon, THAAD ``will give U.S. forces the
best chance to shoot down incoming missiles far enough out so that
post-intercept debris will not harm our troops _ a vital
consideration if a missile carries a weapon of mass destruction.''
The Army intends to field the weapon by 2007.
</P>
<P>
   The major difference between THAAD and the Patriot missile,
which intercepted Iraqi Scuds in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, is that
THAAD is designed to intercept incoming missiles at greater
altitudes and ranges.
</P>
<P>
   Patriot missiles were used to knock down Scuds at much lower
altitudes and didn't actually ram the missiles but instead
detonated close by. THAAD is designed to destroy the incoming
missile by colliding with it.
</P>
<P>
   THAAD also differs from the National Missile Defense program,
dubbed ``Star Wars,'' that would provide an umbrella defense for
the entire United States against intercontinental ballistic
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the THAAD program assert that the program is too
costly and ultimately won't work in actual battlefield conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Army is a long way away from proving reliability,'' said
Brian Hughes, a defense analyst with Taxpayers for Common Sense, a
private Washington, D.C., group that styles itself an independent
watchdog on government spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``One success every $4 billion is not acceptable. If THAAD is
not consistently successful, we believe it should be terminated,''
Hughes added.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Cirincione, a defense analyst with the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace, a non-partisan think tank here, said it
was ``shocking'' that the Army has had only one success in over
four years of test flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much does it add to our capability if it now can hit
Scuds, the types of missiles that we encountered eight years ago in
the Gulf War?'' Cirincione asked.
</P>
<P>
   THAAD champions, meanwhile, hailed Thursday's results.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force Brig. Gen. Richard Davis, a senior official with the
Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, called the test
``a major milestone.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., one of the most outspoken congressional
advocates for missile defense, said the test demonstrated that
THAAD ``is a capable system that will be effective in protecting
our troops overseas from the threat of missile attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Weldon said the previous test failures were ``an inevitable
part'' of developing a new complex weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer, the conservative activist running for the Republican
presidential nomination in 2000, praised the program, calling it
``an important step forward in the drive to give the American
people a defense against missile attack.''

AMERICAN TRIES TO LEAD THAI COMPANY BACK FROM BANKRUPTCY

<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ For Robert B. Mollerstuen, the Asian
economic crisis hit home on a sultry Sunday evening in July 1997,
three weeks after Thailand let its currency plunge in value and set
off a panic from Singapore to Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   Relaxing on his day off, Mollerstuen was called with some
jolting news: his boss, the Thai founder of Alphatec Electronics,
had quit abruptly, suspected of siphoning money out of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Alphatec's directors asked Mollerstuen to take over. The next
day, he arrived at company headquarters here to find finance
executives shredding documents. Mollerstuen barricaded them in a
conference room and later dismissed the whole department.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Mollerstuen, an American who is a veteran of the computer
industry, is still at the helm of Alphatec. It has been a
white-water ride. The company tumbled into insolvency soon after
that Sunday and is the first company to have been resuscitated
under Thailand's newly strengthened bankruptcy law.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Alphatec climbs back on its feet after a bankruptcy
reorganization, it could become a model for other companies
paralyzed by debt, a devalued currency, and the collapse of
Thailand's economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Alphatec, decisions were made: whether you shut it down,
whether you keep operating it,'' said Amaret Sila-On, the chairman
of Thailand's Financial Sector Restructuring Authority. ``Something
had to be done. People have to force this to happen because the
owners will not do it themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Mollerstuen, 63, is clearly proud to play a part in Thailand's
revival. But his deeply lined face attests to the ravages of the
last two years. To save one of Thailand's pioneering technology
companies, Mollerstuen had to battle balky creditors, fearful
customers, and shareholders whose anger prompted him at one point
to hire bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a very difficult experience for me because my
credibility was on the line,'' said Mollerstuen, who had been a
senior executive at Alphatec in its heady growth and descent into
financial turmoil. ``The thing I was naive about was business
practices in Thailand.''

<P>
   Mollerstuen is not the only outsider who failed to see the
unfolding financial disaster in Thailand. Alphatec, which packages
and tests computer chips for semiconductor manufacturers, was one
of the highest fliers during Thailand's high-flying boom years.
</P>
<P>
   When this corporate Icarus crashed to earth, the wreckage
exposed a host of festering problems that contributed to the
nation's economic fall.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, analysts say, the pace of restructuring among large,
debt-ridden Thai companies has picked up. Though Alphatec is the
first to go through an American-style bankruptcy, major companies
like Thai Petrochemical Industry have negotiated deals with their
banks to stretch out or write off debts. All told, Thai companies
have overhauled about 20 percent of their estimated $21 billion in
short-term debt.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand's progress in cleaning up its corporate sector has made
the country a quiet success story among recession-racked Asian
countries. While South Korea struggles to tame its stubborn
conglomerates and Indonesia drifts in an ocean of red ink, Thailand
seems to be getting back on course.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``In Thailand, the balance of power is shifting from the debtors
to the creditors in the recovery of bad loans,'' said Roy Ramos, a
banking analyst at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Such a development is crucially important to Thailand's
recovery, analysts say, because it could persuade foreign investors
to begin pouring money back into the country. Although Thailand has
won praise from the International Monetary Fund for its reform
efforts, outside investors remain dubious.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand attracted $628 million in foreign direct investment in
the first quarter of 1999, down from $2.3 billion in the first
quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Horror stories like that of Alphatec Electronics help explain
why investors are so gun-shy. Founded in 1989 by a Thai
entrepreneur, Charn Uswachoke, Alphatec initially sought to fill a
typical niche for a technology company in an emerging market: it
packaged and tested integrated circuits for chip manufacturers like
Philips, AMD and Cypress Semiconductor.
</P>
<P>
   Charn, however, was eager to vault Alphatec up the technology
food chain. An ambitious ethnic Chinese entrepreneur, Charn viewed
his company as an engine that could propel Thailand into the ranks
of high-tech Asian heavyweights like Taiwan and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, he announced plans to build Thailand's first wafer
factory. With Thai banks eager to hand out money, he quickly lined
up more than $300 million from 26 creditors for the $1 billion
project.
</P>
<P>
   Not content with just a chip factory, Charn began assembling an
empire. His ventures, which grew to include satellite and
telecommunications companies, were to be arrayed in a 2,000-acre
technology park near the Bangkok airport, called Alpha Technopolis.
It was modeled on the vast Hsinchu complex in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, Mollerstuen said, Alphatec's cash demands were
``horrendous.'' That coincided with a slump in the global
semiconductor market, which hammered Alphatec's core packaging
business.
</P>
<P>
   Things went from bad to worse as the Thai economy buckled in the
summer of 1997. Banks stopped lending, Alphatec's loans dried up,
and construction of the Technopolis ground to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   During this period, according to outside auditors, Alphatec
executives transferred money from the publicly listed company to
Charn's privately held companies. In an audit carried out for
Alphatec's banks by PricewaterhouseCoopers in July 1997, the firm
reported that more than $300 million was missing.
</P>
<P>
   PricewaterhouseCoopers filed a civil suit on behalf of creditors
against Charn to recover the money, as well as a suit against
Alphatec's former auditors, KPMG. In addition, the Thai police
began investigating Charn on criminal charges, and he was
blacklisted by the Thai Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the flurry of legal action, executives at
PricewaterhouseCoopers said that the purported siphoning of money
from Alphatec was far from unusual for family-controlled companies
in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   As Jonathan Sisson, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers who runs
the Alphatec case, put it, ``In Thailand, it is often difficult to
figure out where the family interests end and the corporate
interests begin.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Charn, 55, denies that he improperly removed any
money from the publicly listed company. In a telephone interview,
he said Alphatec was a victim of Thailand's imploding economy. He
also notes that no one has successfully brought civil or criminal
charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the one who tried to keep the company alive for many
years,'' Charn said. ``When the crisis came, people, especially in
Thailand, didn't know how to handle it. It got worse and worse
every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason for Alphatec's debts, the conditions for
financial chicanery were certainly ripe. The company's board
consisted of people with close ties to Charn and his family. By the
time the bankers on the board began agitating, Alphatec was already
suffocating under $378 million in debt.
</P>
<P>
   When Alphatec's directors put Mollerstuen in charge, the future
looked grim. Cypress Semiconductor had canceled a crucial contract.
And the company could not meet its debt payments. In 1998, Alphatec
reported losses of $48 million on revenue of $36 million.
</P>
<P>
   But Mollerstuen was sure the company was worth salvaging. Aside
from Cypress, its other customers were loyal. And he believed when
the semiconductor market rebounded, Thailand's advantages as a
low-cost labor center would make Alphatec solidly profitable.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble was, Thailand did not yet have an effective
procedure for overhauling an insolvent company. Mollerstuen's bid
to install PricewaterhouseCoopers as the new auditor was voted down
by Alphatec's shareholders, more than half of them controlled by
Charn. The company's initial proposal to write down 90 percent of
its debts was vetoed by the banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't get from here to there,'' Mollerstuen said. It
was during this period that he hired bodyguards, he said, after
hearing rumors that angry shareholders might attack him.
</P>
<P>
   Alphatec got a break in April 1998 when Thailand amended its
bankruptcy laws. Now the company could submit a rehabilitation plan
and if it was accepted by the creditors, it could be adopted
without shareholder approval. The creditors threw Alphatec into
bankruptcy in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
   PricewaterhouseCoopers was appointed to draw up the plan, and
the French bank Credit Agricole was retained to search for
investors. At the end of 1998, it found two: AIG Investment, the
arm of insurance giant American International Group, and Investor
AB, the Swedish holding company controlled by the Wallenburg
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a lot of unsolicited advice that I was crazy for looking
at this company,'' said Alexander West, the president of Investor
Asia. ``The good thing was that banks had decided to fire Charn and
the finance department.''
</P>
<P>
   Together, Investor and AIG agreed to put $40 million in fresh
equity into the company. PricewaterhouseCoopers devised a plan to
spin off most of Alphatec's debts into a shell company and create a
new Alphatec with only $30 million in debt. Faced with the prospect
of recovering only 5 percent of their loans if the company
liquidated, the banks gulped and went along.
</P>
<P>
   Alphatec's backers took some steps considered unorthodox in
Asia. Borrowing an idea from leveraged buyouts in the United
States, they required Mollerstuen and other top managers to put up
personal assets as collateral against the performance of the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure they believe in the company, and this is
the way we test their conviction,'' said Timothy C. Chang, the
executive director of AIG Investment (Asia) in Hong Kong. ``It
takes a management ethos that is different from traditional Thai
family management.''
</P>
<P>
   Alphatec's investors recognized that retaining Mollerstuen
raised a red flag, since he had been a deputy to Charn. But
Mollerstuen said he knew nothing about the finances of Charn's
companies _ an explanation that was accepted by both
PricewaterhouseCoopers and the investors.
</P>
<P>
   What made Mollerstuen valuable was his ties to Alphatec's
customers and his experience in Thailand, Singapore, Brazil and the
United States. Mollerstuen said that if Alphatec could rebuild its
relationships, the company might be profitable enough in three to
five years to contemplate a stock offering in Asia or even on the
Nasdaq exchange.
</P>
<P>
   After the turmoil of the last two years, however, Mollerstuen
seems reluctant to make predictions. An affable but visibly tired
man, he confided that his journey through the Asian crisis had
exacted a high personal cost. But he saw himself as having little
choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had I turned and walked away from this company,'' Mollerstuen
said, rubbing his eyes, ``people would have said: `Ah, he's part of
it. He's as guilty as the next guy.' I didn't want that to
happen.''

   A lot of plays seem to be set in bars this season: ``The Weir,''
with its charming Irish storytellers; ``The Iceman Cometh,'' with
its motley assortment of the down-and-out, and now, several blocks
from Broadway, ``Exact Change.'' This three-character play by David
Epstein is a mixed bag, awkward at first but coming together near
the end, not particularly deep but consistently well written.
</P>
<P>
   The first sign that the men in ``Exact Change'' may not be that
smart is that they've opened a bar in a Muslim neighborhood.
Business, understandably, hasn't been that brisk. Now Rickie
(Charles Stransky, looking like a cross between Vincent Gardenia
and a young Steve Allen) has lost the trio's money by investing it
in soybean futures. It isn't the local bank that is going to be
upset with them; it's a guy named Caravelli who presides over his
loan shark operation at a suede desk.
</P>
<P>
   The men spend most of Act I discussing their business problems.
In Act II, they have taken action to solve things and failed
miserably. Why on earth they decided to kidnap a dentist for a
modest ransom we don't know, but they lost him while stopped at a
toll booth, which accounts for the title, and now they're pretty
much doomed.
</P>
<P>
   The friends, who were in Vietnam together, deal with just about
everything that comes their way by talking about it, often with
memorable lines, like ``Hitler didn't drive'' and ``When have you
ever seen a picture of the Pope with a drink in his hand?'' and
``Did you ever light a sock?'' (All of these make sense at the
time.) Epstein has been compared to David Mamet, but this is more
because of his characters and his tone than his use of language,
which is just a touch too aware of itself but shows a lot of
promise.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Pierson is the standout as Richie, the brightest of the
bunch. Stransky is fine, as is Ken Ryan as Eddie, even if he often
seems a lot like Art Carney as Ed Norton trying to sell Kramden on
his latest brilliant plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exact Change,'' directed by Jacques Levy, continues at the
Medicine Show Theater in Clinton through June 19.

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO suspended the bombing of Yugoslavia on
Thursday after confirming that Yugoslav troops had begun
withdrawing from Kosovo hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The halt after 78 days set the stage for a U.N. Security Council
resolution that permits 50,000 international peacekeepers to move
in to help a million and a half ethnic Albanian refugees try to go
home.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's secretary-general, Javier Solana, announced the
suspension of the bombing in midafternoon European time _ morning
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would urge all parties to the conflict to seize this
opportunity for peace,'' he said, adding that the moment was a
result of allied determination and intense diplomacy by many
countries, including Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Allied leaders on both sides of the Atlantic were restrained in
claiming victory in a fight that took a toll not only on the Serbs
and Kosovars, but also at times on the allies themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to finish the job and build the peace,'' President
Clinton said Thursday, while Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain
said, ``I feel no sense of triumph now, only the knowledge that our
cause was just and rightly upheld.''
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac of France said, ``A page has been
turned in the conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   With their approval and that of other allied leaders, Solana
halted the bombing after Gen. Wesley Clark, the supreme allied
commander in Europe, confirmed that the withdrawal of 40,000
soldiers, police officers and paramilitary units had begun at
midday.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred Yugoslav army military trucks bearing soldiers
clogged the road north from Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, on
Thursday, more than 12 hours after Yugoslav military commanders
agreed to allied terms with the commander of the peacekeeping force
in Macedonia on Wednesday night. Allied commanders swore vigilance
to make sure the Yugoslav forces lived up to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The first deployment of NATO peacekeeping troops had been
scheduled for Friday, but it will probably be delayed until
Saturday because Yugoslav forces have encountered difficulties in
carrying out their withdrawal, Western officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs are having trouble getting their equipment out,'' a
senior Western official said. ``Their equipment is broken and out
of fuel'' and they need more time to clear the road of mines. The
official said the Serbs were afraid of moving at night because they
fear the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Once bombs were no longer falling _ a condition Russia, China
and France had set for a Security Council vote _ the Council
reconvened in New York City Thursday and quickly approved a
resolution that had been worked out earlier this week in Cologne,
Germany, by the European allies, the United States, Russia, Canada
and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The vote Thursday morning, 14-0 with one abstention, China's,
put Kosovo under international civilian control and placed the
peacekeeping force under U.N. authority.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Jackson of Britain, the force commander,
was set to start leading the 18,500 European and American soldiers
in Macedonia into Kosovo. NATO ambassadors met again Thursday night
and approved an operation order clearing the way for the move,
which is expected eventually to involve a total of around 50,000
troops, mostly Europeans from allied and other countries, with
about 7,000 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops, expected to number about 2,500, could also join
if Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and American military
negotiators who met Russian officers in Moscow on Thursday could
work out command arrangements for them.
</P>
<P>
   Russia was vehemently opposed to the NATO bombing and says it
will not put its troops under the alliance's orders.
</P>
<P>
   Allied warplanes flew their last 82 strike missions on
Wednesday, the allied command said, but will continue flying
reconnaissance missions to monitor the Yugoslav withdrawal, which
is to be completed within 11 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence or noncompliance by any party will not be
tolerated,'' Solana warned. But he said that the alliance and other
international organizations would now try to help all the ethnic
groups of Kosovo, including the Serbs, to build a society free of
the repression that had spawned the conflict in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing campaign sorely tested and profoundly transformed
the 50-year-old alliance, which never fired a shot in anger during
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   In the end it was diplomacy, by Western powers and by Russia,
that tipped the balance, convincing President Slobodan Milosevic
that he had no choice but to accede to international demands and
make peace in Kosovo. Now the alliance has taken on the challenge
of keeping the peace, a challenge that may prove even more
difficult than waging the air war.
</P>
<P>
   Preserving unity among 19 allies during more than two months of
a bombing campaign was a formidable task, one that allied diplomats
from several countries said Solana had handled with diplomatic
skill.
</P>
<P>
   From Britain, which alone among the allies argued for
preparations for an invasion of Kosovo with ground troops to force
Milosevic to accept their will, to Greece, where opposition was
strong to using force against a fellow Orthodox Christian nation,
the allies constantly questioned the air war strategy, but never
could agree on anything better.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Solana always insisted, NATO's air war was about
human values, about 21st-century Europe not tolerating the
throwback to 20th-century totalitarian brutality that the allies
said Milosevic's ``ethnic cleansing'' in Kosovo represented.
</P>
<P>
   In this, NATO had public opinion behind it on most of the
Continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Milosevic didn't reckon with,'' a European diplomat at
NATO said, ``was the effect on public opinion of seeing all those
hundreds of thousands of refugees streaming out of Kosovo. It
reminded all Europeans of the scenes they had seen during World War
II and caused immediate and long-lasting revulsion.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   NATO's bombing took the highest toll on Serbia, where Milosevic
addressed his compatriots on television after the bombing ended
Thursday and called for unity to rebuild the country.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, foreign
ministers of the world's seven largest industrial democracies plus
Russia met with Balkans leaders in Cologne, Germany, on Thursday
and agreed to commit money and effort to a stability pact.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Schroeder Plan,'' which European leaders say could cost $5
billion to $6 billion a year for many years, aims at raising all
the Balkans to an economic and social level on a par with the rest
of Europe, in an effort to make another war there, after a decade
of ethnic conflict, as unthinkable as it is now in France, Britain
or Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe cannot be fully secure unless its southeast corner is
free from strife,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said in
Cologne on Thursday, warning Milosevic against putting political or
military pressure on Montenegro, another constituent republic of
Yugoslavia, whose leaders did not support his attacks in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Now NATO hopes its relationship with Russia can slowly begin to
recover from the damage it suffered from the bombing campaign. It
began to improve after President Boris Yeltsin named former Prime
Minister Victor Chernomyrdin as a special envoy on Yugoslavia last
month, but Russian officials have refused to attend regular
meetings at the alliance headquarters since the bombing began on
24.

CHRISTIAN COALITION TO REORGANIZE AFTER IRS RULING 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Denied tax-exempt status by the government, the
Christian Coalition announced Thursday that it is splitting into
two separate groups and anointing its Texas operation as the
``principal vehicle'' for its national operations.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition of Texas, which is headquartered in
Bedford, near Fort Worth, and is exempt from paying sales taxes,
will be renamed the Christian Coalition of America.
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization was prompted by an Internal Revenue Service
ruling that the Christian Coalition, a Virginia-based group founded
by religious broadcaster Pat Robertson, was not entitled to a tax
exemption as a religious organization.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS ruling, issued in late 1998 and kept under wraps until
this week, is the latest blow to the coalition, a force in the
Republican Party that has been wrestling with the departure of
several top officials, a decline in fund-raising and lethargy in
most of its state chapters.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said the reorganization will enable the Christian
Coalition to remain active in U.S. politics. ``Christian Coalition
of America will continue to be a force in American politics and
will remain a prominent fixture on the political landscape as the
nation's number one pro-family, pro-life organization,'' said
Robertson, whose failed bid for the Republican presidential
nomination in 1988 gave birth to the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Russell, a spokesman for the coalition's national office,
added, ``The organization has been dramatically reshaped but its
mission statement remains intact, and it will continue to do the
things it has been doing since it formed, which is recruit
pro-family activists, draw people to the polls in record numbers
for elections and educate.''
</P>
<P>
   The restructuring calls for formation of a new for-profit
organization to be called Christian Coalition International, which
will endorse candidates and funnel money to political causes and
candidates. The Texas chapter will continue most of the
organization's current operations, including distribution of voter
guides before elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to affect anything,'' said Chuck Anderson, a
spokesman and political organizer for the Christian Coalition of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition opponent criticized the restructuring, calling it a
blatant move to get around the IRS ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of disgraceful shell-game you find in a
second-rate carnival in the middle of nowhere,'' said Barry Lynn,
director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State. He
said his group would challenge the newly restructured coalition's
tax-exempt status.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Christian Coalition is a hardball political machine that
is masquerading as a religious group,'' Lynn said. ``This
organization has been operating as little more than an appendage of
the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, when it raised and spent more than $26 million on
political activities, the Christian Coalition's influence has
slipped. The organization is credited with help pulling off the
Republican Party's winning control of both houses of Congress in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   At its peak, the Christian Coalition boasted 3 million members,
mostly from Robertson's list of 1988 campaign supporters. Robertson
recently announced that the organization would mobilize 1.5 million
conservative voters in the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   During the past two years, the coalition has gone through a
staff exodus. Executive director Ralph Reed left in 1997 and more
recently resigned from the board and is working with Texas Gov.
George W. Bush's presidential campaign. Reed's replacements, unable
to get along with Robertson, have not lasted long.
</P>
<P>
   Coalition President Don Hodel quit in February, and executive
director Randy Tate was demoted to the organization's Washington
lobbying office early this month. National field director Dave
Welch left in March.

TEXAS GOVERNOR RAKING IN CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS AT RECORD RATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush is collecting campaign
contributions at a record pace in a high-stakes bid to become the
first presidential candidate in history who successfully ignores
federal spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   The all-out drive for cash slips into high gear Friday, the day
before the Texas Republican's first presidential campaign swing.
While more than 100 reporters gather in Austin for Bush's initial
outing to Iowa and New Hampshire, the governor will ditch his media
entourage for the day to raise money in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   The private fund-raisers in Chicago and St. Louis are the first
in a series of at least two dozen similar events across the country
in June. By the end of the month, Bush advisers expect his campaign
donations to top $15 million _ about $2 million more than
Republican Bob Dole, the previous record-holder, had at the same
point in the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But that's only the beginning. Bush's fund-raising goals call
for him to have about $32 million by the end of the year. And,
although a final decision is months away, Bush may turn down
federal matching funds and try to raise $50 million on his own to
carry him to the Republican nominating convention in late July
2000.
</P>
<P>
   To put that figure in perspective, Dole and President Clinton
together raised $59 million in 1996. Turning down federal matching
money would let Bush ignore overall and state-by-state spending
limits in the battle for the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going from $32 million to $50 million is a significant move.
Each additional dollar gets more difficult to raise,'' said Don
Evans, the campaign's finance chairman. ``Nobody's ever tried it
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaign reformers worry that Bush's decision could effectively
end the federal matching system by setting a new standard for
presidential candidates. The matching system, first used in 1976,
relies on the lure of federal dollars to get candidates to rein in
campaign spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has the potential of just devastating the whole public
financing system in the primaries,'' said Paul Hendrie of the
Center for Responsive Politics, an organization that tries to
highlight special interest influence in politics.
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates who tried to play outside the system fell short
of their goals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, another Texas Republican, former Gov. John Connally,
turned down federal money so that he could spend unlimited amounts
in the early primary states. He spent nearly $12 million before his
campaign collapsed, leaving him with a single convention delegate.
</P>
<P>
   A few millionaire candidates, most notably Ross Perot and Steve
Forbes, have ignored the federal limits by tapping their personal
fortunes, but to no avail. Forbes intends to ignore the limits
again in Campaign 2000 even though he is accepting donations this
time.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush may yet decide to go the conventional route, his
fast pace is causing problems for his GOP rivals. Former Vice
President Dan Quayle recently complained that Bush's operation is a
``big sucking machine'' that is vacuuming up dollars from
Republican supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and Elizabeth Dole have
also encountered fund-raising difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, a Midland oilman and one of Bush's closest friends, said
the governor's early fund-raising success was the political
equivalent of picking ``easy low-lying fruit'' from donors who
needed little prompting.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, more than 200 Bush supporters agreed to become
campaign ``pioneers'' by raising $100,000 from friends and
associates.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people were anxious to write a $1,000 check without
even a phone call,'' Evans said. ``You want to raise as much as you
can as fast as you can. You raise it early and spend it late.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans said Bush and his advisers will make a decision on whether
to take federal money in the fall, when they are better able to
assess their finances. Candidates who agree to spending limits will
receive nearly $16.8 million, with the first payments scheduled for
Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to giving Bush more flexibility in the early primary
states, turning down the money would let him continue to raise and
spend money well into next year. In 1996, the federal limits forced
candidate Bob Dole to scale back his campaign after the expensive
early primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly anticipate a very competitive primary. It would
be nice to have the luxury to continue to raise money (next year),
but it's just too early to make that call,'' Evans said.

   PETROVEC, Macedonia _ More than 3,000 American ground troops
poured into dusty, makeshift camps near the airport here Thursday,
as the United States scrambled to amass its contribution to a
peacekeeping operation in Kosovo fraught with risks and uncertain
support back home.
</P>
<P>
   The American buildup began before dawn, only hours after
Yugoslav generals accepted NATO's demands for an international
force in Kosovo, as the first of nearly 2,000 troops from the 26th
Marine Expeditionary Force stormed a beach southwest of the Greek
port of Thessaloniki, greeted by protesters and banners opposing
NATO's attacks on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   As the Marines boarded buses and trucks and began a six-hour
drive north, some 1,400 Army soldiers arrived along with tanks,
artillery batteries and 11 Apache helicopter gunships that the
Clinton administration sent to Albania, but then declined to use in
combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're finally getting something done,'' Spc. Jeremiah Siejo, a
machine-gunner with the 82nd Airborne Division, said as he climbed
from a Chinook helicopter with his platoon, which had spent the
last two months outside Albania's capital, Tirana.
</P>
<P>
   There were only a few hundred Americans stationed in Macedonia
when the day began, but by dark nearly half of the 7,000 troops the
United States has pledged to the NATO force in Kosovo, known as
KFOR, had arrived, set up camps near the airport here and begun
preparations for moving into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The American force is not expected to join NATO's first push
into Kosovo, but rather will follow British troops who, NATO
officials said, will clear a corridor on the main road between
Macedonia and Kosovo's provincial capital, Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Led by the Marines from the 26th Expeditionary Force, the
Americans will ultimately patrol a sector in southeast Kosovo,
maintaining a headquarters in Gnjilane, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Like the war itself, the new commitment of American troops in
the Balkans _ on top of more than 6,000 still in Bosnia, 3 1/2
years after the civil war there ended _ has generated opposition in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Republicans in Congress revived an effort to block
financing for the American force, President Clinton said Thursday
that he would not impose a limit on the force's duration, as he did
when he sent 20,000 Americans to Bosnia and pledged to bring them
home in a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should put a timetable on it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO suspended its air war Thursday, preparations for the
peacekeeping mission could be seen all over northern Macedonia.
British and Italian troops took up positions near the border post
at Blace, which is expected to be the main overland route into
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The road into the Macedonian military base near the airport at
Petrovec, which holds troops from several NATO allies, was clogged
at times with fuel trucks, armored troop carriers and other
vehicles coming going in and out.
</P>
<P>
   Overhead, wave after wave of helicopters _ including Army Black
Hawks and Chinooks _ thudded to and from a corner of the base
occupied by the fast-growing American force, ferrying soldiers from
the force in Albania while stirring up terrific storms of dust.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 Apaches, kept out of combat in the air war, will provide
air cover to the American forces as they move in.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is always a period of time when we make sure the
peacekeeping force is the most powerful force in the area,'' Col.
Jeffrey Schloesser, commander of the helicopter squadrons, said
when asked why the Apaches, a powerful weapon against armored
forces, would be needed in a peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
   The troops themselves sounded eager to begin the operation.
``However they can use us, we'd like to be a part of it,'' said
Chief Warrant Officer 3rd Class Eric E. Rings, one of the Apache
pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's deployment came after several false starts that
mirrored the on-again, off-again progress in five days of talks
between NATO and Yugoslav generals over the details of the end to
the war. Greece's government, wary of anti-NATO protests in a
country with religious ties to Yugoslavia's Serbs, had denied the
Marines permission to land until an agreement was reached. Only
then did the orders come to move in.
</P>
<P>
   Brig. Gen. B. John Craddock, the Army commander of the American
forces involved in the mission, said in an interview Thursday that
the troops would encounter any number of obstacles once they
entered Kosovo. Even if the Yugoslav forces withdraw as promised,
the NATO peacekeepers would encounter mines laid by Yugoslav forces
and Kosovo's rebels, the destruction of roads and bridges by NATO
aircraft and, very likely, thousands of refugees who have spent the
war hiding in the hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on the terms of the agreement, if complied with, I would
expect to find nothing,'' he said, when asked what obstacles he
expected to face. ``However, it's not a perfect world.''

U.S. SOCCER STAR MIA HAMM FACES THE PRESSURE OF BEING THE BEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every time Mia Hamm steps on or off a soccer field, the young
girls are waiting. They are wearing her No. 9 jersey. Their hair is
pulled back into a replica of her ponytail. The cumulative effect
is of nesting dolls, each one opening to reveal another inside that
is smaller but identical.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm is considered the world's best female soccer player, a
woman born in 1972, the year of Title IX, the federal law aimed at
prohibiting discrimination against athletes on the basis of gender.
And now, at 27, Hamm represents for many the full realization of
sports opportunity for women. At 15, she became the youngest player
ever to join the national soccer team, and in winning a world
championship and an Olympic gold medal in recent years, she has
scored 109 career goals, more than any other man or woman ever to
play the game.
</P>
<P>
   She has, as well, reached an uncommon level of celebrity and
corporate appeal. People magazine voted her one of its 50 most
beautiful people. Nike named a building in her honor at its
headquarters. She appears in a commercial with Michael Jordan,
challenging him in basketball, soccer, track and fencing, and
flipping him over her hip in a judo maneuver while the music
asserts, ``Anything you can do, I can do better.''
</P>
<P>
   And starting next week, Hamm will headline the largest sporting
event ever held for women, the Women's World Cup, a 16-team
tournament which begins at Giants Stadium on June 19 and that will
be played in stadiums across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The games will provide the biggest stage yet for the woman who
is a sports role model for 7.5 million girls who play soccer in the
United States. Girls, ranging in ages from 10 to 17, wait for her
after practices and games in adoring flocks, shrieking her name in
a way familiar to anyone who saw the Beatles on the old Ed Sullivan
Hour.
</P>
<P>
   The scrutiny promises to be intense, for athletes are rarely
asked to carry the enormous burden of opportunity Hamm is being
shouldered with this summer. She is being counted on not only to
lead the favored American team, but to help fill stadiums, to lend
a name and a face to an emerging game, to be the spark that could
possibly ignite a professional soccer league for women in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   If Hamm fails, or her team loses early, the Women's World Cup
could become a diminished athletic and commercial affair. And a
women's pro league, now a longshot proposition looking for a star
to hook onto, may have trouble becoming more than a proposal in a
boardroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel it is important for soccer that Mia plays well,'' said
Leonardo Cuellar, coach of the Mexican women's team. ``I don't want
to add pressure, but it's always important, when fans have
expectations about seeing a player excel in a world class event,
for that to happen. She's charismatic, very humble. Those are the
attributes of Pele and some of the best stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the pressure to dominate on the soccer field can feel
to Hamm like knotted muscle. Hamm did not finish among the top
scorers in previous major tournaments _ the 1991 World Cup, the
1995 World Cup, the 1996 Summer Olympics. The burden was
particularly evident earlier this year when Hamm did not score a
goal for eight consecutive games. Twice during that drought, the
Americans lost to China, the team the United States defeated for
the 1996 Olympic gold medal and its chief rival.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm seemed reluctant to challenge defenders one on one,
according to the American coach, Tony DiCicco. No one is better at
this aspect of the women's game that is part croquet, part ballet,
part bullfight. At her best, Hamm seems to release and retrieve the
ball as if it were a yo-yo. But now she was hesitant. For the first
time in her career, she made as much news when she didn't score as
when she did. Doubt seeped into her game like sweat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a fine line between setting standards that keep you
getting better and being hypercritical to the point that it
undermines your confidence,'' DiCicco said. ``She's always flirted
with that line. She's not only a soccer icon, but she's an icon for
women's athletics. That's a huge responsibility. It's a very
vulnerable place to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The girls who wait for her hold out their hands for her to slap,
or they ask her to sign their jerseys, or thrust soccer balls
toward her. In return, she offers high-fives, an autograph, a
smile, a nod, an affirming gesture that they can aspire to be
everything she has become.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important for young girls to have female athletes
they can identify with,'' Hamm said.
</P>
<P>
   While she accepts that she is a pioneer, she is a reluctant
celebrity. She wears the role awkwardly, like donning a fur coat in
the dead of summer. Having grown up in a military family with three
sisters and two brothers, there is a reserve about her, almost a
sense of rank, as if she should succeed at a high level but that
she should not stand out from the others.
</P>
<P>
   She is a scorer who is a selfless passer, a forward who is as
economical with her words as she is explosive with her feet, a
female athlete as effortless and guarded as Joe DiMaggio. Even her
handshake is noncommittal, as if it might reveal too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men grow up knowing that if they are the best they are going
to be famous,'' said David Bober, who is Hamm's agent. ``Mia didn't
sign up for soccer to be a famous sports icon. It's an
adjustment.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Hamm is actually more forthcoming discussing her failures than
her successes. The mantle of ``best player in the world'' is
subjective, she says. Failure is objective. It can be taken apart,
examined, repaired. She says that confidence, like fitness, must be
cultivated daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone tried to tell me that Michael Jordan doesn't have
confidence problems, but he is probably very selective who he
shares it with,'' Hamm said. ``I don't think a lot of athletes walk
around thinking they're the best. If they do, it's probably to hide
some weaknesses they have.''
</P>
<P>
   During the scoring drought, Hamm heard and read that she wasn't
playing her best, and by repetition, the supposition of a slump
became fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try not to listen but it does get to you,'' Hamm said. ``I
was putting too much pressure on myself. I wasn't enjoying what I
was doing. I was so worried about, `All right team, jump on my
back, I'm going to carry you through all this.'''
</P>
<P>
   She consulted friends, like Nomar Garciaparra, the shortstop for
the Boston Red Sox, who told Hamm, ``Go out and enjoy the game and
don't worry about all that other stuff.'' Eventually, she scored
again, and with five goals in her last five matches leading to the
World Cup, her personal fog cleared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mia takes the burden really seriously on herself,'' said
Tiffeny Milbrett, who plays forward alongside Hamm. ``She needs to
realize she's not alone. The team will be fine. She will pull off
the spectacular play just by being on the field. All she needs to
do is play.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm was born in Selma, Ala., and lived a road-map childhood in
Texas, California, Virginia and Italy, where her father, an Air
Force colonel, was passionately drawn to soccer. When Mia was five,
her family adopted an eight-year-old boy named Garrett, whose legs
and arms seemed wondrously suited to propelling a ball off a bat,
through a hoop, into a net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Garrett was an influence on me on any form of athletics,''
Hamm said. ``When he'd go play pickup football or baseball, I was
always right behind him. He always picked me for his teams.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time she was 14, the national soccer team wanted her,
too. Anson Dorrance, who coached the team then, got an excited call
about her from a coaching friend in Texas. Skeptical, Dorrance went
to watch her play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team kicks off, a girl passes the ball to the right about
30 yards and I see this skinny brunette take off like she had been
shot out of a cannon,'' Dorrance said.
</P>
<P>
   He walked around the field and approached his coaching friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that Mia Hamm?'' Dorrance asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got something here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hamm was only 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a potential genius, you don't want to crush
their spirit and shatter their confidence if they don't succeed,''
Dorrance said. ``I decided we couldn't wait. The rest is history.''
</P>
<P>
   At 15, Hamm became the youngest player, male or female, ever to
join the national team. She then followed Dorrance to North
Carolina, where she won four national championships and met her
husband, Christian Corry, a Marine pilot. With Hamm, the Americans
won the initial Women's World Cup in 1991, and later the gold medal
at the 1996 Summer Olympics. But her success has been tempered by
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett Hamm contracted a rare blood disorder. Mia raised
$50,000 for his care through a benefit soccer game. But in April of
1997, at the age of 28, her brother died.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm absorbed the hurt, and she has played on, scoring more
goals, raising expectations. But some close to her believe she has
been pulled too thin, playing and promoting the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us might be asking her to do too much,'' Dorrance said.
``I have a great fear it will burn her out, on the field, off the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Reticent off the field, her style of play is dynamically suited
to spreading the sport to a wider audience. A fiercer countenance
emerges, cheeks hollow and jaws clinched in exertion, her ponytail
fanning out behind as she sprints 40 yards to finish a fastbreak or
carves a defender with a deft two-step and makes an inexorable
charge toward the goal. The passion of her game is most evident in
the celebrative convulsion when she scores, the tendons in her neck
flared, her mouth an open scream, her arms cocked at the elbow and
fists closed as if she has just lifted some enormous weight.
</P>
<P>
   She has a dancer's feet, a felon's heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her acceleration is so visceral,'' Dorrance said. ``When she
gets the ball you hold your breath.''
</P>
<P>
   Her athleticism is such that, during a desperate moment of the
1995 Women's World Cup, the Americans made her a goalkeeper.
Someone brought a football to a recent practice, and Hamm expertly
knocked in field goals from 35 yards. As a 7th-grader in Wichita
Falls, Texas, she played end and cornerback on a boy's football
team. ``Even in pads she was fast,'' said her father, Bill Hamm.
</P>
<P>
   With her teammates, Hamm can be funny, outgoing, a master of
accents, someone who gives as good as she gets. When midfielder
Julie Foudy, in a moment of introspection, said that she wanted to
retire from soccer to do something that ``makes a difference,''
Hamm dabbed at fake tears and burst into a mock Bette Midler
number, singing, ``Did you know that you're my hero?''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does she mind sticking pins in her own public image. On the
box of Soccer Barbie, which she endorses, Hamm is pictured with a
doll's freeze-dried smile and eternity-proof makeup. ``You can't
tell which one is the Barbie,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In filming the Gatorade commercial with Jordan, cameras began
rolling in the unscripted judo sequence, and Hamm moved confidently
toward Jordan and flung him to the mat. He played along, said
Bober, Hamm's agent, ``but he waved his finger and said, `That
better not make the final cut.'''
</P>
<P>
   It did.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras will be rolling for real in the coming weeks, and
there will be no play acting. Everyone will be watching.
</P>
<P>
   ``All sports lacking a profile really have to push one or two of
the best athletes who have a number of qualities in and out of the
game,'' said Julie Murray, captain of the Australian women's team.
``Sometimes it can be daunting, standing up and making speeches
when all you want to do is play. But I know it is better for the
sport and for the people who will follow in Mia's shoes. Girls who
are 13, 14, 15, are looking at her. The sport is better off doing
that.''

SITCOM DADS OFTEN PORTRAYED AS INCOMPETENT, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Only nine shopping days till Father's Day, so let's decide once
and for all. Who's the better sitcom dad: Ray Romano or Homer
Simpson?
</P>
<P>
   No contest, right? I mean, Ray Romano has never been arrested
for trying to murder his boss, never been charged with sexual
harassment for pulling a Gummi Venus de Milo off a baby sitter's
tush, and never been an unwitting accomplice in a terrorist
takeover of the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Homer Simpson has been there, done that. Many times over.
</P>
<P>
   But with every precinct reporting, the tabulations indicate
there's not much to choose between Romano and Simpson on the
fatherhood scale. So says the National Fatherhood Initiative in
Gaithersburg, Md., which looked at 15 television series on five
networks last fall and decided that _ surprise! _ father rarely
knows best.
</P>
<P>
   While comedian Ray Romano, who plays himself on ``Everybody
Loves Raymond,'' does better than the bumbling patriarch of ``The
Simpsons'' in areas of parental competence and guidance, Homer
Simpson cleans Romano's clock when it comes to family involvement
and engagement. Simpson even has an edge in placing the role of
father at the top of his priority list.
</P>
<P>
   On a scale of 0 to 25, Romano and Simpson both tallied scores of
16 in NFI's ``Fatherhood &AMP; TV'' report, barely staying out of the
``negative portrayal'' range (see accompanying graphic.)
</P>
<P>
   The fact that we're even comparing a live-action character with
a cartoon figure seems a little goofy, but it was NFI that lumped
them together, not I.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1994, NFI is a non-profit, non-partisan organization
that ``encourages and supports family and father-friendly policies
(and) develops national public education campaigns to highlight the
importance of fathers in the lives of their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Wade Horn, a psychologist/columnist who is NFI's president,
intends to revisit the dads-on-TV report each year to see if
there's any improvement at the networks, particularly in the area
of comedies. Of the 15 shows studied by NFI, 12 are sitcoms and
only three _ ``Smart Guy,'' ``Two of a Kind'' and ``Mad About You''
_ were seen as portraying fatherhood positively. Ironically, none
of the three will be back next season.
</P>
<P>
   Two dramas, ``Promised Land'' and ``7th Heaven,'' got perfect
scores, but the overall conclusion is that the typical portrayal of
fathers on network television ``is one of incompetence.''
</P>
<P>
   The report focused only on shows where a father was a recurring
character, where the relationship between the father and his
children was a defining feature, and where the father's children
were 18 or younger.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, dramas like ``Profiler,'' ``ER,'' ``NYPD Blue'' and ``Law
&AMP; Order,'' where parenthood is a secondary or occasional story
element, weren't evaluated. Nor was the comedy ``Frasier,'' in
which a richly drawn father-son relationship involves adults.
</P>
<P>
   Horn says these shows will be examined in future reports, as
will UPN, which was left out of this year's study because NFI
(www.fatherhood.org) didn't consider it to be on a par with the
other networks.
</P>
<P>
   It is not Horn's aim to have every father on TV be the
never-flustered type played by Robert Young on ``Father Knows
Best'' in the '50s and '60s. But he would like to see more than
four shows _ out of the 100-plus airing on the networks during a
season _ give dads a fair shake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't make this argument in 1962,'' Horn said. ``But
because we have a crisis in fatherhood today, we have to take
seriously the kinds of images we pump into kids' homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Horn asks that the networks look at their schedules and ask
themselves: ``When one out of three kids is not likely to have a
father in the home, are we doing enough, are we fulfilling our
public responsibility to ensure that there are at least some
positive immages of fatherhood coming into our households?''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Horn is a fan of ``The Simpsons.'' He thinks it's
clever and funny, but he also knows his two daughters have no
illusions that Homer Simpson is your typical dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can watch the Homer Simpsons and laugh it off, and they
know that's not what real fatherhood is about because they have a
contrasting model. But what about the one-third who go to sleep
without a father?''
</P>
<P>
   And as for those who would dismiss the NFI study as just another
attempt by a special-interest group to angle for some attention,
Horn seeks to distance himself from other studies, such as a recent
one suggesting that federal employees are also treated shabbily in
TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not suggesting every father should be portrayed as a
superhero,'' he said. ``But ... it's not the same as negative
stereotypes of government workers. We as a society can survive
without government workers, but we cannot survive without
fathers.''

U.S. SOCCER STAR MIA HAMM FACES THE PRESSURE OF BEING THE BEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mia Hamm is considered the world's best female soccer player, a
woman born in 1972, the year of Title IX, the federal law aimed at
prohibiting discrimination against athletes on the basis of gender.
And now, at 27, Hamm represents for many the full realization of
sports opportunity for women. At 15, she became the youngest player
ever to join the national soccer team, and in winning a world
championship and an Olympic gold medal in recent years, she has
scored 109 career goals, more than any other man or woman ever to
play the game.
</P>
<P>
   She has, as well, reached an uncommon level of celebrity and
corporate appeal. People magazine voted her one of its 50 most
beautiful people. Nike named a building in her honor at its
headquarters. She appears in a commercial with Michael Jordan,
challenging him in basketball, soccer, track and fencing, and
flipping him over her hip in a judo maneuver while the music
asserts, ``Anything you can do, I can do better.''
</P>
<P>
   And starting next week, Hamm will headline the largest sporting
event ever held for women, the Women's World Cup, a 16-team
tournament which begins at Giants Stadium on June 19 and that will
be played in stadiums across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The games will provide the biggest stage yet for the woman who
is a sports role model for 7.5 million girls who play soccer in the
United States. Girls, ranging in ages from 10 to 17, wait for her
after practices and games in adoring flocks, shrieking her name in
a way familiar to anyone who saw the Beatles on the old Ed Sullivan
Hour.
</P>
<P>
   The scrutiny promises to be intense, for athletes are rarely
asked to carry the enormous burden of opportunity Hamm is being
shouldered with this summer. She is being counted on not only to
lead the favored American team, but to help fill stadiums, to lend
a name and a face to an emerging game, to be the spark that could
possibly ignite a professional soccer league for women in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   If Hamm fails, or her team loses early, the Women's World Cup
could become a diminished athletic and commercial affair. And a
women's pro league, now a longshot proposition looking for a star
to hook onto, may have trouble becoming more than a proposal in a
boardroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel it is important for soccer that Mia plays well,'' said
Leonardo Cuellar, coach of the Mexican women's team. ``I don't want
to add pressure, but it's always important, when fans have
expectations about seeing a player excel in a world class event,
for that to happen. She's charismatic, very humble. Those are the
attributes of Pele and some of the best stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the pressure to dominate on the soccer field can feel
to Hamm like knotted muscle. Hamm did not finish among the top
scorers in previous major tournaments _ the 1991 World Cup, the
1995 World Cup, the 1996 Summer Olympics. The burden was
particularly evident earlier this year when Hamm did not score a
goal for eight consecutive games. Twice during that drought, the
Americans lost to China, the team the United States defeated for
the 1996 Olympic gold medal and its chief rival.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm seemed reluctant to challenge defenders one on one,
according to the American coach, Tony DiCicco. No one is better at
this aspect of the women's game that is part croquet, part ballet,
part bullfight. At her best, Hamm seems to release and retrieve the
ball as if it were a yo-yo. But now she was hesitant. For the first
time in her career, she made as much news when she didn't score as
when she did. Doubt seeped into her game like sweat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a fine line between setting standards that keep you
getting better and being hypercritical to the point that it
undermines your confidence,'' DiCicco said. ``She's always flirted
with that line. She's not only a soccer icon, but she's an icon for
women's athletics. That's a huge responsibility. It's a very
vulnerable place to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The girls who wait for her hold out their hands for her to slap,
or they ask her to sign their jerseys, or thrust soccer balls
toward her. In return, she offers high-fives, an autograph, a
smile, a nod, an affirming gesture that they can aspire to be
everything she has become.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important for young girls to have female athletes
they can identify with,'' Hamm said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm was born in Selma, Ala., and lived a road-map childhood in
Texas, California, Virginia and Italy, where her father, an Air
Force colonel, was passionately drawn to soccer. When Mia was five,
her family adopted an eight-year-old boy named Garrett, whose legs
and arms seemed wondrously suited to propelling a ball off a bat,
through a hoop, into a net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Garrett was an influence on me on any form of athletics,''
Hamm said. ``When he'd go play pickup football or baseball, I was
always right behind him. He always picked me for his teams.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time she was 14, the national soccer team wanted her,
too. Anson Dorrance, who coached the team then, got an excited call
about her from a coaching friend in Texas. Skeptical, Dorrance went
to watch her play.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team kicks off, a girl passes the ball to the right about
30 yards and I see this skinny brunette take off like she had been
shot out of a cannon,'' Dorrance said.
</P>
<P>
   He walked around the field and approached his coaching friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that Mia Hamm?'' Dorrance asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got something here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hamm was only 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a potential genius, you don't want to crush
their spirit and shatter their confidence if they don't succeed,''
Dorrance said. ``I decided we couldn't wait. The rest is history.''
</P>
<P>
   At 15, Hamm became the youngest player, male or female, ever to
join the national team. She then followed Dorrance to North
Carolina, where she won four national championships and met her
husband, Christian Corry, a Marine pilot. With Hamm, the Americans
won the initial Women's World Cup in 1991, and later the gold medal
at the 1996 Summer Olympics. But her success has been tempered by
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett Hamm contracted a rare blood disorder. Mia raised
$50,000 for his care through a benefit soccer game. But in April of
1997, at the age of 28, her brother died.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm absorbed the hurt, and she has played on, scoring more
goals, raising expectations. But some close to her believe she has
been pulled too thin, playing and promoting the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us might be asking her to do too much,'' Dorrance said.
``I have a great fear it will burn her out, on the field, off the
field.''
</P>
<P>
   Reticent off the field, her style of play is dynamically suited
to spreading the sport to a wider audience. A fiercer countenance
emerges, cheeks hollow and jaws clinched in exertion, her ponytail
fanning out behind as she sprints 40 yards to finish a fastbreak or
carves a defender with a deft two-step and makes an inexorable
charge toward the goal. The passion of her game is most evident in
the celebrative convulsion when she scores, the tendons in her neck
flared, her mouth an open scream, her arms cocked at the elbow and
fists closed as if she has just lifted some enormous weight.
</P>
<P>
   She has a dancer's feet, a felon's heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her acceleration is so visceral,'' Dorrance said. ``When she
gets the ball you hold your breath.''

PLANNING YOUR FINANCIAL FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  ATTENTION EDITORS: The following material is for use only by
arrangement with New York Times Syndicate/Special features. For
purchase information see end of text. 
 By the editors of Hispanic magazine 
 c. 1999 Hispanic magazine 
 New America News Service 
 &HT;    It seems like everyone is ready to offer financial advice these
days _ from your Tio Pepe to your local newspaper to your bank
teller. Too bad much of it can seem garbled.
 &HT;    Money magazine recently advised investing in high-technology
companies, proclaiming ``Everyone's getting rich: Get your share!''
on its front cover. About a year earlier (before the stock market's
subsequent surge to record levels), its front cover had read,
``Sell Stocks Now!'' and warned of a possible market collapse.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, the large stock brokerages warn about the dangers of
on-line investing, even as a growing number of individual investors
are getting richer that way.
 &HT;    On-line stock trading firms warn about the greediness and
general untrustworthiness of commissioned stockbrokers, not
bothering to mention that some investors may need professional
advice when it comes to the often complicated fields of investing,
retirement planning and insurance.
 &HT;    Given all the contradictory messages and hype, what's the
average person to do?
 &HT;    The following financial experts were asked four questions that
touch on issues that concern new investors, young professionals,
baby boomers and families with children. The result is a financial
planning primer that answers some very basic questions.
 &HT;    
 THE PANEL  
 &HT;     LOUIS BARAJAS.  Barajas is a certified financial planner and
head of Louis Barajas &AMP; Associates Financial Advisors in Los
Angeles, Calif.
 &HT;     LILIA MOJICA.  Mojica is assistant vice president of business
development for Union Bank of California in San Diego, Calif.
 &HT;     ROBERT G. FERNANDEZ.  Fernandez is a vice president and
financial consultant with Salomon Smith Barney in Austin, Texas.
 &HT;     ELIZABETH S. GONZALES.  Gonzales is an insurance agent and
registered investment representative at New York Life Insurance
Company /NYLife Securities in Austin, Texas.
 &HT;     PEDRO U. DIAZ.  Diaz is an investment adviser and the vice
President 0f Capital Anal ysts, Inc., in Miami, Fla.
 &HT;    
 Q&AMP;A  
 &HT;    1. How much money does a person really need to start building a
financial portfolio?
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Barajas: To start building a financial portfolio, all it takes
is the first dollar saved. It's not until you decide to save money
that you will see financial changes. Who cares if there are
investments paying 20 percent or 3 percent if you have nothing
saved?
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Mojica: First and foremost, because of the state of the economy,
everyone should be concerned about securing his or her own
financial future. As far as how much money someone needs to start
building a financial portfolio, everyone's situation is different;
therefore, the amounts may vary. As long as you are consistent, you
can start a savings account with as little as $5 and a serious
financial portfolio with about $500,000.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Fernandez: There is no specific amount needed to really get your
financial portfolio started, but of course, the more money the
better. The point is just getting started. There are some
investment programs, like mutual funds, that one can invest in with
as little as $25 to start.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Gonzales: There is only one way to eat an elephant, and that's
one bite at a time. Most banks will allow you to open a savings
account with as little as $100. Mainstay Funds, which are offered
through New York Life, which I represent, allow investors to open
an account with as little as $100 and a $50 monthly bank draft.
There really is no excuse for not saving.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Diaz: What I tell my clients is that it's not so important how
much you start with, but how soon you start. When investing, your
best allies are time, the power of compound interest, and the rule
of 72. The rule of 72 states that to determine how fast your money
will double, divide 72 by your annual return. For example, if
you're getting a 12 percent return on your investments, you will
double your money in six years (72 divided by 12 equals six).
 &HT;    
 &HT;    -----
 &HT;    
 &HT;    2. What Is the single best tip you would offer a young person
just getting his or her professional life arted?
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Barajas: The single best tip for a young professional is to get
him or her to understand why he or she should start saving early.
The why is more important than the how. The how is easy, but
understanding the why takes more thought. However, once you know
the why, you will reach your financial goals without a problem. The
next best tip is to take 10 percent of your hard-earned income and
save it through your company pension plan. Pay yourself first!
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Mojica: My best tip for young professionals is: Save
consistently and minimize consumer debt.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Fernandez: For the young person just getting started, the best
financial advice would be to take advantage of your employer's
benefit plans like 401(k), retirement plans, employee stock
purchase plans, etc. This is usually the best and cheapest way to
start saving and building net worth.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Gonzales: Start your financial plan now! It's never too early.
The sooner you start, the less you'll have to put away later and
the more you will accumulate in the end.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Diaz: The first thing a young person should do is enroll in his
or her company's 401(k) plan and save the maximum allowed under the
plan. (Besides the tax benefits), most companies match employee
contributions anywhere between 1 to 6 percent. That's free money.
If the company you work for does not offer any retirement plan,
start your own IRA or Roth IRA. If you own your business, start a
Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) plan.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    -----
 &HT;    
 &HT;    3. What are steps baby boomers can take to plan for the future?
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Barajas: Baby boomers have a number of options. A.) If possible,
save up to 10 percent of your income for financial independence
through a retirement program (pre-tax). B.) Save 10 percent Of Your
income for current financial needs (so you won't have to rely on
debt). C.) Protect your family with enough life (buy ``term''
only), disability and health insurance.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Mojica: Good advice to baby boomers includes: A.) Obtain
objective, qualified, professional financial advice. B.) Clearly
understand your goals, objectives and risk tolerance level.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Fernandez: Baby boomers should sign up for the plans offered by
their employers, set up a financial plan with reasonable goals and
start as soon as possible to take advantage of the power of
compound interest.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Gonzales: If you're a baby boomer and haven't started a serious,
systematic savings plan for retirement, you have a lot of catching
up to do. Start by taking advantage of any qualified pension plan
that may be available to you. Pension plans allow you to save for
retirement on a tax-deferred basis while you receive tax deductions
for your contributions. Contribution limits vary from $2,000 to
$30,000 a year, depending on the type of plan.
 &HT;    Second, take advantage of the Roth IRA. So long as your earned
income is less than $95,000 as a single person (or $150,000 if
you're a married couple), you can contribute up to $2,000 of your
after-tax income to your Roth IRA. This type of IRA grows tax-free:
You don't pay tax on your gains so long as you leave the money in
the account for at least five years. Two thousand dollars a year
may not seem like much, but over the years your Roth savings will
add up.
 &HT;    Lastly, get permanent life insurance. The cost of term-life
insurance rises as we age and can become cost prohibitive for some.
If you get permanent coverage now, you'll have time to get it paid
off before you retire, freeing up money for your retirement.
 &HT;    A good option is to get a variable universal life insurance
policy, which allows you to maintain your life-insurance coverage
while you invest in mutual funds. The growth in this life insurance
policy grows tax-deferred and the death benefit is paid directly to
your beneficiary, who doesn't have to pay income tax on his or her
windfall.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Diaz: If you were born between 1946 and 1963 and have not
started saving for retirement, you should immediately determine how
much risk you're willing to take with your investment portfolio and
how you want to diversify your investments (probably with the help
of a financial consultant). You should then open an IRA or Roth IRA
account and fund it according to your plan.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    -----
 &HT;    
 &HT;    4. What are some of the best ways families with children can
save for college expenses?
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Barajas: For ways to save for college expenses, it depends on
the age of the child. If the child has more than five years to go
before starting college, a portfolio of growth mutual funds (U.S.
and international) is the best place to start investing. If the
child has less than five years to go before starting college, a
portfolio of balanced mutual funds, short term bonds, and money
market funds is ideal.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Mojica: If sending your children to college is a priority, then
discipline is the key. Even if you only save a minimal amount per
child, the important thing is that it's done consistently. It will
help alleviate the problem of goiing into debt. It will also
provide the child with some understanding of the responsibility of
being a parent and hopefully allow him or her to appreciate the
privilege of receiving an education. There are also certain types
of loans, such as 401(k)s, which, if used for educational purposes,
can be obtained at minimal interest rates and may be withdrawn
without penalty. You should always consult a qualified tax
professional.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Fernandez: Some of the best ways to save for college expenses
are as follows: Set up a Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UGMA) account
for the child and add to the account regularly. This will put the
money in the children's name. Also look at the Educational IRA as a
means of saving. Parents also can withdraw from their own IRA for
educational expenses.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Gonzales: For college funding, you might consider making a gift
to your child or grandchild under the UGMA. After establishing a
UGMA account in a child's name, the first $650 in unearned income
deposited each year in the account is tax-free. The next $650 is
taxed at the child's tax rate, which is usually lower than that of
the parents or grandparents. Some restrictions apply when the child
is over the age of 14 and with unearned income amounts of $1,300 or
more.
 &HT;    You may also borrow money against the accumulated value of your
workplace's 401(k) plan when college rolls around. However,
remember that it's still a loan that must be paid back. I bought a
whole life insurance policy on each of my grandsons when they were
born. I realized their policies would only grow enough by their
college years to cover one year of college. But I also was locking
in their insurability at an early age and accumulating on a
tax-deferred basis; they will never have to pay a higher
life-insurance premium than what I paid at their birth.
 &HT;    The new Educational IRA allows for a $500 annual contribution.
However, with the rising costs of college tuition, I don't believe
this is enough, even if you start the plan at birth.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Diaz: The safest way to save for your children's education is to
buy zero-coupon bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury. These are bonds
that can be purchased at a discount to their value upon maturity.
For example, if you bought your newborn a $1,000 bond that matures
when the child reaches 18, you would pay approximately $350 now and
receive $1000 in 18 years. If you could tolerate more risk, you
could buy some stocks or mutual funds, and wait to see what growth
the stocks would return.

 New America News Service 
 &HT;    When Richard ``Cheech'' Marin shaved off his mustache in 1995,
he not only looked younger, he was transformed.
 &HT;    The actor/comedian's new look wasn't just what the role in
``From Dusk Till Dawn'' demanded, it marked the beginning of yet
another surge in his career. This would include a string of popular
films (``Tin Cup,'' ``The Great White Hype''), a children's record
(``My Name is Cheech, the School Bus Driver''), and a co-starring
role on the hit TV show ``Nash Bridges.''
 &HT;    In 1999, Marin has transformed his image yet again. The mustache
is back, but this time it's to promote a new line of hot sauces.
 &HT;    Marin, 42, says he always wanted to produce his own line of hot
sauces and so he found a specialty food company to help develop the
concept.
 &HT;    Figueroa Brothers, makers of Melinda's hot sauces, won the
opportunity to work with Marin. According to David Figueroa,
president of the company, he and his brother, Greg, were introduced
to Marin through artist Alan Aldridge.
 &HT;    The Hispanic-owned company had worked with the House of Blues,
with which Aldridge was associated, to create a line of hot sauces
for that restaurant chain as well as for Joe's Crab Shack.
 &HT;    The company put together different combinations, and after
several taste tests with Marin, three flavors were born: Gnarly
Garlic, Smokin' Chipotle and Mojo Mango.
 &HT;    ``These are not salsas,'' Marin clarifies. ``They're more in the
family of hot sauces, like Tabasco, and are designed to complement
any dish.''
 &HT;    Marin's favorite, Mojo Mango, combines mangos with habanero
chiles and works very well with fish, he says.
 &HT;    If Marin's latest venture elicits surprise from some, that
merely points to how little the public knows about the man _
despite the fact that he made up half of one of the most popular
comedy duos of the '70s, Cheech and Chong.
 &HT;    ``I've cooked all my life,'' Cheech says. ``My dad taught me.''
 &HT;    Oscar Marin, a member of the Los Angeles Police Department,
didn't enforce gender stereotypes on his son.
 &HT;    ``I remember cooking breakfast on weekends _ pancakes and
sausage, eggs and bacon, the typical breakfast stuff,'' he says.
 &HT;    That early training would come in handy later. In 1968 he left
California State University at Northridge _ just eight credits shy
of earning an English degree _ for Canada, where he worked as a
hotel chef and met Tommy Chong.
 &HT;    Twenty-seven years after the release of the first Cheech and
Chong comedy album, Marin has moved on. With every success, he has
developed a reputation for being the nicest guy in Hollywood.
 &HT;    He prefers to use his celebrity to help a cause. He has been
known to take his own car to an event, passing on an offered
limousine.
 &HT;    Not surprisingly, he plans to set aside a portion of the profits
from the sale of the hot sauces to a Latino charity. preferably one
that encourages self-help.
 &HT;    ``I'd much rather set aside funds like this than just throw
money at a cause. I'm a real believer in the parable that says,
`Give a starving man food, and you feed him for a day. Teach him
how to fish, and you feed him for life.''
 &HT;    Each time Latino consumers purchase a Cheech sauce, they will be
giving back to their community, consciously or unconsciously, he
says.
 &HT;    This is only part of Marin's extracurricular agenda. He's become
an avid golfer _ another fact he believes few people know about
him.
 &HT;    With a handicap of 15, he describes his skill level as
``studying to he an amateur.'' When he can, Marin participates in
celebrity golf tournaments that raise funds for different Youth
programs.
 &HT;    These efforts have earned him the 1999 NCLR/Kraft ALMA Community
Service Award. He plans to donate the $10,000 cash award to the
National Hispanic Scholarship Fund.
 &HT;    But that's not all. Marin is developing a project that's even
closer to his heart. Committed to preserving the Cultural legacy of
Latinos in the United States, Marin is the owner of one of the
largest personal collections of Chicano art. He's been approached
for years by friends and fans to organize an exhibit of his
collection.
 &HT;    He's chosen the new millennium to do just that. He plans to put
together a retrospective of Chicano art using pieces from his own
collection as well from others.
 &HT;    The exhibit will tour the country throughout the year and will
incorporate a multimedia interactive component that will encompass
the history of Latinos in all art disciplines from dancers to
comedians.
 &HT;    Marin also will continue playing the character of Joe Dominguez
in ``Nash Bridges,'' which was renewed for another season.
 &HT;    ``This has been the best season. We're having fun, getting paid
and living in San Francisco. What could be better?'' he asks.

CLASSIC LEGAL DECISION STILL IMPACTS NATIVE-AMERICANS

Times Publishing, Inc., located in Sioux Falls, S.D. His Indian

 New America News Service 
 &HT;    The Santa Clara Pueblo vs. Martinez decision has impacted many
Indian people since the U.S. Supreme Court handed it down more than
20 years ago.
 &HT;    The court ruled that the Indian Civil Rights Act does not
subject tribes to the jurisdiction of federal courts in civil
actions for the injunctive or remedial relief. Plainly, the court
decided that federal agencies should not interfere with the
internal policies of an Indian nation.
 &HT;    The Martinez case originated on the Santa Clara Pueblo in
northern New Mexico. It involved a Pueblo woman married to a Navajo
mn. Mrs. Martinez attempted to get her half-Navajo children
enrolled in the tribe but discovered that a tribal ordinance only
allowed male members of the tribe married to nonmembers the right
to enroll their children. Women married to nonmembers could not
enroll their children.
 &HT;    Martinez and her children sued the Pueblo and its governor in
federal district court contending that the membership ordinance
violated the equal protection and due process provisions of the
Indian Civil Rights Act.
 &HT;    The Supreme Court's opinion reaffirmed the theory that Indian
tribes possess immunity from suit traditionally enjoyed by
sovereigns and that a waiver of sovereign immunity cannot be
implied but must be unequivocally expressed.
 &HT;    The court's opinion goes, ``First, is the plaintiff one of a
class for whose benefit the statute was enacted: second, is there
any indication of the legislative intent, explicit or implicit,
either to create or deny such a remedy? Third, is it consistent
with the underlying purposes of the legislative scheme to imply
such a remedy? Fourth, is the cause of action one traditionally
relegated to tribal law in an area basically of concern to tribes
so that it would be inappropriate to infer a cause of action based
solely on federal law?
 &HT;    The court concluded that ``Tribal courts have repeatedly been
recognized as appropriate forums for the exclusive adjudication of
disputes affecting important personal and property interests of
both Indians and non-Indians and the tribal forums are available.''
 &HT;    What the court intended, simply put, was to allow the Indian
nations to settle internal matters involving personal and property
interests within their own court system.
 &HT;    Most outside observers would believe that excluding Indian women
on Santa Clara from enrolling their children if they had a
nonmember father as outlandishly unconstitutional, but the court
recognized the sovereign right of the tribe to live within the
framework of its own culture and traditions.
 &HT;    Since that decision in the 1970s, several government agencies
have used it to duck controversial issues arising on many Indian
reservations. When confronted with these choices, they often allude
to the Martinez decision and wash their hands of the matter saying
they do not want to intrude upon tribal internal matters.
 &HT;    Some tribal leaders have used the Martinez decision to declare
open warfare upon political rivals. Given the freedom to act
independently without fear of interference by the Bureau of Indian
Affairs or the Interior Department gives a lot of elbowroom to
unscrupulous politicians.
 &HT;    Too often, decisions made by tribal courts can violate the civil
rights of tribal members and many times these decisions are made
for political reasons and have little to do with protecting the
tribe's right to make decisions on internal matters.
 &HT;    As in the larger society, laws enacted can be used for good or
evil. The Santa Clara Pueblo vs. Martinez decision strengthened
tribal governments in many ways but it also left the door open for
political skullduggery.

 New America News Service 
 &HT;    The best argument for term limits for politicians is an
83-year-old Democrat county tax assessor in Madison County, Ala.
 &HT;    The man just might be liable as a criminal for denying American
citizens their civil rights, by denying them legal tax benefits
that any Alabama homeowner is entitled to as long as the homeowner
swears that his application is true and correct.
 &HT;    Kevin Sack of the New York Times has brought to our attention
that Mr. Wayland H. Cooley, the elected county tax assessor for
almost six four-year terms, has denied American citizens their
rightful home tax exemptions because they don't speak English.
 &HT;    Cooley claims that the Alabama Constitution has English as the
official language of Alabama, thus, he cannot accept the oaths of
those who do not speak English. Not being able to give an oath
would thus render the application untrue. Madison County, where 3.8
percent of 272,000 residents are Hispanic or Asian, is the only
county in Alabama that does not allow interpreters to assist
applicants for tax exemptions. By the way, Alabama civil and
criminal courts can accept Spanish with interpreters.
 &HT;    A lawsuit has been filed by Dominican immigrants Julio and
Carmen de Paula Telleria, 71 and 59 respectively, who came to the
United States in the 1960s and became citizens in 1982 under a law
that didn't require they speak English. They retired from their New
York and New Jersey jobs in 1995 and bought their Alabama house for
$54,000.
 &HT;    They went to Cooley's office in 1996 with their English speaking
son to claim their tax exemptions. He turned them down and when
informed they were U.S. citizens allegedly said that it doesn't
matter.
 &HT;    Cooley is wrong. He is wrong because the Alabama Attorney
General, Bill Pryor, says so in a formal opinion declaring that the
English-language provision in the Alabama Constitution does not
prevent someone from receiving their tax exemptions, as the
exemptions accrue to the property not to an oath.
 &HT;    Cooley has violated the United States Constitution's call for
equal protection and due process of law. The Southern Poverty Law
Center of Montgomery has filed the lawsuit. It has surveyed the
entire state of Alabama and finds that Cooley is the only tax
assessor in the state who refuses to accept any language but
English.
 &HT;    What is Cooley doing here?
 &HT;    There are two previous cases in which Cooley denied property tax
exemptions to a native of Mexico. His comments to an FBI analyst
who offered to act as interpreter are instructive. Mary Catherine
Graham says, ``He said that he had to watch out for people who were
trying to come in from all over the world and skin us on taxes.''
 &HT;    Cooley told a real estate agent who volunteered as an
interpreter that ``They're coming over here and taking what's
ours.''
 &HT;    What we have here, is a case of all foreigners looking alike, a
touch of xenophobia and, perhaps, a case of dementia. This is not
to speak ill of an 83-year-old, but certainly we would have few
Cooleys around if there were term limits for all political offices.
 &HT;    We have the English-only conundrum here and that is a phony
issue that appeals to people like Cooley, but didn't appeal to the
founders of the country. We then have the issue of whether a State
constitution can override the U.S. Constitution. The issue of
whether a county official can violate the ``equal protection'' and
``due process'' and be immune, as Cooley claims, from taking legal
responsibility is involved here, as well. And, Cooley is going to
learn that a naturalized citizen cannot be denied anything a
native-born citizen can receive.
 &HT;    Cooley claims that he gives all English-speaking citizens what
they are entitled to, thus he has violated no law. But, again, the
State Attorney General has issued a formal ruling that tax
exemptions cannot be denied on the basis of language, despite the
language provision of the Alabama Constitution. What Cooley doesn't
claim is that he is a racist, but he is. He hasn't claimed that he
is a xenophobe and hates immigrants, but he is and does.
 &HT;    Is he alone in Alabama? Or is Alabama a hotbed of xenophobes and
haters of foreigners? It looks like he's pretty much alone. The
Asian population is growing in Alabama, as is the Hispanic
population. Prior to this situation, there haven't been too many
problems of note for immigrants in Alabama.
 &HT;    We can only hope that the lawsuit will put Cooley in his place
and send a signal to everyone else that neither Cooley nor anyone
else can discriminate on any basis as a public official. We can
also hope that Cooley takes the hint and retires from office. We
can further hope that if he runs for reelection, the good people of
a fairly sophisticated space city will retire him from office.

UNITARIANS VOW TO FIGHT BOY SCOUTS' SIN OF HOMOPHOBIA

 By CHUCK COLBERT 
 &HT;    (Chuck Colbert is a founder of the Gay and Lesbian Alumni of
Notre Dame/St. Mary's College, and serves on the board of directors

 New America News Service  By Chuck Colbert
 &HT;    More than a month ago the Unitarian Universalists Association
and the Boy Scouts of America reached a compromise in their dispute
over homosexuality.
 &HT;    But apparently that compromise fell apart when the Scouts
revoked the Unitarian's authority to grant religious awards,
according to a breaking news story recently in The Boston Globe by
religion reporter Diego Ribadeneira. The UUA intends to defy the
BSA's latest order.
 &HT;    For more than a year now, the two organizations have been trying
to resolve a very public disagreement over two differing views on
homosexuality.
 &HT;    According to the 1911 Scout Oath a boy pledges to ``keep myself
physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight.'' In 1991
the Scouts reaffirmed that stance, stating that ``homosexual
conduct is inconsistent with the requirements in the Scout Oath''
and that ``avowed homosexuals'' were not welcome.
 &HT;    Unitarian Universalists _a progressive religious denomination
with deep roots in American Protestantism _ stresses the ``inherent
worth and dignity of every person,'' and from that tenet flows the
UUA's affirmation of gay rights. Unitarians teach that homophobia _
not homosexuality _ is the sin.
 &HT;    Marking the first time a mainline religious denomination has
made so public and so forceful its criticism of the anti-gay
policy, the dispute made national headlines. It was not just any
religious organization taking on the Scouts, but one that has a
very American history of supporting freedom, reason and tolerance.
 &HT;    Universal Unitarianism is the faith tradition of Ralph Waldo
Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Susan B. Anthony, Clara Barton,
William Howard Taft, Thomas Jefferson and John Quincy Adams.
 &HT;    To resolve the dispute, the church deleted from its manual for
the ``Religion and Life'' award, a statement the Scouts found
offensive. That statement _ mentioning the UUA's ``ongoing concern
regarding the homophobic and discriminatory attitudes of the
national leadership of the Boy Scouts of America'' _ caused the BSA
a year ago to order the denomination to stop giving out the award.
 &HT;    ``Until...the Unitarian materials can be redrafted to a form
acceptable to the Committee, youth may not be awarded Unitarian
Universalists religious emblems in scouting or wear the emblem on a
scout uniform,'' the chairman of the Scouts' Religious
Relationships Committee wrote last May to the president of the UUA.
 &HT;    In reaching a compromise the BSA unanimously approved the
redrafted UUA manual and reauthorized the ``awarding of the
Religion in Life emblem by the UUA to Scouts and the wearing of the
emblem on a Scout uniform,'' according to the chairman.
 &HT;    But while the church agreed to delete the statement offensive to
the Scouts from Unitarian manual, the UUA was unwilling to
compromise its core religious beliefs. Consequently, along with
each copy of the newly revised manual was to be provided a separate
letter offering ``resources appropriate to dealing with issues of
homophobia and religious discrimination,'' according to John
Buehrens, president of the 250,000-member denomination.
 &HT;    The Scouts, however, now say that the separate document was not
mentioned as part of any compromise. ``That document reopens the
whole issue of using boys as a venue to air the Unitarian
Universalists Association's objection to scouting's commitment to
God and to traditional family values,'' Gregg Shields of the BSA
told the Globe.
 &HT;    While the Unitarian Universalists refused to temper their
criticisms of the Scouts, they would like a Unitarian to serve on
the BSA's religion committee. Buehrens explained why the church
wanted representation:
 &HT;    First, ``many of the values of scouting are congruent with our
UU principles,'' he wrote last month. Second, ``BSA bylaws contain
a statement about the nature of God which many good people in many
traditions would find impossible to accept.'' Third, ``the BSA can
and should adopt new policies with regard to volunteers, to
membership and to homophobia.''
 &HT;    Continuing, he wrote ``Discrimination on the basis of sexual
orientation should not be allowed to continue as a national policy.
It will ruin the organization ...''
 &HT;    Buehrens has got that right. For some time now, legal and
human-rights organizations have challenged the Scouts policy _ not
only on the issue of barring openly gay men and boys from the BSA,
but also on issues of religious freedom and discrimination _ in
court cases from California to New Jersey, from Washington to
Illinois, and in the District of Columbia.
 &HT;    Just because more conservative churches, Roman Catholic,
Methodist, and Mormon charter most Scout troops does not mean that
their sectarian religious traditions should unduly influence and
set national policy for a secular organization like the Boy Scouts.
 &HT;    Openly gay Unitarians should be able to join the BSA and serve
in leadership and volunteer positions. The UUA should be able to
give out religious awards to its boy scouts.
 &HT;    What's so inspiring about the Unitarian Universalists is the
example they set: for a change the religious order prods the
secular order to do the right thing instead of sitting on the
sidelines waiting for social justice and equality to happen.

   LONDON _ Perry Brooks is groovy, baby.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks sports a moptop, an orange wide-collared shirt open at
the neck, and brown polyester pants that hug his slim hips, flaring
just so over mock croc ankle boots. And he has a mood ring that is
tinting a pale blue. Very mod.
</P>
<P>
   The only person cooler is Austin Powers, the foppish British
secret agent featured in the 1997 film, ``Austin Powers,
International Man of Mystery.'' On Carnaby Street, the epitome of
swinging London in the 1960s, Austin rules _ or is at least
emulated by 20-somethings such as Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of stuff I can relate to in Austin Powers
because I'm heavily into the '60s and swinging London,'' said
Brooks, who works at Sherry's, a '60s store on the street.
</P>
<P>
   So news that the ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' is
finally hitting the screens in the United States _ although not in
the United Kingdom until this summer _ was greeted warmly along the
street, which set fashion standards in the '60s with its
psychedelic colors, garish designs, and outrageously short
hemlines. Because, on Carnaby Street, a half-mile swath in central
London, mod never went out of fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows about mods and everyone has blokes who were, or
have been mods,'' said Phil Meynell, 19, at Face, another retro
shop off Carnaby Street. ``It's totally cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Carnaby Street, Abbey Road, Portabello Road, St. John's Wood.
These were the haunts of young Mick Jagger, Twiggy, the Beatles,
Marianne Faithful, The Who, The Yardbirds, and Petula Clark.
</P>
<P>
   Abbey Road, for one, remains unscathed by time, except for fresh
graffiti on the nearby fence of the Beatles' former recording
studio. Carnaby Street, however, was defined by its commercialism.
That element still exists.
</P>
<P>
   A walk down the pedestrian thoroughfare is like being on an
Austin Powers's set: Hendrix and Morrison posters abound, the Union
Jack flies at nearly every shop, and buyers can pick up plastic
breasts, plastic blowup chairs or mushroom-shaped ceiling lamps.
The clientele is young, and business has never been better.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sell a lot of cravats and velvet suits,'' said Helen
Robinson of Pop Boutique. ``We just get a lot of people who follow
'60s fashions and they like to look here, especially on Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all young people,'' she says, then slightly wrinkles
her young nose. ``Not 40-year-olds.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, baby boomers and older generations this side of the pond
seem to be ignoring comic Mike Meyers and his movie persona, Austin
Powers. Commentary in British press _ which enthusiastically
embraces nearly every popular topic _ has barely scratched the
Austin Powers surface. When they do, it is to decry a return to
that ``vulgar'' era.
</P>
<P>
   But younger, cooler Britannia says Austin Powers is all in fun.
</P>
<P>
   Meyers ``has got a really good sense of humor. Even though
Austin is making fun of the English, he's also looking at their
ability to laugh at themselves,'' said Lewis Wharton, 24, who
sports a mild mod look with a shag haircut and retro eye wear.
``He's not a bad guy to have stereotype the English.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Britons embrace Meyers for several reasons: They enjoyed
his performance in ``Wayne's World,'' his parents are British
(although he is Canadian), and he did a stint long ago on British
children's television in a show called ``Wide Awake Club.'' But it
is Austin Powers and the '60s they never knew that they have
embraced the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie was hilarious,'' Brooks said. ``It draws a lot of
obvious references from the '60s, but it was very amusing. I even
thought the teeth thing was funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Underneath all of his shagadelic bravado, Austin Powers owns
plaque-encrusted, yellow, crooked teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw the movie, I thought: `What was that all about?' ''
recalled Wharton. ``My (American) girlfriend had to tell me: You
English don't know you've got bad teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   But Meynell disagreed. Mike Meyers ``has got it quite right,''
he said. Then he smiled wide and flashed crooked, yellow teeth.
``We all have bad teeth over here. We don't care!''

IT'S BEST TO QUIETLY AVOID THE TBS MOVIE, `SILENT PREDATORS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every now and then, critics need to sharpen their claws, which
apparently is why movies like Sunday's ``Silent Predators'' on TBS
Superstation are made.
</P>
<P>
   It's a marvelous public service. But trust me. Unless you're a
critic you don't have to see this movie, because you've already
seen it. And you know how it ends. It is cinematic schlock of the
first order, featuring acting and writing so pedestrian it could be
arrested for jaywalking.
</P>
<P>
   As a horror-genre flick aimed at viewers who like to be shocked,
``Silent Predators'' has some grab-the-sofa moments, thanks mainly
to well-timed music (by Michael Tavera). It's about killer snakes
in California, none of whom works in the film industry. The premise
is the same as in all the ``Jaws'' movies, the only difference
being that it's land-based, so the advertising slogan would be
altered slightly to something like: ``Just when you thought it was
safe to go into the crawl space beneath your house ... ''
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, the original script for ``Silent Predators'' is
nearly 20 years old. Horror-meister John Carpenter (``Halloween'')
intended it as a feature film, but it went the way of many grand
cinematic schemes and never got made. (Possibly because it was so
much like the ``Jaws'' oeuvre?) Anyway, TBS chose it for its
original-movie lineup, but whatever tweaking it received from
co-writers William Gilmore and Matt Dorff won't win it any prizes.
Example:
</P>
<P>
   Guy: ``Ever been to a herpetologist?''
</P>
<P>
   Gal: ``Excuse me?''
</P>
<P>
   Guy: ``A snake scientist.''
</P>
<P>
   Gal: ``Never.''
</P>
<P>
   Guy: ``There's always a first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the film, one of the characters actually says, ``Better
safe than sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   And so on.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Hamlin is our hero, Vic Rondelli, the new fire chief in
the pleasant San Diego suburb of San Catalano. Shannon Sturges is
our heroine/woman in distress, Mandy Stratford, who works for the
bad guy but likes the good guy. Jack Scalia is our bad guy, Max
Farrington, a slimy real estate developer who knows he's not the
only snake in town but doesn't want to address the problem because
it'll ruin his business.
</P>
<P>
   The snakes are hybrids: a combination of the Western diamondback
rattlesnake and a much more lethal tropical variety. And therein
lies another problem: The film is called ``Silent Predators,'' but
these big honkin' reptiles _ an expert estimates there may be as
many as 35,000 bearing down on San Catalano _ are rattlers, and
they're not exactly quiet when disturbed by humans.
</P>
<P>
   Silent predators indeed. It's as if a maraca convention is
meeting in them thar hills. Was anyone at TBS paying attention?
</P>
<P>
   The best performance in this loser is Scalia's. Though
completely one-dimensional, his Farrington is relatively plausible:
greedy, opportunistic, self-centered. But with a thin script and a
hackneyed story, Hamlin and Sturges travel a path so worn that they
can't muster much support. They'd have been better off saying less
and giving the snakes more screen time.
</P>
<P>
   Silent Predators. Two-hour cable-TV movie about a small
California community infested with killer rattlesnakes. Starring
Harry Hamlin, Shannon Sturges and Jack Scalia. Sunday on TBS
Superstation. Repeats Wednesday and June 19. Parental guideline
rating: TV-PG.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: D+

 &HT;    REFUGEES AND U.S. TROOPS BOTH LOOK WITH SKEPTICISM AT THE
JOURNEY TO KOSOVO
 &HT;    With Photo.
 &HT;    With KOSOVO-MAIN.
 &HT;    By MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKOPJE, Macedonia As Ismet Blakgori's extended family of
refugees languished in the shade of their tent flap in Thursday's
breathless heat, they listened to the radio, talked now and then,
and didn't even think much about prospects of returning to their
Kosovo neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the news they said we would be going home soon, but we
don't trust it,'' said 50-year-old Blakgori, who was stretched out
on a blanket until a grandbaby landed in his arms. ``We THINK this
time might be different, but we still don't trust it.''
</P>
<P>
   On another outskirt of town, paratroops of the elite 82nd
Airborne Division were idling outside their own hot tents at Camp
Able Sentry Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   And like the refugees at the Stankovec camp, many of them were
considerably less than euphoric over the deal NATO finally clinched
with Yugoslavia on Wednesday night to stop the latest of the ugly
Balkan conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Some troops sitting on gravel outside their olive drab tents
likewise voiced skepticism about what lies ahead as they try to
secure Kosovo so families like the Blakgoris can return safely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not too happy, to tell you the truth,'' said Sgt. John
Newland, 27, of Fayetteville, N.C. ``Most of the guys are going to
BS you and say they are proud to go in.''
</P>
<P>
   But Newland, among a group that had shed flak jackets and
helmets in favor of their brown T-shirts and camouflage pants, said
these troops of the 82nd Airborne Division didn't sign up for
service as the world's policemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are getting ourselves in a nutroll,'' he said. ``It's like
Bosnia. They make a plan to get out, but it is not possible to get
out because without you the fighting is going to start all over
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly some Kosovar Albanian refugees and some newly-arrived
U.S. soldiers are enthusiastic about the prospects of how the
coming weeks will unfold. But voices in both camps spoke with
arresting hesitation and worry, if not downright pessimism.
</P>
<P>
   At another tent in the Stankovec refugee camp, two women and
nine children hanging around in the desultory afternoon were
perplexed about what to do if the deal works and they are sent
home.
</P>
<P>
   Naile and Bahnie Zhieqi, who married brothers now working in
Italy, enjoy a vastly better situation than the thousands of women
whose husbands were separated from them and now are missing.
</P>
<P>
   But the pair is still fearful and uncertain of how to proceed in
this culture where women are not so used to being either
decision-makers or breadwinners. A complication is that their homes
in Podjevo were burned down.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have our husbands. We don't have our houses. How will
we survive?'' said Naile Zhieqi, 31, who has three children.
</P>
<P>
   Back at Camp Able Sentry, Spec. Christopher Miller, 21, of
Elizabethton (CQ), Tenn., wasn't so worried about survival, but he
did express concerns not so dissimilar to Zhieqi's about readiness.
He said American soldiers were never trained for this kind of duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a trying experience,'' said Miller, who pointed to
the problem of target recognition now that this mission is not
simply about shooting enemy soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Previously when one of us saw a Serb soldier, we could regard
him as an enemy contact,'' he said. ``Now we have to wonder whether
it is just a soldier who has gotten lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The physical hazards of Kosovo sometimes were troubling to both
refugees and troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hope to be back this year, because they destroyed
everything. We don't have a home any more. We don't have a place to
sleep,'' said Haxhi Ibrahimi, 52, of Pushkosova, a village outside
of the Kosovo capital of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Several times in a half-hour conversation, Ibrahimi spoke of the
mines both refugees and military think are planted around Kosovo.
He also feared the retreating Serbs left booby traps in the homes
or barns or wells of ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   To the military, such dangers are simply a way of life. What
does raise some concern is how efficiently the troops _ as
peacekeepers _ will be able to defend themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is pretty stupid we are coming down here,'' said Spc.
Nathan Poppenga, 20, of Centerville, S.D.
</P>
<P>
   ``We train for hostile situations. And when we get deployed, we
spend all our time peace keeping,'' he said. ``Basically, we have
to wait for them to shoot. By then it may be too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at the Blakgori tent, a cavernous structure housing 13
people, Ismet's brother Idriz was clad in shorts and was virtually
wearing the radio he never put down as he talked about the
prospects of the peace pact working.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are happy, some are skeptical. We don't trust
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He talked about the family's two years of bad experiences that
he said began after another brother was beaten by Serbian police
and died. Others of the family were arrested and harassed, but none
treated so badly as that brother who was arrested and fatally
beaten a day after he held a ceremony in his school room in honor
of Albanian national day.
</P>
<P>
   Those bad times are enough to make them wary of returning, and
now the three surviving brothers from Pristina, their parents and
children, have heard that everything was stolen from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, a hint of hope crept into the bleak commentary of
brother Ismet Blakgari
</P>
<P>
   ``If the NATO troops are there and clear the mines, then we will
go,'' he said. ``It's better in my house, even if I have nothing,
than it is here.''

CLINTON MARKS HIS LEGACY WITH U.S. ROLE AS MEDIATOR 
</HEADLINE>

Eastern)  
 News Analysis

POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's enduring legacy in foreign
affairs may be his efforts to reconcile warring factions inside
sovereign nations.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by international inaction during the slaughters in Bosnia
and Rwanda, the president has devoted much of his foreign policy to
crafting compromises designed to ease the ethnic, religious or
cultural animosities that often lead to bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton helped fashion compromises in Northern Ireland, Bosnia
and the Middle East. He opted for talk over combat in Haiti,
dispatching a team of heavy-hitters _ former President Jimmy
Carter, retired Gen. Colin Powell and former Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga. _
on the eve of the U.S. invasion in 1994 to persuade a defiant
strongman to step aside.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has worked, as well, with African leaders to help stem
ethnic struggles in Burundi and in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   The president noted Thursday that the world did ``not turn away
in the face of ethnic cleansing and killing'' in Kosovo that
displaced some 1.6 million ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am grateful to the American citizens, who felt enormous
compassion for the suffering of the people in Kosovo and understood
the importance of standing up to the war crimes involved in ethnic
cleansing and killing, and the kind of ethnic and religious bigotry
and violence we have seen against innocent civilians,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   The international community took a stand, Clinton said, adding:
``The United States should feel vindicated when the people go home,
and when they're safe, and when we can say that we, as a nation,
have played a role in reversing ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's foreign policy has been distinguished by heavy
reliance on personal diplomacy with the leaders of Russia and
China, a willingness to threaten military action, and reliance on
high-tech warfare with low risks of casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's air-only operation against Yugoslavia was emblematic
of the tactics he used to strike Iraq, Sudan and Afghanistan in the
past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Dallek, a professor of history at Boston University and
the author of ``Hail to the Chief: The Making and Unmaking of
American Presidents,'' said Clinton's willingness to confront
burgeoning humanitarian catastrophes may become the model for
American foreign policy in 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton may be establishing a new paradigm for American
foreign policy _ that whenever we see ethnic cleansing, even the
mere hint of genocide, it will be resisted by the United States,''
Dallek said. ``The United States may be emerging as the world
policeman to fight ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Simon Serfaty, director of European studies at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, warned that
Clinton's willingness to intervene must be matched by a willingness
to follow through once hostilities end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe any of Clinton's interventions will prove to
be constructive in the long term,'' Serfaty said. ``There has just
not been enough follow up.''
</P>
<P>
   Reconstruction lags in Bosnia, a former republic of Yugoslavia
ravaged by ethnic conflict. Nations are behind on promised
donations to a $5.1 billion recovery fund. Barely 574,000 of the
1.8 million uprooted Bosnians have returned to their homes more
than three years after a U.S.-brokered peace agreement ended the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Reconstruction in Kosovo may require $30 billion, difficulties
lie ahead persuading uprooted Kosovars to return home and the
secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army may resist disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may well turn out that we've done the easy part with regard
to Kosovo,'' Serfaty said. ``Now we're there and we have no idea
what we're facing or how long it will take. We'll need follow up.''

<P>

</P>
<P>
   White House aides say the roots of Clinton's approach lie in the
frustrations of watching the international community stand idly by
as 200,000 people died in Bosnia during four years of communal
warfare there, and as more than 1 million people died in Rwanda in
internecine fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton came face-to-face with the human cost of inaction during
a stopover at Kilgali airport in Rwanda in 1998, when survivors
vividly recalled the horror.
</P>
<P>
   Aides say the experience has shaped Clinton's thinking ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not act quickly enough after the killing began,''
Clinton lamented in remarks to the survivors in the Central African
nation. ``We did not immediately call these crimes by their
rightful name _ `genocide.'''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton referred back to the precedent in his remarks on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Americans should be proud of standing up to the Yugoslav
leadership's crusade to drive Kosovars ``from their land _ dead or
alive,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After what we have done in Bosnia, and the work we have been
doing in Africa to try to prevent a Rwanda from ever occurring
again, we will be able to see the world go into the 21st century
with a more humane future,'' he said.

LEARNING CHANNEL EXPLORES THE WORLD OF SHOWGIRLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   She's 6 feet tall in her stocking feet, and pushing 10 feet in
her work clothes.
</P>
<P>
   High heels and feathery headdresses do that to a girl.
</P>
<P>
   Kate Vanderliet is the (set ital)vedette(end ital) _ the star _
of the high-strutting stage show at the Lido in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the world's most glamorous jobs. But outside the
famous nightclub, she says, ``I'm a Northern California girl. I
come from the Bay Area and I love the outdoors. I like to put my
jeans on. I'm just a down-to-earth kind of girl without a lot of
makeup.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanderliet, who grew up in Orinda, Calif., and once studied
ballet in San Francisco, has been at the Lido for a decade. She's
not only its lead dancer but, at 39, its oldest.
</P>
<P>
   She's also one of the featured personalities in a cable TV
documentary to be televised Sunday. Narrated by Anjelica Huston,
the film by Agnieszka Piotrowska is called ``Showgirl Stories.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the latest eyebrow-raiser from The Learning Channel, the
cable channel that promises ``adventures for your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous mind adventures on the channel that now simply calls
itself TLC have included documentaries about swimsuits (``History
of the Bathing Suit: Nothing to Hide'') and lingerie (``Next to
Nothing: The History of Lingerie'').
</P>
<P>
   Are we feeling adventurous yet?
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who watches might wonder what sorts of adventures went
into editing the film for TV.
</P>
<P>
   TLC seems to be majoring in physical education but not in
anatomy. Bare breasts have been blurred in the film, and in many
shots nipples have been magically eradicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Showgirl Stories'' runs the gamut from hip-grinding lap
dancers to stage stars such as Vanderliet. It's a lavish production
with some serious intent and, at least, a few light points to make
about fleeting beauty.
</P>
<P>
   But at two hours, the film is too long and sometimes meanders
its way without good effect through the stories of showgirls in
London, Paris, New York, Las Vegas and the Mojave Desert, home to
an exotic dancer museum.
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting to meet a few of the surviving Ziegfeld Girls
and to hear about wealthy admirers showering them, way back when,
with roses, diamonds and hundred-dollar bills for their cab fares.
</P>
<P>
   But I could have done without a tour of a showgirl's suburban
Las Vegas house. (``Me and my ex-husband, we bought it together ...
This is the TV room, as I call it. As you can see, I love pink.'')
</P>
<P>
   Vanderliet, a University of California at Irvine graduate who
made her way to Paris via Reno and Lake Tahoe revues, stands out as
one of the more sensible performers in the film.
</P>
<P>
   Good sense seems to be a lifelong trait. On a recent visit to
San Francisco, she said in an interview that although she devotedly
took ballet classes, she knew since childhood that she wouldn't
dance ballet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just knew when I was a little kid,'' she said. ``You know,
you look in the mirror every day when you take a ballet class. You
look and you expect perfection. I knew what perfection was, and I
didn't see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to go to New York and pursue New York City
Ballet or ABT (American Ballet Theatre). I grew too tall. I didn't
want to suffer. I knew I wouldn't be a diva, a prima ballerina. It
wasn't right.''
</P>
<P>
   But what was wrong for the ballet stage was altogether right for
the international troupe at the Lido. The minimum height for a Lido
dancer is 5 feet 9 inches.
</P>
<P>
   The film captures a pensive Vanderliet talking about her
decision not to marry during her stage career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally have chosen to be alone and lonely than to be
with someone else and lonely,'' she says, and the comment sounds
sage in the context of Piotrowska's film.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Francisco interview, Vanderliet said she's wrestling
with the knowledge that age is closing in on her showgirl career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ashamed to say it: I'm pushing 40,'' she said. ``Most
people finish long before this. I'm preparing myself now mentally
for that, because you can't do it forever.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her future possibilities include returning to the Bay
Area as a dance teacher and maybe taking a stab at a new career in
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm at the crossroads right now,'' she said. ``I wish I could
give you a straightforward answer. I'm trying to make a decision
myself.''

   `Austin Powers': It's still a gas, baby
</P>
<P>
   By Steve Murray
</P>
<P>
   MOVIE CRITIC
</P>
<P>
   Chaos hits Carnaby Street when our favorite dentally impaired
British superspy has his mojo, and much of his new movie, stolen by
Dr. Evil. But because Mike Myers plays both the good guy and the
bad guy (and a third character to boot), he has only himself to
blame for the scene-stealing in ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who
Shagged Me.''
</P>
<P>
   In this follow-up to 1997's surprise hit, Myers keeps the faith
with Austin fans, delivering a gas of a sequel. The flick gives us
a new curvy love interest, Felicity Shagwell (Heather Graham),
while bringing back Seth Green as Dr. Evil's sullen son Scott and
Robert Wagner and Mindy Sterling as henchpersons Number 2 and Frau
Farbissina. We also get Rob Lowe doing a perfect Wagner imitation
as Younger Number 2 and tiny Verne Troyer as Dr. Evil's clone,
Mini-Me.
</P>
<P>
   As shaggy as it is shagadelic, ``Spy'' is really just an excuse
to take comic aim at pop institutions, from ``Star Wars'' to
Starbucks, with ``The Jerry Springer Show'' thrown in as a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   The movie zaps us back and forth between 1999 and 1969, but
don't worry about plot; screenwriters Myers and Michael McCullers
barely do. Instead, revel in the movie's gleeful bad taste. That
includes toilet humor involving a greasy, flatulent, kilt-wearing,
obese Scotsman (Myers in a body suit); a genital-biting battle
between Austin and Mini-Me; and a scatological shadow play that
climaxes with a gerbil joke. The gags this time out are more body
humor than boudoir. In other words, kids will love it.
</P>
<P>
   The movie doesn't always hit its targets. When Dr. Evil commands
son Scott to ``zip it,'' the ensuing shtick goes on too long. So
does his riff on '90s catch phrases (``Don't go there,
girlfriend''), which bewilders the U.S. president of 1969.
</P>
<P>
   The prez is played by Tim Robbins, one of many cameos. Willie
Nelson and Woody Harrelson also appear, lending their first names
to a riotously juvenile running gag about Dr. Evil's phallic-shaped
space shuttle. Elvis Costello and Burt Bacharach also turn up to
sing ``I'll Never Fall in Love Again.''
</P>
<P>
   These celebrity visits underscore the charm of ``The Spy Who
Shagged Me.'' It's a pop-art party where the host is happy to do
anything to keep the guests laughing _ whether that means wearing
rotten teeth and a chest pelt or running around in a bikini. Last
summer we had ``There's Something About Mary.'' This year, ``Austin
Powers'' meets our need for undiluted silliness. And best of all,
at 95 minutes, it doesn't waste any time giving us our fix. And
that, indeed, is groovy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Austin Powers: The Spy
</P>
<P>
   Who Shagged Me''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mike Myers and Heather Graham. Rated PG-13 for sexual
innuendo and crude humor. At metro theaters. 1 hour, 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: The sequel's a gas.

 &HT;    Exquisite, if you're really in the mood
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   First Thandie Newton was ``Beloved.''
</P>
<P>
   Now she's ``Besieged.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's time to move to a new letter of the alphabet.
</P>
<P>
   Made for Italian television by Oscar-winning director Bernardo
Bertolucci (``The Last Emperor''), ``Besieged'' is an art film for
the MTV Generation. Most of the story is conveyed through image and
music; in fact, the two leads don't really talk to each other until
a half hour into the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Newton plays Shandurai, a proud, beautiful African woman who has
moved to Rome after her husband was arrested by her country's
repressive government. David Thewlis plays her employer, Kinsky, a
reclusive, music-loving Englishman who has inherited a huge villa
in Rome filled with antiquities. While she mops and cooks
downstairs (no mere maid, she's also studying pre-med), he mopes
and composes upstairs. Then, out of the blue, he makes a startling
confession: He's in love with her and would do anything to earn her
love in return. Shocked, perhaps even frightened, she snaps
angrily, ``You get my husband out of
</P>
<P>
   jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Before long, the villa is becoming noticeably less stuffed with,
well, stuff. Shandurai slowly realizes Kinsky is as good as his
word. He's selling his art, his tapestries, even his beloved piano
to finance his rescue effort.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the film has a fairy-tale Beauty-and-the-Beast
quality. Kinsky may be ardent, but his eccentricity has made him
remote and unfamiliar with human contact. His gestures of love are
as strained as a schoolboy's (a love note consists of a sheet of
music with a question mark on it). A more successful gambit is the
way he begins to work African rhythms into his white European male
repertoire. Yet, while there is a culture-clash component, theirs
is not just an opposites-attract love story. Rather, the two are
surprisingly similar _ both isolated exiles, wary of, yet aching
for, connection.
</P>
<P>
   The film is full of exquisite touches, but the bottom line is,
``Besieged'' is a movie you have to be in the mood for. Otherwise,
it comes off as a bit overblown and solemn/silly. If you're not
caught up by Bertolucci's mastery of nuanced sight and sound, you
may find yourself thinking, gee, Thewlis really does look better
with a beard (as in ``Naked,'' his breakthrough film). Or wondering
about the incredibly gifted Newton, whose career is almost a case
study in the limited opportunities available to actors of color.
She's wonderful here. She's wonderful in just about everything she
does. But she's already done the smart-servant-loved-by-the-master
bit (in ``Jefferson in Paris'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Besieged'' is more bothersome than bad _ a congruence of
top-flight talent from which you somehow expect more than swooning
camera shots and operatic emotional shorthand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besieged''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Thandie Newton and David Thewlis. Directed by Bernardo
Bertolucci. Rated R for brief nudity. 1 hour, 34 minutes.

 &HT;    An unsettling, intriguing `Limbo'
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   By all rights, John Sayles' career should be in limbo. Only a
filmmaker independent to the point of near-insanity would follow a
commercial breakthrough like ``Lone Star'' with something as
doggedly uncommercial as ``Men With Guns'' (Central American
politics? Subtitles? )
</P>
<P>
   Instead, ``Limbo'' is the title of his new work, a movie that
evinces Sayles' ornery, goes-his-own-way streak in spades. It's as
if he started out to make one picture _ a tender, middle-aged
romance told against the backdrop of encroaching tourism in Alaska
_ and then got interested in something entirely different: an
unsettling metaphysical survival tale.
</P>
<P>
   The setup is Sayles at his satirical best. Welcome to Alaska,
land of azure skies, cathedral-sized icebergs and omnipresent
``floating nursing homes'' (read, cruise ships). Tourism is on a
rampage, turning the state into a giant theme park. One developer
cautions another to avoid cutting down trees along the coastline:
``Heavy machinery they can see in New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   In semi-bustling Port Henry (a thinly disguised Juneau), Joe
(David Strathairn) meets Donna (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio). He's
a former fisherman, landlocked since a fatal accident 25 years
earlier. She's a been-around lounge singer (actually, quite a good
one) with a sullenly sensitive teenage daughter (Vanessa Martinez).
</P>
<P>
   They come together tentatively, two people accustomed to the
kind of personal limbo where lives are shaped by ``unforeseen
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   The plot's unforeseen circumstance turns up as Joe's shady
half-brother (Casey Siemaszko). He needs a favor, a favor that will
take the characters _ and the film _ in an unexpected direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Limbo'' can't honestly be called a successful movie. The parts
simply don't add up to a satisfying whole. But it's always a
thematically intriguing and inherently honorable work, right down
to the true-to-its-title denouement. Sayles' pungent character
observations and knowing dialogue make it worth a look, as do the
two leads. Strathairn, a Sayles regular, has the delicate, soulful
masculinity of a latter-day Gary Cooper, while Mastrantonio invests
her character's nervous optimism with a kind of wayward courage.
</P>
<P>
   The same wayward courage, it might be said, that it takes to
make a movie like ``Limbo.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Limbo''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring David Strathairn and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio.
Directed by John Sayles. Rated R for language. 2 hours, 6 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Even a mixed-up John Sayles movie is worth a look.

   ``Besieged'' R (brief nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Thandie Newton and David Thewlis.
</P>
<P>
   An art movie for the MTV generation. Made for Italian TV, it's
about a reclusive Brit (David Thewlis) who lives in a huge villa in
Rome and his relationship with his housekeeper (Thandie Newton), a
proud African beauty who mops by day and studies pre-med by night.
Full of exquisite touches, but it can come off as overblown
emotional shorthand. B- (ERG)

   ``The Castle'' R (profanity)

<P>
   Starring Michael Caton.
</P>
<P>
   A sunny little sleeper from Australia. A cheerfully dimwitted
working-class bloke named Darryl (Michael Caton) takes on the
system when the neighboring airport decides to expand and tries to
force him and his family out of their home. It's a genial and
just-goofy-enough David-and-Goliath (Darryl-and-Goliath?) comedy
that aims to do little more than put a smile on your face. Which it
does. Handily. (ERG) 1 hour, 25 minutes. B+

   ``The Dreamlife of Angels'' R (strong sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Elodie Boucher
</P>
<P>
   and Natacha Regnier.
</P>
<P>
   A beautiful character study of two young women trying to make
sense of life in a working-class town. The film is shot with a
documentarian style that registers every nuance. Subtitles. (SM) 1

   ``Election'' R (profanity, sexuality and drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew Broderick
</P>
<P>
   and Reese Witherspoon.
</P>
<P>
   In this cruelly funny satire, high school teacher Matthew
Broderick schemes to thwart perky student Reese Witherspoon in her
bid for the student government presidency. The second feature from
``Citizen Ruth'' director Alexander Payne may sound like a bouncy
comedy. But it's really a

   ``Endurance'' G
</P>
<P>
   Starring Haile Gebrselassie.
</P>
<P>
   A peculiar but engaging blend of travelogue, docu-drama and

</P>
<P>
   A thriller with no thrills. A he/she sexual pas de deux with
little

<P>
   chemistry. Sean Connery plays Max, a dapper thief swiping
priceless works of art and computer chips. A shapely insurance
agent (Catherine Zeta-Jones) slinks into the picture and
``Entrapment'' becomes a cat-and-mouse game with lots of twists and
turns. Sadly, it's almost always a bore. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 50

   Opposites attract as strait-laced Ben Affleck heads to his

   Resist your instinct to see it. Oscar winner Anthony Hopkins
plays an anthropologist locked up in a psychiatric prison
surrounded by ``colorful'' inmates. It seems that, after living for
months with gorillas in the African wilds, he went berserk and
killed two natives. Why? It's up to a psychiatry student (Oscar

<P>
   A charming fable about the growing bond between a street
performer and his adopted child. It's also a good treatise on the
treatment of females in 1930s China. Though it suffers some lapses
of sentimentality and melodrama, it's held together by its
emotional core. In Mandarin with subtitles. (SM) 1 hour, 35

<P>
   Independent filmmaker John Sayles is at his most
independent-minded in this intriguing and inherently honorable
movie whose parts don't add up to a satisfying whole. It's as if he
set out to make one film _ a tender, middle-aged romance told
against the backdrop of encroaching tourism in Alaska _ and then
got interested in something totally different: an unsettling
metaphysical survival tale. (ERG) At Lefont Plaza. 2 hours, 6

</P>
<P>
   Not lovable, but generally likable. An anonymous love letter
circulates among the residents of a small New England town setting
off rendezvous, revelations and romantic misunderstandings. The
film has two problems: It flirts with a serious case of the cutes

quite takes over her own star vehicle. Still, it has enough charm
to keep you interested. (ERG) 1 hour, 29 minutes. B-

   A knockout sci-fi flick. Writer-directors Andy and Larry
Wachowski bring their sharp storytelling and visual showmanship to
an adventure starring Keanu Reeves that should please comic book
fanatics and mainstream moviegoers. Balancing intelligence with
stunning special effects and action, it's a movie that earns its

   Drew Barrymore is Josie Geller, a newspaper copy editor in her
mid-20s and former high school dweeb (``Josie Grossie,'' they
called her) who goes back to teenville as an undercover reporter,
promptly relives high school hell and pretty much bumbles her way

   Deeply satisfying tale of West Virginia teenager Homer (Jake

shoot off model rockets. Their goal: to win a science fair, which
could help them escape a future of working in the coal mine of

   Aspiring filmmakers might love ``Running Time,'' a 70-minute,
black-and-white crime caper flick. It's composed of several long

HIGH COURT VOIDS CHICAGO LOITERING LAW AIMED AT GANGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Chicago's anti-loitering law, which other cities
looked to as a model for reclaiming the streets in gang-infested
neighborhoods, was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court
on Thursday on the grounds that it gave police too much discretion
to target innocent people. The vote was 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago police arrested more than 42,000 people under the law
during the three years it was in effect, from 1992 to 1995, when it
was struck down by a state appellate court. The law made it a crime
to ``remain in any one place with no apparent purpose'' in the
presence of a suspected gang member when ordered by a police
officer to move on.
</P>
<P>
   In his opinion for the court Thursday, Justice John Paul Stevens
focused on the absence of adequate guidance to police officers.
Under the law, he said, ``it matters not whether the reason that a
gang member and his father, for example, might loiter near Wrigley
Field is to rob an unsuspecting fan or just to get a glimpse of
Sammy Sosa leaving the ball park.''
</P>
<P>
   In either case, he said, as long as their purpose was ``not
apparent'' in a police officer's ``inherently subjective''
judgment, the pair were subject to arrest for refusing the
officer's order to disperse. And by the same token, Stevens said,
``the entire ordinance fails to give the ordinary citizen adequate
notice of what is forbidden and what is permitted.''
</P>
<P>
   The opinion suggested that Chicago could repair the law's
unconstitutional vagueness by defining the prohibited behavior more
precisely or by limiting the law's scope. Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor, in a concurring opinion that Justice Stephen G. Breyer
also signed, made this point more explicitly, asserting that
``there remain open to Chicago reasonable alternatives to combat
the very real threat posed by gang intimidation and violence.''
Among the two justices' suggestions were requiring that loiterers
have some ``harmful purpose'' before they could be arrested, or
targeting only gang members themselves rather than people who are
simply standing nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The law was challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union's
Chicago office on behalf of 66 defendants, 34 of whom were not
alleged to be gang members themselves when they were arrested and
prosecuted. After the Illinois Supreme Court declared the law
unconstitutional, in a 1997 ruling that affirmed an earlier
decision by the Illinois Appellate Court, the city brought the case
to the U.S. Supreme Court. Thirty-one states, along with the
Clinton administration, filed briefs supporting Chicago's appeal,
Chicago vs. Morales, No. 97-1121.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, Mayor Richard M. Daley said Thursday morning that
the city would try to draft a new ordinance to overcome the court's
objections. But Harvey Grossman, an ACLU lawyer who argued the case
for the defendants, said in an interview that he doubted whether a
law aimed at sweeping gang members off the streets could be both
effective and constitutional. Grossman said that while a law that
prohibited loitering when coupled with specific conduct, like
loitering to commit prostitution or to sell drugs, would be
unobjectionable, such a law would require the very proof of
individualized wrongdoing that the Chicago law sought to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago City Council adopted the law in 1992 after witnesses
testified at public hearings that street gangs, using loitering as
a strategy to claim territory, were taking over neighborhoods and
terrifying the residents.
</P>
<P>
   However measured the majority's approach Thursday, it provoked a
stinging dissent from Justice Antonin Scalia, who attacked the
majority's analytic method as well as its conclusion. Sarcastically
accusing the court of endorsing a ``Fundamental Freedom to
Loiter,'' he said it should not be the court's concern whether the
law covered ``too much harmless conduct by innocent citizens''
because ``in our democratic system, how much harmless conduct to
proscribe is not a judgment to be made by the courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from the bench Thursday, at times reading from a
written summary of his dissent and at time extemporizing, Scalia
said emphatically that if he lived in a gang-infested area, ``I
would trade my right to loiter in the vicinity of a gang member in
return for the liberation of my neighborhood in an instant.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Clarence Thomas dissented as well, in an opinion that
Scalia and Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist also signed. Thomas
and Rehnquist did not, however, add their names to Scalia's
opinion. Whether his tone was too strong for them or whether they
simply had different points to make was not clear.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' dissenting opinion emphasized the historical pedigree
for the ``well-established principle that the police have the duty
and the power to maintain the public peace and, when necessary, to
disperse groups of individuals who threaten it.''
</P>
<P>
   His opinion also included some pointed language. ``By
invalidating Chicago's ordinance, I fear that the court has
unnecessarily sentenced law-abiding citizens to lives of terror and
misery,'' Thomas said, adding that the court had the luxury of
focusing on the `` `right' of gang members and their companions''
because ``the people who will have to live with the consequences of
today's opinion do not live in our neighborhoods.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago defended its law on both pragmatic and analytic grounds,
offering statistics to show that while the gang-related homicide
rate fell by 26 percent in 1995, the last year the law was in
effect, the rate climbed by 11 percent during the year following
the law's invalidation. However, Stevens, noting that the homicide
rate then went back down, by 19 percent, the next year, said it was
difficult to evaluate these statistics ``or to reach any firm
conclusion about the ordinance's efficacy.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On analytic grounds, Chicago argued that there was nothing at
all vague about the requirement to obey a police officer's order to
move on. Thomas agreed with this argument. ``There is nothing
`vague' about an order to disperse,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the majority found this argument insufficient. ``That the
ordinance does not permit an arrest until after a dispersal order
has been disobeyed does not provide any guidance to the officer
deciding whether such an order should issue,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   The majority opinion emphasized the law's ability to put
innocent people unknowingly at risk. ``Friends, relatives,
teachers, counselors, or even total strangers might unwittingly
engage in forbidden loitering if they happen to engage in idle
conversation with a gang member,'' Justice Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   Further, he added, the law had the ``perverse consequences'' of
not applying at all to the most dangerous type of gang-relating
loitering, that for which the purpose is apparent, such as to
visibly dominate a territory or to deal in drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The case was argued more than six months ago, and the combined
opinions, totaling 79 pages, bore the earmarks of institutional
struggle. While Stevens, joined by Justices David H. Souter, Ruth
Bader Ginsburg, and Anthony M. Kennedy along with O'Connor and
Breyer, spoke for a majority of the court on the vagueness issue,
that was not the case on the separate issue of how to evaluate the
underlying constitutional right that was at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Only Souter and Ginsburg subscribed to Stevens' view that ``it
is apparent that an individual's decision to remain in a public
place of his choice'' is an aspect of personal liberty protected by
the 14th amendment's due process guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia, in his dissenting opinion, aimed so much of his ire at
what was only a few paragraphs of due-process analysis in Stevens'
opinion as to suggest that the analysis might have had a more
prominent place in an earlier draft.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the court's stolid tone Thursday differed notably
from the approach the justices took nearly 30 years ago, when a
series of decisions struck down an earlier generation of vagrancy
laws that cities in the South had been applying in a racially
discriminatory manner. Papachristou vs. City of Jacksonville, a
1972 opinion by Justice William O. Douglas, was essentially a paean
to nonconformity and to the lure of the open road as extolled by
Henry David Thoreau, Walt Whitman, and Vachel Lindsay.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas spoke admiringly in his unanimous opinion of ``lives of
high spirits rather than hushed, suffocating silence.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, attempting to hold a majority on a much different
court, cited the Papachristou opinion Thursday, but only as a ``see
also,'' in passing.

   WASHINGTON _ There has never been an air campaign quite like it.
</P>
<P>
   Over 78 days, NATO warplanes flew 35,000 sorties, dropped 23,000
bombs, destroyed 1,500 targets and shattered the backbone of a
central European military force, all without losing a single U.S.
or allied pilot in combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is an extraordinary achievement in the history of air
warfare, to be sure,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen said
Thursday. Just hours earlier, NATO suspended its attacks against
Yugoslav military forces as they retreated from Kosovo, winding up
what Cohen called ``the most precise application of air power in
history.''
</P>
<P>
   For all of its high-tech weaponry and success, the air campaign
was dogged by two of the oldest variables in the history of battle:
weather and terrain.
</P>
<P>
   During the early weeks of the air war, there were nights when
more than half of NATO's strike planes were forced to return to
base without dropping their bombs, because heavy cloud cover or fog
prevented them from using their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks after that, Serbs were able to hunker down inside
Kosovo, hiding tanks and heavy weaponry inside barns, alongside
churches or beneath foliage, frustrating NATO pilots. In several
instances, the strategy appears to have resulted in strikes that
caused civilian deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the campaign settle the argument over whether air power
alone can win a war without the use of ground troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't end the debate,'' said former Pentagon official
David Ochmanek, an expert on air power for RAND, a research
organization based in Santa Monica, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   That's because NATO pilots had little success finding and
destroying concentrated groups of Serb troops in the field until
the last two weeks of the campaign, when Kosovo Liberation Army
rebels on the ground were able to force their opponents to mass and
move out into the open for battle.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign did go further than any other in history, Ochmanek
said, in demonstrating the extent to which modern air power can
isolate and grind away at a military force dispersed in the field _
to prepare the battlefield, in other words, for the successful
deployment of ground forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Air power was able to substantially place at risk the Yugoslav
army in Kosovo, and that, to me, was always the key to this,'' said
Ochmanek, who served as assistant secretary of defense for strategy
during the first two years of the Clinton presidency. ``The
viability of our strategy turned on being able to create in Kosovo
the conditions under which a ground force could be mounted.''
</P>
<P>
   Twice in six months, U.S. Air Force and Navy pilots have
spearheaded bombing campaigns aimed at bringing intransigent
leaders to heel over issues the White House has defined as
important, if not vital, American interests.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day Desert Fox campaign last December used high-tech
air strikes to both punish Iraqi President Saddam Hussein for
impeding United Nations weapons inspections and to set back his
efforts to build or store weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Allied Force, the NATO campaign that was suspended
Thursday, coerced Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, president of
Yugoslavia, to begin pulling 40,000 troops and police out of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   If the campaigns demonstrated the might of American air power,
though, they have also underscored its limits.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein and Milosevic may have paid a price for their conduct,
but they both remain in office, where they could well outlast their
antagonist, President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The outside world knows little about Hussein's weapons program
now, or about the extent to which December's bombings set those
efforts back.
</P>
<P>
   And the success of Operation Allied Force will forever be marred
by its tragic inability to stop the commission of atrocities on the
ground by Serb troops, police and paramilitary thugs that forced an
estimated 1.5 million ethnic Albanians to flee their homes in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   In both Desert Fox and Allied Force, U.S. pilots relied heavily
on technologies and tactics that have advanced greatly in the
decade since the Gulf War ushered in the dawn of precision air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon didn't give the percentage of NATO bombs that
struck their targets during the 11-week campaign. Preliminary
battle damage assessments, however, suggest that the ratio will
prove to be unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   Of an estimated 23,000 bombs dropped, Cohen said the Pentagon
has confirmed just 20 instances in which munitions missed their
targets and caused unintended civilian deaths or destruction.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the only measure of misses. The Pentagon has shown
footage of some bombs falling wide of the mark into forests or
fields, and even some instances in which pilots diverted bombs at
the last minute to avert the possibility of civilian deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav government, moreover, claims that some 1,500
civilians were killed by NATO strikes and four times as many others
were wounded. While that number is impossible to refute or confirm
with confidence, it would, if true, imply far more misses than the
Pentagon has admitted.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Without question, though, a large number of NATO's bombs landed
within a few feet of the bull's eye.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes destroyed or damaged beyond use roughly 500 fixed
targets _ refineries, airfields, military headquarters, ammunition
dumps, troop barracks, radio and television facilities among them.
Many of those required dozens of bombs to destroy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Pentagon claimed Thursday that the strikes
destroyed or left inoperable 800 tanks, armored personnel carriers,
artillery pieces or mortars in the field in Kosovo, not to mention
scores of military trucks and cars and more than 200 military
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The effectiveness stemmed from a combination of new technologies
and evolving tactics employed on a scale never before seen in
combat.
</P>
<P>
   To minimize the threat from the several hundred surface-to-air
missiles fired at them, NATO pilots flew high _ at altitudes
topping 15,000 feet during the first several weeks of the campaign
_ and dropped bombs that used lasers, satellite signals and
infra-red sensors to help direct them to targets several miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a revolution,'' said Ochmanek. ``Back in the 70s and
80s we were all about going low and going fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The high-altitude strikes helped protect pilots. Two U.S.
warplanes _ an F-16 and an F-117 stealth fighter _ were lost during
the campaign, but the pilots of both were rescued by NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
   Critics allege, however, that reducing the risk to pilots
increased the threat to civilians on the ground: both from Serb
forces and from errant NATO bombs.

JUSTICES STRIKE DOWN CHICAGO ORDINANCE AIMED AT GANGS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A divided Supreme Court on Thursday limited the
ways in which cities can fight the scourge of gang violence,
striking down as unconstitutional a Chicago ordinance that allowed
police to disperse people congregating on street corners with a
suspected gang member.
</P>
<P>
   In a 6-3 decision, the high court said the city's Gang
Congregation Ordinance violated the constitution's requirement that
criminal laws be clear. The justices assailed the Chicago statute
as vague, saying it gave police unbridled authority to order
loiterers to separate while providing city dwellers with no warning
of what behavior would constitute an illegal act.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago enacted the controversial ordinance in 1992 amid
outcries from city residents who said the presence of neighborhood
gangs had made them terrified to leave their homes. Police issued
more than 89,000 dispersal orders and arrested more than 42,000
people between August 1992 and December 1995, when an Illinois
court ruled the law unconstitutional, according to testimony in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union, which brought the case on
behalf of people arrested under the law, praised the court's
decision in Chicago vs. Morales. The ACLU said the law hit minority
youngsters especially hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are grateful that the justices of the Supreme Court
understand what escaped the political leaders of Chicago: namely,
that it is not a criminal activity simply to be a young man of
color gathered with friends on the streets of Chicago,'' said
Harvey Grossman, legal director of the ACLU of Illinois, who argued
the case before the high court. ``The Chicago ordinance is, sadly,
exemplary of what happens when politicians seek to appear tough on
crime, ignoring the basic rights of individual citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston criminal defense attorney Edward Mallett also hailed the
decision as providing ``great comfort to the American people'' that
they can peacefully assemble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we might be upset that such laws can find a majority
in city councils,'' added Mallett, a senior vice president of the
National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. ``We have no such
laws in Texas that I'm aware of.''
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Ruda, a Washington attorney who represents states
and municipalities, said the high court's decision preserves the
ability of cities to enact valid anti-gang ordinances so long as
the laws are more narrowly written to address gang violence. He
noted that, in this case, many justices wrote separate opinions
that either supported the Chicago ordinance or advised the city to
narrow its law.
</P>
<P>
   Under the ordinance, people who failed to comply with an
officer's order to disperse were jailed for up to six months, fined
$500 and ordered to perform up to 120 hours of community service.
The law defined a loiterer as a person standing with a suspected
gang member ``in any one place with no apparent purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court's majority,
said that ambiguous definition made potential criminals out of
innocent people who had no way of knowing that they were doing
anything illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to imagine how any citizen of the city of
Chicago standing in a public place with a group of people would
know if he or she had an `apparent purpose,''' Stevens wrote. ``If
she were talking to another person, would she have an apparent
purpose? If she were checking her watch and looking expectantly
down the street would she have an apparent purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens also expressed disdain for the law in saying that it
could have made criminals out of Chicago Cubs fans who were merely
standing together outside Wrigley Field to catch a glimpse of
slugger Sammy Sosa. Joining Stevens' opinion were justices Sandra
Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader
Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting Justice Antonin Scalia took the unusual and highly
symbolic step of reading portions of his dissent from the bench, a
move reserved by justices who have the most profound disagreement
with the Court. Scalia, agreeing with arguments made by attorneys
for Chicago, said the city's ordinance was a constitutionally
reasonable method to keep thugs off residential streets.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia acknowledged that the ordinance imposed ``minor
limitations'' on the right of innocent people to congregate but
called the restriction ``a small price to pay for liberation of
their streets.'' He equated the anti-loitering ordinance to traffic
laws that restrict the freedom of people to drive fast but are not
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``The citizens of Chicago have decided that depriving themselves
of the freedom to `hang out' with a gang member is necessary to
eliminate pervasive gang crime and intimidation _ and that the
elimination of the one is worth the deprivation of the other, ''
Scalia wrote. ``This court has no business second-guessing either
the degree of necessity or the fairness of the trade (off).''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas assailed the
court for striking down what he called the city's reasonable and
legitimate effort to keep its streets safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``By invalidating Chicago's ordinance, I fear that the court has
unnecessarily sentenced law-abiding citizens to lives of terror and
misery,'' Thomas wrote. ``Gangs fill the daily lives of many of our
poorest and most vulnerable citizens with a terror that the court
does not give sufficient consideration, often relegating them to
the status of prisoners in their own homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Scalia and Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist joined Thomas'
dissent.

 &HT;    Baptists to show faith in evangelism
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If the doorbell rings this weekend when you're not
expecting company, chances are it's a Southern Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 Southern Baptist churches in metro Atlanta will be
coordinating door-to-door canvassing Saturday through Wednesday as
part of an evangelism effort linked to the Southern Baptist
Convention meeting here next week.
</P>
<P>
   Some 700 teen-agers from across the country, known as
Frontliners, will participate, as will about 140 college and
university students. As many as 1,000 people will come in early for
the Southern Baptist Convention, which convenes Tuesday at the
Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate knocking on 50,000 doors through the metro
area,'' said Don Smith, associate for event evangelism for the
North American Mission Board of the 15 million-member Southern
Baptist Convention. Baptists will be visiting houses from Douglas
to Gwinnett and Forsyth to Henry counties asking questions about
church participation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, about 20 churches are hosting block parties for
their communities. Musicians, puppeteers and magicians will perform
on the streets in inner-city neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Teens from Peachtree City's Braelinn Baptist Churchwill wash
cars for free.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Bible times, one way to serve was to wash people's feet,''
said the Rev. Barry Odom, the church's community pastor. ``We're
going to wash people's cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Erica Snelling, 18, will be out with the sponges and hoses. ``We
use practical ways to help out the community,'' she said. ``People
respond more to God's love when they see actions behind it and it's
not just words.''
</P>
<P>
   To put some large-scale action behind their evangelism, the
Baptists are hosting two mega-parties Saturday at Centennial
Olympic Park, one for families and one geared to teens.

 &HT;    Baptists to show faith in evangelism
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If the doorbell rings this weekend when you're not
expecting company, chances are it's a Southern Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 Southern Baptist churches in metro Atlanta will be
coordinating door-to-door canvassing Saturday through Wednesday as
part of an evangelism effort linked to the Southern Baptist
Convention meeting here next week.
</P>
<P>
   Some 700 teen-agers from across the country, known as
Frontliners, will participate, as will about 140 college and
university students. As many as 1,000 people will come in early for
the Southern Baptist Convention, which convenes Tuesday at the
Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate knocking on 50,000 doors through the metro
area,'' said Don Smith, associate for event evangelism for the
North American Mission Board of the 15 million-member Southern
Baptist Convention. Baptists will be visiting houses from Douglas
to Gwinnett and Forsyth to Henry counties asking questions about
church participation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, about 20 churches are hosting block parties for
their communities. Musicians, puppeteers and magicians will perform
on the streets in inner-city neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Teens from Peachtree City's Braelinn Baptist Churchwill wash
cars for free.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Bible times, one way to serve was to wash people's feet,''
said the Rev. Barry Odom, the church's community pastor. ``We're
going to wash people's cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Erica Snelling, 18, will be out with the sponges and hoses. ``We
use practical ways to help out the community,'' she said. ``People
respond more to God's love when they see actions behind it and it's
not just words.''
</P>
<P>
   To put some large-scale action behind their evangelism, the
Baptists are hosting two mega-parties Saturday at Centennial
Olympic Park, one for families and one geared to teens.
</P>
<P>
   Family Fest '99 is a free carnival with rides, games, mimes,
magicians and stage shows taking place from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. at
the park. At 7:30 p.m. youth are invited to the ``Gettin' Free''

 &HT;    The E. coli outbreak: One year later
 &HT;    By Virginia Anderson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Jordan Shook's long, yellow hair bounces like holiday
curling ribbons down her back, just as it did last June.
</P>
<P>
   Her little-girl teeth are white and straight, even if the tooth
fairy has claimed one. And when Jordan smiles at her mommy, it
still melts Judy Shook's heart.
</P>
<P>
   But the real trick is to even get a look at Jordan today, almost
a year after she contracted E. coli last June 12 at White Water
Park in Cobb County. The outbreak sickened 25 other children,
killing 2 1/2-year-old McCall Akin in July.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, now 5, spends most of her time in hiding in her pink
bedroom in Cartersville, or in doctors' offices hiding from nurses
and others who would stick her with a needle. She is scared of most
people, especially men, after having seen 62 doctors, mostly male,
and countless nurses and technicians.
</P>
<P>
   The once outgoing child uses her long hair as a veil to hide
from visitors. She darts out of her bedroom into the living room
only once every few minutes, then just as quickly runs back inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just say the word E. coli, and it makes me sick,'' Judy
Shook said as she talked about the effect of the infection on
Jordan and the other children. ``I feel like some of her innocence
has been taken away so senselessly.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is the sickest surviving child of last summer's outbreak
of E. coli 0157:H7, a deadly bacteria that health officials believe
was transmitted when an infected child visited a children's wading
pool at White Water Park. The germ can cause severe diarrhea in
mild cases, but some children get much sicker and, like Jordan,
develop a life-threatening kidney and blood disorder called
hemolytic uremic syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's parents, James and Judy Shook, said they feel blessed
for her life, despite the challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to hold her and kiss her all the time and tell her
how much I love her,'' Judy Shook said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan may never get a clean bill of health. The Shooks are
uncertain whether their only child can go to kindergarten in the
fall. They feel happy when Jordan will agree to go to a church ice
cream social.
</P>
<P>
   As for Jordan's ever swimming again, Judy decided to hide a
sprinkler she bought for the garden hose; she had hoped to use it
to reintroduce Jordan to a bathing suit and water, but then decided
the child wasn't ready.
</P>
<P>
   After suffering a stroke and seizures, undergoing dialysis,
physical therapy, occupational therapy and having been poked and
probed over nearly her entire body, Jordan is afraid someone will
hurt her. She also is afraid she's going to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``She can get real emotional,'' said her mother. ``And it's
hard. You see her little mouth pucker up and she says, `Am I going
to die, Mommy?'''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan undergoes occupational therapy once a week and physical
therapy once a month. She has regained most of the use of her left
side, which had been partly paralyzed from the stroke. She is not
on any medications.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors as far away as Dallas and Seattle have examined her and
are studying the functioning of her kidneys, brain and nervous
system for a prognosis, which the Shooks hope to receive next week.
</P>
<P>
   Of equal concern now is Jordan's emotional well-being, her
mother said. The Shooks and Jordan's doctors don't know how much of
her fear may be due to brain injury or from trauma.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you first come home, you think your life is going to be
normal,'' Judy said. ``And then you realize `normal' won't be in
your vocabulary anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   When visitors stayed for a few hours at her Cartersville home
last week, Jordan asked three times, ``Mommy, I'm not going to have
to have any more blood tests, am I?'''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan spent 52 days in Scottish Rite Children's Medical Center
last summer. She underwent dialysis for almost two weeks. When she
was released from the hospital, she received daily physical therapy
for months. By winter, the therapy became weekly.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors called Jordan a miracle because of her recovery. She
was nearly as sick as McCall Akin.
</P>
<P>
   Andy and Marisa Akin, McCall's parents, stayed fast by her
bedside, just as the Shooks did with Jordan. For days and nights
that seemed endless, both couples watched their little girls go
downhill, hooked up to machines and spliced with wires and tubes to
keep them tethered to life.
</P>
<P>
   They camped out in the waiting room of Scottish Rite's intensive
care unit, often unable to sleep or shower for fear they would miss
a moment of their daughters' lives, or miss being there when their
daughters needed them.
</P>
<P>
   Last July 22, doctors took McCall off life support machines. She
died that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Shook said she will never forget Marisa Akin's coming into
Jordan's room to give McCall's balloons to Jordan before she left
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just stood there and said, `You are so lucky.' And I will
never forget that. Marisa will never have the chance to be with her
little girl ever again.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall's death has been one of the hardest things to talk to
Jordan about, Judy Shook said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell her that they just got a nasty germ, and that God
decided it was time for the other little girl to come home to
heaven. And she tells me, `I'm glad that God wasn't ready for me to
go, cause I want to stay with my mommy and daddy.

 &HT;    Attorney wages war for E. coli victims
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Bill Marler frantically searched for his young
daughter in the grocery store. One minute they were looking at
watermelons together, and the next moment she had disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Then he heard Morgan's loud little-girl voice, near a juice
display. Hands on hips, she stood yelling at a startled shopper.
``Don't buy this stuff! It almost killed my friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the life of Bill Marler of Seattle, who has emerged as
the nation's esquire of E. coli plaintiff litigation. The lawyer _
described as a compassionate advocate by clients and as egotistical
and arrogant by corporations he has sued _ is representing four of
the seven children most seriously sickened in the E. coli outbreak
at White Water Park in Cobb County last summer.
</P>
<P>
   In the past five years, Marler's caseload of clients sickened or
killed by E. coli 0157:H7 has pitted him against the Jack in the
Box hamburger chain, McDonald's, Odwalla juice company and Costco.
All the companies settled out of court, for sums ranging from
$500,000 to $15.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Marler's next foe is White Water, where 26 children were
infected with the bacteria. The seven who required hospitalization
developed hemolytic uremic syndrome, a kidney and blood disorder
caused by E. coli O157:H7. One child, 2 1/2-year-old McCall Akin,
died.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Marler has filed lawsuits against White Water on behalf
of the families of Jordan Shook, 5, of Cartersville; Summer
Kirkland, 4, of Duluth; Matthew Addison, 4, of Louisville, Ky.; and
Erin Gray, 7, of Cartersville. Atlanta Braves shortstop Walt Weiss,
whose 4-year-old son, Brody, was sickened in the outbreak, is
talking with Marler. The White Water cases may be protracted.
Marler says that White Water's attitude seemed to shift when it
took its longtime attorney, Thomas Carlock, off the case and hired
lawyer Billy Gunn earlier this year. ``Ever since then the entire
approach has become much more cantankerous and adversarial,''
Marler said.
</P>
<P>
   Gunn says it's Marler who is being unreasonable and unwilling to
start mediation.
</P>
<P>
   ``His settlement demands have been shocking,'' Gunn said.
``Attorneys representing other families have made very different
demands. We have been engaged in conversation with other people who
have filed suit and others who have not, because they are
optimistic we can resolve these cases.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, three cases _ including the Akin family's _ have been
settled but may not be discussed under a confidentiality agreement
with White Water. White Water, opened in 1984 by the privately held
family firm Silver Dollar, recently was sold to Premier Parks,
owner of Six Flags Over Georgia. But the sale will not affect the
E. coli claims against the water park because settlements are paid
by the park's insurer, AIG, one of the world's largest corporate
insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Gunn, who is with the Atlanta law firm Long Weinberg Ansley &AMP;
Wheeler, argues that White Water is not negligent because it did
not introduce the dangerous bacteria into the park. Health
investigators have speculated that a child infected with E. coli
may have defecated in a wading pool at White Water and that other
children fell ill after ingesting pool water contaminated with the
fecal bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a legal distinction between selling food that is
contaminated and operating a water park where someone else
introduces and transmits E. coli,'' Gunn said. ``I don't know if it
was a baby in diapers or a 4-year-old. You can have fecal matter
that's invisible to the eye, so how it spread is an unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   Gunn said transmission in the water is an assumption and not a
proven fact. Inspection records have indicated that chlorine levels
in the pool were well below the Cobb County health standard on the
days when the contamination is thought to have occurred. But Gunn
maintained that, even at the levels recorded on the days in
question, chlorine levels were high enough to kill the bacteria.
``At the lowest levels ever documented, the chlorine still kills E.
coli,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marler disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is White Water did not have adequate chlorine in a
pool it designed specifically for toddlers,'' Marler said. ``It did
not properly monitor diaper-changing areas near the pool and in the
bathrooms. All these things led to this disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   A personal injury lawyer, Marler's career took a turn toward
food poisoning in February 1993, after he met with Suzanne Kiner at
Seattle Children's Regional Medical Center. Kiner's 9-year-old
daughter, Brianne, had almost died in an E. coli outbreak that was
tied to tainted Jack in the Box hamburgers. She lapsed into a coma
and stayed in the hospital for six months. ``I was looking for a
young, hungry lion,'' Suzanne Kiner recalls of her criterion for
selecting someone to charge into the then-unchartered legal terrain
of E. coli poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   But Marler hardly roared. He whimpered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brianne had been out of her coma maybe one and half weeks and
she was just this little, tiny, very sick little girl,'' Marler
recalls. ``From her liver failure her skin had this unnatural
brownish tone, and there were tubes in her everywhere. ... Then she
made this strange sound, moaning and talking to her mom. It just
shook me, and I backed out of the room and I started crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I thought, `Great, that's a real good way to impress your
client, have her see what a tough trial lawyer you are. But my own
daughter was 1 at that time, and I just couldn't help thinking it
could have just as easily been my kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, it seems, whenever and wherever there is an outbreak of
food-borne illness, there is Bill Marler. He doesn't solicit
victims _ that's unethical. He does, however, manage to get his
name out there to the families involved. Sometimes he calls the
local media to offer his knowledge and opinion; sometimes, families
of victims of past outbreaks call parents caught in the newest one
and mention his name.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, Marler just happened to be in Atlanta, attending the
annual convention of the International Food Technologists, when he
heard about the local E. coli cases on his hotel television news.
He quickly called the news station to offer his take on the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks later he was back in Atlanta, conferring in hospital
hallways with families reeling from the bacterial assault on their
children. He was at Scottish Rite Children's Medical Center when
McCall Akin died there.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Marler severed ties with his old law firm and set out
with three new partners to specialize in food poisoning. He also
started a consulting business, OutBreak Inc., to further educate
food companies and chain restaurants about how to prevent food
poisoning. He says those clients pay only travel expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Marler's high visibility and aggressiveness lead some to
question his tactics. Kenton Brine, an insurance industry lobbyist
in Olympia, Wash., has called Marler's approach to finding clients
``ambulance chasing.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who've come up against him in E. coli cases say he's now
making money on both sides of the aisle, from distraught familes
and fearful food distributors. In a Wall Street Journal article
last year, Odwalla juice company spokesman Chris Gallagher said,
``My guess is that Mr. Marler's new enterprise will be extremely
profitable for him _ both politically and financially.'' Gallagher
has since left the company, and officials there declined comment
for this article.
</P>
<P>
   During his lectures to companies, Marler includes a videotape
showing Brianne Kiner's grisly battle with E. coli, which resulted
in the removal of her intestines, kidney failure, a coma and
seizures. Marler won $15.6 million for her family.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could happen to your company,'' he likes to warn his
audience, ``and I could be coming to your office, subpoenaing you,
taking your documents and making your life miserable.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Clark used to roll his eyes at Marler's in-your-face style
when he sat across from him as the lead defense attorney for Jack
in the Box. Now Clark and Denis Stearns, who also defended Jack in
the Box, are legal partners with Marler. He wooed them over after
admiring their knowledge of food-borne pathogens.
</P>
<P>
   ``He truly does believe in what he's doing,'' says Stearns.
``When I was up against him at Jack in the Box, he was a zealous
advocate for the families. ... E. coli is a horrible, horrible
bacteria. It decimates families and causes lifelong disabilities.
That has radicalized him and made him into a fighter.

 &HT;    Georgia lottery sales soon may set record
 &HT;    By Peter Mantius
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Georgia Lottery Corp. could soon achieve a
national record with sixth straight years of revenue growth,
surpassing the $2 billion mark in annual ticket sales with help
from a successful new instant ticket game.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the lottery's contribution to state education is
expected to soar above $640 million for the fiscal year ending June
30 from $555 million a year ago, lottery CEO Rebecca Paul said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The strong performance comes after many state officials had
assumed the lottery had reached its peak _ even before competing
lotteries open next door in Alabama and South Carolina. A year ago,
Georgia ticket sales were virtually flat and lottery contributions
to the state fell slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were concerned,'' said Rep. Newt Hudson (D-Rochelle),
chairman of the House Industry Committee that oversees the lottery.
``That's why I'm so pleased with this rebound.''
</P>
<P>
   After selling $1.74 billion in tickets last year, Paul said, the
lottery will sell $2 billion for the year ending June 30 ``unless
the sky falls.'' Paul said Georgia and Texas were the only U.S.
lotteries that achieved rising sales during their first five years.
Texas slumped in year six.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's sales have grown this year because of The Big Game,
Cash 3 and a popular new star: the $2 instant ticket game Jumbo
Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   With annual sales approaching $300 million, Jumbo Bucks is the
most popular instant game ever in Georgia because prizes total 69.9
percent of ticket prices. On average, lottery games pay back about
53 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Paul said the Jumbo Bucks payout is supplemented with money from
the lottery's unclaimed prize fund, which amounts to about $25
million a year. The game started in 1995 but was discontinued
briefly before taking off this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has gained a great deal of momentum in the last six to
eight months,'' Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its high payout ratio and popularity with players,
Jumbo Bucks may jeopardize the lottery's ability to return 35
percent of all ticket sales to the state for education. State law
requires that return to be ``as near as practical'' to 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time last year, the lottery dipped below 35
percent to 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Lottery Chairman Wyck Knox attributed the failure to
unusually high payouts on Cash 3, the lottery's most popular
fixed-odds game. Cash 3 payouts have continued to run higher than
expected this year, but Paul and Knox said it was too early to tell
whether the lottery would reach the 35 percent standard this year.
</P>
<P>
   Knox said he was less concerned about achieving a 35 percent
payout than with maximizing dollars paid to the state.
</P>
<P>
   Most lottery employees receive bonuses based on lottery sales,
but Paul and a few senior officials receive bonuses tied to
payments to the state.
</P>
<P>
   Knox said Paul's base pay was raised to $200,000 earlier this
year. ``Of course, our board will want to reward her for an
excellent year,'' he said.

 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aspiring filmmakers might love ``Running Time,'' a 70-minute,
black-and-white crime caper flick. It's composed of several long
takes that create the illusion that the movie is unfolding in a
single camera shot. It's a cool experiment. But as a movie _ you
know, something that gives you interesting characters, sharp
dialogue, plausibility and thrills _ it tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Campbell plays a bank robber leaving jail after five years
and then immediately jumping into another heist with some pals.
Things don't go as planned, resulting in some shootouts, chases and
an unexpected reunion with Campbell's high school girlfriend (Anita
Barone), now a hooker.
</P>
<P>
   That the yuppieish Campbell and the powder-puffy Barone don't
remotely seem like a crook or a hooker is only one distraction in
``Running Time.'' It doesn't help that writer-director Josh Becker
wants us to believe Campbell and Barone don't recognize each other,
even when they're face to face having quickie sex in the brightly
lit back of a truck. The movie's worst fumble is the long robbery
scene, which has Campbell and his main partner in crime (Jeremy
Roberts) wearing surgical masks that barely hide their faces,
shouting incriminating details about each other in a roomful of
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Becker obviously took a lot of time to figure out the
photographic logistics for his flick. Too bad he didn't take the
same amount of time writing a believable script. Or hiring someone
else to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running Time''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bruce Campbell. Unrated, but contains profanity,
bloodshed and discreet simulated sex.
</P>
<P>
   One hour, 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A fun filmmaking stunt, but not much of a movie.
</P>

   `Elephant' plus IMAX equals BIG
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   If you like your elephants big, how about five stories tall?
``Africa's Elephant Kingdom,'' the new IMAX film at Fernbank Museum
of Natural History, delivers some eye-poppingly large pachyderms.
When one of these angry mamas comes charging at the screen to
protect her territory, don't be surprised if you feel like ducking
under your seat.
</P>
<P>
   The first IMAX movie from Discovery Channel Pictures,
``Kingdom'' follows a family of elephants as they survive drought
in Kenya. The flick is narrated by Avery Brooks, who plays the role
of a male ``bull.'' This viewpoint takes some getting used to, and
it never works especially well.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, it doesn't get in the way of the movie's mixture of
facts and spectacle. We learn that elephant clans are matriarchal.
The bulls tend to be loners who come around only when the mating
itch hits them.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike ``Everest,'' the pinnacle of IMAX movies, ``Africa's
Elephant Kingdom'' isn't visually astounding. But it has its share
of lovely images, including a massive storm whirling across the
plain. It strikes a pleasant balance: a film that's informative for
young people but won't have grown-ups looking at their watches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Africa's Elephant Kingdom''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   An IMAX film. Unrated. 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: An informative and lovely visit with pachyderms.

ROLE OF RUSSIAN TROOPS REMAINS AN OBSTACLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Western nations are considering new command
arrangements to ease Russia's concerns about participating into a
NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo, allied officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   With allied peacekeepers poised to enter Kosovo, the role of
Russian troops has emerged as one of the last major hurdles to a
durable peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Russian generals are scheduled to take up the issue on
Friday, and the matter is also receiving top-level attention.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton called President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday to
encourage a settlement, and Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott discussed the matter with Russia's prime minister, Sergei
Stepashin.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, the two sides are faced with a contradiction.
Allied officials insist that Kosovar refugees will not come back
unless they are protected by an effective peacekeeping force that
is commanded by a NATO general.
</P>
<P>
   Giving the Russians a sector of their own to control, NATO
officials add, would discourage the refugees from returning to that
part of Kosovo and lead to a de facto partition.
</P>
<P>
   But putting Russian troops under the control of a NATO general
is out of the question to most Russian politicians, who have
bitterly condemned the allied airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Nationalist sentiment against the alliance is running so high
that on Thursday the Communist-dominated Parliament urged in a
lopsided vote that Victor Chernomyrdin be stripped of his post as
Russia's special envoy to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   One simple way to resolve the issue would be to leave the
Russians out of the peacekeeping force. From a military
perspective, the Russian soldiers are not essential.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, however, NATO wants Russian troops to be deployed,
largely to prevent a further deterioration in Russian-Western
relations. So NATO officials are struggling to devise a solution.
</P>
<P>
   Under one approach, Russian troops would support NATO forces in
their area but would not be under their direct command.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Russian troops would be under the overall
supervision of the top NATO general in Kosovo, a less rigid command
structure that is designed to mollify the Russians while upholding
the alliance's principal of unity of command.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether Moscow might accept such an arrangement.
But it is just one of a host of issues that remain to be settled.
</P>
<P>
   Money is likely to be a big issue. Citing Russia's financial
crisis and its cash-strapped military, Stepashin has publicly
proposed that the international community pay the cost of
stationing Russian peacekeepers in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott said that Russian officials have yet to formally ask for
funds. He declined to say Thursday whether Western nations might be
willing to provide them.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was it clear how many troops Russia might send. Russia's
defense minister, Igor Sergeyev, initially talked about providing
up to 10,000 troops. But on Thursday the Defense Ministry talked
about dispatching 2,500 paratroopers, a deployment that could take
seven days or more.
</P>
<P>
   To the consternation of NATO, the Russians have so far refused
to go along with the kind of command structure they agreed to in
Bosnia, where Moscow has 1300 Russian peacekeeping troops.
</P>
<P>
   Formally, the Russian troops in Bosnia report to the Russian
general staff. But the Russian troops are deployed in an American
sector and as a practical matter are under the day-to-day
supervision of a two-star U.S. general.
</P>
<P>
   Given its strident criticism of NATO's air attacks, the Kremlin
appears to believe that replicating the Bosnia command arrangement
in Kosovo would make it vulnerable to charges that it is
cooperating too closely with the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The military talks Friday will bring together Gen. Robert
Foglesong, a representative of the U.S. joint chiefs of staff, with
Col. Gen. Leonid Ivashov, the chief of the international division
of the Russian Defense Ministry and a vociferous critic of NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a solution ``will take a combination of political will
and very tough serious work on the part of military experts,''
Talbott said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It is also an especially important challenge for Talbott. He was
one of the architects of the strategy to include the Russians in a
Balkan settlement. On the other hand, Talbott warned Thursday that
the Kosovo settlement could falter if the peacekeeping arrangements
were flawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get this wrong, KFOR is not going to work,'' Talbott
said, referring to the NATO-led peacekeeping force. ``Unity of
command is absolutely crucial.''

 &HT;    MEXICAN COMIC'S KILLING FOCUSES ON HIS DRUG USE RATHER THAN
COMMON CRIME
 &HT;    500&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ At first Paco Stanley's murder on a Mexico City
street was seen as the most glaring example yet of random crime
plaguing this troubled metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   Television anchors sobbed and fans of the famous television
comic mourned, all assuming that Stanley was the innocent victim of
a vicious assault by gunmen Monday in broad daylight.
</P>
<P>
   Political opponents of the city's mayor, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas,
also jumped on the bandwagon, anxious to weaken Cardenas'
presidential aspirations by blaming the mayor for failing to stem
the city's crime wave.
</P>
<P>
   But now it appears that Stanley's killing was not random, and he
may not have been so innocent. Instead of common crime, his death
is spotlighting another crisis in Mexican justice: the
pervasiveness of drugs in Mexican society and, possibly, the
brazenness of powerful drug cartels.
</P>
<P>
   After his funeral Tuesday, Mexico City authorities announced
that Stanley, 56, died with cocaine in his body, half a gram of the
drug in his pocket and a special grinding kit consumers use to
reduce rocks to powder.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities also said Stanley had lesions in his nose of the
type that habitual users develop.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City authorities have not announced they believe that
Stanley's killing is directly connected to drugs, but reports
suggest that narcotics are a primary line of inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley was killed when gunmen fired a hail of bullets into his
head while he sat in his parked car outside a restaurant in Mexico
City's exclusive San Angel neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen escaped after the mobster-style execution, which
killed a bystander.
</P>
<P>
   A news report in Mexico's El Universal newspaper Wednesday cited
unnamed investigative sources who say Stanley was a pool-playing
buddy of the late Amado Carrillo Fuentes, the head of Mexico's
Juarez cocaine-smuggling cartel. Carrillo Fuentes died during
plastic surgery in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican public, by now accustomed to politicians being
linked to drugs, isn't having trouble accepting that the comic --
who hosted a popular morning show -- could have been mixed up with
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cruel to say it, but I can't understand how a man of his
importance could be killed in such a manner if he didn't have
something to do with drug traffickers or some other mafia,'' said
Irais Yanez, a 30-year-old Mexico City nurse.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were people who really believed the city was a den of
injustice. But now that passions have fallen and after what
(authorities) have said, there are those of us who smell a rat,''
Yanez added.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City's Reforma newspaper cited sources speculating that
Stanley was killed because he was late in paying a $300,000 debt on
a cocaine shipment.
</P>
<P>
   Reforma also said Stanley was implicated in trafficking by the
U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. But in a statement, the DEA
strongly denied ever investigating Stanley and accused the
newspaper of ``making up'' information.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Duran Chavez, a Mexico City federal legislator and
representing Mexico's dominant Revolutionary Institutional Party,
said it could be true that a high-paid entertainer like Stanley
used drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the simple fact that a citizen, a politician, an artist, a
student . . . uses drugs, doesn't mean that they are drug
traffickers,'' Duran Chavez said.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional trim follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Initially, it appeared that the biggest political casualty after
Stanley's killing would be Cardenas, predicted to be the leftist
opposition candidate for Mexico's presidency in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But the tables have turned. Emotional television coverage that
targeted Cardenas is now under attack. After the killing, TV Azteca
owner Ricardo Salinas Pliego -- Stanley's employer -- took over the
airwaves to personally put Cardenas under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do we pay taxes? Why do we have elections? Why have
government if there is no authority?'' Salinas Pliego said.
</P>
<P>
   Now TV Azteca faces charges of hypocrisy since it is sponsoring
a public service campaign ``Live without Drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   In a message to the press, the network said, ``if it's proved
that Stanley consumed these type of products, it only serves to
strengthen the need for the efforts of programs like Live without
Drugs.''

 &HT;    Miss. governor to divorce, then marry junior high sweetheart
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mississippi Gov. Kirk Fordice has become so brazen in
his extramarital activities, he makes President Clinton seem
subtle.
</P>
<P>
   For the second time in his two terms as governor, Fordice on
Thursday announced he will divorce Pat, his wife of 44 years. But
he won't be single long: He also announced he will marry his junior
high school sweetheart, Memphis, Tenn., widow Ann G. Creson, whom
it is widely rumored he has been dating for many years.
</P>
<P>
   The statement, released by his attorney, James Becker, comes
after reports by WLBT-TV in Jackson, Miss., that Fordice vacationed
in Paris with Creson last week. In one report, which has been
replayed as often as O.J. Simpson driving his white Bronco on a Los
Angeles freeway, Fordice walks toward the reporter, wagging his
finger and saying, ``You invade my privacy this way, six months
from now, I'll whip your ass.''
</P>
<P>
   Fordice finishes his second term in six months. State law
prevents a third term. He plans to work for former Vice President
Dan Quayle's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Sid Salter, a statewide columnist and publisher of the Scott
County Times, was the first person to report on the Fordices'
marital problems six years ago. He said Thursday that Fordice's
indiscretions are now so blatant, he's lost interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the point when the governor announces a divorce and stops
lying, it retreats into a private matter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fordice has gained enemies on both sides of the aisle in the
Legislature by issuing a flurry of vetoes each session. The list of
opponents is growing longer as his personal behavior becomes more
controversial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even hard-core Republican backers are falling off him in
droves,'' Salter said.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Ken Stribling, a Republican and longtime Fordice
critic, said this was ``the last straw'' for his colleagues who
still supported the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he remembering that anything he does reflects on the
Republican Party and on the state of Mississippi?'' he said. ``This
is a class issue: If there is something wrong in your marriage, you
should handle it with class.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Fordice's bad relationship with the Legislature has
been a newsmaker, it seems now that his legacy will be his cheating
heart.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Friedeman, a newspaper columnist, radio talk-show host and
theologian, used to be a Fordice supporter. This week, he has been
calling for the governor's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very disappointed,'' he said. ``I want to say,
`Governor Fordice, you ran on a God and country ticket, you talked
about faith and families, and it's obvious you're not walking the
walk. It's time to leave.'''
</P>
<P>
   Stribling says he does not think Fordice should resign but he
does think he should stop being seen in public with Creson until
his divorce is final.
</P>
<P>
   In the eight years since he was elected the state's first
Republican governor since Reconstruction, Fordice on several
occasions has made public _ on purpose or inadvertently _ his
marital troubles. In 1993, he announced he and his wife had
``irreconcilable marital differences'' and hinted at divorce. His
wife immediately issued her own statement that said she had no
intention of getting a divorce. They reconciled publicly a week
later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, on Election Day, Fordice was driving alone on
Interstate 55 from Memphis to Jackson, Miss., when his Jeep
Cherokee veered off the road, flipped and caught fire. The crash
was called a mystery by the state troopers; meanwhile, rumors began
to fly that he was having lunch in Memphis with a middle-aged
woman.
</P>
<P>
   Fordice claimed to have no memory of the entire day. Later, he
went on record calling President Clinton a liar for not being
truthful about his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
He called for Clinton's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Fordice bought a house in suburban Jackson that his
wife knew nothing about. ``I know it is not for me,'' Pat Fordice
recently told a Jackson television station.
</P>
<P>
   Becker said the Fordices are working out a property settlement
``in connection with an irreconcilable differences divorce.'' Both
Fordices still live in the governor's mansion, according to the
governor's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a show of respect for the first lady, he needs to go ahead
and move out now from the governor's mansion,'' Stribling said.
</P>
<P>
   Fordice may be feeling the heat of the criticism being heaped on
him. Perhaps that's why he was pictured on the front page of
Thursday's Jackson Clarion-Ledger with three trusted friends: His
beloved labrador retriever, a bodyguard, and a pistol strapped to
his waist.

   PLANET-EARTH (New York) _ Over more than a century, scientists
and explorers from the American Museum of Natural History have
searched the world and returned with arresting examples of life in
all its diversity: dinosaurs from Montana to Mongolia, birds and
butterflies, artifacts of exotic cultures from here to the South
Sea. For the last four years, their quest has been to collect the
stuff of Earth itself and bring it back for a new exhibition
illustrating the planet's 4.5 billion-year history. Now the
collections have been studied, winnowed and arranged for display in
the museum's newest permanent exhibit, the Gottesman Hall of Planet
Earth, which opens Saturday. By John Noble Wilford.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Our flowers furnish more than furniture ever could
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   From time to time Lyn and I get into those
</P>
<P>
   ... let's call them discussions about which is more demanding,
house or garden. Which calls for more work. You can guess which
side I'm on.
</P>
<P>
   She Who Does Not Garden But Appreciates (and that's the way I
like it; I've always believed in one gardener to a garden) talks
about what a long, hard job it is, towing a vacuum cleaner from
room to room, floor to floor. I point out that it's no picnic
dragging a big old Japanese maple from site to site, trying to find
a home for it in 90-degree temperatures. Well, mopping floors all
through the house wears you out, she retorts. Yeah, and so does
wetting the ground all around a parched garden.
</P>
<P>
   And so it has gone for years, as we debate the merits of taking
care of our respective domains. (She does not garden, but she's
starting to get opinions: ``You pruned one limb too many off that
dogwood.'')
</P>
<P>
   The other day, however, we broke new ground, focusing not on the
work required to keep a house or garden going but on the emotional
value of what's in the house and garden _ furniture vs. flowers. We
achieved rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of conversation you have when you're taking
stock of what you have, or when you're thinking of what you'd face
_ physically and psychologically _ if you moved, or when you're
just trying to get rid of stuff, lighten your load.
</P>
<P>
   Our conversation, part practical, part philosophical, was
launched as we dove into a weekend effort to pare down closets,
clear pathways through mountains of office papers.
</P>
<P>
   What about this blue sofa in the parlor, I said. We've had it
since Washington. Would we keep it?
</P>
<P>
   ``It could go,'' answered Lyn. ``I have no emotional attachment
to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The same went for television sets, of course, and all other
electronic pieces. The kitchen table, various chairs. Most of
what's in the house was expendable, leavable, in our hypothetical
conversation. There were, of course, exceptions _ recorded music,
books and pictures, which are in a category of their own; you just
have to keep them. And the big dining room table of solid oak,
along with a 100-year-old wooden chest and a tall painted bookcase.
</P>
<P>
   A common thread that wove through our short list of keepers was
uniqueness. Unlike most of our furnishings, these things cannot be
replaced. And even if they are not the only pieces of their kind,
they feel like it.
</P>
<P>
   In the garden, there is no doubt; each plant is one of a kind in
ways that furniture cannot be.
</P>
<P>
   Each plant has a story, a history. Most important, they, like
people, grow.
</P>
<P>
   Some are passed from one friend or relative to another. As do
all gardeners, I look at my plants and see connections.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the English oak sent through the mail by old friends from
Massachusetts a few years ago. It was bare-root, wrapped in
newspaper, a spindly little thing. Now, it grows stronger each
year, as do the memories of good times with good friends.
</P>
<P>
   There's the black bamboo, shared from a hugely graceful mother
plant one autumn nearly a decade back. One cane and a few rhizomes
is how it began. Now, there are enough canes to form a fine clump;
they multiply like the conversations and meals we've shared with
the bamboo sharers.
</P>
<P>
   Many plants came from nurseries, which my car refused to pass
during jaunts around the region. Some were just babies when I
hauled them to the garden, dug holes for them, pampered them,
watched them grow and change. The little twice-blooming cherry tree
that was just a short stick several years ago now stares into my
second-story office window. The 2-foot-high native azalea I bought
during a visit to Fairhope, Ala., has doubled its height and its
sweet floral output. A sparse patchwork of dwarf mondo planted
about five years ago has, little by little, woven into a quilt of
green in a space out back.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike furniture, plants need to see us often _ though,
admittedly, not as often as we need to see them. There is a
distinct and necessary interaction between plants and people that
can never exist between furniture and people. Even if those people
are artists or master crafters. Gardeners birth, nurture, feed,
shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Lyn agreed. As she put it: ``I didn't grow that couch.''
</P>
<P>
   So furniture vs. flowers is an easy call. Can we settle the
debate centering on house chores vs. garden chores? Not without a
lot of work.
</P>

AMERICANS' HEALTH IMPROVING OVERALL 
</HEADLINE>
 CARD-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KAREN HSU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every year since 1979, the federal government has issued a
report card on how healthy Americans are. This year, the nation got
its best report card in the last two decades: Americans are eating
more fruits and vegetables, have healthier hearts, and are dying
less frequently from breast and colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   However, US Surgeon General David Satcher said that child
obesity is at an epidemic level, and the huge disparities between
the health of whites and minorities is stalling progress toward the
nation's goals.
</P>
<P>
   At Harvard Medical School's commencement Thursday, Satcher
released a progress review on the government's Healthy People 2000
goals, a blueprint of more than 300 health objectives.
</P>
<P>
   The Healthy People initiative, first launched in 1979 under
former surgeon general Julius Richmond, has been reformulated each
decade to provide a yearly review of Americans' health progress.
</P>
<P>
   Six months shy of the year 2000 goal, many of the target areas
are on track or have been reached, including those for nutrition,
maternal and child health, heart disease, and mental health.
</P>
<P>
   Goals have been met for 15 percent of the objectives: Infant
mortality has dropped throughout the 1990s and the death rate for
children ages 1 to 4 has declined by 26 percent, surpassing the
government's objective. For adolescents and young adults, ages 15
to 24, death rates have declined enough to meet the government's
2000 goal of 85 deaths per 100,000. Since the inception of the
initiative 20 years ago, the mortality rate for this age group has
dropped 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol-related motor vehicle crash deaths and suicides are
down. However, heavy drinking among high school seniors has
increased recently and there has been little reduction among
college drinkers.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer death rates for adults ages 25 to 64 are below the year
2000 target, due in part to the drop in breast and colorectal
cancers and a slowing of lung cancer fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   Among older adults, life expectancy rates are up, reflecting a
continuing decline in heart disease and stroke-related fatalities.
But as Americans live longer, more people over age 70 have trouble
performing critical functions, such as dressing, bathing or even
getting out of bed.
</P>
<P>
   In several key areas, Americans are drifting further from the
government's healthy target _ most notably when it comes to weight
and exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a lot of work to do,'' Satcher said. ``For 20
percent of the objectives, we are moving in the wrong direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Cases of and complications from diabetes are on the rise. Rates
for deaths resulting from falls and motor vehicle crashes have
increased during the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the rise in obese children is that many states
have cut physical education in the schools, Satcher said. ``We are
paying a tremendous price.''
</P>
<P>
   Children are also watching more TV, playing video games, and
working on computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be OK, if they still went outside to play,''
Satcher said. In addition, children emulate their parents and other
adults, who are leading sedentary lives and spending less time
organizing activities for children, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Violence and unsafe neighborhoods are also a cause of less
activity among children and adults because they do not feel safe
going outside, Satcher said.
</P>
<P>
   During his commencement speech, Satcher hinted at some of the
nation's goals for 2010, which he said he would release in January
2000. He said one goal will be to eliminate racial and ethnic
disparities in health by 2010, especially in six areas where there
have been documented differences: infant mortality, child and adult
immunization, coronary heart disease, diabetes and cancer
screening, and lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Satcher said two strategies to close the gap are a
balanced-community health system, including uniform access, and a
balanced research agenda, one that reflects racial and ethnic
health disparities.

PACERS ACKNOWLEDGE THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE KNICKS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Reggie Miller was at the podium and talking
somberly after the Pacers had crumbled to lose Game 5 to the Knicks
when some startling words slipped out of his mouth: when the Knicks
get out and running, Miller said, it is hard to beat them.
</P>
<P>
   With this admission, it appeared, the transformation of the
Knicks was complete. This Eastern Conference final matchup has been
turned on its head in Game 5, with the new-look greyhound Knicks
making the Pacers, thought by most to be the heirs apparent to
Chicago in the East, seem old and ragged, as if the time for their
ascension had come and gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like as the game went along, the more fatigued we
looked,'' Coach Larry Bird said. ``We didn't get much accomplished.
We battled and played hard, but we didn't make a lot of plays. They
made all the plays down the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, that was the role of the plodding, physical Knicks,
who were eaten up not only by Miller but, more critically, by the
athletic Dale and Antonio Davis, the Indiana forwards.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, when the Knicks spread the floor to take
advantage of their superior athleticism, the Pacers could not keep
up and were taken out of their own game. When Marcus Camby, who was
occasionally guarded by Chris Mullin of all people, soared to the
basket, no Pacer went with him. Bird had talked of the need to put
a body on Camby. The Davises had little luck and Mullin's was the
wrong body entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The efficiency of the Knicks was staggering and, for the Pacers,
stultifying. They seemed mentally and physically out of the game
for much of the second half, outrun by the Knicks, but also, more
surprisingly for a veteran team that has had its lineup intact
since Bird arrived, outthought.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks led on fast-break points, 18-2. They scored on 10 of
their last 11 possessions. But more shocking was that the desperate
and wheezing Pacers abandoned the type of fundamental, old-school,
half-court basketball that has taken them to four of the last eight
Eastern Conference Finals.
</P>
<P>
   During a span of nearly 27 minutes from midway through the
second quarter to when there were just four minutes left in the
game, the Pacers had one assist. That's one assist from a team with
Mark Jackson at point guard. The result: after the spectacular
first quarter, when the Pacers opened a 14-point lead on 10-of-18
shooting, they shot 23 of 61 (.377) the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   No one, save Miller, ever seemed to have any energy.
</P>
<P>
   Bird said he thought this team _ celebrated last season for
pushing the Chicago Bulls to the brink of elimination _ perhaps did
not have the heart of a champion after all. When the Pacers went up
by 14 to start the second quarter, they seemed to become
complacent, unable to find the killer instinct to put the Knicks
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't press them when we had them down,'' Dale Davis said.
``We had breakdowns in offense and defense.'' &QL;

 &HT;    IRS ruling leads Christian Coalition to restructure
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Christian Coalition announced a major
reorganization Thursday following reports that the Internal Revenue
Service has ruled that the group is too partisan to be exempt from
federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Coalition spokesman Mike Russell would not comment on the IRS
ruling, first reported by the St. Petersburg Times. The newspaper
said the IRS issued its denial last year, but kept its decision
quiet pending an appeal. The coalition received word recently that
it would lose the appeal, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Russell said the coalition was pulling its application to be
granted tax status given to nonpartisan groups, a category reserved
for educating voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 10 years of fruitless negotiations with the IRS, the
Christian Coalition board of directors has decided to withdraw its
application for tax-exempt status, and create two new separate
organizations,'' Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition of Virginia will be renamed Christian
Coalition International, and it will operate as a for-profit
corporation. As such, it may endorse candidates, form a political
action committee and contribute to candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition of Texas, an existing tax-exempt
organization, will change its name to Christian Coalition of
America and focus on nonprofit ``voter education,'' Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   The changes come as the Christian Coalition is struggling to
regain the influence and fund-raising power it enjoyed in the late
1980s and early 1990s. Founder Pat Robertson predicted the group
would ``continue to be a force in American politics.''
</P>
<P>
   But the group has keen competition from the Family Research
Council and other religious-based organizations that appeal to the
same social conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   The organization's critics welcomed the outcome of the
announcement, whether the result of an IRS ruling or a voluntary
decision to change course.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a decade we have urged the IRS to recognize the Christian
Coalition's clear partisan nature,'' said Carole Shields, president
of the liberal People for the American Way. ``We welcome this clear
signal that everyone has to play by the rules, even Pat
Robertson.''
</P>
<P>
   The coalition's opponents and many Democratic candidates have
fiercely criticized voter guides that the coalition has distributed
to churches before elections.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates have complained that the guides distorted their
positions and were thinly disguised promotional materials for
Republican candidates.

 &HT;    Collection shows off decorative arts ranging over 90 years
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If someone deserves a key to the High Museum of Art,
if not the city, it is Virginia Carroll Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   Through the Atlanta resident's patronage and the good work of
curator Donald Peirce, the High owns a stellar collection of
decorative arts from 1825 to 1917. The objects run the gamut from
cabinets to silver pitchers, pottery to light fixtures. They
represent a period of swiftly changing fashion that encompasses
ornate carving and materials as well as the pared-down simplicity
of the Arts and Crafts movement.
</P>
<P>
   Decorative arts fans should be thrilled, and others might be
converted. Anyone can appreciate the skill and craftsmanship here
or, in my case, find oneself in an aesthetic swoon at some point,
even if the piece in question isn't your personal taste.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the collection is on view in the handsomely and
thoughtfully installed exhibition on the fourth floor. Though
arranged as a history of style rather than in period vignettes,
Peirce often evokes the context in which the pieces were used or
made. One first walks into an airy space with wrought-iron garden
furniture and ferns in which objects displayed at various world's
fairs and expositions are installed. This gives us a sense of how
style, a maker's reputation and merchandise were disseminated as
well as new ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Objects are frequently displayed with photographs or drawings of
them in situ. We see a photo of the lobby that housed Louis
Sullivan's elevator grille, for instance, or a drawing that reveals
how the Herter Brothers' stunning gilt and mother-of-pearl chair
was used in the Vanderbilt's New York mansion.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 pieces, specially marked, remain in the permanent
collection on the second and third floors. It's a testament to the
Crawford collection's breadth and importance that removing these
pieces would have eviscerated the display. Some of the quirkiest
and most interesting pieces are there, like a fabulous silver ice
bowl and spoon, which feature snarling bears and drip with
stalactites. Very, very cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art and Enterprise:
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia Carroll Crawford Collection
</P>
<P>
   of American Decorative Art, 1825-1917''
</P>
<P>
   Through Sept. 26. High Museum of Art, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Top notch.

MILOSEVIC SUGGESTS YUGOSLAVIA WON THE WAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ His army is retreating from Kosovo. Thousands of his
citizens are dead. He has been indicted as a war criminal. And his
country has been bombed so much that it could take 30 years and
perhaps $100 billion to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic spoke of
a successful ``defense of the fatherland in the struggle for
freedom and dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on state television for the first time since he dared
NATO to bomb him 78 days ago, Milosevic suggested his nation had
won the war because Yugoslavia retains sovereignty over Kosovo. He
did not tell his audience that the Western allies had never wanted
independence for Kosovo, or that the future of Kosovo is largely
out of their hands.
</P>
<P>
   His government said at least 2,000 civilians died, and he
asserted that 462 soldiers and 114 police officers were killed.
But, after losing his fourth war in 10 years, he said the nation
had never been more united.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people are the heroes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's rare televised address and the reaction of ordinary
people show the huge gap between government rhetoric and reality in
a society where the news media is state-controlled. If it is, as
Politika, the newspaper that backs Milosevic, declared, a ``great
victory,'' many people here had trouble pointing to the evidence of
it.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, after the official media announced an end to
the war, there were celebrations on the streets of the Yugoslav
capital. Soldiers and police fired their guns. Young couples kissed
in Republic Square. Motorists honked their horns.
</P>
<P>
   But for a city of 2 million, it was not much. The Yugoslav Army
is known here as the VJ, but this was no VJ day. Thursday, people
went about their business, not savoring the moment as much as
contemplating the future. Many were subdued.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a victory. It is a capitulation,'' said Bozo
Koprivica, 46, a writer. ``It is a capitulation not of the army,
but of the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Koprivica said this was a ``virtual war.'' News censorship kept
ordinary people from seeing how many people really died. While
deaths of civilians were emphasized for propaganda purposes, deaths
of soldiers and police were suppressed. Only their families and
friends will know, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Koprivica nor his friend, Bozidar Djurovic, 43, a stage
director, felt much like celebrating Wednesday night. If anything,
they felt less celebratory Thursday afternoon, as news spread that
NATO had officially suspended its air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got the feeling we're smiling with one eye and crying
with the other,'' said Djurovic. ``We're happy because people are
not going to be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he celebrated, Djurovic managed a tired smile and said,
``No, I slept for a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Sleep sometimes brings nightmares, and that, according to young
people, especially, is what awaits Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   At 18 years of age, fresh from high school, Dusan and Milja are
Serbia's future. Both are going on to university, he to study
biochemistry, Milja to study physics. But both say that most of
their friends want to leave Serbia as soon as they can. This war
convinced many of them there is no future here. They spoke on the
condition that their last names were not used.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing to celebrate,'' said Dusan, standing in a
pedestrian mall. ``There are so many people dead. They say 2,000
civilians died, but it's many more. Some say 10,000 soldiers, I say
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Milja said even those who believe the country won by standing up
to the world's most powerful military alliance will begin to
question that assessment in a few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country is destroyed,'' she said. ``It will be a very long
winter. People are not going to have heat. The water and
electricity systems are destroyed. The entire region is unstable.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are people here who believe Milosevic when he says
that the country won the war. Ruzica Minic, 40, a housewife who was
buying vegetables at a downtown market said, ``Of course this is a
victory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We succeeded in defending our land, and Kosovo remains inside
Yugoslavia,'' she said. While many grumble that the government that
got them into conflict with Europe and the United States should go,
Minic is not one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has defended the country, so why should we
change it?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Dragana Stamenkovic, 33, who was selling cheese and salami at
the market, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a victory because we got to keep Kosovo. Nobody can
take Kosovo from us,'' she said. ``Our country is destroyed, but we
will try to rebuild as best we can.''
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to say whether the widespread skepticism and
cynicism here will grow into a demand for political change. The
Americans and Europeans have been adamant that they will not pay to
rebuild Serbia unless Milosevic is removed and the country becomes
truly democratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This war will not produce a healthy movement of the people,''
said Koprivica. ``If this government stays, we'll go backwards.
There will be no progress or prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   Milja, the newly graduated high school student, said she found
it hard to concentrate on politics. She said she had friends killed
in the war, both civilians and soldiers. Her friend Sanja
Milenkovic, 16, was killed when NATO bombed a bridge south of
Belgrade two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sanja was in a special school,'' she said. ``A lot of the
students go on to MIT, Harvard, Yale. Sanja wanted to be a
scientist. But now she is dead.''

SPORTS COLUMN: TEAM EFFORT INCLUDES THE COACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Around the witching hour Friday night, it just might
be appropriate for Dave Checketts to burst into a press conference
and blurt, ``Jeff Van Gundy, you're a gosh-dang good coach.''
</P>
<P>
   It's happened before, where a sports executive had to eat crow
in public. I once witnessed the legendary Branch Rickey making nice
to Johnny Keane, the baseball manager he had schemed to dismiss. In
sports, all things come around.
</P>
<P>
   If momentum and energy and sudden surging youth have anything to
do with it _ the roar of underground trains, the honking of taxis,
the bellowing of rich and petulant fans _ then Friday night could
be the time for Checketts to say something nice about Van Gundy.
Long overdue, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   These improbable Marcus-come-lately Knicks could very well oust
the Pacers from their preordained place in the National Basketball
Association finals. The Knicks are on a roll _ from essentially
nowhere, Lower Dysfunction _with an oddness not seen in these parts
in decades.
</P>
<P>
   Look at it this way: New York winners in recent years were
supposed to be good. The Stanley Cup Rangers, Devils and Islanders.
The World Series Yanks. The Holzman Knicks. The Mookie Mets. Even
the Seaver Mets, you could see that team coming on, months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But if these 12 characters in search of an identity should get
past Indiana on Friday night, they would be New York's most
surprising finalists since the Jets won Super Bowl III in 1969.
Before that, you go back to 1951 when a baseball team called the
New York Giants won a playoff with a man named Bobby Thomson. . . .
Ah, ask your grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   These Knicks could get buried Friday night and Sunday. Or they
could get clobbered by the tall and fresh San Antonio Spurs in the
finals, the way those ancient Giants were outclassed by the Yankees
in 1951. Doesn't matter. The Giants are still remembered for their
Miracle of Coogan's Bluff and Leo Durocher is still the Dandy
Little Manager. Forever.
</P>
<P>
   Now, these Knicks, under Jeff Van Gundy, have shown us a
surprisingly good time this past month. Allan Houston's
follow-the-bouncing-ball shot to beat Miami. Knicks fans filling up
the arena in Atlanta. Three shocking victories over Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   All of New York has been analyzing these characters since their
erratic wobble toward a 21-21 record late in the season, when
Checketts sacked Ernie Grunfeld, who assembled this lot.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they appeared to be certified numbskulls, egotists,
individualists, and they still are, some of them. But they have
stunned a cohesive, logical, talented team, with Patrick Ewing in a
suit, with Latrell Sprewell and Houston still making it up as they
go along, without a point guard who can equal Indiana's Mark
Jackson out of Queens and Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't have anything to do with the coach, could it? Van
Gundy, the son of a coaching lifer, came into this job with his own
tactics. He withheld time from Marcus Camby, who was playing soft.
He started Kurt Thomas because somebody had to give up some early
fouls. He turned Sprewell into an unwilling sixth man because he
envisioned the chaos Sprewell could cause in the opponent's second
unit.
</P>
<P>
   Forced to revise his thinking because of Ewing's absence, Van
Gundy started Sprewell in the fourth game. I did not agree with
that, because it left the Knicks without their normal jolt of
adrenaline midway through the first and third quarters. But now Van
Gundy is 1-1 by listening to his own head. Sounds like gosh-dang
coaching, to me.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Checketts has been smoked out interviewing a
replacement for Van Gundy. It reminds me of 1964, when
beetle-browed Branch Rickey, the eminence grise of the Cardinals,
politicked all summer to replace Keane, the kind and grizzled lifer
from the St. Louis system, with the vain and notorious Durocher.
</P>
<P>
   To everybody's surprise, the Phillies collapsed and the
Cardinals roared into first place in the final week. One night
after a game, while Keane was talking with reporters, Rickey
materialized from a back door, like Banquo's Ghost, startling the
small assemblage with a hearty, ``Johnny Keane, you're a gosh-dang
good manager!'' (A religious man, Rickey did indeed say
``gosh-dang.'' I was there.)
</P>
<P>
   After the Cardinals won the World Series, Keane left for the
Yankees. I am not saying Van Gundy will do anything that impetuous.
I do hope Checketts does not have anything in writing with Phil
Jackson. Regardless of what comes down, Van Gundy's Knicks have
entertained New York _ and have made money for whoever owns the
Garden at this moment. It's time for Checketts to polish up his
``gosh-dang good coach'' speech. &QL;

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Computer researchers Thursday reported a
malicious computer program that is spreading rapidly through the
Internet, attacking Microsoft's e-mail programs and destroying
documents created by popular Microsoft software programs, including
Word, Powerpoint, Excel and other applications.
</P>
<P>
   A number of large corporations, including Boeing, A.T.&AMP;T. and
General Electric, said they had computers infected by the program
and moved to limit the damage, in some cases by shutting down their
e-mail systems. Employees of Microsoft, Intel and the anti-virus
software maker Symantec said they had also been hit.
</P>
<P>
   The program, a form of computer attack known as a worm, shows up
an an e-mail attachment. It held the potential to be far more
dangerous than the Melissa computer virus, which spread rapidly in
March as a sort of e-mail chain letter but was not designed to
destroy files.
</P>
<P>
   The new program is known as a worm rather than a virus because
it able to transmit itself through the Internet under its own
power. In contrast viruses spread by hitchhiking by attaching to
documents, programs or disks.
</P>
<P>
   The program, began spreading Wednesday in Europe and the United
States. Several anti-virus software companies said they believed
that the program had originated in Israel, because the first sample
had been discovered in that country.
</P>
<P>
   At AT&AMP;T's headquarters in Basking Ridge, N.J., the company
intercom broadcast an alert at lunch time warning employees that
the program was spreading and a spokesman said he believed that
several hundred computers had been infected within the building.
</P>
<P>
   At the Intel Corp., the program was first discovered during the
day at the company's development facility in Israel and computer
administrators severed networks linking the company to Europe and
the United States to halt the spread of the program, according to
an internal company memo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gone and past, it's a great tornado that zoomed through
and left,'' said Pam Wickham, a spokeswoman at General Electric.
She said the company had been warned on Wednesday and that
anti-virus software had been quickly distributed, minimizing the
impact.
</P>
<P>
   The worm e-mail is particularly dangerous, anti-virus experts
said, because it contains the message: ``I received your e-mail and
I shall send you a reply ASAP. Till then, take a look at the
attached zipped docs. Bye.''
</P>
<P>
   One employee at an e-commerce firm said two of her colleagues
encountered the virus Thursday morning, with one employee losing
all files on his hard drive. The attachment apparently came from an
employee of Microsoft, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The worm is transmitted by Microsoft e-mail programs and uses
those programs' features to spread itself to other computer users
who have sent e-mail messages from the infected machine.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials said they were aware of the attack and were
gathering information on it. During a day a number of anti-virus
companies updated their programs and posted scanning utilities to
their web sites to fend off the attack.
</P>
<P>
   However, anti-virus experts said that the program was difficult
to detect and that the best defense was for computer users to
resist opening electronic mail attachments from strangers.
</P>
<P>
   The program which comes in an innocuous file identified as
zip_files.exe is an example of a kind of attack known as a Trojan
Horse because it fools computer users into executing a malicious
program by opening the attached mail document.
</P>
<P>
   The program then creates another file named explore.exe that is
launched every time the infected computer is restarted.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of ``social engineering'' relies on the gullability of
computer users who are lulled into believing that the program has
actually been sent as a reply from the person who they recently
sent an electronic mail message.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Explore worm is even worse because you get it from someone
you know,'' said David Chess, a research staff member at the Watson
Research Laboratory in Hawthorne, N.Y. ``People are going to be
lulled into to thinking it is OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the worm establishes itself on a computer, it
systematically searches for documents created by the three programs
that are part of the Microsoft Office Suite, Word, Excel and
Powerpoint as well as some programmers' files and erases them.
</P>
<P>
   Word is the world's most widely used word processing software
and Excel is the most widely used spreadsheet program. PowerPoint
is software for creating graphical business presentations on a
computer screen.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, experts at anti-virus firms said the new program
represented a disturbing trend in the virus underground which
appears to be developing more lethal programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last few weeks we've begun to see attempts by virus
writers to combine the rapidly spread capability of the Melissa
program with a more destructive payload,'' said Wes Wasson,
director of security product marketing at Network Associates, a
Silicon Valley software developer. He said he expected to see a
number of copycat programs in the future as virus writers attempt
to mimick the Explore program.
</P>
<P>
   Network Associates has recently established ``risk assessment''
guidelines for gauging the danger of new malicious programs and
</P>
<P>
   Wasson said the company had assigned the Explore worm a ``high''
rating, its most threatening category because of its destructive
ability.
</P>
<P>
   The new program is known as a worm rather than a virus because
it able to transmit itself through the Internet under its own
power.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``worm'' was coined by science fiction author John
Brunner in his novel Shockwave Rider. In the novel, worms were
programs created by a rebel group that helped destroy an oppressive
computer network.
</P>
<P>
   Although the new Explore worm does not have the ability to
spread as quickly as the Melissa virus, it still has the capability
to quickly proliferate because an infected machine attempts to
infect any other computer that it receives mail from, computer
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worm has the ability to create a ping pong effect,'' said
Wasson.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Computer Emergency Response Team at Carnegie
Mellon University in Pittsburgh said Thursday that they were still
assessing the situation and had not decided whether they would
release an alert.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still trying to understand the scope of the problem a
little better,'' said Shawn Hernan, a CERT security expert. He said
that by late in the afternoon on Thursday the security organization
had received only ten reports of worm infections, however, he said
that the program had spread rapidly at the afflicted organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday a number of virus experts said they were puzzled by the
recent destructive bent within the virus writing community. Many of
the programs in the past have been written as a form of cybernetic
graffiti and are annoying but do not do physical damage.
</P>
<P>
   However, a program such as the Explore worm has the power to
destroy years of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine what these people who write these programs are
thinking,'' said Chess, the IBM researcher.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 13)  
 (af)  
 By MARK HULBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An unfortunate consequence of the long bull market in stocks is
that investors are paying precious little attention to asset
allocation _ the division of their holdings between various asset
classes like stocks, bonds and real estate. They have been lured by
stocks' huge returns into thinking that equities are the only game
in town.
</P>
<P>
   That assumption is costly, and not just because the run-up in
stocks won't last forever. By focusing only on equities, investors
are also paying too high a price whenever they want to reduce risk.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say you are invested only in stocks, but want to reduce
your risk by one-half. One way to do that, of course, is to
withdraw half your assets from the stock market and put them in
cash instead.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, your new portfolio will indeed be only half as risky
as the stock market, but your returns will be only be half as much
(plus the interest earned by the cash).
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 10 years through April 30, the returns of a
portfolio that was 50 percent invested in the Wilshire 5000, a
broad stock index, and 50 percent in cash would have been 11.5
percent, annualized, or 6.2 percentage points less than a pure
equity portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   By expanding your allocation focus beyond stocks and cash,
however, you could improve returns without incurring any more risk.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, a fixed-allocation portfolio that was 41
percent in stocks and 59 percent in United States government bonds,
for example, would have been no more risky than the half
stocks-half cash portfolio. Yet it would have returned 12.5 percent
annualized, or one percentage point more.
</P>
<P>
   That extra percentage point is the payoff of effective asset
allocation.
</P>
<P>
   Asset allocation works because the various asset classes don't
move in lock step. When one is declining, at least one of the
others will usually be rising. The right combination can reduce
overall volatility _ and risk _ by flattening the peaks and troughs
of each class's performance.
</P>
<P>
   And because stocks, bonds and other classes historically
outperform cash, a good asset allocation portfolio should
outperform one that uses cash alone to reduce risk.
</P>
<P>
   The advantages of asset allocation can be seen in the
performance of investment newsletters that focus on it explicitly.
Though none of the 10 such newsletters tracked by The Hulbert
Financial Digest over the last decade through April 30 have beaten
the overall stock market through that period, six of them have
outperformed the market on a risk-adjusted basis.
</P>
<P>
   That is significant, because the vast majority of newsletters
that use other strategies for beating the market _ like market
timing or stock selection _ have failed to keep pace with the stock
market when adjusted for risk.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that advisers who focus on asset allocation are smarter
than the others. When these same advisers have tried their hands at
market timing or stock selection, most of them have also failed to
beat the market. The lesson to draw is that it's easier to beat the
stock market when you expand your focus beyond equities to include
several asset classes.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you're not interested in reducing risk, asset allocation
is still worthwhile. Using an example that may not be altogether
realistic for all investors, let's reconsider that portfolio
containing 41 percent stocks and 59 percent bonds. How would it
have performed over the last decade if you had doubled the original
amount invested, say by borrowing the additional money?
</P>
<P>
   Your risk would have been the same as that of the stock market
itself, but you would have realized a greater return, even after
paying interest on the amounts borrowed. You would have made a 19.8
percent annualized profit over the 10 years through April 30, or
2.2 percentage points more than the 17.7 percent return of stocks
themselves. &QL;

KOSOVARS REALIZE A QUICK RETURN IS UNLIKELY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ Ylkie Drvishaj has waited six years to see her
husband, a Kosovar Albanian who fled to Germany to avoid getting
drafted into the Yugoslav Army. She has waited two months in a
refugee camp here for a peace agreement. She was waiting hours in
the hot sun Thursday to call her husband at a free telephone bank.
</P>
<P>
   And now, she is ready to wait even longer before she ventures
back into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to go to Kosovo, and to go as fast as we can,'' said
the 30-year-old Drvishaj, clutching a 6-year-old son who can't
remember his father, who left when the boy was an infant.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I won't believe it's happening until I see my brothers''
in the Kosovo Liberation Army, ``to see if it's real,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Trust is in short supply in the Balkans, and the lack of faith
is especially pronounced among ethnic Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   No one trusts Milosevic. Most trust NATO and the office of the
U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, which is desperately trying to
persuade the masses not to rush to the border all at once.
</P>
<P>
   There are two who appear to enjoy the absolute trust of the
Albanians: President Clinton and the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Clinton guarantees it, and he says I can go back, we will
go,'' said Esmer Rashiti, 40. ``But only if Clinton says to go.''
</P>
<P>
   For hours after the signing of the peace deal was announced on
Wednesday, there was celebratory shooting and cheering on the
streets of Kukes, a refugee collection point, and in the town of
Kruma, a virtual KLA base on the Albanian-Kosovar border.
</P>
<P>
   But soon after, the reverberations of bombs and unfriendly fire
began. In the northern town of Bajrum Curri, loud thumps and slight
tremors from bombing could be heard for hours late Wednesday night.
It was unclear whether the sounds were from a NATO attack on the
Kosovo side, or a Serb attack on the Albanian side.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, four villages near Kruma were shelled by the
Serbs, said an official with the Organization on Security and
Cooperation in Europe who was there.
</P>
<P>
   Bajrum Curri was shelled Thursday, said a KLA volunteer soldier
who had come from western Europe. He was caught in the attack as he
drove from the town to Kukes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This war is not over,'' the soldier said. ``Don't believe
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bajrum Curri, a skeleton OSCE crew had been put on alert to
watch for last-minute attacks from either the Serbs or Albanians
seeking to use up their artillery before heading home or to settle
old scores in the last hours of the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what the Serbs do _ they do as much damage as they can
at the last moment,'' said Ales Biber, an OSCE staffer in Kruma.
</P>
<P>
   What is waiting for the refugees back home may be even worse.
The entire province must be cleared of an unknown number of mines _
a huge task. Homes may be booby-trapped, and water may have been
deliberately poisoned. The nightmarish picture has aid
organizations scrambling to persuade refugees to stay put _ at
least until the situation can be assessed and deemed safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice to get as many people as possible back in as
quickly as possible,'' said Rupert Colville, spokesman for the UN
commissioner. But ``it would be pretty disastrous if they tried to
rush the border too soon.''
</P>
<P>
   A contingent of 5,000 German soldiers headed north Thursday
night to Kukes; the troops may head into Kosovo as early as Sunday,
said Albania Force spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Helge Eriksen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't allow a vacuum,'' Eriksen said. ``As soon as they
(Serbs) leave, we have to enter.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugee aid groups _ having just succeeded in getting the bulk
of the refugees to move away from northern Albania to camps in the
south _ are now faced with trying to keep nearly half a million
Kosovars from heading back north too soon.
</P>
<P>
   There is no chance that everyone will be resettled by the end of
the year, meaning that camps here must be winterized to accommodate
those who must wait it out here, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want people going back and living under a scrap of
plastic in a Balkan winter,'' Colville said.

clients of the NYTimes News Service for Friday, June 11. If you
have any questions, please call the Republic News Desk at (602)
444-8286. 
 
BUSH (Phoenix) - Two weeks ago Congressman Matt Salmon made a
pilgrimage to Austin Texas, where he sipped tea with Texas Gov.
George Bush and asked the presidential candidate a simple question:
Would the front-runner make a stand in the state of Arizona? Bush,
in an attempt to put to rest rumors that he was ceding the state to
John McCain, said yes. By KRIS MAYES. Story will move in the ``A''
category. 
 
MORTGAGE (Phoenix) - Home buyers got bad news Wednesday when
mortgage rates hit their highest level in nearly two years. The
average interest rate on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages climbed to
7.51 percent from 7.41 a week ago, and the highest since September
1997, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. By
CATHERINE REAGOR. Story will move in the ``F'' category. 
 
AUSTIN-MOVIE (Phoenix) PHOENIX - If you're wondering where all the
15-year-old boys are, they're chuckling their butts off at ``Austin
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.'' This comic sequel to Mike Myers'
surprise 1997 winner hits all the high spots _ or low spots,
depending on your taste in tasteless humor _ of the original. Myers
and crew provide an endless string of sex jokes, potty jokes, then
back to the sex jokes again. By BOB FENSTER. Story moved in the
``E'' category. 
 
BESIEGED-MOVIE (Phoenix) - Director Bernardo Bertolucci makes two
kinds of movies: those, like ``The Last Emperor'' and ``Little
Buddha,'' which are readily accessible to American audiences, and
those, like ``The Sheltering Sky'' and ``The Conformist,'' where
you must find your way into the film.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bertolucci's new drama, ``Besieged,'' is one of the latter. If
you want to gain a sense of this film, you must meet it half way if
not three-quarters. By BOB FENSTER. Story moved in the ``E''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MOVIES-ALTERNATIVES (Phoenix) - There is a lack of good
alternatives to R-rated movies for teens, and many of the
alternatives are flops at the box office. Why? These R-rated movies
are marketed to teens. The movie's success depends on this market.
And even if they stayed home from the movie and watched the WB
instead, they'd still see sex and violence. Even teen magazines are
chock full of ads for sex. We'll also mention that parents take
their kids to the r-rated movies, anyway. Call that the moral
decline of America. By JAIMEE ROSE. Story will move in the ``A''
and ``E'' categories. &QL; 
 &QL; 
AUTO-REVIEW (Phoenix) - The 2000 Neon has been redesigned fore and
aft to eliminate some problems. Gone is the noise and roughness,
and, hopefully, the spotty repair record. But also gone is much of
the charm and character that made the Neon such a standout among
subcompacts. By BOB GOLFEN. Story moved in the ``L'' category.
Embargoed for Saturday, June 12. &QL; 
 &QL; 
FENGSHUI (Phoenix) - How to make your house a fengshui home. An
guide to the ancient art of Chinese placement for dummies. By

 &HT;    Smith wrests much from steamy Cuban locale
 &HT;    EMBARGOED UNTIL JUNE 13. DOM NOT USE BEFORE THEN.
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Very early in Martin Cruz Smith's new novel, his hero, Arkady
Renko, is about to commit suicide. Renko, the melancholy Russian
investigator of three previous Smith procedural thrillers starting
with ``Gorky Park,'' is despondent over the death of his beloved
wife, Irina. He's been summoned to Havana to identify the corpse of
an old friend and is just about to inject an air bubble into his
own vein when a Cuban bursts into his room, trying to murder him.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting without thinking, Renko kills the Cuban in
self-defense, then spends the rest of the book unraveling the links
between his dead Russian friend and his would-be Cuban killer. But
that moment _ a man stopping his own suicide to defend himself _ is
so very Russian it sounds like the punch line to one of the dark
jokes that are told in the crumbling former empire today.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you had to do was wait,'' the Russian tells the dying
assassin. Renko is both passive and aggressive, but not
passive-aggressive in the way we use that term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Havana Bay'' is really not so much about the state of a
Russian's soul as it is about the state of Cuba's soul, and really
not even so much about that as about the way the two play off each
other.
</P>
<P>
   It's a wonderful idea _ seeing the beautiful, proud, desperate
city of Havana through the eyes of a Russian, seeing as how the
Cubans now hate the Russians more than anybody on earth. For years,
Cuba was essentially a Soviet colony, and the Soviets ruled with
contempt. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba was
abandoned and now makes much of its income off tourists who come
for the cigars, the rum and the blatant underage prostitution,
which the government grotesquely winks at.
</P>
<P>
   There is a plot, full of players and double-crosses and
McGuffins, giving Renko reason to move from Point A to Point B, but
it hardly matters, and when he gets to the end, it matters even
less.
</P>
<P>
   But the plot does give Renko the opportunity for several edgy
encounters, leading to an unusual symbiotic relationship, with
Ofelia Osorio, a Cuban detective who distrusts the Russian, as
opposed to outright loathing him like the rest of her countrymen.
The scenes of Ofelia at home, worrying about her two young
daughters, whether they have enough to eat and whether they'll
soon, of economic necessity, join the hot-pantsed girls who prowl
the boulevard along the sea wall for fat, rich European tourists,
have a fierce maternalism that is heartbreaking.
</P>
<P>
   Details such as those of Ofelia's home life make ``Havana Bay''
worth attention: The way people, even in private conversations,
never refer to Castro by name but instead pull their thumb and
forefinger along their chin, indicating a beard _ a gesture of
paranoia, respect and superstition. The constant blaring of salsa
music from tinny radios, the fin-heavy Caddies from the '50s that
still roam the streets (so preferred over the flimsy Russian
Ladas), the intensity of the local folk religion Santeria, the way
in which the country's revolutionary zeal is crumbling faster than
its apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Elmore Leonard also ventured to Havana for his novel
``Cuba Libre,'' but it was the Havana of a century ago, at the time
of the Spanish-American War. Reading ``Havana Bay,'' one wishes
that a writer of Leonard's gifts had used the Havana of today as a
setting. Smith may not have done right by his narrative, but the
sheer observational powers he brings to bear, coupled with his
strangely endearing detective hero Renko, make ``Havana Bay'' a
trip worth taking.

 &HT;    Comma et al. are markers on road of life
 &HT;    EMBARGOED UNTIL SUNDAY, JUNE 13. DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For many of us, the Iowa Test of Basic Skills has become the bar
exam of life. You can be a good parent or a bad parent, a grouch
whose glass is forever half empty, a spineless pushover or a
watchful monitor of minutely calibrated behavioral limits. But what
really concentrates the mind is that array of numbers reporting how
one's child did in the early heats of the rat race.
</P>
<P>
   I opened the white envelope addressed to ``Parent of ...'' with
clammy hands, not knowing its contents but wondering, ``Well, what
was it this time?''
</P>
<P>
   The array of numbers, the bar graphs, the showy jargon lifted
from statistics _ what a relief, for once, to see it all. And amid
this impressive tangle of data one particularly amusing nugget of
information only a writer could appreciate. They're testing the
kiddies on their punctuation now, although even there they cannot
resist the urge to complicate what would seem clear enough. One of
the categories is called ``Terminal Punctuation,'' which I take to
mean periods, question marks and the like. Somehow that word
``terminal'' conjures up images even grimmer than the perils of
middle school.
</P>
<P>
   But it was something else that caught my eye. Once one gets past
intimations of mortality there is a subcategory called, simply,
``Comma.'' And there I read that my child, whose attention to
punctuation had always struck me as blissfully insouciant, is
something of a master. He not only knows how to use a comma, but he
knows how to use it better than just about everyone his age.
</P>
<P>
   Now, this came to me as a complete surprise _ a shock, in fact.
So much so that it raised grave doubts about a test I would like to
take at face value: I have seen those commas, and ``masterful'' is
not the first word that comes to mind.
</P>
<P>
   Ramifications of a little black dot
</P>
<P>
   Periodically there come in one's life Rubicons that must be
crossed. Punctuation is one of these, terminal or otherwise. Anyone
who begins a sentence and ends it with a little black dot knows the
uncertainty of getting from here to there. Punctuation marks do
more than help us along our way, like the four-way stops or the
cattle-crossing sign; they are triggers of emotional response.
</P>
<P>
   And for writers they are fetishes of a sort, things to be
fretted and worried about. Punctuation, a man named Paul Robinson
wrote once in The New Republic, ``is naturally attractive for all
with the character strictures of the sort Freud dubbed anal, and I
readily confess to belonging to that sect. We anal folk keep neat
houses, are always on time, and know all the do's and don'ts,
including those of punctuation.''
</P>
<P>
   Speak for yourself, Robinson. I'm never on time, my house not as
neat as it could be (too many newspapers, too many magazines, too
many books, too many kids, too little time), and there are don'ts
I've too often done and do's I don't do enough. But about
punctuation I'm punctilious.
</P>
<P>
   The late Lewis Thomas, an oncologist better known as an
essayist, wrote playfully once of the stops and pauses of prose and
of the indicators of tone _ the foolish exclamation mark (it should
be expelled from the language), the question mark, quotation marks
(usually misused or overused). My kid's no master of the comma,
much less the complex sentence. But Lewis Thomas was one of the
masters of English prose in our day. He was, among other things,
fond of the staid old mark you don't see much anymore, one that's
not a period and not a comma:
</P>
<P>
   ``It is almost always a greater pleasure to come across a
semicolon than a period. The period tells you that that is that; if
you didn't get all the meaning you wanted or expected, anyway you
got all the writer intended to parcel out and now you have to move
along. But with the semicolon there you get a pleasant feeling of
expectancy; there is more to come; read on; it will get clearer.''
</P>
<P>
   Parenthetical paean
</P>
<P>
   In the same essay Thomas happens to mention something
parenthetically, and then something else parenthetically within
that, and again and again until a sentence that began simply enough
ends with )))))))))))).
</P>
<P>
   And you never thought punctuation could be so much fun (put away
that exclamation mark). But gold-star exactitude and fluency are
not the same. You can learn to write mechanically and never make a
grammatical error, but you won't necessarily write well. The
pleasure of all those silly marks is that they shape what we say by
modulating how we say it. Russell Baker called punctuation a kind
of body language of our written word, helping readers hear us the
way we want to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   Rightly used, the comma can be lovely, and the dash diverting.
The question mark serves of necessity, while the semicolon,
appreciated only by its friends, gathers dust. And loveliest of
all, of course, is the one a reader might give up hope of ever
seeing, the one that says we are finished, at least for now.

THE FAMILY DOCTOR HAS A BLURRED FACE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DIANE BARNET   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Time was, family doctors were there for you through thick and
thin. They immunized your children, prescribed antibiotics for your
strep throat and visited you in the hospital after your
appendectomy. It was not unusual for such relationships to last 20
years or more.
</P>
<P>
   But these days a ``health care provider'' often has the shelf
life of a sneeze droplet, because of managed care, health industry
mergers and the insurance business. My recent struggle to be
reimbursed $87.83 from a clinic led me to examine this surreal
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Navigating the thousands of insurance plans _ each with its own
deductibles, ``co-payments'' and ``allowed amounts'' _ can tax
anyone's strength. Although health maintenance organizations
control the amount of care a consumer receives and insurers dictate
the financial parameters, doctors can pick and choose the health
care plans and insurers they accept.
</P>
<P>
   I know first-hand the absurdities of the doctor-insurer-patient
relationship. Several years ago, I began work as a registered
nurse. My job offered health insurance, but, as is often the case,
it didn't kick in for three months. Unfortunately, the only
significant medical problem I've ever had _ a neurological
condition involving an eye _ developed during that time.
</P>
<P>
   I went to an ophthalmologist, who referred me to a neurologist.
While I was willing to pay his $200 fee up front, he kindly waived
it and suggested a CT scan. ``How worried are you about these
symptoms?'' he asked. ``Not very,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking more of the $1,000 cost of the scan than of my eye, I
deferred the procedure, and the problem cleared up on its own. But
the irony of working in health care yet lacking insurance did not
escape me.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, I married, switched to part-time work and
obtained coverage through my husband's employer. My family doctor,
however, did not accept his insurer. A friend recommended another
doctor. But my search would continue after just one visit, when,
with only a glance at my records and no discussion with me, that
doctor decided that I should have estrogen therapy.
</P>
<P>
   I was just getting used to Doctor No. 3 when he left to teach
family-practice residents at a hospital. His replacement was a
young woman I liked. Unfortunately, she moved to another city after
a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Doctor No. 5 had been my husband's physician for 10 years. A
clerk in her group practice told me that her clinic accepted our
insurance. That turned out to be incorrect; the group had recently
dropped it.
</P>
<P>
   My husband was not affected by that decision, because he had
just qualified for Medicare, but I had a hefty bill for an office
visit. The office manager suggested that I pay with a credit card
and then file a claim even though my doctor was a
``nonparticipating provider'' _ in the hope that the plan would
cover part of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   During my battle to straighten out the mess, I could feel my
blood pressure rise and my heart race every time I gathered my
paperwork and picked up the phone. And (italics)I'm(end italics)
healthy; I can't imagine arguing with insurers while recuperating
from surgery, say, or undergoing chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   So where does the $87.83 come in? In pursuing my claim, I
learned that even a ``nonparticipating provider'' could not bill me
more than 115 percent of the amount allowed by my insurer for a
given procedure. My bill from No. 5 had exceeded that ceiling by
$87.83, and I was determined to get it back. So I began another
round of copying documents and firing off letters to billing
supervisors. I would love to charge for my time and annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   After six months of calling, writing letters and being passed
from office manager to billing supervisor to refund supervisor, I
finally received a check. My efforts had stopped just short of
contacting the state insurance commission.
</P>
<P>
   My new doctor is No. 6 in as many years. Well, he is really No.
3, the one who left to teach. I realized that he was seeing
patients again when his name appeared on my insurer's list of
``providers.'' But such lists can soon become out of date, as
providers or groups of providers end their relationship with an
insurer.
</P>
<P>
   I called the clinic of Doctor No. 6 to make sure that he still
accepted my insurance. The clinic couldn't tell me, because it
contracts its billing to another company.
</P>
<P>
   That contractor has since confirmed in writing that my insurer
is on the list, so I feel safe _ for this week, anyway _ and ready
again to brave the shifting sands of managed care. Of course, my
doctor's group practice could decide to drop my insurer. Such
decisions are made at the corporate level, and doctors don't
necessarily like them any more than patients do.
</P>
<P>
   So it seems that doctors, too, are pawns in the insurance game.
They are losing not only their autonomy, but also, in the parlance
of managed care, their titles. I'm waiting for the day when a
receptionist announces: ``Primary care provider Smith is not in,
but P.C.P. Jones will see you as soon as his staff examines your
insurance coverage.'' &QL; 
 &QL;

DEMOCRATS ASSAIL BUSH'S LEADERSHIP ABILITIES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Texas Gov. George W. Bush embarks on his first
presidential campaign tour, Democratic leaders Thursday criticized
his leadership abilities and suggested he could be tarred by the
actions of congressional Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the leadership issue there is much to be desired,'' said
Roy Romer, general chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
``He would not be a candidate if he did not have his father's
name.''
</P>
<P>
   Romer, who along with the DNC's national chairman Joe Andrews,
devoted a large part of a breakfast meeting with reporters to what
they believed were the GOP front-runner's vulnerabilities. Their
comments suggest that they not only believe Bush will be the likely
Republican nominee, but they need to try and quickly slow his
political momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Bush on Saturday begins a tour of the key primary states of Iowa
and New Hampshire, and he will attend a number of fund-raisers
elsewhere Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate that he is not only leading a large field of
Republican candidates but is also ahead of the Democrat's top
candidate, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman David Beckwith dismissed the attacks, saying
``there is a whiff of desperation already in the air at the DNC.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to peck away at him in every which way. They
think these little peashooter attacks are going to undermine him,''
Beckwith said.
</P>
<P>
   Romer said Bush had failed to show leadership on a number of key
issues. He criticized Bush for delaying for several days after the
NATO bombing of Yugoslavia began to comment on it. He also said the
governor was remiss for not supporting a hate-crime bill that was
killed in the Texas Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   And he particularly singled out Bush's position on gun control,
including his endorsement of a measure requiring instant background
checks at guns shows after a state legislative committee had killed
the bill. Lawmakers said that even though Bush said he backed the
measure he did not lobby for its passage.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans generally oppose hate-crime legislation and gun
control.
</P>
<P>
   Romer said Bush's positioning on that gun-control measure was
``like being at the Alamo, being out in the bushes waiting until
the fight is over and then coming out and saying, `Hey, I was
really there for you guys after all.'''
</P>
<P>
   Romer predicted that the gun-control measure would continue to
prove troublesome for Bush as the House considers a GOP-sponsored
gun-control measure, which Democrats charge is considerably weaker
than one passed by the Senate several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Romer said that Bush could not distance himself from Republican
congressional leaders because he had received the support of a
majority of House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats also made it clear they will try to link Bush with
two conservative House firebrands from Texas, House Majority Leader
Dick Armey, R-Irving, and House Whip Tom DeLay, R-Sugar Land.
</P>
<P>
   Beckwith said Bush's relationship with Armey and DeLay was
``very good.'' And he added that the Texas governor was ``proud of
the record of the Republican Congress since 1995 in eliminating the
deficit, reforming welfare and reducing the growth of government.''
</P>
<P>
   Romer and Jacobs insisted that the vice president's record in
government would stack up favorably to Bush's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask candidates what they have been doing in the last 25
years,'' said Romer. ``Bush brings five years, plus baseball plus
oil drilling to the table. Gore brings 25 years of very intense
focus on public policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governorship, which Bush first won in 1994, is Bush's
first elective office. Gore was first elected to Congress in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Romer said Republicans have criticized Gore's advocacy of
environmental positions and ridiculed his book ``Earth in the
Balance.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Democratic chair countered, ``At least he has an idea.
He is intellectually curious. He is willing to step out and say we
got to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Beckwith, however, said it was odd for the Democrats to be
questioning Bush's qualifications when they backed a presidential
candidate in 1992 who was governor of a state ``one tenth the size
of Texas.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The wave of postmodernism that swamped architecture in the 1980s
lapped up on the shores of the automobile in the '90s. Starting
with the Dodge Viper _ a riff on the iconic Shelby AC Cobra _ a
series of cars have happily rummaged through the toy box of great
design.
</P>
<P>
   The Volkswagen New Beetle, pert and stylized, revisits the
classic Bug; the Plymouth Prowler is the PG-13 version of the
raunchy T-bucket roadster; the coming Ford Thunderbird reimagines
the mythic, coming-of-age coupe from the '50s in glossy,
computer-designed perfection.
</P>
<P>
   Interesting cars, all. Yet there is something glib and easy
about each, and each seems hidebound by its source material. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new Audi TT sport coupe, on the other hand, draws from no
car in particular. In its broad, flat proportions, its wheels
gripped in the far reaches of the chassis, it pretty obviously
breathes the same air as the first Porsche, the 356.
</P>
<P>
   Less obviously, the roofline hints at the ridged backs of Grand
Prix racers fielded by Auto Union. That company, a consolidation of
four auto makers in prewar Germany, lends its four-ring emblem to
the Audi of today.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Prowler and the T-Bird, the TT manages to avoid airs
of pining nostalgia. With its blunted fenders and taut skin, its
constant-radius roofline and its crisp creases around curvilinear
wheel arches, the TT recalls nothing so strongly as other
brilliantly executed new cars from Audi and its parent, Volkswagen.
(A neighbor said the TT looked as if someone had taken a rolling
pin to a New Beetle.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A car of traffic-stopping beauty and heart-racing cool, the TT
is a postmodern masterpiece, probably the first such work in
automobiles. In suave and sure strokes, it blends the streamlined
style and geometric curves of 1930s Art Deco with the spare economy
of Bauhaus. In its exposed rivets, Torx-head screws and brackets,
its leitmotif of brushed aluminum rings, it flirts with a
half-dozen Machine Age schools of design. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In one way, however, the TT seems to shrug off the postmodern
label. It has none of the tart-tongued humor that usually marks the
style, none of the precious irony that you see in, say, the Beetle.
This is an earnest car for serious drivers, seriously fast and
seriously fun. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, when Audi began circulating TT concept cars _ a
silver coupe and a battleship-gray ragtop _ they seemed a
farfetched notion. Audi was coming off a decade of slumping sales
and it seemed more in need of mainstream products than sports
exotica.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many figured the TT's audacious use of bare aluminum
and exposed workings would never make it past the safety police.
(The inside of the doors was bare metal; the door lever was built
into the tubular side-impact beam, which doubled as a door pull.)
</P>
<P>
   When Audi _ inspired, no doubt, by the enthusiasm shown for
sports cars from BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Porsche _ announced that it
would indeed build the TT, many were dubious that its Bauhaus soul
would survive in a production body.
</P>
<P>
   Yet amazingly little of the TT's edgy, industrial patina was
lost in the march to market. Rings of brushed aluminum _ echoes of
the four-ring logo _ glimmer in the cabin, floating on a background
of dense vinyl and industrial-grade rubber.
</P>
<P>
   Rotating bezels of aluminum dimpled with fastener-style
indentations surround the air vents. This dimple theme is picked up
on the steering wheel, in the trim at the base of the shifter, on
the shift knob, and, outside, with the aircraft-style fuel-filler
cap. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shiny aluminum rings also surround the black-faced instruments _
which glow a devilish red at night _ and the dash-mounted buttons,
including those for the optional seat heaters. These pop out and
rotate, lighting up a circle of red LEDs as they are turned higher.
The climate controls, encircled in the same aluminum (which,
remarkably, does not show fingerprints), use spring-loaded dials
that toggle ``plus'' and ``minus'' for fan speed and temperature. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bigger slabs of aluminum are used for a door that conceals the
audio controls and for the large, perforated dead pedal to the left
of the clutch. (The TT will have a manual transmission only for its
first few months in the United States.) Exposed triangular brackets
connect the transmission tunnel to the dash assembly; when the
driving gets intense, as it surely will, you can brace against the
bracket for more stability. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, there are some ergonomic tradeoffs. The cup holder,
a double hoop of aluminum wire, resides inconveniently between the
seats at about the driver's right elbow. The window switches are
tucked weirdly behind the door pull; operating these is a move akin
to fishing a cherry out of the bottom of a highball glass. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The seating position is upright and comfortable, but the car's
high gunwales, low roof and sloe-eyed side glass restrict
visibility. It sometimes feels as though you are peeking out from
under an umbrella. Such is the price of sports-car cool. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The front shoulder belt is hard to reach once seated. The rear
seats, though equipped with belts, are too small for sentient
beings. Better that the seatbacks be folded to make use of the
well-finished and spacious (14 cubic feet) cargo hold. Here,
polished aluminum tie-downs hide in spring-loaded recesses. Details
abound. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Audi plans to phase the TT into the American market, beginning
with the front-drive coupe that went on sale last month, then a
coupe with the same engine and Quattro all-wheel drive in the fall.
Next spring, Audi will offer a more potent 225-horsepower version
of the Quattro coupe; it adds a larger turbo-charger and other
performance tweaks to the same basic engine.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is that Americans will have to wait a year for the
roadster, which will come only with all-wheel drive but will offer
a choice of 180- or 225-horsepower engines. The good news is that
the chassis of the base coupe ($31,025 including destination
charge) is way overengineered in the interests of commonality with
the more powerful version now available only in Europe. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And the coupe is no slouch in any event. Under its stubby hood
is a tweaked version of Volkswagen's 1.8-liter, 20-valve
turbo-charged four-cylinder, which produces 180 horsepower and 173
foot-pounds of peak torque.
</P>
<P>
   The motor is buttoned to a flawless five-speed manual
transmission. While the car feels a little lazy off idle (a
consequence of the time it takes the turbo-charger to spool up),
once the turbo comes on line the car wakes up like a startled deer,
surging forward in great gusts of acceleration as you work through
the gears. Zero to 60 miles an hour blows by in 7 seconds; at
highway speeds, there's still enough oomph for midrange passing to
spill your coffee. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because it was designed with the convertible in mind, the
coupe's chassis is girder-stiff. Even during hard driving on rough
roads, the interior pieces did not make a peep. (It is not unusual
for an exotic interior to rattle madly in the real world.) Because
the chassis is so stiff, the suspension could be made compliant
without sacrificing the handling.
</P>
<P>
   The TT has a firm but supple ride, dousing big bumps without
smothering feedback through the seat and wheel. The tautly
bolstered bucket seats keep passengers socketed securely in place.
</P>
<P>
   Like most front-drive cars, the TT favors understeer _ resisting
changes in direction at high speed _ though with the optional
17-inch performance tires the car has more grip than most drivers
will be willing to exploit. Near the limit the car does a little
hitching maneuver upon turning toward a corner (not surprising, on
a short 95.4-inch wheelbase), but settles instantly onto what feels
like rails.
</P>
<P>
   Traction control is standard and it helps to preserve rubber
when the torquey car is put under the lash. A stability system _ a
la Mercedes-Benz _ is not in the plans and seems superfluous
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The TT has superb tactile sensations. The fat steering wheel
feels alive in your hands; the brakes (four-wheel disks with
antilock technology), clutch and gas pedal all modulate with
sports-car precision. While all the controls are heavy, in the
Teutonic mold, the car is effortless to drive over all. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is it too late for nominations for Car of the Century, way too
soon to elevate the TT to that lofty list? I wonder. This is a
historically significant car. For all its retro eclecticism, the TT
manages to be utterly fresh and original.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, the TT works _ it handles and performs well, drives
easily, offers practical space and delivers it all at an excellent
price. If good design is about anything, it is about all that.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE TRACK: Postmodern that matters. &QL;

THE COST OF RECHARGING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 13) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Conn., Calif.)   (af)  
 By MICHELLE COTTLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. (italics)After 15 years of working in sales and marketing for
a Fortune 100 company, I need to make a change. I will most likely
seek a position in a similar field, but first I need a break from
the pressure. I have all but decided to quit my job and take a
two-month respite. But if I do so, how much more difficult will it
be to find another job? And how can I improve my chances?(end
italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Even in a strong economy, getting a new job is easier when
you already have one. Proving that a resignation was entirely
voluntary can be tough; some old-school employers still view any
gap in your employment record as a warning flag, said Edward D.
Hendricks, a management consultant in Bridgeport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than dropping out of the rat race, consider moving into
the slow lane. Many companies grant sabbaticals. You might try
finding part-time consulting work, suggested Ruth J. Luban, a
career counselor in Laguna Beach, Calif. In some cases, she added,
you can even work as a consultant to the very company that you're
leaving.
</P>
<P>
   If consulting seems too daunting, think about going back to
school, Hendricks said. Pick a topic or two that captures your
interest and has practical applications in your field. Consider
courses in Web design, for example, or in information technology
advances. ``Look for something that a new prospective employer
would see as valuable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still too much pressure? You could try developing your own
informal (and low-key) learning regimen. Many of us have stacks of
new computer software or industry-related reading that we'd like to
go through, Ms. Luban said. Catching up on changes in your field _
and related fields _ can improve your prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the drawbacks of an extended break, it can put you in a
much better frame of mind for job-hunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Burnout so erodes your energy and self-concept that you're
only 50 percent available to go out and sell yourself,'' Ms. Luban
said. By recharging and rediscovering your passion for your work,
you can make a much better impression than if you go to interviews
when you're ``fried and tired,'' as she put it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing with burnout is that it does not go away by
itself,'' she said. And it will only get worse if you jump directly
into another high-impact job.
</P>
<P>
   When you start looking for a new position, don't be defensive
about taking a break. ``De-emphasize the time out,'' Ms. Luban
said. ``Go in really pushing that you're the right person for the
job.''
</P>
<P>
   If _ or, more likely, when _ an interviewer raises the issue,
``lead with a positive, pro-active spin and explain the reasons why
your time off was so productive,'' she said. Especially in today's
tight labor market, many employers may be more interested in your
abilities and experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have the right skill set,'' she said, ``you're going to
land somewhere fairly soon.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Titanic wake was no bonus for `Ship of Gold'
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sinking of the Titanic was the biggest sea disaster of the
20th century, but some six decades earlier, another sinking shocked
the nation. In 1857, the SS Central America was bound for New York
from Panama with 600 passengers and 21 tons of gold from California
when it sank in a hurricane off the South Carolina coast. The 149
survivors' personal accounts of the horror of the storm and the
bravery of Capt. William Herndon were more dramatic than any
fiction.
</P>
<P>
   It was just the kind of story that Seattle writer Gary Kinder
thought would make a compelling book. ``I have to feel the story
before I can write about it,'' says Kinder, 52, a Seattle lawyer
who changed careers after reading Tom Wolfe's comments on the ``new
journalism'' in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   What started out as a good story soon turned into a great one.
While researching the shipwreck for a book in 1987, Kinder heard
about a Columbus, Ohio, group that had filed a claim for salvage
rights. Tommy Thompson and his crew planned to retrieve the riches
from nearly two miles beneath the ocean's surface using a specially
designed robot. Hesitant at first, Thompson finally agreed to let
Kinder accompany him on the greatest treasure hunt of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Weaving in historic details with Thompson's recovery efforts,
Kinder wrote the spellbinding best seller ``Ship of Gold in the
Deep Blue Sea'' (Vintage, $14 paperback). The book sold more than
150,000 copies in hardback and Warner Bros. recently bought film
rights for seven figures.
</P>
<P>
   Originally scheduled for publication in 1995, the book was
delayed until 1997 because of Thompson's legal battles over rights
to the treasure. When it finally was published, ``Ship of Gold''
came out in the wake of the ``Titanic'' frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think `Titanic' helped my book, but I think it hurt
it,'' says Kinder, who was in Atlanta for a book tour this week.
``By that time, four or five books about Titanic were out. The two
stories had nothing in common. Director James Cameron had to
fabricate a love story, while we didn't. If we had come out before
`Titanic,' we could have gotten even more attention.''
</P>
<P>
   CLIMBING HIGHER: Armchair adventurers apparently can't get
enough of true outdoor sagas such as ``The Perfect Storm'' and
``Into Thin Air.'' Now, with the discovery last month of the body
of explorer George Mallory on the slopes of Mount Everest, more
books about mountaineering are in the pipeline. Some believe that
Mallory, who disappeared during a 1924 expedition with his partner
Andrew Irvine, may have reached the summit 29 years before Sir
Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay. Larry Johnson and Jochen
Hemmleb, who found Mallory's remains, will tell the story of their
expedition this fall in ``Ghosts of Everest: The Search for Mallory
and Irvine.'' Rights to a BBC and Nova documentary have already
been sold.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, National Geographic Books plans an October
publication of ``The Last Climb: The Legendary Everest Expeditions
of George Mallory'' by David Breashears and Audrey Salkeld.
Breashears is the author of the recently published ``High Exposure:
An Enduring Passion for Everest and Unforgiving Places.''
</P>
<P>
   RICKY, RICKY, RICKY: Less than three months after Ricky Martin
sparked a fan frenzy at the Grammy Awards, the Latin singing
sensation has become the idol of screaming teenage girls. So it's
no surprise that publishers have rushed to press with four
biographies for young fans. In stores this week are ``Ricky Martin:
A Scrapbook in Words and Pictures'' (Dell, $7.95) and ``Ricky
Martin: An Unauthorized Biography'' (St. Martin's, $4.99) by Elina
Furman. Coming in July are ``Ricky Martin: Rockin' the House!''
(Pocket, $4.99) by Nancy Krulik and ``Ricky Martin: Livin' La Vida
Loca'' (HarperEntertainment, $5.99) by Letisha Marrero. Needless to
say, all the books are packed with photographs.
</P>
<P>
   OUT THE DOOR: Bring in a best-selling author and what thanks do
you get? In Dell president Carole Baron's case, it's a pink slip _
after 18 years of nurturing such authors as Thomas Harris, Elmore
Leonard, Nicholas Evans and Danielle Steel. Baron's ouster, a
result of ``restructuring'' at parent company Random House, comes
just as Harris' blockbuster ``Hannibal'' hits stores.

WOMAN STABS HUSBAND, DIES IN FIRE WITH 2 CHILDREN

<P>
   EAST HARTFORD, Conn. _ Kelly Silk struggled against depression
in the pale yellow house with red shutters.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe the 32-year-old mother of four, who
attempted suicide a year ago, battled the disease for years before
slashing her sleeping husband to death with a kitchen knife
Thursday morning. She then set a fire in the split-level ranch that
killed two of her children.
</P>
<P>
   Silk and her husband Charles, 39, were discovered dead by
firefighters who responded to the 1:15 a.m. blaze at the couple's
home on Passaro Drive, a cul-de-sac.
</P>
<P>
   Two Silk children, ages 3 and 2, were barely breathing when
firefighters found them in their smoke-filled bedroom. They died
shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The family's baby, 6-month-old Joshua, was severely burned and
in serious condition Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was Kelly Silk's eldest child, 9-year-old Jessica, who
managed to run for help after she was stabbed by her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were awakened by a voice crying for help,'' the Rev. Chad
Trigge, a neighbor and the Silk's pastor told WHDH-TV Channel 7,
describing how Jessica Silk came to his door. ``It was Jessica,
whose hair was ablaze, and as soon as I doused the flames, I
realized that she was quite bloody.''
</P>
<P>
   Jessica may have awakened to hear her parents fighting and then
walked into their bedroom, police said. She was stabbed several
times in the back and legs and seriously wounded, but she was able
to run from the family home and knock on Trigge's door.
</P>
<P>
   Church members gathered to mourn last night at the Truth Baptist
Church in South Windsor, where Trigge is pastor and where Kelly and
Charles Silk met. Several woman who knew Kelly Silk said that they
were aware their friend was depressed, but that she sought relief
by attending prayer meetings and celebrating her children's
milestones.
</P>
<P>
   ``You knew she was depressed,'' said Cathy Amadusun. ``But
nobody expected anything like this. Nothing at all like this.''
Church member Leon F. Madore said he never saw a hint of depression
in Kelly Silk, who was a single parent, raising Jessica alone, when
she met her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're loving parents,'' Madore said. ``The kids really loved
their folks. The church community is mortified and shocked by
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Madore said Jessica and her brother will not have to worry about
finding a loving home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will all be here for her. In our church, when one grieves,
we all grieve,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   East Hartford Police Commander Mark Sirois said Kelly Silk had
attempted suicide a little over a year ago by combining the
antidepressant drug Prozac with other prescription drugs. Sirois
confirmed that she was hospitalized at the time, but said he could
not release any other details related to her health care or
hospitalizations.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Silk, 39, died from multiple stab wounds, police said.
His body was found in the home's master bedroom, and the severely
burned body of his wife was in the hallway. Jennifer, 3, and Jonah,
2, likely were overcome by smoke inhalation, said Assistant Fire
Chief Brian Rykowski.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua was in full cardiac arrest in his crib, in the same room
where his father was killed, when firefighters found him.
</P>
<P>
   Because there were so many ambulances already in use, a
firefighter held the infant in a police cruiser that rushed to the
nearest emergency room, fire officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The baby was listed in serious condition in the burn center at
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, according to a hospital
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Jessica was taken to the Connecticut Children's Medical Center,
where she was in serious condition following surgery for multiple
wounds, hospital spokesman Chris Boyle said.
</P>
<P>
   East Hartford Police said Kelly Silk's attempted suicide in May
1998 was the only domestic dispute or call for service from the
Passaro Drive home while the Silks lived there.
</P>
<P>
   State and local police and fire investigators were working to
determine whether there was anything that sent Kelly Silk into a
rage. They said they could not be sure how the fire was set, only
that it was apparently started upstairs, in one of the bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The smoke was billowing out of the windows when they arrived
on scene,'' Rykowsky said. ``They would find one person, drag them
out, and know they had to go in after the others. The neighbors
knew there were small, young children in there somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of Kelly and Charles Silk and their two young
children were taken to the Connecticut state medical examiner's
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know whether she planned to die in the fire, or
wanted to escape and couldn't,'' Rykowski said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we have three homicides and an arson. Do we have a
suicide? We can't be sure yet. It's an awful scenario no matter
what we find.''

 &HT;    `Out for Good' ably traces gay rights drive
 &HT;    EMBARGOED UNTIL SUNDAY, JUNE 13. DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN
 &HT;    By Shane Harrison
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If it's true that ``history gets thicker as it approaches recent
times,'' as English historian A.J.P. Taylor once remarked, there
are few better illustrations than ``Out for Good: The Struggle to
Build a Gay Rights Movement in the United States.'' In the 30 years
since the patrons at New York's Stonewall Inn fought back against
police harassment _ a pivotal encounter known ever since simply as
``Stonewall'' _ the campaign for gay rights has inspired a steady
flow of histories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out for Good,'' by Dudley Clendinen, former features editor at
The Atlanta Journal-Consti-
</P>
<P>
   tution and now an editorial writer for The New York Times, and
Adam Nagourney, a Times reporter, stakes its claim as the first
comprehensive history of the gay rights movement _ a sweeping
statement that sets a prodigious task. After careful consideration,
it seems a valid boast. Many before have chronicled the same
events, but with a microcosmic focus. In 1993's ``Stonewall,''
Martin Duberman invested the movement as a whole with a sense of
personal warmth by tracking the lives of several participants and
bystanders at that seminal moment in New York in the summer of '69.
Others have taken a regional tack: James T. Sears compiled early
Southeastern gay experiences in ``Lonely Hunters'' (1997); Will
Fellows did the same for the Midwest in ``Farm Boys'' (1996).
</P>
<P>
   In ``Out for Good,'' the authors focus on a handful of cities,
but the places chosen represent a respectable range of sizes,
regions and temperaments: Atlanta, Los Angeles, New York, Chicago,
Minneapolis/St. Paul, Boston, Austin, New Orleans, Seattle, Miami,
Washington and San Francisco. The protagonists in these tales are
much less familiar than those recounted before in books; some in
fact have never been written about.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Franklin Kameny, the first openly gay candidate for
federal office, is an early indicator of the quality storytelling
to come: He has ``the confidence of an intellectual autocrat, the
manner of a snapping turtle, a voice like a foghorn, and the habit
of expressing himself in thunderous bursts of precise and formal
language. He talked in italics and exclamation points, and he
cultivated the self-righteous arrogance of a visionary who knew his
cause was just when no one else did.'' A Harvard-trained
astronomer, Kameny was dismissed from his government job after
being arrested in Washington's Lafayette Park in 1957. (Late one
evening in the park, he saw an arrest in progress and stopped to
watch, before being spotted by the police and placed under ``arrest
for investigation'' himself. The authors describe this as ``a
procedure used by the morals squad in those years to hold, question
and pressure someone they suspected of homosexuality.'') In 1971,
he ran for the newly created office of delegate to Congress from
the District of Columbia. Ultimately he lost, but ``the votes were
not the measure of the campaign,'' Clendinen and Nagourney write.
``It was the change made in public consciousness, and in the
political organization of the gay community in Washington and
beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   Some might quibble with the authors' decision to begin their
story with the Stonewall riots, the importance of which many gay
activists and historians have debated in recent years. The fact
remains, though, that Stonewall was a powerful symbol and a
rallying point for the struggles of the early 1970s, and it lingers
in the yearly gay pride celebrations that commemorate that June
night each year in cities all over the world. The authors don't
ignore the work of the pre-Stonewall activists, but much of the
work of pioneers such as Harry Hay, founder of the Mattachine
Society, and Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin of the Daughters of
Bilitis, is well-documented elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   With the detailed clarity that comes with meticulous research
and a little distance, the authors recount the many highs and lows
of the gay rights movement, from Anita Bryant's successful late
'70s campaign against a gay rights ordinance in Florida to Bowers
v. Hardwick _ which pitted Georgia Attorney General Mike Bowers
against Michael Hardwick, an Atlanta bartender arrested under the
state's sodomy law _ to the devastating toll that AIDS wrought on
the early generations of activists.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the AIDS crisis was felt not just in the deaths of
some of the movement's leading lights, but in the response to
governmental and medical reactions to the disease. ``No other
movement has been so reshaped by a plague,'' Clendinen and
Nagourney write.
</P>
<P>
   The founding of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power (ACT-UP) was
a galvanizing moment in gay activism. On March 10, 1987, at the New
York City Lesbian and Gay Community Services Center, a group was
born that ``would be hip, stylish, informed and sexy activism,''
and that ``defied type.'' ACT-UP wasn't alone, though. Without
accounts such as ``Out for Good,'' many of the other important
players might be left to languish in the footnotes. Few people
would recognize the contributions of organizations such as the
Lavender Hill Mob and the unnamed collective organized by Avram
Finkelstein and others that was responsible for the now familiar
slogan ``Silence  &QC;  Death.'' As Clendinen and Nagourney write, ``The
Lavender Hill Mob would lend to ACT-UP much of its tactical
armament, but (Finkelstein's) collective would impart an artistic
and marketing sensibility, which would prove equally distinctive to
this new activism.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Randy Shilts' excellent history of the early years of the
AIDS crisis, ``And the Band Played On'' (1987), the mountainous
cast of characters in ``Out for Good'' can be overwhelming. But the
authors never allow the many disparate threads of the story to
become tangled into outright incomprehensibility. Dashes of humor
and a simple, straightforward style make the book a pleasure to
read, with none of the dry, academic prose that plagues so much
historical reportage. What Clendinen and Nagourney have created is
an invaluable document, impressively researched, remarkably
well-written and groundbreaking in its scope.

HOW BLUE IS YOUR COLLAR?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DEBORAH STEAD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In her mid-30s and in mid-career, Solange de Santis, a business
reporter with an Ivy League education and a crisp white-collar
upbringing, became an auto worker.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. de Santis writes in her engaging account of that
year-and-a-half stint, ``Life on the Line: One Woman's Tale of
Work, Sweat and Survival'' (Doubleday, $24.95), it wasn't a hard
decision.
</P>
<P>
   She was bored with journalism to the point of mischief: To amuse
herself, she had begun to sneak hidden baseball references into her
bond-market articles. Besides, she wanted, for once, to write a
business article from the inside out and from the bottom up.
</P>
<P>
   She found that story in the early 1990s _ in Ontario, where she
had been freelancing after jobs at Reuters and The Toronto Globe
and Mail, and where General Motors was warning workers about an
impending shutdown of its Scarborough van plant.
</P>
<P>
   The project would also satisfy her longtime curiosity about
factory work. She said she found herself ``weirdly attracted to
blue-collar life,'' and, at 5 feet 4 inches tall, to the physical
challenge it posed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. de Santis's aim was to be at the plant to chronicle the 18
months or so leading up to that closing. She also wanted ``to step
over the line between white collar and blue collar,'' a line, she
reminds us, that is widening.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the narrative of the shutdown doesn't have much
drive. It meanders a bit, and there is little drama in the plant
closing. Ms. de Santis's co-workers, counseled by outplacement
professionals and wearily adept at calibrating the available buyout
deals, seniority privileges and union benefits, are more or less
prepared by the time the last van rolls off the line in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But the author, who is known at the plant as ``Sally,'' take us
over the collar line with grace and authority. And with conviction:
She winds up marrying a co-worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life on the Line'' doesn't pretend to be a woman's version of
``Rivet-head,'' the boozy, funny, testosterone-saturated
best-selling memoir by Ben Hamper, a GM worker in Michigan. Ms. de
Santis describes herself as a ``visitor,'' aiming to make a mosaic
from the bits of life she sees in her corner of the 2,700-employee
plant.
</P>
<P>
   Well, visitors can bring not just passion, but their own special
perspective, as Keith Thomas points out in ``The Oxford Book of
Work'' (Oxford University Press, $35), to be published in America
this fall. Thomas notes that analytic observers have always been
drawn to labor arenas, often successfully capturing the life around
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that in many ways the advantage is with those who go
in and do it for a bit,'' he said in a recent interview about the
writers he has included in his collection. ``It's fresh and new to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   He includes in this genre Polly Toynbee, a British journalist
who took a job in a cake factory (``A Working Life,'' 1971) and
David Linhart, a French academician and radical who signed on at a
Citroen plant (``The Assembly Line,'' translated in 1981).
</P>
<P>
   The writing of Ms. de Santis is indeed fresh as she is initiated
into the world of hard work. And she offers a terrific newcomer's
account of how shocking it can be to mind and body.
</P>
<P>
   Her first job, at $16 an hour, is to wrestle fiberglass
insulation into engine compartments, add a vent and tighten three
screws. In passages that are bone-achingly visceral, she describes
how, to keep pace with each moving van shell, she has to walk
backwards, fling herself against it, jam in the insulation and
tighten the screws through layers of fabric, plastic and metal. The
work is exhausting. It is impossible to keep up. The half-hour
lunch break is scant respite. Time crawls.
</P>
<P>
   Her co-workers are helpful enough, but they can't stop the
fatigue, the heat, the tiny glass insulation needles that cling to
her nose, the clang of robots, the Led Zeppelin blasting out of
boom boxes. After her first shift, she sits in her car and cries
with exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   ``My arms were sore, my chest bone was bruised,'' she writes.
``I had figured assembly-line work would be hard, but a small piece
of my yuppie mind had conceived it as sort of an extended session
at the health club.'' A co-worker tells her that men, too, cry on
their first day.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, and satisfyingly, Ms. de Santis gains the strength
to wield her power tools like a pro. The fatigue is always there,
and she occasionally finds herself gripped by irrational anger and
by a desire to quench her thirst _ and boredom _ in a time-honored
way: swigging beer in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   The author also introduces us to her co-workers, but the list of
characters is a bit difficult to keep straight. The best drawn are
Lance, her immediate supervisor, and Maria, a 50-something woman
made frail by breast-cancer treatments who nonetheless reports for
a full shift most days. The author's husband-to-be, Cam, turns up
near the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life on the Line'' also portrays casual sexism at the factory,
which is 85 percent male (pinups and the occasional suggestive
leer, along with vulgarisms hardly shocking to a newsroom veteran
like Ms. de Santis). And it chronicles workers' cynicism toward
both GM and the Canadian auto workers' union as the plant's last
days tick away.
</P>
<P>
   But what sticks is the rhythm and the punishment of the line. At
book's end, when Ms. de Santis and her co-workers read an article
quoting a professor who says the Scarborough line crews are
``probably overpaid in relation to their job skills,'' you may be
as enraged as they are.

 (af)  
 By ERIC QUINONES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his first year in the physical therapy program at Thomas
Jefferson University in Philadelphia, Tony Woods saw advanced
students receiving multiple job offers _ sometimes months before
graduation. Woods, a former carpenter, was feeling good about
trying a career change.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, he is close to earning his master's degree
but recruiters have not come calling. ``No responses on anything so
far,'' he said, ``and I've probably put a couple of dozen feelers
out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods's plight exemplifies a rather sudden shift in physical
therapy. For years it was a booming field desperate for skilled
practitioners, but now it faces a slowdown caused by its own
growing pains, the growth of managed care and, especially, Medicare
cutbacks that took effect in January. Years of undersupply have
given away to rising unemployment, reduced work hours and salaries,
and a tighter job market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shortfall has literally evaporated,'' said William
Quillen, director of the physical therapy program at Indiana
University in Indianapolis. ``There's just not the hot, hot job
market there was two or three years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade, the number of physical therapy programs at
colleges and universities nationwide soared 75 percent, to 208,
with graduates in fierce demand to treat an aging, fitness-obsessed
population. And thousands of foreign therapists arrived to fill
vacancies at hospitals, rehabilitation centers and nursing homes
and with home health-care agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Full-time therapists typically earn $55,000 a year, and some
make more than $100,000. But the ranks of full-timers are thinning
even as more graduates enter the field each year.
</P>
<P>
   Therapists assign some responsibility to managed-care companies'
cost controls, but they say the new Medicare spending caps are most
to blame. Under a provision of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act that
took effect this year, Medicare beneficiaries are now limited to
$1,500 a year for physical therapy, though the head of a federal
advisory panel recently recommended eliminating that cap.
</P>
<P>
   The changes have meant that many patients get less care than
they used to and that new graduates must look longer and harder for
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I actually got accepted to Jefferson, everybody was
telling me what a great field it was,'' said Woods, 46. But now he
is facing $50,000 in loans, which he must start paying off later
this year, and job prospects appear dim in the area around
Philadelphia, where he lives.
</P>
<P>
   As he works in his final two clinical rotations, Woods and his
wife, Cynthia, a management training consultant, have begun to
consider leaving the Northeast, a saturated market for physical
therapists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have two children, so that's a big issue,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Jennifer Sonn, who graduated from Thomas Jefferson
in 1996, had three offers before she even finished school. She
chose Presbyterian Medical Center in Philadelphia, which offered
her a signing bonus 10 months before she graduated.
</P>
<P>
   She left the hospital last summer and now works for the Visiting
Nurses Association, a nonprofit home health-care agency in
Runnemede, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Though she is doing well, experienced therapists are not exempt
from effects of the tightened job market. Mrs. Sonn said that of a
dozen of her friends from Thomas Jefferson, three have been laid
off and two have taken pay cuts of up to $5,000 in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Weinstein, a veteran therapist who practices in New York
City, said managed care restrictions have cut his revenues by 35
percent in two years.
</P>
<P>
   The American Physical Therapy Association, in Alexandria, Va.,
which represents about 49,000 of the nation's 116,000 or so
licensed therapists, confirmed last month that the Medicare cuts
have led to a sharp rise in unemployment and to cuts in therapists'
working hours.
</P>
<P>
   The group reported that 20 percent of 6,000 therapists surveyed
in April said their hours had been reduced, compared with 13
percent in October 1998. It also said that while unemployment among
therapists working in nursing homes and home health care remained
low, it had more than doubled, to 3 percent in April from 1.2
percent in October. There was virtually no unemployment in those
fields just three years ago, Alexis Waters, the group's
spokeswoman, said.
</P>
<P>
   The association has not compiled industrywide unemployment
figures this year. But even before the new law, a 1997 study
commissioned by the group predicted a 20 percent to 30 percent
surplus of therapists as early as 2005, citing the rising numbers
of students and the managed-care companies' cost controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Managed-care reimbursement has caused an impact on every
aspect of health care,'' said Sandra Howell, interim chairwoman of
the University of Southern California's physical therapy
department. ``Patients are being discharged from the hospital a lot
sooner, and there's less time for physical therapy, occupational
therapy and a number of ancillary health professions.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas Simmer, medical director of Health Alliance Plan, a
Detroit-based Health maintenance organization, said managed care
companies are emphasizing cutting drug and hospital costs. ``I do
not believe that national or locally, physical therapy is
undergoing that same type of energetic cost-reduction strategy,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Quillen of Indiana University said older patients already
receiving therapy might not be able to afford further care if, say,
they broke a bone.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, he said, people ``can very quickly exhaust their
Medicare benefits.''

U.N. VOTES ITSELF A MAJOR PEACEKEEPING ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ After more than a day of frantic diplomatic
maneuvering, the U.N. Security Council approved Thursday a draft
resolution sending a large NATO-led force into Kosovo to keep the
peace and placing the United Nations in administrative charge of
the province.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen of the Council's 15 members voted in favor of the
resolution. China, which had pressed for changes in the text, only
two of which were adopted, abstained.
</P>
<P>
   Approval of the resolution bestows U.N. legitimacy on the peace
plan and the NATO-led military operations in Kosovo. NATO's bombing
campaign, by contrast, never secured the world body's explicit
blessing, since resolutions authorizing it would have been blocked
by Russia and China.
</P>
<P>
   The vote also gave a vast, challenging role to the United
Nations, which had been politically sidelined until now by American
insistence that NATO and Russia take the lead in efforts to end the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we are seeing at least the beginning of the end of a
dark and desolate chapter in the history of the Balkans,'' said
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who nevertheless warned against
being ``triumphalist,'' warning of ``difficulties and dangers
ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials, struggling with budget cutbacks and demands that
they do more with fewer resources, said they were pleased, but
daunted by the task ahead. For the resolution approved Thursday
turns Kosovo at least temporarily into a veritable U.N.
protectorate.
</P>
<P>
   Shashi Tharoor, Annan's director of communication, said that the
resolution ``reaffirmed the value of the United Nations and what it
stands for, and gives the United Nations its rightful
responsibilities.'' The war, he added, ``was a NATO war; the peace
will be a United Nations peace.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO members of the Council, bowing to China's sensibilities,
adopted a non-substantive change in the wording of the resolution's
preamble by referring to the ``principles and purposes'' of the
U.N. charter and the ``primary responsibility'' of the Security
Council in maintaining international peace and security.'' But the
Chinese representative, Shen Guofang, regretted that the Council
did not accept its other changes, adding that the resolution
``makes no mention of the disaster caused by NATO bombing'' of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 20 representatives who gave often impassioned
speeches in the Council defended NATO's campaign against Yugoslavia
and endorsed the peace plan. Peter Van Walsum, the Netherlands'
representative, said that the vote reflected a profound shift in
the balance between respect for human rights and for national
sovereignty. While the U.N. charter was ``more specific on respect
for sovereignty than respect for human rights,'' he said, the
balance had shifted. ``Today,'' he said, ``no sovereign state has
the right to terrorize its own citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir Jeremy Greenstock, the British representative, asserted that
President Slobodan Milosevic had been ``defeated'' in his attempt
to destroy the lives and the homeland of the Kosovar people. ``We
have now stopped Milosevic's ethnic-cleansing machine in its
tracks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's representative, Sergey Lavrov, one of the resolution's
13 co-sponsors, said that his country nevertheless ``sternly
condemned the NATO aggression'' against Yugoslavia. The bombing, he
said, had transformed a humanitarian crisis into a ``humanitarian
catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   A far harsher note was sounded by Cuba, whose representative
heatedly attacked the United States and its NATO allies for the
bombing campaign, accusing the allies of conducting ``genocide''
against the ``innocent women and children'' of Serbia. This, in
turn, elicited equally sharp critiques of Cuba's human rights
record from the United States, the Netherlands and Croatia, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's representative, Vladislav Jovanovic, also expressed
disappointment that the resolution had authorized participation in
the U.N. mission by ``countries which have taken an active part in
the aggression.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, China had sought to fix a firm 12-month limit on
the life of the peacekeeping force, soften criticism of Yugoslavia,
and limit the circumstances under which the NATO-led troops could
use military force to implement the resolution. It succeeded on
none of these points.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO-led force, which is to be some 50,000 strong, will
include civilian experts as well as soldiers. It will supervise the
refugees' return and the withdrawal of both Yugoslav forces and
paramilitary police. It will consult with Annan, but not be
directed by him.
</P>
<P>
   Another unusual feature of the resolution, a senior U.N.
official said, is its unlimited authorization of the NATO-led
force. While the resolution authorizes the force for an ``initial
period of 12 months,'' it can continue to operate there ``unless
the Security Council decides otherwise.'' That means that the
Security Council, which has now ordered all parties to comply with
the resolution and its terms, would have to vote to dismantle it if
NATO chose to stay.
</P>
<P>
   What diplomats have called the ``post-conflict'' architecture
approved by the Council gives sweeping powers to both the NATO
forces and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, it charges the NATO force with ``deterring renewed
hostilities''; ``demilitarizing the Kosovo Liberation Army'';
establishing ``a secure environment in which displaced refugees and
displaced persons can return home in safety''; de-mining, and
``ensuring public safety and order.''
</P>
<P>
   Placing these powers under Chapter 7 of the world body's charter
means that the NATO-led soldiers can use force to ensure that the
Yugoslavs fulfill their commitments to the Council.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution also authorizes Annan to establish an ``interim
administration'' for Kosovo, guaranteeing ``substantial autonomy''
within Yugoslavia and providing for free, democratic elections.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats said that the far-reaching powers authorized by
the Council make Kosovo a virtual U.N. protectorate.
</P>
<P>
   While he declined to comment on that characterization, Tharoor,
the secretary-general's director of communications and a key
adviser, said that the resolution gives the United Nations its
``rightful responsibilities.''

WHAT'S YOUR INTERNET IQ?  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   My favorite Internet commercial these days shows this man
checking into a cheap motel. The desk clerk is a bored young woman.
As the man is checking in, he asks the clerk whether he can get
movies on his room TV. The clerk answers matter-of-factly: ``All
rooms have every movie ever made in every language, any time, day
or night.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to predict exactly when desk clerks at Motel 6 will be
telling you that, but thanks to the Internet it will be a lot
sooner than you think. It took America Online nine years to sign up
its first million members; AOL just added its latest million
members in 42 days. Two years ago, the average AOL member was on
line for 14 minutes a day; now it's 55. The U.S.-based Internet
economy has gone from $0 to roughly $300 billion in revenues in
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Things are changing so quickly that Cisco Systems, which makes
the black boxes that connect the Internet, has just come up with a
model through which companies can measure themselves for how close
they are to what Cisco believes is the ideal business model needed
for success in the Internet economy. It's called the Internet
Quotient, or IQ. It's not a perfect yardstick, and Cisco has an
obvious self-interest in promoting it. But there's something to it.
</P>
<P>
   A company's Internet IQ, argues Don Listwin, Cisco's executive
V.P., is the product of two measures: the degree to which its own
internal operations _ and how it delivers products and services _
are now built around using the Internet, and the degree to which
its external behavior exploits the global spread of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   To find your company's IQ, start by assigning one point for each
of the following internal criteria it meets: (1) Does your
management understand the opportunities, and destructive potential,
of the Internet for its business? (2) Is your business strategy
fully aligned with what the Internet now makes possible, or do you
deal with the Internet as just another piece of technology to add
on to your computers? (3) Do you use the Internet to anticipate
customer behaviors and recognize market changes? (4) Does your
company cultivate Internet skills for its workers and managers?
</P>
<P>
   (5) Can your company's technological infrastructure accommodate
rapid change and customization without sacrificing scale and
security? (6) Are Internet sales an important component of your
overall revenues? (7) Can your company handle an Internet ecosystem
in which you are intimately tied together over the Internet with
multiple suppliers and multiple customers? (8) Is each one of your
employees empowered to use Internet technology to build employee
ecosystems within the company? (9) Can you operate in warp-speed
Internet time to get to market faster and establish first-mover
positions? (10) Do you have systems for measuring the impact of the
Internet on your business and cost-cutting?
</P>
<P>
   Next, go through the external checklist and assign two points
for each of the 10 external criteria you meet. I don't have space
for all 10 (you can get them off Cisco's Web site), but here are
the key ones: Is your company sought out as an Internet partner by
other companies?
</P>
<P>
   Does your company have a vision for tapping the Internet market
in ways that will enable other companies to also profit from its
success? Is your company actively engaged in developing Internet
standards?
</P>
<P>
   Is your company investing in its future by financing other
companies that are pursuing complementary Internet technologies?
</P>
<P>
   Are venture capitalists financing Internet start-ups that could
feed off your business?
</P>
<P>
   You calculate your Internet Quotient by multiplying the total
points you get on the internal scorecard (ideally 10) by the number
you get on the external one (ideally 20). The ideal IQ would be
200. Does it matter?
</P>
<P>
   Well, Cisco contends that there will increasingly be a
correlation between a company's Internet IQ and its return on
invested capital. The higher the IQ, the higher the return.
According to Cisco, Dell, which pioneered computer sales over the
Web, has an IQ of 140 and a return on capital of 51 percent; Compaq
has an IQ of only 40 and a return of 9 percent; Sotheby's auction
house has an IQ of 8 and a return of 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, it's probably just a gimmick, you say. Nothing to worry
about. Right. The next thing you know someone will tell you that
Motel 6 is offering every movie ever made in any language on its
room TV's. (BOX)

 &HT;    Plaintiffs argue for class-action status in Coca-Cola suit
 &HT;    By Christopher Seward
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Plaintiffs in the racial discrimination case against
Coca-Cola asked a federal judge in Atlanta on Thursday to block a
company effort to prevent class-action status.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola had asked U.S. District Judge Richard Story to
postpone discovery, or information gathering, that would help
plaintiffs build their case for adding 1,500 other prospective
black plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys said Story should deny that request because the
gathering of statistics and other employment data on Coca-Cola is
critical to determining whether more plaintiffs should be included
in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facts relating to Coca-Cola's employment practices and
treatment of African-American employees with respect to ...
compensation, promotions, job placement and performance evaluations
are necessary for reasoned consideration of the class-certification
issue,'' plaintiffs' attorneys said in their response.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, Story gave Coca-Cola until July 1 to turn over
to plaintiffs a detailed database on its work force. That order
appears to expedite the process of deciding whether the lawsuit can
get class-action status.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola, which denies that it discriminates against its
employees, has argued that plaintiffs have made ``general
references to discriminatory practices'' and that they have nothing
in common with the prospective plaintiffs, other than race.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of ``commonality'' makes the case inappropriate for
class action, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Even without class action, the four plaintiffs _ administrative
assistant Motisola Malikha Abdallah, security officer Gregory Allen
Clark, consumer information specialist Linda Ingram and former
director Kimberly Gray Orton _ can continue to pursue their claims.
</P>
<P>
   If the judge rules against Coca-Cola, the plaintiffs still must
convince him later that the suit, filed April 22, merits
class-action status. That decision is not expected for several
months.

 &HT;    Stylish Italian Ducati has motorcyle enthusiasts crooning
 &HT;    By David Tulis
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Italian motorcycle maker Ducati may not have the name
recognition or macho image of the leader of the pack,
Harley-Davidson, but it does have European style, racing heritage
and engineering that is finding a market in America.
</P>
<P>
   American Demographics magazine noted in its June issue that
while sales of big boats have risen only slightly in the 1990s,
sales of motorcycles have climbed 150 percent as baby boomers try
to squeeze more fun into less time.
</P>
<P>
   From the Little Puppy, a scooter born during World War II, to
the powerful Monster motorcycle created a half-century later,
Ducati has been a boutique brand. Now, its cycles are finding their
way into more garages across the country as the company goes
mainstream, including a new store in Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   During an open house last week at the recently opened Ducati
Atlanta showroom on Piedmont Road, enthusiasts, known as
Ducatistis, were able to sip Ducati-brand water and check out the
company gear, including custom red leather riding suits with black
trim ($1,595) with matching riding gloves and boots.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta architect Paul D'Arconte, 47, who had never even ridden
a motorcycle, was smitten during a European vacation. In Italy, he
saw his first Ducati and a couple with matching leathers. ``That's
the coolest thing I've ever seen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he liked the idea of motorcycling, D'Arconte says he
didn't feel confident about it until he planted himself atop a
silver-and-gold Ducati 750 Monster two years ago. ``It fit me, it
was small and light, and I felt comfortable handling it. Now that
I'm confident on the bike, I feel I could ride anything.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Arconte cites the brand's heritage, superb manners and
unmistakable roar of its L-Twin engine as the reason for his
rapture over his Ducati. ``Hey, I'm Italian, what can I say!'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   Changes have already come to Ducati since the 1996 takeover by
Texas Pacific Group, including the introduction of new models.
</P>
<P>
   From the base model Monster 750 selling for $6,995 to the
superbike-bred 996 priced at $16,495, the company has broadened its
lineup to include a pair of two-person sport-touring models.
</P>
<P>
   The ST2 at $12,495 and the more powerful ST4 at $14,495 are fine
for taking on Italy's autostrada or the Alps, with their
comfortable seats and matching hard luggage.
</P>
<P>
   Men and women both say they appreciate the styling of their
machines, with the lumpy tan engine peeking out from under a
spaghetti frame.
</P>
<P>
   Ducati's rise to prominence began in the mid-1950s, when Italian
motorsports designer Fabio Taglioni _ known for avant garde designs
and an emphasis on performance _ jumped on board. His Mach 250
broke distance and speed records in the '60s, and Taglioni won the
hearts of motorcycle enthusiasts and sports fans with his
eye-catching designs. In the 1970s, Taglioni introduced the unusual
desmodromic valve system on a production bike. The system's
positive valve actuation gives more immediate response than
conventional valve systems.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the 30-year-old desmo valve design enabled Ducati 996
riders to take the top two positions in last weekend's Big Kahuna
Nationals road race at Road Atlanta.

 &HT;    Delta decision on deferring 777 orders could come today
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines could announce as early as today
whether it will defer its remaining Boeing 777 orders because of a
stalemate over pilot pay.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move would likely delay for months or years the
Atlanta-based carrier's plans to make the giant jet a significant
part of its international fleet.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokesman declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Delta took delivery of its first two 777s in late March and put
them into service May 1, with plans to add five more to the fleet
by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   But talks with the carrier's pilot union over pay rates for the
new planes have produced little progress.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot union can refuse to fly a new type of plane if no pay
agreement is in place six months after they enter service, which
would be Nov. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Delta says it needs assurances of a pact much sooner in order to
confidently schedule the planes for fall and winter use.
</P>
<P>
   It has already deferred four 2000 deliveries, citing uncertainty
created by the pay dispute, and indicated the five deliveries
scheduled for this year are in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its newness and size, the 777 would be the
best-paying plane in Delta's fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The airline has offered $239 an hour for captains, 5 percent
above the top rate at carriers already flying the jet.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot union's last demand was for $319 an hour, a figure it
says is based on the plane's revenue-generating potential.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the pilot union announced overwhelming
rank-and-file approval of a special dues assessment to pay pilots
affected by a possible 777 grounding, a vote the union termed a
``show of support and solidarity'' for its negotiating stance.
</P>
<P>
   Another negotiating session is scheduled Tuesday, but neither
side has offered new proposals in the last two sessions.

CARRIERS NEAR AGREEMENT ON PASSENGER TREATMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's major airlines, responding to growing
complaints about the mistreatment of passengers, are close to
signing an agreement to relax ticketing rules, do more to notify
customers of canceled flights, and better serve people stranded on
aircraft during long delays.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines had been set to announce the deal Thursday, but
they canceled at the last minute amid reports Senate leaders were
angry because they had not signed off on the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is an attempt to head off at least four bills in
Congress, dubbed ``passenger bills of rights,'' that were spurred
by complaints about poor airline service. In one prominent
incident, which became a public relations disaster for the
industry, a January snowstorm left passengers stuck aboard a
Northwest Airlines Corp. aircraft on a runway for eight hours or
longer with inadequate food and restroom facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the airline industry is negotiating with some of the
lawmakers who have filed bills to make the airlines more
consumer-friendly. After calling a press conference Thursday,
however, the Air Transport Association, which represents airlines
covering 95 percent of US passenger traffic, abruptly canceled it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan needed some further work, which it is undergoing
right now,'' said David Fuscus, spokesman for the airline
association. ``It will probably be next week before we are ready to
announce it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported that some senators want tougher
language in the deal than the airlines had approved.
</P>
<P>
   There is no guarantee that any industry agreement will blunt the
effort in Congress to pass new laws. One airline critic,
Representative Louise Slaughter, Democrat of New York, dismissed
the talks as ``good public relations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``While I'm glad my friends in the airline industry recognize
they have a problem with poviding poor passenger service, Congress
should not close the books on what is clearly a concern to the
thousands of people who fly,'' Slaughter said.
</P>
<P>
   Under a draft of the agreement, airlines would be required to do
more to help passengers who are forced to remain on board aircraft
during long delays. The airlines would make new efforts to provide
food, water, and restroom facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Other pledges in the proposed 12-point agreement called on
airlines to do more to notify customers of delayed or canceled
flights. Airlines would promise to provide all customers with the
lowest fare available when customers call for a reservation, and to
return lost baggage within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, airlines might give customers 24 hours to cancel
nonrefundable tickets.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear, however, whether airlines would face any
punitive action if they violated any of the pledges in the
agreement. The Air Transport Association would not discuss details
of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airlines stand ready to do everything within our power to
improve customer service,'' said Gerald Greenwald, chairman of
United Airlines and chief of the association's executive committee,
in a press release.
</P>
<P>
   However, the airlines' draft agreement does not include one of
the most controversial proposals now before Congress: a requirement
that airlines compensate travelers who are delayed for more than
two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines have argued that a ``passenger bill of rights'' would
raise costs and have been lobbying against the measures. With
company encouragement, for example, about 15,000 Continental
Airlines employees had written letters to lawmakers opposing the
``bills of rights.''

 &HT;    IBM, Baan devise resource planning process
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ IBM and Baan have developed a way to automate a lot of
the development work for custom computer programs that companies
use to do everything from managing a sales force to tracking what's
in the warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   The work is being done at the IBM Implementation Factory for
Baan, which is housed at one of IBM's Atlanta sites.
</P>
<P>
   The center, which IBM estimates cost $20 million to develop,
staff and house, already employs about 20 people. By year's end,
IBM could hire 80 more. IBM employs about 8,000 people in metro
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Enterprise resource planning, or ERP, is software that lets a
company's data flow beyond department walls. Instead of separate
software for each department, it allows a company to have one
software program for everything: sales force automation to
bookkeeping to shipping and receiving.
</P>
<P>
   Buying the software, installing it and training employees to use
it costs time and money: It can cost $200,000 to $50 million,
depending on the size of the company. Implementation can take from
three or four months to a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   Baan, SAP America, J.D. Edwards and PeopleSoft have 61 percent
of what was a $16.6 billion market for ERP software in 1998,
according to AMR Research, a Boston firm specializing in the ERP
software market.
</P>
<P>
   Companies hire consultants like IBM or Arthur Andersen to
shepherd them through the process of implementing an ERP system,
which includes customizing the software to fit a specific company,
installing it, transferring data from the old system and training
the staff on how to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Plymack, in charge of Baan ERP software for IBM, said
there is a certain amount of redundancy each time a software
program is developed for a company.
</P>
<P>
   That sameness was used to create templates that automated 60
percent to 80 percent of the process.
</P>
<P>
   The new implementation factory adds templates for training
employees and transferring the data from the company's old computer
system to the new one. AMR estimates the new IBM process could
automate 80 percent to 90 percent of the ERP implementation.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's Plymack said the new process could cut implementation time
and cost in half. He said IBM plans to develop similar centers for
other ERP vendors that IBM works with.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Johnson, a senior analyst with AMR, said IBM's factory
concept is unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other consultants have just the basics,'' he said. ``But this
level of detail, expertise and technology? No one's even close
yet.''

 &HT;    Elvis blitz: Vegas ads targeting Atlantans
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coming your way: A swivel-hipped Elvis and
high-stepping showgirls.
</P>
<P>
   No, you haven't been transported back in time to a Las Vegas
lounge. Rather, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority is
betting on an aggressive marketing campaign to lure metro Atlantans
to Glitter Gulch. They're bringing a sample of the glitz here.
</P>
<P>
   During June, Atlantans are being hit with an advertising blitz
that includes billboards, radio and television spots, and maybe not
the King himself, but certainly a good impostor. The authority has
plunked down $900,000 to saturate the area with ads and a Las Vegas
Ultra-Lounge Extravaganza mobile marketing vehicle that is making
appearances at area malls, flea markets and other sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're merely trying to appeal to residents of Atlanta that Las
Vegas is a tremendous entertainment resort destination, and we'd
like them to think of us the next time they plan a leisure trip or
vacation,'' said Jim Gentleman, group director of R&AMP;R Advertising
in Las Vegas, marketing agency for the convention authority.
Portland, Ore., was targeted with a similar project in May.
</P>
<P>
   While the obvious attraction is the casinos, Gentleman said the
city wants to put the word out that there's much more to do in Las
Vegas. He said the city is rich in restaurants, shopping and family
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the latest individual city figures available, about
350,000 Atlantans visited Las Vegas. But based on the availability
of airline seats between the two cities, that has the potential to
double, Gentleman said. He said while the authority hopes Atlantans
will fly to Las Vegas directly, it's also hoping to lure travelers
flying to Los Angeles, which is just a short drive or plane ride
away.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Howard, executive vice president of tourism and public
relations for the Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau, called
the marketing campaign ``smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Other cities, domestic and international, have done similar
campaigns here, he said. But the Las Vegas blitz is among the
largest to hit the metro area. The ACVB would be hindered from
doing a campaign of the same magnitude because it doesn't have the
marketing budget of a Las Vegas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a lot more dollars than Atlanta. They have 15 times
more money,'' Howard said. Additionally, he said, the bulk of metro
Atlanta's leisure travel business comes from within a 300-mile
radius of the city, so most marketing efforts are concentrated
regionally. ``Atlanta is a tourist mecca for those in smaller
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas' biggest competitors for the Atlanta market include
such regional hot spots as Orlando and the Gulf Coast. For
instance, AirTran offers direct service from Atlanta to the
Gulfport/Biloxi, Miss., area, which has a growing casino industry.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Lofton, a spokeswoman for the Mississippi Gulf Coast
Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau, said Atlanta has always been
considered an important market for the Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have gaming, the beach and family entertainment,'' she
said. ``Of course, for Atlantans, we feel like we're their best
bargain. We're close by and we can give them what Las Vegas gives
them and more. Plus it doesn't cost as much to get here.

COMMENTARY: THE FRUITS OF VICTORY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By A.M. ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   But _ why aren't we celebrating? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After all, we won, didn't we? The Kosovars will get to go home,
won't they? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes, we did encourage Slobodan Milosevic to drive them
from those homes by giving him advance notice of when we would
attack and assuring him not to worry about our sending in troops. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All right, all right, those were mistakes; shut up about them.
At least now the million or so Kosovars we were supposed to be
helping can pick up lives in their broken homes in smashed
villages. Can't they?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Somebody will put up the money to fix up the homes. Isn't that
so, perhaps? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then there will be real peace, won't there? Naturally, to keep
the Kosovars and Serbs from killing each other, we will have to
maintain enough troops there for _ oh, for about a generation.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But we are already doing that in Bosnia, so what is the big deal
about sending off 7,000 or so more Americans _ to start with _ to
Yugoslavia? Let's not be petty about that; we are into the Balkan
wars far too deep to quibble.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it won't be dangerous duty. The Kosovar army of Yugoslav
citizens who count themselves Albanians won't take advantage of the
departure of Serbian forces to take revenge on civilian Serbs. Will
it? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And the Serbs in Serbia _ they won't harbor a grudge against us,
will they, for bombing their power plants, their factories, homes,
hospitals, bridges and of course relatives, with a destructiveness
only the Germans had achieved against the Serbs, in World War II? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they will forgive what the Germans did to them. About that
time, they and their children will forgive us too, isn't that
possible? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And the upside! Look at what we win. We saved NATO's face and
President Clinton's, and Madeleine Albright's. Her mouth foretold a
quickie war. Maybe actually not saved their faces _ but at least
wiped them off a bit.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So we will be able to walk tall in the world for bombing Serbia
into slivers. I mean, when the fear of America dies down in some
countries that one day we will fly over their lands to bomb them
into submission for not carrying out our orders.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You know, countries like India that are not about to surrender
Kashmir without all-out war, or Israel, whose mind it has crossed
that if NATO could bomb a neighbor that had not attacked its
members first, why shouldn't the Arab League exercise the same
privilege against Israel and eventually ask the U.N. for approval?
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Remember _ we have indicted Milosevic for war crimes. Yes, the
fact that we never indicted Franjo Tudjman of Croatia, our own
private dictator, for driving 300,000 Serbs out, is embarrassing.
But at least the Serbian killer will have to spend his vacations at
home, or maybe someplace in Russia. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe all that is why we are not celebrating the great victory.
People like myself, who have spent years struggling to get our
country to use its political and economic power for human rights,
saw its leaders bumble into another Balkan war using bombs instead
of the brains God should have given them. The Bosnian frightfulness
has wound up in the partition that without foreign interference
Muslims, Croats and Serbs could have had a decade ago, without
war. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We have seen our country launch a war, first by futile
ultimatum, then by a slovenly planned war that from the beginning
brought more suffering to Kosovars and Serbian civilians than to
Milosevic and his troops. Far too many Americans wrote and talked
of Serbs, our allies in battles we should remember, as if they were
bugs.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To those Kosovars who will return or seek safe lives elsewhere,
for Serbs who will one day eliminate Milosevic, go our embraces. To
Clinton and his fellow ``leaders'' _ our contempt for their human
and security ``values.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton and his NATO comrades were busy bombing Serbia and
Kosovo they were permitting the destruction of the U.N. arms
inspection of Iraq _ the one barrier against Saddam Hussein's path
to nuclear, biological and chemical weapons.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That is a disaster for all nations, for all human rights
struggles. If America remembers the Clinton-Albright bungling in
Iraq, China and Yugoslavia, and demands that any presidential or
senatorial candidate separate from them, he may have reason for
some satisfaction _ but for champagne and parades, none.

 &HT;    Renovation presents tough choices _ even for a pro
 &HT;    By Danny Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Don't try this at home.
</P>
<P>
   That seems like odd advice coming from a remodeling pro. But
after renovating his 1930s Atlanta home, Craig Kennedy admits the
job is no model for his clients. Although he and his wife, Lisa,
were pleased with the outcome, some decisions made along the way
proved inefficient and costly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did things the hard way,'' said Kennedy, a partner in
HammerSmith, an Atlanta design/build firm. ``Like most homeowners,
we had no idea what we were getting into. Once you move in, it's
hard to renovate.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, kitchens and baths, typically the most expensive _ and
disruptive _ remodeling projects, should be done while the house is
vacant. But like many young home buyers, the Kennedys couldn't
afford to do everything they wanted when they bought their Glendale
Estates home six years ago. So they tackled a variety of projects,
including the kitchen, in phases.
</P>
<P>
   That meant the renovation, like their tastes, continued to
evolve. Driving some of the changes were two family members _
Davis, 3, and Henry, 4 months _ who were born since they launched
the project.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other homeowners, the Kennedys didn't fall victim to the
typical remodeling pitfalls _ hiring a contractor without first
checking references, putting down too much money up front, failing
to put all terms in writing. But when the homeowner is in the
business, the process can be frustrating in other ways, Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough remodeling for yourself. I'm exposed to so much
stuff every day in my work. I see it, and I want it,'' he said.
``So we had to make some tough decisions that I usually have to ask
my clients to do.''
</P>
<P>
   They started by making just enough improvements to make their
home attractive and functional.
</P>
<P>
   The 1937 house had some structural problems _ the attic sagged
about 4 inches, some structural sills were rotten _ that required
repairs. While the three bathrooms had never been updated, the
Kennedys chose to only ``jazz them up a little'' for now, he said,
painting the walls in decorative finishes.
</P>
<P>
   In a second phase, they replaced the siding, selecting vinyl the
same size as wood to make the exterior appear old, replaced the
windows and refinished the hardwood floors.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the Kennedys tackled finished attic space, where they
created a den and office. Vinyl floors, jalousie windows and
fluorescent lights were traded for wall-to-wall carpet, new windows
and track lights. They also opened the office space by vaulting the
ceiling and adding skylights.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the back yard, building terraces and retaining walls
to correct drainage.
</P>
<P>
   And finally there was that kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Kitchen of their dreams
</P>
<P>
   Craig wanted the kitchen to contain everything, from a fireplace
and breakfast area to appliances with the latest bells and
whistles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the remodeler's curse,'' said Lisa, an attorney turned
full-time mom.
</P>
<P>
   But finances required the couple to approach the room in phases
_ a process they don't regret because it gave them time to get to
know the space and determine their needs.
</P>
<P>
   They began by replacing its laminate countertops with granite
and installing a new sink. Open, stainless steel restaurant-style
shelves were added as temporary storage, but they wound up liking
them so much they kept them instead of hanging new wall cabinets.
``We really fought the traditional kitchen so we went without
them,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the floors, ceiling and walls, all inspired by
kitchens in Tuscany where the Kennedys once vacationed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest response we get is to the floor. When we moved in
we had no kids, just dogs, so we've since made it child proof,''
Lisa said of the Italian ceramic tile in three sizes and a combo of
colors, including rust, mauve, tan and gray, that hides dirt.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedys opened up more of the attic to create a cathedral
ceiling with Tuscan-style cedar trusses, where track lighting was
installed to supplement canned fixtures.
</P>
<P>
   Then the dangers of not having a master plan for the room began
to unravel.
</P>
<P>
   Dream or nightmare?
</P>
<P>
   New windows had been installed on each side of the stove, but
one later had to be removed when the couple decided to purchase a
48-inch wide Sub Zero refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we decided the walls were the problem,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   So they added old-style ceramic tile in a running-bond pattern
half way up the walls. Above, they applied an old plaster finish,
made of plaster of Paris, latex paint and tinted wax, to the
Sheetrock.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of surfaces here,'' Craig said, ``but when you
spend a lot of time in the kitchen, things like that and proper
lighting really matter.''
</P>
<P>
   And spending time there proved something else: The Kennedys
wanted an eat-in kitchen, but a table and chairs made the new
kitchen crowded. Craig's parents suggested they convert the
adjacent dining room into a breakfast room and open it to the
kitchen by removing a wall. In place of the table, an island with
roll-out shelves gave them much-needed counter space.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, lack of planning, along with special features such
as roll-out windows with no center bar, a custom-designed range
hood and a child-proof dishwasher, made the $100,000 kitchen
project far more expensive than planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you manage a project, you can get good results,'' Craig
said. ``We did it all in phases so that spread it all out.''
</P>
<P>
   The hard-learned lessons haven't cooled the Kennedys' remodeling
fever; they next plan to expand their bedroom to make a master
suite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're getting close to being done,'' he said. ``We've
created a lifestyle out of renovation, so when we're done, does
that mean we move for a new lifestyle?''
</P>
<P>
   The couple don't think so. ``We like this house,'' Craig said.
``It isn't perfect . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   But what old house is?
</P>
<P>
   B E F O R E Y O U R E M O D E L
</P>
<P>
   Remodeling can be frustrating enough with the barrage of
decisions and constant disruption that accompany a project. But
those challenges pale in comparison with being victimized by
unreliable contractors and shoddy workmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Before launching a renovation project, be sure to:
</P>
<P>
   -- Check with real estate agents for property values in your
neighborhood before deciding how much you should invest.
</P>
<P>
   -- Develop a realistic budget. Add at least 10 percent because
most remodels run over either from inaccurate budget forecasting or
from additions to the original plan.
</P>
<P>
   -- Ask friends for references on contractors they have used and
inspect their work.
</P>
<P>
   -- Interview several contractors who are licensed and have
Workers' Compensation and general liability insurance. Ask to see
licenses and insurance certificates as proof. All general estimates
for the work should be free.
</P>
<P>
   -- Ask contractors how long their companies have been in
business (It typically takes at least five years to establish a
financially sound business).
</P>
<P>
   -- Check court records to determine whether the contractor has
been sued.
</P>
<P>
   -- Make sure you can communicate well with the contractor
because misunderstanding can lead to cost overruns and delays.
</P>
<P>
   -- Insist on a written contract once you hire a contractor that
indicates the estimated start and completion dates and descriptions
of the work, materials and prices.
</P>
<P>
   -- Check to see if the contract includes a warranty covering
workmanship and materials.
</P>
<P>
   -- Ask for working drawings to ensure your ideas have been
properly translated.
</P>
<P>
   -- Make sure no work is done until the contractor purchases the
necessary building permits.
</P>
<P>
   -- Don't pay cash for work and don't pay more than one-third of
the cost in advance, one-third midway into the project and the
balance upon completion.
</P>
<P>
   -- Don't sign a completion certificate for the job before it has
been inspected and properly completed.
</P>

   ABLE SENTRY BASE, Macedonia _ Moving to secure the peace in the
wake of war, NATO commanders here spent Thursday positioning a
powerful ground combat army to begin pouring northward across the
border into Kosovo as early as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO peacekeepers mustered, hundreds of Yugoslav troops began
filing out of northern Kosovo in convoys of military vehicles, the
first stages of a retreat that prompted the U.S.-led alliance to
suspend its bombing campaign against Yugoslavia after 78 days of
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton claimed a moral victory in the
11-week campaign, saying the NATO strikes had ended, if not halted,
Serb atrocities the alliance claims forced more than 1 million
ethnic Albanians to flee their homes in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have achieved a victory for a safer world, for our
democratic values and for a stronger America,'' Clinton said in a
televised address from the Oval Office Thursday night. ``An
aggression against an innocent people has been contained and is
being turned back.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stressed that NATO warplanes stood by to resume bombing
if Serb forces renege on the promise their commanders made
Wednesday to exit Kosovo by June 20.
</P>
<P>
   He warned the nation that the peacekeeping mission carries grave
risks. ``There may well be casualties,'' Clinton cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   And he braced the nation for the possibility that U.S. troops
might be required to spend years in Kosovo restoring order and
peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should put a timetable on it,'' Clinton said.
``We will define our objectives and proceed to implement them.''
</P>
<P>
   If NATO claimed victory, so did Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, president of
Yugoslavia, used what's left of his state-run television network to
praise his forces as ``the greatest army in the world,'' and try to
convince his fellow Serbs that the destruction they endured had
saved Kosovo for future generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Citizens, the aggression is over, peace has prevailed
over violence,'' said Milosevic, appearing in his trademark
double-breasted suit. ``We did not give up Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, the United Nations Security Council met in New York
to approve a resolution that effectively hands control of Kosovo
over to a handful of U.N. civilian agencies and a NATO peacekeeping
force expected to swell to 50,000 troops within 45 days.
</P>
<P>
   The figure does not include troops from Russia. U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State Strobe Talbott spent Thursday in Moscow
discussing the prospects for adding Russian troops to the
peacekeeping contingent, as both Washington and Moscow have agreed
would be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, NATO's 19 nations have pledged to send 44,000
peacekeepers to Kosovo; 11 NATO partner countries have pledged
about 5,000 others.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is ready for its new mission, a mission to bring people
back to their homes and to build a lasting and just peace in
Kosovo,'' NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana told reporters in
Brussels, moments after suspending the air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've insisted on the fact that NATO has absolutely nothing
against the people of Yugoslavia,'' Solana said.
</P>
<P>
   In a message to Kosovo's ethnic Serbs, Solana said they have
nothing to fear from the advancing NATO forces, vowed to protect
them and urged them not to flee the war-ravaged province as Kosovar
Albanian refugees return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sincerely hope that the Serbs in Kosovo will remain in their
homes,'' said Solana. ``The NATO forces will defend their rights,
just as it will defend the rights of all other ethnic communities
in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cologne, Germany, U.S. and European diplomats called for
establishing a Pact of Stability for Southeast Europe, an effort to
help stitch the war-torn Balkans back into the rapidly modernizing
region with the help of as much as $6 billion a year in foreign
aid.
</P>
<P>
   The issue seemed likely to dominate much of the agenda a week
from now, when Clinton joins Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
British Prime Minister Tony Blair and the heads of state from
Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan for a summit of the
so-called Group of Eight, or G-8, in Cologne.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe cannot be fully secure,'' Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said following the meeting in Cologne, ``unless its
southeast corner is free from strife.''
</P>
<P>
   The first crucial step, though, in what promises to be a long
and costly endeavor was taking shape here, where British troops
were preparing to form the vanguard of the NATO peacekeeping force
inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shall be off quite soon,'' said British Lt. Gen. Michael
Jackson, who will command the NATO peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
   Some 3,000 U.S. troops _ Marines and Army infantry forces _
poured into Macedonia throughout the day, prepared to enter Kosovo
and to counter any threat they might face there.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to make sure that the forces that come in to keep the
peace are in fact the most powerful forces around,'' said U.S. Army
Col. Jeffrey Schlosser, who flew here Thursday at the head of a
column of 26 U.S. Army helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   Among these were a dozen Apache attack helicopters. If NATO
commanders gave the orders, the Apaches would be available to plant
Hellfire missiles on anyone interfering with the peacekeepers _
whether that be Serb renegades or diehards of rebel the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is any sort of violence, the Apaches are like a big
stick,'' said Schlosser. ``If anything bad does happen in Kosovo,
we can protect our forces so they won't get caught between opposing
forces.''
</P>
<P>
   An advance team from the British Fifth Paratrooper Regiment and
British Combat Engineers is expected to cross into Kosovo by
helicopter as early as Friday. After the British combat engineers
have cleared mines and barricades from the main road into the
provincial capital Pristina, the main initial column of Western
peacekeepers is likely to surge across the border on Sunday. That
first NATO occupation column may be 1,000 vehicles long.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least, is the scenario provided late Thursday to
Canadian journalists from NATO liaison officers with access to the
exact plans for NATO's entry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence must end immediately,'' said Jackson, making clear
that the admonition applied as equally to the KLA, made up of
ethnic Albanians, as to Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson warned KLA commanders that it would be ``foolish in the
extreme,'' to fire on withdrawing Serbs or take other actions that
would impede their departure from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said retreating Yugoslav forces ``are being
cooperative'' in providing NATO officers detailed maps showing the
locations of minefields and boobie traps. And he said he had
received a report that Yugoslav explosives experts were dismantling
the explosives from a bridge and tunnel complex at Kacanic, on the
road to Pristina, which had been designed to block any northward
invasion through Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever the first big column of peacekeepers moves forward, the
United States will be providing only about 15 percent of the troops
_ but most of the combat punch.
</P>
<P>
   America's most heavily armored battle tanks, the M1A1 Abrams
that captured Kuwait a decade ago, are being flown in to this NATO
camp's busy airstrip. By Friday night, about 14 of the tanks are
expected to be poised to go into Kosovo. Another 14 were scheduled
to arrive as early as next week from a NATO tank base in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday night, U.S. Marines were unloading massive
amphibious armored personnel carriers called Amtracs from flatbed
trucks that jammed the entryways to this makeshift NATO base, which
has sprung up next to the runway of the airport at the Macedonia
capital Skopje.
</P>
<P>
   The Army, meanwhile, was moving in a column of about 15 of its
Bradley armored personnel carriers across a mountain pass from
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday night, the United States will have ready to send into
Kosovo an elite force of 1,700 Army combat troops, including
paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne Division, plus another roughly
2,000 Marines of the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit based at Camp
Lejeune, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Counting support troops and other units already stationed in
Macedonia, the United States will be ready by this weekend to field
7,000 peacekeepers, most of them from elite units trained for
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Britain is deploying a considerably larger peacekeeping
contingent, and sizeable contingents also will come from France and
Germany and lesser-sized units from roughly 15 other powers.

THE MASTER OF THE COMEBACK DOES IT AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID SHRIBMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOVER, N.H. _ We interrupt this presidential campaign to bring
you a surprising announcement.
</P>
<P>
   As candidates follow the curving roads around this state, as
Iowa and New Hampshire gird for this week's campaign debut of Texas
Governor George W. Bush, and as activists build organizations for
the race to succeed Bill Clinton, the president finds himself in
two astonishing places:
</P>
<P>
   At the center of things in the seventh year of his presidency.
And occupying the moral high ground in American politics.
</P>
<P>
   With Thursday night's Oval Office remarks hailing the West's
``victory for a safer world'' and its success overcoming barbarity
in the Balkans, the master of the comeback _ the magician with the
gift of turning the world upside down, the political figure who has
made a career of defying expectations _ has done it again.
</P>
<P>
   To the immense anger, frustration, and bewilderment of his
critics _ a group that at one time or another these past seven
years has included almost every corner of the political
establishment and large portions of the American electorate _
President Clinton once again emerged tattered but triumphant.
</P>
<P>
   Only a year ago, as the drama of the White House sex scandal
deepened, the president still faced a determined independent
counsel and a cadre of House Republicans hungry to impeach him and
prevent him even from entering the seventh year of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Only a year ago, as the president was hiding behind legalisms in
his determination to avoid the prosecutor's grip and was
constructing rhetorical ramparts in his effort to redefine what
constituted a sexual episode, the president was a prisoner in the
ethical valley, far from the moral heights.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when most two-term presidents are in the least productive
part of their eight years in the White House, Clinton is a
victorious commander in chief, showing mastery over the military
services who treated him with skepticism, courage in the face of a
difficult diplomatic problem, and resolve in a struggle against
mass murder and what the president called ``the awful ethnic
cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, when the political establishment had written off his
White House years as an embarrassing interlude, Clinton has
reclaimed the moral power he admired in another turn-of-the-century
president, Theodore Roosevelt, who originated the notion of the
``bully pulpit,'' and whom Clinton emulated in early speeches
calling for Americans to fulfill their personal responsibilities in
a civil society.
</P>
<P>
   The soundbite from the evening: ``We did the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Clinton has redrafted his entry in the American
textbook, redefined the office that his would-be successors are
striving to win and, at a time when his wife is seeking a Senate
seat from New York, solidified his family's place at the center of
the political debate at the very time he could be expected to be
receding from view.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, the president identified himself with the great
statemen of freedom in the century just about to end.
</P>
<P>
   He said ``we have sent a message of determination and hope to
all the world,'' a remark with echoes of Woodrow Wilson; he said
the United States had ``given confidence to the friends of
freedom,'' a phrase redolent with overtones from John F. Kennedy;
and he vowed, ``We will finish the job,'' a statement harkening
back to a vow Winston Churchill made to Franklin Delano Roosevelt
before the United States even entered World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Though this astonishing recasting of the president and his place
in national life appears to be the result of the mischievous
caprice of forces beyond his control, the broad contours of this
development were taking shape weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   In early spring, as the war for Kosovo began, the White House
invited a small clutch of guests to join Elie Wiesel, the Holocaust
survivor and Nobel Peace Prize recipient, in an East Room
discussion on millennial lessons. There, where Theodore Roosevelt's
children once romped indoors on their ponies, the Clintons listened
to the Boston University scholar deliver an address called ``The
Perils of Indifference'' and then led a conversation about the
nexus between morality and politics.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks about what he called ``a violent century,''
Wiesel spoke of the Holocaust and of the Slavic offensive in Kosovo
and, saluting the president, said, ``This time the world was not
silent.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the capital, the United States Holocaust Memorial
Museum was holding a special exhibition on the St. Louis, a ship
stuffed full of European refugees from Hitler's terror that
approached US shores but was turned back during Franklin
Roosevelt's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The president at that moment clearly was determined to use
Theodore Roosevelt's bully pulpit _ and was just as determined not
to face the puzzling questions that historians have raised about
Franklin Roosevelt's failure to recognize early the implications of
the European Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   In winning at least a temporary victory in a European struggle
that his critics considered unwinnable _ and in succeeding with a
military strategy that his critics considered destined to fail _
the president has once again emerged at the top of the heap.
</P>
<P>
   More than any one achievement, that ability _ the agility to
prevail in the most difficult circumstances, when all the
circumstances are arrayed against him _ may emerge as the Clinton
legacy.

TAX-EXEMPT STATUS REJECTED, CHRISTIAN COALITION REGROUPS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Christian Coalition, a powerhouse in the
Republican Party for the last decade, has been denied tax-exempt
status because of its political activity, officials of the
organization said Thursday, and is reorganizing in an effort to
retain its influence.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, the organization has successfully rallied voters
behind candidates, almost all Republicans, who supported the causes
of religious conservatives at the national, state and local level.
It has been especially influential in Iowa, which holds the first
party caucuses in presidential election years.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last couple of years, the coalition has had some
trouble raising money and its influence has seemed to be waning.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders who have tracked recent developments in the
organization said that it had never recovered from the loss of
Ralph Reed, the politically talented executive director who left
two years ago to become a political consultant in Atlanta, and that
Pat Robertson, the founder and president, was taking complete
control to change the course.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the coalition, which has headquarters in Chesapeake,
Va., announced that Reed's successor, Randy Tate, had been demoted
and that the chief operating officer, Kenneth Hill, would be
leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, four other top officials either resigned or
were discharged. They are Donald P. Hodel, the president; Dave
Welch, the national field director; Arne Owens, the communications
director, and Charles H. Cunningham, the national operations
director.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, officials of the coalition confirmed that its
long-standing application to the Internal Revenue Service for
tax-exempt status would not be approved and that, as a result, the
coalition would be reorganized.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Robertson founded the coalition in 1988 after his
unsuccessful race for the Republican presidential nomination, it
sought tax exemption under section 501(c)(4) of the Internal
Revenue Code.
</P>
<P>
   Donors to such organizations may not deduct their contributions,
but the organizations themselves do not have to pay income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations that have such an exemption are not permitted to
engage in ``substantial'' political activity. The IRS generally has
interpreted this to mean that they could not support parties or
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main activities of the Christian Coalition has been
to prepare voter guides and to distribute them in churches. The
guides generally describe the candidates in a race and leave little
doubt about which one the coalition favors.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1994 Senate race in Virginia between Sen. Charles S.
Robb, a Democrat, and Oliver L. North, a Republican, the guide said
that Robb, who had voted for an appropriation for the National
Endowment for the Arts, favored government-financed obscenity.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Russell, the coalition spokesman, said the group had
recently withdrawn its application for tax exemption. Other
officials said it was withdrawn after it became apparent it would
not be approved.
</P>
<P>
   As is its practice on such matters, the IRS refused to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of tax exemption means that the organization may have
to pay a small amount in income taxes each year. More important, it
may make churches reluctant to allow representatives of the
organization to speak and distribute material during services.
Churches are covered by another section of the tax law that
theoretically does not allow participation in any political
activity.
</P>
<P>
   Russell said the coalition would now be broken up into two
distinct organizations.
</P>
<P>
   One, to be called the Christian Coalition International, would
engage in political activities. This organization would not be
tax-exempt.
</P>
<P>
   A separate group, to be called the Christian Coalition of
America, would concentrate on voter education and would assume the
existing tax-exempt status of the Christian Coalition of Texas,
Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson will assume ``a greatly increased role'' in the daily
operation of the organizations, Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson has recently taken a surprisingly pragmatic approach
to politics. During the impeachment trial last winter, he warned
that President Clinton had won the public relations battle and that
it was perilous for Republicans to expend their energy trying to
remove him from office. He has also conceded that Congress will not
approve a Constitutional amendment outlawing abortion and has said
Republicans should turn to other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, Robertson said he hoped to raise $21 million for
political activities in the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Black, a Republican consultant, said he thought the
Christian Coalition would remain an important organizing force in
many states. Another Republican strategist, Richard N. Bond, who
was director of George Bush's presidential campaign in 1988, agreed
with that assessment but said it was important for the organization
to rise above ``a lingering image of intolerance.''

A CLINTON PROMISE DETERS HOUSE GOP FROM BARRING FUNDS FOR KOSOVO
FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton promised Thursday night to ask
Congress to fund security troops in Kosovo. His last-minute
maneuver stopped House Republicans from barring money for the
force.
</P>
<P>
   That promise, in a faxed letter from Clinton to House Speaker
Dennis Hastert was ``exactly what we wanted,'' said a spokesman for
the speaker, John Feehery. ``It shows that the president can't raid
the defense budget for peacekeeping. If there is going to be a
peacekeeping force, it will have to come out of money that is not
already earmarked for defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter, though deliberately vague, bowed to Congress and
pledged to make a separate budget request for the troops. It
arrived after six hours of fierce argument on the House floor over
the U.S. presence in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people are expecting us to support an effort to
bring peace,'' said House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is duty-bound to keep that peace, Gephardt
said, adding, ``Turning our backs on this effort now would send a
horrible signal.''
</P>
<P>
   The forum for the debate was a $289 billion military-spending
bill that won final passage Thursday night, 365-58. The original
measure had prohibited using the money for combat or peacekeeping
operations in Yugoslavia in fiscal 2000, which begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton's letter arrived, the House voted, 270-155, to
strike the prohibition. The ``yes'' votes included 77 Republicans,
among them Majority Leader Dick Armey and Majority Whip Tom DeLay.
An amendment to ban all spending for peacekeeping in Kosovo lost,
97-328.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never in the history of this country has the Congress voted to
deprive the nation of victory in the battlefield,'' said Rep. Ike
Skelton of Missouri, the ranking Democrat on the Armed Services
Committee who led the fight to remove the ban. ``The votes taken
today will tell whether we keep that victory or whether we sour it
or whether we throw ashes on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, whose approval of financing for the peacekeeping
force is by no means assured, said they feared a long deployment of
U.S. troops as an occupying force in hostile territory. ``After
bombing a country to smithereens, we're now occupying it,'' said
Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas. ``When will it end?''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Donald Manzullo, R-Ill., said the administration had
``destroyed a country'' and ``wasted our precious military
resources.'' Paying for the troops, Manzullo added, is ``fiscally
wrong, and it's morally wrong, and the president needs to be
stopped. This war should never have been started, and the American
taxpayer should not be called upon to complete it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., said Clinton had ``undermined our
national interests'' and ``disguised the costs of this war,''
wasted billions on an ``ill-conceived operation'' that
``accelerated and augmented the tragic refugee crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Souder questioned whether the war had really been won. ``This is
certainly no victory,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Randy Cunningham, R-Calif., called the NATO bombing
unconscionable and its outcome a disaster. ``We have killed
civilians,'' Cunningham said. ``That is not a win. Hundreds of
thousands of people are refugees. That is not a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Republicans sought something more than Clinton's word
that an emergency spending request was forthcoming. ``Get it in
writing,'' Cunningham said. ``I know what the meaning of `is' is.''
</P>
<P>
   The $289 billion sum is greater than the budgets for all other
agencies combined, greater than all military spending by the 10
biggest foreign armies in the world taken together. Nevertheless,
the Pentagon, House Republicans and conservative Democrats say the
U.S. military faces a financial crisis that threatens national
security.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which gives legal authority, not appropriated money,
to the Pentagon programs, backs a 4.8 percent pay increase. It
includes $91 billion for new weapons, including $3.7 billion for
continuing attempts to build a missile-defense system and $3.1
billion to speed production of the F-22 fighter jet. The bill also
cuts the budget for declassifying Pentagon documents, from $200
million to $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate action, the House defeated, 116-307, an amendment
to cut U.S. troops in Europe, from 100,000 to 25,000, over three
years.

 &HT;    New Turner cable channel to put focus on women
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Turner Broadcasting is going after women with a new
cable channel set to launch early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The unnamed channel will feature news, information and how-to
shows, much of it based on magazines such as In Style, Parenting
and Cooking Light, owned by parent Time Warner. The channel will
also draw on a partnership with magazine giant Conde Nast, whose
titles include Vogue, House and Garden and Vanity Fair.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Pat Mitchell, one of Turner Broadcasting's most
powerful executives, will head the channel, which will operate out
of Turner Broadcasting's new studio. The channel will also have a
studio in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women are a huge under-served market and the number one
economic opportunity of the day,'' says Mitchell, producer of CNN's
award-winning series, ``Cold War.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner Broadcasting is the first to see a future in focusing all
of a channel's programming on women. The new channel will face the
well-established Lifetime Television, already in more than 70
million homes nationwide. Another women's channel, Oxygen, is
scheduled to launch in February. If Oxygen is not yet familiar,
some of its principal investors may be: former Nickelodeon boss
Geraldine Laybourne, ``Third Rock from the Sun'' and ``The Cosby
Show'' mastermind Marcy Carsey, and Oprah Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   Lifetime's top executive wondered why it took everyone so long.
But now that it could become a battle, she said, Lifetime is
well-armed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have just experienced our best quarter ever in ratings and
demographics,'' said Carole Black, president and CEO of Lifetime
Television, which recently announced a new lineup of shows,
featuring such big names as Bette Midler, Dolly Parton and Vanessa
Williams. ``Women represent over 50 percent of the population, they
buy the majority of all products sold, so I can understand why
others are going after women now.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Lifetime's success, says Kris Magel, an analyst with
DeWitt Media, is that the network has been smart to create an
``emotional relationship'' with its female viewers, especially
those in the 25-54 and 35-64 age range, who ``have all the
disposable income.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell says her channel will differ from Oxygen and Lifetime,
which is heavy on entertainment programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing you won't see on our channel is sitcoms, network
reruns and dramatic series,'' says Mitchell. About her competitors,
she adds, ``There is plenty of room for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman's channel, Turner Broadcasting's 19th, also will face
the difficult task of finding distributors in an increasingly
competitive industry. Laybourne has already signed up some big
cable operators, including the 5 million subscribers of Charter
Communications. She is expected to announce other distribution
deals at the National Cable Television Association in Chicago next
week.

   Turner Broadcasting is planning to launch a new cable TV channel
designed to appeal specifically to women sometime early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The channel is as yet unnamed but will feature news, information
and how-to shows, much of the programming based on magazines owned
by parent Time Warner. The channel will also draw on the content of
magazine giant Conde Nast, a unit of Advance Publications.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of a partnership agreement between Time Warner and Advance
are still in negotiation and Turner Broadcasting executives
declined to discuss them.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner and Conde Nast are among the largest magazine
publishers and each has a number of titles marketed to women. For
Time Warner, those titles include In Style, Parenting and Cooking
Light. Conde Nast's titles include House and Garden, Glamour and
Mademoiselle.
</P>
<P>
   Together, Time Warner's and Conde Nast's women's magazines reach
some 100 million readers a month, the companies say.
</P>
<P>
   Turner Broadcasting's new channel will be headed by veteran
television newscaster and executive Pat Mitchell, who currently
works at CNN. Mitchell has been working on the woman's channel for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Why, though, is Turner Broadcasting moving to air the channel
now?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because women are a huge under-served market and the number
one economic opportunity of the day,'' says Mitchell. ``And that's
a good business reason for the channel.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner Broadcasting is not alone in seeing a potentially big

Lifetime and it reaches more than 70 million homes nationwide.

time as Turner Broadcasting. That channel is called Oxygen and is
the brainchild of Geraldine Laybourne, the cable TV veteran

</P>
<P>
   Mitchell says her channel will differ from Lifetime and Oxygen,
both of which feature fiction entertainment such as movies, sitcoms
and drama series.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Mitchell's channel will offer news, information and
discussion about issues considered important to women. The topics
include parenting, fashion, health and lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing you won't see on our channel is sitcoms, network
reruns and dramatic series,'' says Mitchell. About her competitors,
she adds, ``There is plenty of room for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman's channel, Turner Broadcasting's 19th, has no
distribution as of yet. Finding distribution remains hard these
days in the cable industry.
</P>
<P>
   But Mitchell says she expects the channel to initially show up
on the new digital tiers of cable operators. It is here that most
operators are adding new channels. Subscribers pay additional fees
to receive digital packages from their cable operators.
</P>
<P>
   The woman's channel would be run out of the entertainment
division of Turner Broadcasting in Atlanta. It will use the new
digital studio under construction at the company's Techwood campus.
The channel would also have a studio in New York.

   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's enduring legacy in foreign
affairs may be his efforts to reconcile warring factions inside
sovereign nations.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by international inaction during the slaughters in Bosnia
and Rwanda, the president has devoted much of his foreign policy to
crafting compromises designed to ease the ethnic, religious or
cultural animosities that often lead to bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton helped fashion compromises in Northern Ireland, Bosnia
and the Middle East. He opted for talk over combat in Haiti,
dispatching a team of heavy-hitters _ former President Jimmy
Carter, retired Gen. Colin Powell and then-Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga. _
on the eve of the U.S. invasion in 1994 to persuade a defiant
strongman to step aside.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has worked, as well, with African leaders to help stem
ethnic struggles in Burundi and in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   In an 11-minute address from the Oval Office Thursday night, the
president celebrated the U.S.-led campaign against ethnic
intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This victory brings a new hope that when a people are singled
out for destruction because of their heritage and religious faith _
and we can do something about it _ the world will not look the
other way,'' he said.

and the Middle East. He opted for talk over combat in Haiti,
dispatching a team of heavy-hitters _ former President Jimmy
Carter, retired Gen. Colin Powell and then-Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga. _
on the eve of the U.S. invasion in 1994 to persuade a defiant
strongman to step aside.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has worked, as well, with African leaders to help stem
ethnic struggles in Burundi and in Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   In an 11-minute address from the Oval Office Thursday night, the
president celebrated the U.S.-led campaign against ethnic
intolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This victory brings a new hope that when a people are singled
out for destruction because of their heritage and religious faith _
and we can do something about it _ the world will not look the
other way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the 79-day military campaign had ``sent a message
of determination and hope'' that the international community will
combat ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a world too divided by fear among people of different
racial, ethnic and religious groups, we have given confidence to
the friends of freedom and pause to those who would exploit human
differences for inhuman purposes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and its allies took a stand, Clinton said
earlier, adding: ``The United States should feel vindicated when
the people go home, and when they're safe, and when we can say that
we, as a nation, have played a role in reversing ethnic
cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's foreign policy has been distinguished by heavy
reliance on personal diplomacy with the leaders of Russia and
China, a willingness to threaten military action, and reliance on
high-tech warfare with low risks of casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's air-only operation against Yugoslavia was emblematic
of the tactics he used to strike Iraq, Sudan and Afghanistan in the
past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Dallek, a professor of history at Boston University and
the author of ``Hail to the Chief: The Making and Unmaking of
American Presidents,'' said Clinton's willingness to confront
burgeoning humanitarian catastrophes may become the model for
American foreign policy in 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton may be establishing a new paradigm for American
foreign policy _ that whenever we see ethnic cleansing, even the
mere hint of genocide, it will be resisted by the United States,''
Dallek said. ``The United States may be emerging as the world
policeman to fight ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Simon Serfaty, director of European studies at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, warned that
Clinton's willingness to intervene must be matched by a willingness
to follow through once hostilities end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe any of Clinton's interventions will prove to
be constructive in the long term,'' Serfaty said. ``There has just
not been enough follow up.''
</P>
<P>
   Reconstruction lags in Bosnia, a former republic of Yugoslavia
ravaged by ethnic conflict. Nations are behind on promised
donations to a $5.1 billion recovery fund. Barely 574,000 of the
1.8 million uprooted Bosnians have returned to their homes more
than three years after a U.S.-brokered peace agreement ended the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Reconstruction in Kosovo may require $30 billion, difficulties
lie ahead persuading uprooted Kosovars to return home and the
secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army may resist disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may well turn out that we've done the easy part with regard
to Kosovo,'' Serfaty said. ``Now we're there and we have no idea
what we're facing or how long it will take. We'll need follow up.''

<P>
   White House aides say the roots of Clinton's approach lie in the
frustrations of watching the international community stand idly by
as 200,000 people died in Bosnia during four years of communal
warfare there, and as more than 1 million people died in Rwanda in
internecine fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton came face-to-face with the human cost of inaction during
a stopover at Kilgali airport in Rwanda in 1998, when survivors
vividly recalled the horror.
</P>
<P>
   Aides say the experience has shaped Clinton's thinking ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not act quickly enough after the killing began,''
Clinton lamented in remarks to the survivors in the Central African
nation. ``We did not immediately call these crimes by their
rightful name _ `genocide.'''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton referred back to the precedent in his remarks on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Americans should be proud of standing up to the Yugoslav
leadership's crusade to drive Kosovars ``from their land _ dead or
alive,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After what we have done in Bosnia, and the work we have been
doing in Africa to try to prevent a Rwanda from ever occurring
again, we will be able to see the world go into the 21st century
with a more humane future,'' he said.

BOSNIA IS TESTAMENT TO DIFFICULTY OF KOSOVO MISSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSTAR, Bosnia _ The old bridge across the River Neretva was one
of those places where history spoke for itself. At the bridge, as
at the Great Wall of China, the Pyramids, or the Western Wall in
Jerusalem, the very stones had a pulse. You could feel it.
</P>
<P>
   Now the graceful, white-limestone arch, erected by Ottoman Turks
in the mid-16th century and blasted from its foundations by Bosnian
Croats in the late 20th, lies in pieces on a platform, waiting to
be reconstructed by one of the scores of international governments
and donor agencies trying to put Bosnia back together again.
</P>
<P>
   Physical reconstruction almost certainly will succeed. Such
projects have flowered all over the country since 1995, when the
Dayton accords, a peace agreement brokered by the United States,
put an end to the most savage and destructive fighting Europe had
seen since World War II. But restoring the pulse of the place? That
is a different matter, and may not be possible.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia is full of cautionary tales and lessons for the Americans
and Europeans who, in the wake of the NATO bombing of Serbia, are
setting out to restore 1.4 million ethnic Albanians to their homes
in Kosovo, and to reconstruct their lives in Serbia's southernmost
province. Some lessons tend toward the philosophical, but most are
practical.
</P>
<P>
   Above all is the need for speed. Close behind that comes the
need for a competent civil administration, and the need for the
military to perform some vital civilian tasks to get the return and
reconstruction effort off on the right foot. None of these things
were given immediate high priority in Bosnia, and as a result the
recovery effort has struggled, at best, despite major international
investments of funds and personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international presence here is dysfunctional,'' said
Jacques Klein, a top-ranking official in the Office of the High
Representative, which administers the Dayton accords, in an
interview Thursday. ``We do not want to repeat in Kosovo what we
have done here.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein, a former US Air Force general and veteran diplomat, won
praise for overseeing the reversion of Eastern Slavonia from Serbia
to Croatia before taking on the number two job in Bosnia. What will
be most critically needed in Kosovo, he said, is ``a strong, single
chain of command, with a clearly defined mission, and with
discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   A rule of thumb, supported by research by United Nations
agencies, is that no more than 50 percent of refugees can be
expected to return home once they have been away from their former
lives for a year. Crops are missed, social circles break down, and
children engage in new lives. With each additional year away, the
number likely to return falls again by half.
</P>
<P>
   Because this reality was not quickly taken to heart, ``we have
to work very hard in Bosnia for small results,'' said Andy
Bearpark, the chief official for refugee return and reconstruction
under Klein.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, while jealousies and turf wars are to be
expected in any major international relief effort, ``I have never
seen it as bad'' as in the Balkans, where many of the nations and
relief agencies involved have long histories and private agendas
with local political groups.
</P>
<P>
   It is not difficult to find the results of this situation.
</P>
<P>
   High on a dry eastern hillside in Mostar, just past the pile of
stones that used to be the Orthodox Cathedral, a large yellow van
is parked against the wall of a former parish building. From a
distance, it looks like a workmen's van, and suggests the church is
under reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could be further from the truth. The van contains the
worldly possessions of a middle-aged couple who had an apartment in
the neighborhood before the war. Family members made a gift of the
van when the couple was told to get out of Germany. They are
settling more and more deeply into the rubble, building a laundry
area here, a bathing area there, and becoming increasingly bitter
at the reconstruction work going on around them that they do not
understand and that will do nothing for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West gives all this money to Bosnia and Herzegovina, and
the people have none of it,'' the man said, spitting in the dust.
``We can't do anything. We just sit here.''
</P>
<P>
   Down in the valley, Jelka Kebo, director of the Mostar Culture
Center, which sponsors multiethnic programs for youth and women, is
facing problems of a bureaucratic nature.
</P>
<P>
   The center had some early triumphs, including a youth radio
station and educational programs, that won support from the
European Community and some foundations. But the support is spotty,
and can vanish when she needs it most.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the center is the lead local agency for the Mostar
Summer Festival, a 20-year-old event that has assumed heightened
importance since the war because it attracts the whole community.
</P>
<P>
   ``We received a letter from the Council of Europe that they will
be donors,'' Kebo said. ``We have not received a penny, and the
festival is July 1 _ unless we cancel it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mato Zovkic, the Roman Catholic vicar general of Sarajevo,
said that ``the foreign assistance is far too complicated, both
that which comes from foreign governments and that which comes from
NGOs,'' or nongovernmental organizations. ``They all look very
busy, but there is overlap, duplication, and not very much happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the need for their presence,'' Zovkic said. ``Without
them there would be war. But I wish there were more coordination,
more efficiency. Instead, they struggle for their own visions of
Bosnia. . . . You USA people can hardly grasp why we insist so much
on our ethnicity.''
</P>
<P>
   In Europe and the United States, people tend to speak of
repairing societies here which have been damaged by the bitter
years of war. But if the goal is to have democracy and market
economies, ``creating,'' rather than rebuilding, is the correct way
to describe the goal.
</P>
<P>
   There was never democracy, in Bosnia or in Kosovo, before the
onset of the wars in the early 1990s, and no free economy above the
level of local markets. Democracy and open economies, if that is
what there is to be, will have to built through education and
training efforts that easily could take decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of democracy and democratic traditions are the
biggest problems'' in the region, said Jakob Finci, director of the
Soros Foundation in Bosnia. ``You cannot bring democracy here by
NATO and OSCE,'' the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe. ``The historic memory is of the communist days, when the
decisions were all made in the central committee, and then everyone
in Parliament just raised their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Making democratic processes and an open economy priorities would
require steps that many who are preparing to launch the relief
operation in Kosovo would rather avoid.
</P>
<P>
   These include such sticky subjects as detaching Kosovo from
Yugoslavia until Yugoslavia becomes a democracy, and disarming the
Kosovo Liberation Army, which is not a democracy-friendly force nor
likely to surrender its weapons willingly. Western leaders will be
tempted to accept a few truckloads of weapons and declare the KLA
disarmed, knowing full well that it is not, rather than risk losing
soldiers disarming it forcibly.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting fuzzy thinking about these or other goals, said Albert
Rohan, secretary general of the Austrian Foreign Ministry, is a
formula for failure. ``Better for Kosovo to have the plans very
strictly and clearly defined.''
</P>
<P>
   A much more serious concern, according to a well-informed
diplomatic source in Bosnia, is whether some of the most important
players in the soon-to-begin Kosovo effort are willing to address
some of the highest priority needs.
</P>
<P>
   There is, for example, a lack of clarity between the United
Nations and the OSCE about who is to do what in Kosovo, the source
said.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, military leaders have been told their troops will have
to perform some basic civilian functions, such as setting up water
supplies and electrical systems, and they are unhappy about it.
That leaves Western civilian leaders worried about whether the
military will be prepared to do those tasks within the next few
days, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the source said, the NATO alliance has put the European
Commission in charge of reconstruction, and many relief veterans in
Bosnia believe ``you could hardly find a less competent agency to
do a job of this magnitude with any speed.''

THE MASTER OF THE COMEBACK DOES IT AGAIN

   HANOVER, N.H. _ We interrupt this presidential campaign to bring
you a surprising announcement.
</P>
<P>
   As candidates follow the curving roads around this state, as
Iowa and New Hampshire gird for this week's campaign debut of Texas
Governor George W. Bush, and as activists build organizations for
the race to succeed Bill Clinton, the president finds himself in
two astonishing places:
</P>
<P>
   At the center of things in the seventh year of his presidency.
And occupying the moral high ground in American politics.
</P>
<P>
   With Thursday night's Oval Office remarks hailing the West's
``victory for a safer world'' and its success overcoming barbarity
in the Balkans, the master of the comeback _ the magician with the
gift of turning the world upside down, the political figure who has
made a career of defying expectations _ has done it again.
</P>
<P>
   To the immense anger, frustration, and bewilderment of his
critics _ a group that at one time or another these past seven
years has included almost every corner of the political
establishment and large portions of the American electorate _
President Clinton once again emerged tattered but triumphant.
</P>
<P>
   Only a year ago, as the drama of the White House sex scandal
deepened, the president still faced a determined independent
counsel and a cadre of House Republicans hungry to impeach him and
prevent him even from entering the seventh year of his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Only a year ago, as the president was hiding behind legalisms in
his determination to avoid the prosecutor's grip and was
constructing rhetorical ramparts in his effort to redefine what
constituted a sexual episode, the president was a prisoner in the
ethical valley, far from the moral heights.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when most two-term presidents are in the least productive
part of their eight years in the White House, Clinton is a
victorious commander in chief, showing mastery over the military
services who treated him with skepticism, courage in the face of a
difficult diplomatic problem, and resolve in a struggle against
mass murder and what the president called ``the awful ethnic
cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, when the political establishment had written off his
White House years as an embarrassing interlude, Clinton has
reclaimed the moral power he admired in another turn-of-the-century
president, Theodore Roosevelt, who originated the notion of the
``bully pulpit,'' and whom Clinton emulated in early speeches
calling for Americans to fulfill their personal responsibilities in
a civil society.
</P>
<P>
   The soundbite from the evening: ``We did the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Clinton has redrafted his entry in the American
textbook, redefined the office that his would-be successors are
striving to win and, at a time when his wife is seeking a Senate
seat from New York, solidified his family's place at the center of
the political debate at the very time he could be expected to be
receding from view.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, the president identified himself with the great
statemen of freedom in the century just about to end.
</P>
<P>
   He said ``we have sent a message of determination and hope to
all the world,'' a remark with echoes of Woodrow Wilson; he said
the United States had ``given confidence to the friends of
freedom,'' a phrase redolent with overtones from John F. Kennedy;
and he vowed, ``We will finish the job,'' a statement harkening
back to a vow Winston Churchill made to Franklin Delano Roosevelt
before the United States even entered World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Though this astonishing recasting of the president and his place
in national life appears to be the result of the mischievous
caprice of forces beyond his control, the broad contours of this
development were taking shape weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   In early spring, as the war for Kosovo began, the White House
invited a small clutch of guests to join Elie Wiesel, the Holocaust
survivor and Nobel Peace Prize recipient, in an East Room
discussion on millennial lessons. There, where Theodore Roosevelt's
children once romped indoors on their ponies, the Clintons listened
to the Boston University scholar deliver an address called ``The
Perils of Indifference'' and then led a conversation about the
nexus between morality and politics.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks about what he called ``a violent century,''
Wiesel spoke of the Holocaust and of the Slavic offensive in Kosovo
and, saluting the president, said, ``This time the world was not
silent.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the capital, the United States Holocaust Memorial
Museum was holding a special exhibition on the St. Louis, a ship
stuffed full of European refugees from Hitler's terror that
approached US shores but was turned back during Franklin
Roosevelt's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The president at that moment clearly was determined to use
Theodore Roosevelt's bully pulpit _ and was just as determined not
to face the puzzling questions that historians have raised about
Franklin Roosevelt's failure to recognize early the implications of
the European Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   In winning at least a temporary victory in a European struggle
that his critics considered unwinnable _ and in succeeding with a
military strategy that his critics considered destined to fail _
the president has once again emerged at the top of the heap.
</P>
<P>
   More than any one achievement, that ability _ the agility to
prevail in the most difficult circumstances, when all the
circumstances are arrayed against him _ may emerge as the Clinton
legacy.

   TOKYO _ After nearly two years of recession, Japan's dormant
economy leaped to life in the first three months of the year,
according to official figures so strong that they were immediately
played down by some of the government's own economists.
</P>
<P>
   The gross domestic product rose for the first time since the end
of 1997, gaining 1.9 percent from the last quarter of 1998,
compared with a drop of eight-tenths of a percent in the previous
quarter, according to the figures released today. If this pace were
maintained for a full year _ something virtually no one expects _
the economy would grow 7.9 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese government officials, long criticized for failing to
acknowledge the depths of the nation's economic crisis, hastened to
stamp out any sense of euphoria.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to say the economy has recovered or bottomed
out,'' said Taiichi Sakaiya, he head of the Economic Planning
Agency, which compiles the figures.
</P>
<P>
   Few are betting that the improvement in output will have much
momentum, and many worried that it would force the government to
postpone drafting a supplemental budget devoted to further
stimulating the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a risk of a slowdown in the economy in the
second half of this year because public expenditures are likely to
decrease,'' said Hiroyuki Inoue, chief economist at the Japan
Center for Research. ``Today's number doesn't mean the crisis is
over.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest output figures appeared to indicate, though, that the
government's yearlong, $800 billion-plus spending program had begun
to have stimulative effects. The government estimates annual growth
of half of 1 percent for the year, a figure that until Thursday was
considered unrealistically rosy by many economists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government's projections will not be so difficult to
achieve, given today's figure,'' said Masaru Takagi, an economist
at Meiji University. ``The key point is whether private demand
continues to improve, especially in the second half of this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, stock buyers were impressed by the data. The
benchmark Nikkei index of 225 issues shot up 480.12 points, or 2.89
percent, to 17,102.62. The yen spiked up against the dollar after
the new figures were announced and then fell back amid speculation
by currency traders that the Japanese central bank had intervened
in the markets and was selling yen. A strong yen could crush hopes
of an economic turnaround because so many big Japanese
manufacturers rely on exports. In late currency trading in New
York, though, the yen stood at 118.84 to the dollar, only slightly
higher than Wednesday's rate of 118.93.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of the Treasury Robert E. Rubin said in Washington
that the United States was not selling yen and would not confirm
that the Japanese authorities had in fact sold yen to buy dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said he would not draw broad conclusions from the Japanese
output data. ``My instinct is that individual quarterly numbers
don't give you much sense about what's happening in an economy,''
he said. ``Clearly, they have enormous challenges ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, the magnitude of the improvement caught economists off
guard. The consensus forecast of 28 economists polled by Bloomberg
News this morning had been for growth of only 0.1 percent _ and
many forecasters grumbled that the government's statistics were
based on data that did not accurately reflect economic reality.
Just a day earlier, on Wednesday, Bloomberg's economists were
predicting the economy would contract by eight-tenths of a 8
percent until comments late in the afternoon by the prime
minister's spokesman, who suggested that the figures would be
positive, sent them back to rework their models.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm cautious about the accuracy of the numbers in reflecting
what's really happening in the economy,'' said Chris Calderwood,
chief economist at Jardine Fleming Securities here. ``Even if the
numbers are vaguely right, it's possible we're getting all the good
news in one blow, and it's all downhill from here.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Calderwood and others looked askance at the
figures for private consumption and corporate investment, which
rose 1.2 percent and 2.5 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer spending, which was down 0.2 percent the previous
quarter, has always been the wild card in a Japanese recovery.
While there are signs that Mrs. Watanabe, the ubiquitous Japanese
housewife, is shopping more freely, companies are forcing workers
to retire early, and are cutting bonuses and perquisites.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers face new tax increases for the public pension system
and for medical insurance, which should also hold back spending.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the increase in corporate spending was due to a one-time
outlay for technology related to a new digital telephone system. In
the previous quarter, corporate expenditures dropped 5.5 percent,
and almost every major company has plans to cut capital spending
anywhere from 15 to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists have been skeptical about the corporate profit
survey compiled by the Finance Ministry, which contains the figures
on company spending that are used to calculate the gross domestic
product. The same survey showed employment up 6.2 percent compared
with the period last year, according to one economist. Such a
figure seems so clearly out of sync with reality _ unemployment
rate is at a record high 4.8 percent _ that it raises questions
about the entire survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The data on corporate spending doesn't really jibe with other
data we have,'' said Brian H. Rose, senior economist at Warburg
Dillon Read. ``I'd conclude that the survey just isn't that
accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's output figures would appear to support the
government's strategy of setting aside fiscal caution in order to
goad the economy into action. More than $800 billion has been
invested in public works over the last year, and tax cuts, credit
guarantees and shopping vouchers have been handed out to encourage
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Economists worry that once spending stops, Japan will again fall
into a prolonged decline, and they say that spending is almost
certain to stop. The country's public-sector debt has ballooned,
with the Finance Ministry predicting it will stand at 108.5 percent
of the gross domestic product this year. Tax revenue is falling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're approaching the peak of government spending,'' Rose
said. ``I think a lot of people, including us, are really more
worried about what will happen in 2000 rather than this year, when
it looks like they've propped things up pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   Public investment rose 10.3 percent in the first quarter, on the
back of a 10.6 percent increase the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Bankruptcies are down, largely because the government has spent
15 trillion yen in the last six months _ $126 billion at current
exchange rates _ on a loan guarantee program for small and midsized
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Tax breaks have produced a surge in new housing, pushing housing
investment up 1.2 percent in the first quarter, compared with a 7
percent decline in the fourth quarter of 1998. Interest rates are
about as low as they can go without being negative.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the government will take the wraps off a plan to halt
the rise in unemployment, with $17 billion to $42 billion in new
spending aimed at creating 700,000 jobs and preserving existing
ones.
</P>
<P>
   These sorts of pump-priming activities are applauded by
officials in the United States and other foreign governments; in
Japan, they draw criticism as an expensive effort to stave off
wrenching structural changes needed to put the economy on a
globally competitive footing.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists said that a danger inherent in today's figures
was complacency _ that hints of Asian economic recovery would
squelch the drive for market-driven changes that was so strong in
worse times a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have a new set of risks,'' Inoue of the Japan Center
for Research maintained. ``If private corporations react to the
current numbers the wrong way, if they think the crisis is over,
they might not press ahead with restructuring and reform. And that
will postpone necessary structural readjustments to the economy.''

CLINTON AVERTS FUNDING BAN DESPITE MOVE BY HOUSE REPUBLICANS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Amid protests that their timing was extraordinarily
bad, House Republicans sought Thursday to deny funding for U.S.
peacekeeping operations in Kosovo even as American troops were
massing on the border of the Serbian province preparing to move in
with NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
   But President Clinton managed to avert a ban on funding by
pledging in a letter to House members that he would seek the
express approval of Congress for additional money for peacekeeping
operations and by offering assurances that the mission would not
interfere with U.S. military readiness elsewhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's effort to address GOP concerns about an extended
military involvement in Kosovo came after Republican opponents of
the war tried to pass language as part of the 2000 defense
authorization bill that would have prohibited the Pentagon from
spending any money on the peacekeeping operation after Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   The language was later stripped from the $289 billion defense
bill by a vote of 270-155. The bill passed 365-58.
</P>
<P>
   The language banning Kosovo funding was included in the bill,
said Republican sponsors of the provision, to ensure that Congress
would continue to control ``the government's purse strings,'' as
one member put it, and to prevent the president from shifting money
from other defense operations to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   But a few GOP opponents of U.S. involvement in the Balkans were
able to use the debate on the language as a vehicle to denounce the
Kosovo peace agreement as ``a defeat'' for NATO, as Rep. Mark
Souder, R-Ariz., put it, and to accuse the allies of killing more
civilians during the bombing campaign than the Serb forces did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Through the bombing of NATO, there's been over twice the
number of people killed than were killed prior to our bombing. We
have killed more civilians ... than the Serbs,'' said Rep. Duke
Cunningham, R-Calif., adding that Yugoslavian President Slobodan
Milosevic ``had a plan (to rid Kosovo of ethnic Albanians), and we
implemented that plan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are hundreds of thousands of people today who would not
be refugees if we had not bombed. That is not a win.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, also criticized the peacekeeping plan,
calling it nothing more than a blueprint for the extended
occupation of sovereign country.
</P>
<P>
   ``After bombing a country to smithereens, we are now going to
occupy it,'' Paul said, adding that taxpayer dollars are now
supporting a worldwide U.S. empire built on American military
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``When will it end,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The debate unfolded as Yugoslav military and paramilitary units
began withdrawing from Kosovo and as Clinton and other allied
leaders were celebrating the peace plan and expressing hope that
the peacekeeping mission would be a success.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats accused the Republicans of ``trying to snatch defeat
from the jaws of victory'' by moving to cut off funding just at
NATO forces are about to move in and prepare the way for Kosovar
refugees to return to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., who led the effort to strike the Kosovo
language from the defense bill, told his Republican colleagues that
``Congress would be the laughingstock of the world'' if it voted to
cut off spending on Kosovo on the day that the peace agreement was
being implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gene Taylor, D-Miss., also cautioned his GOP colleagues to
be careful about labeling the peace agreement a defeat for NATO.
Recounting a recent visit with U.S. forces in the Balkans, Taylor
drew applause when he said that many of the troops he spoke with in
Bosnia and Macedonia believe that their involvement is critical to
preventing rape, murder and genocide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's don't give away the peace that they have won,'' he said.
``We stopped the horror in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans also objected to efforts to cut off funding on
the day the peace agreement was taking hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a terrible time to pull the plug,'' Rep. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., told members. ``This is not the time to give signals of
uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pleas of fellow Republicans and Clinton's letter,
many Republicans continued to insist that Congress restrict funding
for Kosovo operations. In the end 142 of 223 Republican members of
the House voted against taking out the restrictive language on
funding.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how much the peacekeeping operation in Kosovo will
cost taxpayers. But Defense Secretary William Cohen said Thursday
that it could run up to $2 billion a year.

`POWERS' STARTS OUT GROOVY, BABY, THEN GOES RIGHT DOWN THE TUBES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's interesting about the Austin Powers phenomenon is that it
represents a rare instance in which a movie franchise has been set
off by the popularity of a video. The 1997 original, after all,
only grossed $54 million theatrically (less than the advertising
budget of ``Armageddon'').
</P>
<P>
   But the video has been a huge success for the past two years,
the character and his tag lines (``Oh, behave!'' etc.) have seeped
into the culture, and the sequel, ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who
Shagged Me,'' is entering the summer movie wars with only slightly
less media hype than ``Episode 1.''
</P>
<P>
   It debuted last Sunday at the 25th Seattle International Film
Festival, and opens this weekend. It's very much a mixed bag: a
movie that starts off marvelously and promises to be much more than
the original, but then nosedives into what could be the greatest
celebration of bathroom humor in the history of movies.
</P>
<P>
   The story has superspy Powers (Mike Myers) once again battling
his nemesis, Dr. Evil (also Myers), who, from his headquarters in
Seattle's Space Needle, has traveled back in time to 1969 to steal
Powers' most valuable possession, his ``mojo'' (libido).
</P>
<P>
   Powers also has a time machine, so he goes back as well, and,
teaming up with a beautiful secret agent of the '60s named Felicity
Shagwell (Heather Graham), finds himself in and out of one absurd
situation after another, until he's finally battling his enemy on
the moon.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Austin'' is even more of a sendup of James Bond than its
predecessor, with specific references to ``You Only Live Twice,''
``Goldfinger,'' ``Dr. No,'' ``The Spy Who Loved Me'' and
practically every other Bond epic of the '60s and '70s _ complete
with a voluptuously brassy, John Barry-like score.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a succession of dance routines ripped off from
``Laugh-in'' (linking the various sequences), a lengthy in-movie
commercial for Starbucks Coffee, a pint-size Dr. Evil-clone named
``Mini-me,'' and a cameo by Tim Robbins as a harried U.S.
president.
</P>
<P>
   The first half is a riot. Both of Myers' characterizations are
charming and cute, the gags are witty and inventive, the
retro-idyllic vision of London in the Swinging '60s is affectionate
and clever, and we're set up to believe we're in for one heck of a
great time.
</P>
<P>
   But the moment Myers introduces his third character _ a Scottish
villain named Fat Bastard, who weighs a metric ton and is obsessed
with his own bowel movements _ ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged
Me'' disintegrates into non-stop defecation jokes, epic anal-sex
routines and flatulence gags.
</P>
<P>
   Myers and director Jay Roach probably know what they're doing _
aiming their humor straight at all those 13-year-old boys who sent
the video through the roof. But the repulsive turn of events erased
all my good memories of the first half, and makes the movie hard to
recommend to a normal human being.
</P>
<P>
   Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me. Directed by Jay Roach.
Written by Michael McCullers and Mike Myers. Cast: Mike Myers,
Heather Graham, Rob Lowe, Robert Wagner, Michael York. New Line
Cinema. 100 minutes. Rated PG-13 for bathroom humor.

POLITICAL COALITION THWARTS ANC IN WESTERN CAPE PROVINCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Despite winning the largest share
of the vote in the province surrounding Cape Town, the African
National Congress has been largely shut out of power there as two
traditionally white parties formed a coalition with a tiny
religious party.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of trade unions aligned with the governing party have
called the arrangement racist and have threatened to strike or
demonstrate against it. The coalition parties have responded that
the deal is perfectly normal and that the governing party's use of
union threats is anti-democratic.
</P>
<P>
   In the June 2 election, the ANC won 42 percent of the vote in
the Western Cape province, which is home to the national
Parliament, a tourist mecca and an important farming, fishing and
wine-making region.
</P>
<P>
   The New National Party won only 38 percent, but joined with the
Democratic Party, which got 12 percent, and the African Christian
Democratic Party, which got 3 percent, for a total of 53 percent.
The coalition controls 23 of the 42 seats in the province's
parliament and will presumably return Gerald Morkel, provincial
head of the New National Party, to his post as premier.
</P>
<P>
   In the first post-apartheid elections of 1994, the National
Party had 54 percent of the province and ruled without partners.
</P>
<P>
   The tripartite coalition offered to let the African National
Congress join, but would only give it one Cabinet seat, that in
charge of the police.
</P>
<P>
   Ebrahim Rasool, provincial head of the governing party, said,
``We have expressed ourselves as deeply insulted by that offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Ehremreich, local branch leader of the Congress of South
African Trade Unions, a labor group that has traditionally
supported the governing party, said, ``When the white parties gang
up to exclude the black parties and the working man, then we're
going to demonstrate our dissatisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   The union said unspecified ``mass actions'' might begin Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the National Party was once the whites-only party that
created apartheid, it now bridles at the ``white'' label. Its
biggest support base in the Cape is among mixed-race people
classified here as ``colored,'' and Morkel and his No. 2, Peter
Marais, are colored.
</P>
<P>
   A leader of the Democratic Party, Helen Zille, said the ANC had
been perfectly free to cut its own deal to form a majority
coalition but had been unable to do so. But other leaders of her
party had said even before the election that they would do nothing
to help the governing party increase its power.
</P>
<P>
   The ANC won nearly two-thirds of the national vote, and seven of
the country's nine provinces. In KwaZulu/Natal, the only other
province it lost, it appears to be on its way to forming a
coalition with the Inkatha Freedom Party to dominate the provincial
legislature.
</P>
<P>
   In the Northern Cape province, where the National Party was also
once powerful, the ANC won 63 percent of the vote to the National
Party's 26 percent. Thursday, it refused to offer the New National
Party a single seat in the Cabinet. There was suspicion that it
made the move in response to the shutout in the Western Cape,
though the governing party denied it.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick van Zyl Slabbert, an independent political
commentator, said democracies usually allow minority parties the
freedom to band together and outvote the largest party, but he
suggested it might backfire here, since the ANC controls the
central government purse strings.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run, it will lead to more tension in the Cape,''
he said, ``and I find that depressing.''

TEAM FINDS THAT CURLED DNA PLAYS KEY ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boston scientists have solved a mystery they created 20 years
ago when they found an odd, reverse-twisting form of DNA, raising a
question that has bedeviled them since: Does it have a purpose in
nature?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they now say confidently.
</P>
<P>
   In a discovery hailed by other DNA experts, a Massachusetts
Institute of Technology group reports in the journal Science that
leftward-coiling DNA is an important part of cells' repertoire for
making proteins that all organisms need to keep humming along
smoothly. Conventional DNA curls rightward in the famous
double-helix curve that resembles a graceful spiral staircase.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery may open new vistas in biotechnology, some said,
by giving researchers new ways to manipulate DNA, the master
molecule that encodes the genetic instructions for an entire
organism. For instance, scientists said, it might lead to ways to
deactivate cancer-promoting genes, switch on cellular repair
mechanisms, or diagnose genetic diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The unconventional DNA also appears to be a part of a key
evolutionary mechanism that gives rise to small changes in the
protein code, tiny modifications that sometimes confer a survival
advantage. ``It enormously broadens the way an organism can work,''
said professor Alexander Rich, who led the MIT team.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a change in only one amino acid in the protein
receptor for serotonin _ the brain hormone that the drug Prozac
enhances _ results in a weaker receptor, a state Rich dubbed
``serotonin lite.'' Having the ability to make both normal-strength
serotonin receptors and weaker ones enables the brain to modulate,
or fine-tune, serotonin effects as it needs to.
</P>
<P>
   The backwards-twisting DNA appears to facilitate this
fine-tuning by flagging genes that are switched on, early in the
process of transcribing the code from DNA to RNA, the template for
protein assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sort of beacon saying, `I'm on. I'm transcribing,' ''
Rich said of the DNA variant, which he called Z-DNA in 1979 because
it has a zig-zag backbone of sugar and phosphate molecules, in
contrast to the smooth spiral that DNA usually displays.
</P>
<P>
   Rich and his colleagues have discovered a region within Z-DNA
that is a strong chemical magnet for a particular ``editing
enzyme.'' This enzyme must do its work during a brief window of
time when the double strands of DNA are being ``unzipped'' so that
one of the strands can serve as a template for the RNA that carries
out the next step of protein synthesis.
</P>
<P>
   When the RNA editing is complete, Z-DNA snaps back to DNA's
conventional, right-handed conformation, called B-DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Because timing is critical, Rich believes nature ``invented''
Z-DNA, with its strong affinity for certain enzymes, to ensure that
molecular editing occurs when it's supposed to. But he said this
``targeting'' function for Z-DNA is a working hypothesis that will
require further studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like this hypothesis very much,'' commented Maxim
Frank-Kamenetskii, a specialist in DNA structure at Boston
University. ``We know there are so many proteins involved in
regulation and transcription and editing, but we don't know how it
happens that they are located in the correct place. This is a very
interesting idea of how it may happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Research suggests that each gene among the 100,000 or so in
humans probably has at least one site structured so a portion of
its DNA can flip into the Z-DNA form _ another hint that the odd
form serves biological purposes. There may be many more
Z-DNA-forming sites, perhaps 580,000 or more, in the DNA of each
cell.
</P>
<P>
   The MIT scientists grew crystals of a stretch of Z-DNA tightly
bound to the editing enzyme, called RNA adenosine deaminase. This
enabled them to take X-ray photographs that unmasked the molecular
structure of this critical ``binding site.''
</P>
<P>
   These pictures constitute ``good evidence that there is a real
biological function for Z-DNA in the living cell,'' said professor
Richard R. Sinden, a specialist in DNA structure at Texas A&AMP;M
University in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said the new Z-DNA findings, coupled with other recent
discoveries about the various forms DNA can take, are expanding
scientists' ideas about how DNA encodes crucial information.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many years we have thought of DNA as sort of a repository
of genetic information, like a computer hard disk,'' Sinden said.
``But in addition to the genetic code, DNA contains a lot of
information in its structure that is used biologically.''

KARROS TRIES ON NEW SHADE OF BLUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It wasn't supposed to be like this for Eric
Karros, who sits in the Los Angeles Dodgers dugout and fantasizes
what it should be like in the fickle business in which he draws a
paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   He peers out to the pitcher's mound, and can see Pedro Martinez
overpowering batters with a dominance not seen by anybody wearing a
Dodger uniform since Sandy Koufax.
</P>
<P>
   He looks over to the batter's box, and can see Mike Piazza
putting up hitting numbers for the Dodgers unmatched by any catcher
in all the seasons of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   He hears the usual speculation about his being dealt even though
he's been one of the most reliable Dodger batsmen of the decade,
and accepts it with a calm resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no control over what happens in this game,'' he says
softly. ``I never thought they'd trade Mike (Piazza), but they did.
The same with Pedro (Martinez).
</P>
<P>
   ``We all came up together, and it would have been nice to have
stayed together. But this is a game of sudden change, unexpected
change. I don't worry one bit about being traded. If it happens, it
happens. You just have to learn to live with it...''
</P>
<P>
   His voice tails off, and his eyes drift out to the Dodger
Stadium outfield where the fences, once barren, are now covered
with pictures of people like Maury Wills and Duke Snider and Jackie
Robinson and Pee Wee Reese and advertisements for Bud Light and
Pacific Bell and Dodge.
</P>
<P>
   He looks around the field, and sees teammates named Onan Masoka,
Doug Bochtler, Jamie Arnold, Chance Sanford, Angel Pena and others
he knows only faintly go through their pre-game warmups.
</P>
<P>
   At a mere 31, Eric Karros is the Dodgers' elder statesman in
point of service on a team of strangers, a leftover memento from
the Peter O'Malley-Tom Lasorda-Fred Claire Dodger regime that
didn't stick ornaments on the outfield fences and didn't tamper
with the uniforms and didn't fill the stadium with crummy music and
didn't spend millions on free agent pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Karros is off to his traditional slow-motion start, and so is
his team that finds itself several games behind the Arizona
Diamondbacks and San Francisco Giants in the N.L. West Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never left this many base runners in scoring position,''
says Karros, always proficient at driving in runs during his
previous seven seasons with the Dodgers. ``But you go through
periods like that in this game. Things tend to even themselves out
over a whole season.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to come a time when I'll start driving in runs
again. It'll happen. It always has in the past. I'm not concerned
about it. But it's frustrating for me right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros also doesn't seem that concerned about his team even
though its hitters and pitchers have been inconsistent and its
defense has been similarly erratic highlighted by catcher Todd
Hundley's unique knack of turning every runner into a base-stealing
wizard.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt about it that we've been struggling,'' he says. ``But
you look at the standings, and we're only a few games behind the
other teams. It's not like we're 10, 12 behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can make up ground in no time. If this were July, or
August, I'd start getting concerned. But it's only June. It's too
early yet. We still haven't put together a decent winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every team in baseball even the worst ones win seven, eight,
nine games in a row. And our turn will come. We just haven't put it
all together yet. But we will. It will happen. There's no reason to
panic this early.''
</P>
<P>
   It is all so different now for Eric Karros.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a few years ago that he and Mike Piazza shared a
bachelor pad at Manhattan Beach, and they were inseparables who
spent their evenings chasing pitchers out of games and ladies in
the nightclubs.
</P>
<P>
   But Mike Piazza would be cut loose by the Dodgers last summer,
and Eric Karros would forfeit his single status last November by
getting married.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things change nothing in this world stays the same,'' says
Karros. ``I never dreamed that Mike Piazza would be gone from this
team before me. You just have to expect the unexpected in this
game. That's the nature of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't that bother you when your name keeps surfacing in
trade rumors?'' I wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros shakes his head slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not even an issue with me,'' he says. ``Actually, the way
it came up this time was disappointing to me. We were in Cincinnati
a couple of weeks ago, and Peter Gammons (ESPN baseball analyst)
said that I had missed three games because of knee problems and
that the Dodgers were trying to get rid of me.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hear that, and it's a little upsetting because I haven't
missed a game this season because of injuries. But, honestly, all
that stuff just doesn't bother me that much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you ever think how it would have been with the Dodgers had
they kept Mike Piazza and Pedro Martinez?'' I ask.
</P>
<P>
   A wistful expression covers Eric Karros' face, as he gazes
forlornly out at the Dodger Stadium playing field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in a while,'' he says, and there is sadness in his voice.
``Oh yes, once in a while...''

`BESIEGED' SPEAKS VOLUMES WITH FEW WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Words aren't a big part of ``Besieged,'' Italian director
Bernardo Bertolucci's exquisite, intimate and fragile drama, so
it's hard to find the right way to explain this rich and sumptuous
piece of filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   Opening a regular run Friday after successful screenings in the
Seattle International Film Festival, the film is from a script he
wrote with his wife, Clare Peploe.
</P>
<P>
   Bertolucci is masterful when it comes to making character-driven
films with artistic and political overtones _ ``The Conformist,''
``La Luna'' and ``Stealing Beauty'' are extraordinary,
well-composed works, but he stumbles with works made purely for
epic David Lean-esque glory, such as ``The Last Emperor'' and
``Little Buddha.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Besieged,'' which reportedly began as a TV project, is a
quiet, lean actor's piece, with a delicate interwoven structure
that will either sweep you up or elude you.
</P>
<P>
   Thandie Newton plays Shandurai, a young African woman who moves
to Rome to study medicine after her husband is abducted for
unexplained _ but most certainly liberal political _ beliefs. She
takes lodging in the home of a quiet, loner pianist, Mr. Kinsky
(David Thewlis), who gives her board in exchange for housecleaning
and small jobs.
</P>
<P>
   He also falls in love with her. And after Kinsky
uncharacteristically reveals his feelings, the film takes an
extraordinary turn, with a series of events so elemental, human and
moving they seem small.
</P>
<P>
   Newton, an exceptional actress who has graced John Duigan's
films (``The Journey of August King,'' ``Flirting'') and who
managed to make a little something out of an incomprehensible role
in last year's ``Beloved,'' is breathtaking in her ability to
reveal vulnerability through body language.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, Thewlis has never been more restrained and
accessible and he and Newton show us what the craft of acting is
about. The pair work like finely oiled clockwork and emit such a
daring depth of emotion in their looks and silences that we can't
foresee what will happen.
</P>
<P>
   Bertolucci lets the actors take command in this play of the
heart and what emerges is a study from a master filmmaker who is
back in form. He merges a love of letting visual elements tell a
story and reveal character with a talented cast. He _ and they _
make the final, unspoken moments all the more powerful.
</P>

`TWICE UPON A YESTERDAY' SHOWS LOVE IS NEVER AS EASY AS WE HOPE IT
WILL BE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   It would be easy _ but unfair _ to compare ``Twice Upon a
Yesterday'' with Peter Howitt's 1998 romantic drama ``Sliding
Doors.'' Both are about the coincidence of destiny.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Sliding Doors'' was chock full of English trendiness and
its limited appeal depended upon whether audiences could engage
with an earnest and overly ingratiating tone as well as a tidily
stacked deck of a plot.
</P>
<P>
   Director Maria Ripoll has imbued her movie with the reality,
messiness, clutter and the chaos of an ethno-urban London life.
She's even given us a flawed and flailing protagonist in Victor
(Douglas Henshall), who is, of all things, an unemployed actor. As
the film opens, he's also a cad _ cheating on his seven-year,
live-in girlfriend Sylvia (Lena Headey).
</P>
<P>
   When Sylvia learns about his indiscretions, she moves out. And
Victor spends the next few months desperately trying to woo her
back. But Sylvia's moved onto something else; she's dating Dave, a
fellow who was seeing her best friend but with whom she sparked
when she met him again at the gym.
</P>
<P>
   Victor embarks on a lonely life of drunken binges and painful
reminiscences. But what if Sylvia wasn't the true love that he
thought?
</P>
<P>
   One night, Victor, after stumbling through the rain-soaked
streets, meets two mysterious Spaniards who offer him a drink _ as
well as a surreal window into another plane of consciousness. It's
one that will provide him with a view into how life with Sylvia
might have turned out.
</P>
<P>
   Parallel worlds collide and soon the tables are turned on both
Victor and Sylvia, proving love is never as easy as we hope it will
be.
</P>
<P>
   Henshall has a frenetic, chaotic appeal that gives Victor an
emotional vulnerability usually relegated to female characters. Yet
he's equally a slob _ destined to muddle through his life until
women take charge and give him a reason to exist. Victor doesn't
come into his own until he learns to take responsibility for his
actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twice Upon a Yesterday'' thankfully doesn't apologize for its
fairy-tale sensibility and its foray into ``magic realism.''
Although it's sometimes difficult to engage with a character as
clueless as Victor, the women _ played by Headey and Penelope Cruz
_ are effective and ground the movie when he threatens to become
too manic and tiresome.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   SIDON, Lebanon _ No one yet knows exactly who fired Kalashnikov
rifles into a courtroom here two days ago in a massacre that killed
the chief judge and three other court officials. But the attack has
focused attention on a problem that Lebanon has long done its best
to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   A large and angry population of Palestinian refugees now numbers
more than 300,000, most living in camps _ like Ain Hilwe, just
outside Sidon _ that are ruled by armed militias. It was to Ain
Hilwe that the gunmen are believed to have fled. But like all the
camps, Ain Hilwe is a place where the Lebanese police and soldiers
do not dare to go.
</P>
<P>
   Large numbers of Lebanese troops were rushed to Sidon, and the
authorities have vowed to track the culprits down. But so far the
soldiers have kept a wary distance from Ain Hilwe, whose squalor
and violence is emblematic of a problem that Lebanese officials
clearly wish would go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Lebanese forces went into that camp, there would be a
battle,'' one official said Thursday. ``The Palestinians have
always been a headache, but now it may be getting worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever before the attack, rivalries within the camps set off a
wave of internal Palestinian violence, and Lebanese officials say
some of the violence may now be directed at the Lebanese state.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have always insisted that the Palestinian
presence here is temporary, saying the Palestinians must be allowed
to return to lands they fled in 1948. But nearly all of the 125,000
or so Palestinians who fled to Lebanon at that time came from what
is now northern Israel, making it very unlikely that they or their
descendants will ever gain the right to go home.
</P>
<P>
   But with peace talks expected to resume soon between the Arabs
and Israelis, and the security setback in Sidon, Lebanon appears
ready to redouble its case. President Emile Lahoud has told recent
visitors that his government will press hard for the right of the
Palestinians to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see this as their last, faint chance to get rid of what
they see as a potential time bomb,'' a Western diplomat said of
Lebanon and its Palestinian population.
</P>
<P>
   A peace accord that does not give the Palestinians the right to
return would leave Lebanon to accommodate a fast-growing
Palestinian population that already accounts for about 8 percent of
Lebanon's residents _ something that Lebanese officials say would
upset a delicate internal political balance.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees have long caused problems for Lebanon. In one of
the worst incidents, cross-border attacks on Israel by Palestinian
militias prompted the Israeli invasion of 1982, whose legacy
remains the Israeli-occupied border zone in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Though that invasion drove away Yasser Arafat and the guerrilla
fighters of his Palestine Liberation Organization, other combatants
stayed behind. Groups like the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine remain armed and active inside Ain Hilwe and other camps.
</P>
<P>
   Lebanon's response has been intentional neglect. Because most of
the militias oppose both Arafat and peace with Israel, Lebanon has
made no effort to rein them in, seeing them as instruments of
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   But because it does not want to encourage a permanent
Palestinian presence, Lebanon has refused to allow the refugees
citizenship, the right to work or even access to government
services. That has contributed to poverty, despair and the wave of
violence around Sidon, including shootings, car bombings and other
attacks that in the last 14 months have been directed against
several Palestinian factions and have claimed six lives.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's attack, by far the most serious, was the most brazen
against the Lebanese authorities since the end of the 1975-91 civil
war. Among those killed when the two gunmen broke ground-floor
windows and sprayed the courtroom with bullets were the chief
judge, the prosecutor and two court officials; five other people
were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Left behind at the scene were not only the Kalashnikovs but also
a rocket-propelled grenade.
</P>
<P>
   Since the culprits have not been identified as Palestinians,
Lebanese politicians have been careful not point fingers. But the
reports that the gunmen had taken refuge in Ain Hilwe have prompted
Lebanese politicians to warn of the dangers posed by what are
described as ``islands outside the law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be no areas outside the law in Lebanon under the
pretext of just causes, including the Palestinian cause,'' Shaker
Abu Suleiman, a prominent member of Parliament, told reporters in
Beirut. ``The authorities should chase the criminals to any hiding
place they might take.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before the attack, the court was on the verge of handing
down verdicts and sentences in eight cases involving charges of
murder, drug smuggling, forgery, robbery and sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants, four Palestinians and four Lebanese, were in the
courtroom, but no attempt was made to free them, and Lebanese
officials said Thursday that they regarded the attack as a
political statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an organized act of terrorism,'' said the state
prosecutor, Adnan Addoum. ``One can only conclude that the goal was
to kill the judges and nothing else.''

<P>
   BEIJING _ A businessman and former government planner who
distributed a pro-democracy manifesto last year was sentenced
Thursday to four years in prison, the latest in a series of harsh
steps taken against dissidents in the last month.
</P>
<P>
   The former official, Fang Jue, 44, was convicted here of illegal
business activities, on charges that he and his relatives insisted
were trumped up. He has been jailed since July.
</P>
<P>
   Months before then, he had distributed to foreign journalists a
long paper that called for political change that he said reflected
the secret thinking of many younger Communist Party members.

<P>
   Fang was not allowed to speak at a brief hearing but shouted,
``This trial was illegal!'' before being led out, his sister Liu
Jing told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, a factory worker who founded the Hebei Province branch
of the outlawed China Democracy Party, Yu Feng, 37, was arrested on
suspicion of ``subverting state power,'' according to the
Information Center for Human Rights and Democratic Movement, based
in Hong Kong. That is a serious charge that was used last year to
give out long sentences to the most prominent party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, three other democracy advocates have received
prison terms ranging from three to four years on similar charges.
</P>
<P>
   In late May. a democratic party member from the southern
province of Guangxi, Li Zhiyou, was sentenced to three years. He
was arrested in December after he having tried to protest the
11-year sentence given to a party founder.
</P>
<P>
   On May 11, Liu Lixian of Beijing received a four-year sentence
for subversion. He had tried to publish a book of the writings of
two leading dissidents and democratic party leaders, Xu Wenli and
Qin Yongmin, who themselves were given sentences of 13 and 12 years
in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   On May 27, Zhang Youju, a democratic party member in the central
province of Hebei, was sentenced to four years. He was arrested
last fall after having posted fliers that called for the government
to reassess its violent suppression of the democracy demonstrations
at Tiananmen Square in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   An additional three democratic party members in the northern
province of Gansu were tried on subversion charges May 28 and are
awaiting sentences, and other activists around the country are in
detention and awaiting possible charges.

JUST WILD AND CRAZY GEEKS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 13) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The way TNT's film ``Pirates of Silicon Valley'' tells it, the
story of the computer revolution as we know it begins with Steve
Jobs and Steve Wozniak running in slow motion through tear gas
during a student protest on the Berkeley campus in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a chronology that TNT has sent out with publicity
releases about the film notes that Job and Wozniak didn't meet
until 1973, when they were both employees of Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   But then the film doesn't claim to be a documentary _ or even a
docudrama. In it, the real-life events and real characters involved
in the early days of the computer age are given the star treatment
(as heroes or villains, depending on your perspective). The script
also goes beyond the office wars and gets personal about its
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The young Bill Gates is shown as a particularly ardent fan of
Playboy magazine, a devotee of strip clubs and the kind of guy who
actually says to a beautiful young woman he has just met, ``You
must have really great bandwidth.'' Gates is also shown singing
``My Way'' to himself as he drives.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs is portrayed as considerably more colorful. In his youth he
is seen as a happy drug user (the kind of guy who will trip on LSD
alone if none of his other friends want to join him) who seeks
truth in 1970s ways (``Like it's gone, the anger's gone,'' he tells
his therapy group) and eats fruit because it ``makes the soul
pure.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the film, when his computer company, Apple, has grown
huge, he is shown barging into a job interview conducted by one of
his employees, putting his bare feet up on the conference-room desk
and asking the job candidate if he's a virgin.
</P>
<P>
   The film also shows the young man who invented DOS selling it to
Bill Gates's representative for $50,000 (a figure disputed by some
computer historians) _ and being thrilled about the deal. And it
specializes in quotes, like the ones below, that sum up a lot:
</P>
<P>
   ``What on earth would ordinary people want with computers?'' (A
Hewlett-Packard executive to a young Steve Jobs.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The profits are in the computers themselves. Not this software
stuff.'' (An IBM executive to a young Bill Gates.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This ain't just business. This is practically spiritual. This
is about overthrowing dead culture, dead gods.'' (Jobs, still
running his fledgling company from his parents' garage, to a man
offering him $250,000 in venture capital.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It was practically like being a rock star or something.''
(Steve Wozniak in voice-over, describing the experience of manning
the Apple booth at an early computer trade show.)
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what they say in the Mafia? Keep your friends close _
and your enemies closer.'' (Gates to his right-hand man.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the loot, Steve. And you're yelling `That's not fair! I
want to try to steal it first!' You're too late.'' (Gates to Jobs,
near the end.)

BE PREPARED FOR SOME TWISTS AND DETOURS IN `GET REAL' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This surprisingly anarchic English film is a rarity in that it
successfully makes the leap from stage (it's adapted from the play
``What's Wrong With Angry?'') to screen with agility and grace.
</P>
<P>
   And though it rides the heels of the recent coming of age/coming
out film, ``Edge of Seventeen,'' it tackles more topics than the
anguish and joy of being gay.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there is an entire group of high schoolers who help
make ``Get Real'' so palpable and engaging. In the center of the
story is Steven Carter (Ben Silverstone), a journalism major who is
always picked on by the athletes in the school because he hangs out
with the girls and is a whiz in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Steven's secret is he's gay. And when he and the most unlikely
candidate for a boyfriend _ handsome, magnetic John Dixon (Brad
Gorton) _ embark on a secret ``relationship,'' chaos ensues.
</P>
<P>
   If all of this sounds predictable and routine _ the high school
hunk meets the intellectual outcast _ be prepared for a bit of a
twist. While it follows the road map when it comes to the teenage
angst formula, ``Get Real'' also takes some detours.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does it look at Steven's plight, it actually gives
insight into the other side _ the difficulty of being a big fish in
a small pond. ``It's hard to be me,'' says John, and indeed, it is.
He's far less certain of himself than Steven; in fact, he's so
confused he has to keep up appearances in order to be accepted by
the sorry bunch of jocks who idealize him.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Steven and his gang have more freedom, more sense of
direction and a better defined place in the world than the guy who
has yet to discover who he is. In fact, the film hints that if John
doesn't come to grips with his sexuality, he may turn out to be one
of those high school wonders who fades into oblivion after
graduation.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a nice touch about journalistic censorship that
parallels nicely with Steven's plight. But best of all, ``Get
Real'' is about diversity _ whether straight or gay _ and it
celebrates the idea that the world is indeed made up of many
different types of people.
</P>
<P>
   While recent _ and old (think ``Grease'') _ high school romantic
comedies often force a character to change in order to be accepted,
``Get Real'' does get real: it allows its kids to be themselves and
to simply ``be'' without judgment. That's an empowering enough
message for any movie.
</P>
<P>

1999. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT &AMP; ARTS (Moved in `e' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   RUN-LOLA-RUN-FILM (Undated) _ Not many films have inspired both
a hair color (italics)and(end italics) a conservative politician's
campaign poster. But the German director Tom Tykwer's ``Run Lola
Run'' certainly did. The film, which has sold more than two million
tickets in Germany and which opens in Manhattan on Friday, is the
anarchically charged story of a flame-haired punk, Lola (Franka
Potente), who races through the streets of Berlin in a desperate
attempt to save her boyfriend's life. By Laura Winters. (Moved). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ANITA-EKBERG-FILMS (Genzano, Italy) _ With Anita Ekberg, 68,
talk usually revolves around the Fountain of Trevi, a monument
forever associated with the scene in ``La Dolce Vita'' in which she
dances in its waters so alluringly. It has been many decades since
she looked like the dewy sex goddess who entranced Marcello
Mastroianni in Fellini's 1960 classic. Or sounded like one. Her
once satiny, babyish whisper (``Marcello, come, join me'') has
become harsher with time and tobacco. But with her deep,
authoritative voice, imperious manner and carefully tended face,
she still looks and acts very much the diva. The Belgian director
Yvan Le Moine has cast her as a mercurial retired opera star in his
feature film debut, a Fellini-esque art film called ``The Red
Dwarf,'' which opens in New York on Friday. By Alessandra Stanley.
(Moved).  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   COYLE-LISTEN-THEATER (Undated) _ Brendan Coyle has spent almost
400 performances, his elbows propped on a bar, a lager or a whisky
at the ready, listening to his fellow players in ``The Weir'' turn
a litany of ghostly tales into a haunting study of collective
self-revelation. But playing a bartender also named Brendan, Coyle
never gets a story of his own, unless you believe _ as some do _
that Brendan's tale begins once Conor McPherson's play ends. Can
listening be its own reward? As Coyle's acclaimed performance shows
_ in February, he won an Olivier Award in London for best
supporting player _ listening has the capacity to be as potent as
speech. By Matt Wolf. (Moved). Photo. &QL;

<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL-DANCE-MEMOIRS (Undated) _ Here's a little secret I wonder
if it's wise for a critic to share: I often find that traveling to
someplace new, or at least someplace not routinely familiar, puts
me in a good mood for seeing performances. By Jack Anderson.
(Moved). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ORCHESTRAS-FUTURE (Undated) _ When the Cleveland Orchestra was
at Carnegie Hall last month, giving concerts led by its music
director, Christoph von Dohnanyi, and a former principal guest
conductor, Pierre Boulez, Ara Guzelimian, the hall's artistic
adviser, took the opportunity to convene a public discussion. The
two maestros and Joseph Polisi, the president of the Juilliard
School, were asked to speculate on what orchestras might be like in
the next century, as institutional bodies and as artistic machines.
By Paul Griffiths. (Moved). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BOULEZ-MUSIC (Undated) _ The modernest composer, Pierre Boulez,
development as a major musician of our time has been well
documented on disk. Now 74, he has understandably begun to cut back
his conducting commitments. But he continues his work in the
recording studio. Three important recent releases on
Deutsche-Grammophon, the company with which he has been most
closely associated of late, present Boulez as conductor and
composer. By Anthony Tommasini. (Moved). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PROVINCETOWN-ART (Provincetown, Mass.) _ Whether they come to
party or to produce, diverse artistic types still succumb to
Provincetown's natural beauty and mystique. This summer,
Provincetown marks its centennial year as an art colony. By Ann
Wilson LLoyd. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   NY-ARCHITECTURE (New York) _ Jean Nouvel's new design for a
hotel and cineplex on the Brooklyn waterfront strikes me as one of
the most imaginatively conceived pieces of architecture New York
has seen in a long time. By Herbert Muschamp. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   HERMITAGE-MUSEUM (St. Petersburg, Russia) _ For a museum that
has miraculously survived the 20th century (two revolutions, two
wars and Russia's messy eight-yearlong lurch toward democracy), the
Hermitage, keeper of one of the world's greatest art collections,
is doing its best to get a jump on the coming millennium. This
week, it will launch what experts describe as one of the best
digital libraries on a museum Internet site, put together by IBM
technicians working with the latest scanning technology, some of it
designed especially for IBM's $2-million Hermitage project. By
Celestine Bohlen. (Moved). Photo.

   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;

   TV-MINI-SERIES (Undated) _ A look at some of the proposed
television mini-series for the fall. By Ron Wertheimer. (Moved).

Valley,'' the story of the computer revolution. By Anita Gates.

   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DEPERO-ART-ANTIQUES (Miami Beach) _ The stunning variety of
works the Italian painter and designer, Fortunato Depero, produced
are explored in ``Depero Futurista Rome-Paris-New York,
1915-1932,'' an exhibition here at the Wolfsonian museum of design,
through July 26. Most of the 160 items on view were produced before
1932, but some date to the late 1940s. Aside from a chair and
several books from the Wolfsonian collection, the objects on view
were lent by the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art of Trento
and Rovereto, towns 20 to 30 miles north of Verona in northern
Italy near Fondo, the village where Depero was born. But from
earliest childhood until his death at 68 in 1960, Depero lived
mostly in Roverto, where he worked at the House of Art, the studio,
showcase and shop for his art and furnishings. By Rita Reif.

OFFICIALS ENVISION A KOSOVO `WALLED OFF' FROM YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany _ Although the political future of Kosovo is
left vague in the settlement that ended the war, American and NATO
officials say they envision an international protectorate that will
in theory be part of Yugoslavia but that may well, after a few
years, become independent.
</P>
<P>
   As refugees return and society is rebuilt, a senior NATO
official said Thursday, Kosovo will become virtually ``walled off''
from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   People living in Kosovo would not serve in the Yugoslav army or
pay taxes to Yugoslavia; a new police and judiciary would have to
be created without Yugoslav influence; the currency would probably
be either the Deutsch Mark or the American dollar; and trade would
turn south and west toward Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro
instead of north to Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   None of these points are spelled out in the settlement that
President Slobodan Milosevic signed. Indeed, in framing a political
solution to the war, the NATO allies have been careful to state
that Kosovo will remain within Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on keeping the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia
and not allowing Kosovo to break away immediately was an essential
ingredient for winning the agreement of Milosevic and the Russians
to a peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   But the resolution passed by the U.N. Security Council on
Thursday includes the phrase ``taking full account of the
Rambouillet accords,'' a signal that can be interpreted to infer
that down the road independence is a probability, Clinton
administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Rambouillet accords _ which Milosevic refused to sign,
a move that led directly to the airstrikes _ the future status of
Kosovo was to be decided by calling an international conference in
about three years. The views of the conference, as well as the
``will of the people'' of Kosovo and an assessment of Serb views,
would determine the final status of the province, according to
those accords.
</P>
<P>
   The accords offered a detailed blueprint for an autonomous
Kosovo, including a 120-member parliament, election rules, an
independent judiciary, local government structures, a police force
and border security.
</P>
<P>
   As Kosovo becomes increasingly separated from Serbia, which is
the dominant republic in what is left of Yugoslavia, the likelihood
of Serbs having a significant say in the status of Kosovo will
diminish, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The physical reconstruction of Kosovo was addressed briefly
Thursday at a meeting here of the foreign ministers of the
so-called Group of 8 countries _ the richest industrial nations and
Russia _ who said they would soon organize a donors conference to
start raising the billions of dollars needed for the task.
</P>
<P>
   As well, the G8 announced a stability pact for Southeastern
Europe that is intended to help the poor economies of the region
that were made still poorer by the war. The World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund would be called on for financing, the
G8 said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said Thursday that since the United States had
carried the cost of most of the military campaign, the cost of
rebuilding the burned homes, damaged roads and torched schools of
Kosovo would be borne mostly by the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has requested $100 million in a supplemental
appropriations bill for Kosovo and the redevelopment of the
countries of southeastern Europe, but Congress is expected to
approve only a portion.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. secretary-general, Kofi Annan, is expected shortly to
announce his choice of special representative for Kosovo, a job
that will likely resemble that of a governor general.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the French foreign ministry, Anne
Gazeau-Secret, said Thursday that that her government had requested
that Annan appoint a European to the post. A European in charge of
Kosovo made the most sense, she said, because the bulk of the money
for reconstruction would come from the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials have said that despite doubts
about the efficiency of U.N. programs, they were resigned to the
United Nations taking overall responsibility for Kosovo, with the
European Union playing a major role as financier.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations was a preferable choice as the dominant
player, Clinton administration officials said, because the United
States has influence there but not at the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Another organization, the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, a 54 member trans-Atlantic body based in
Vienna, Austria, would also play a vital role in rebuilding Kosovo,
officials said. In particular, the OSCE would organize elections
for a time yet to be set and might assist in forming a new police
force.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months, administration officials have been
careful not to flatly rule out independence for Kosovo, or
separation from Yugoslavia, even though European countries are more
fearful of the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has quietly held out the prospect because the
feasibility of independence is important as a way of trying to
encourage the Kosovo Liberation Army to lay down its arms.
</P>
<P>
   As a moral question, the possibility of independence is
important to the ethnic Albanian population, who before the war
outnumbered the Serbs by more than 90 percent. In all likelihood,
according to Balkans experts, much of the civilian Serb population
still left in Kosovo will probably go to Serbia proper, leaving the
province almost totally an ethnic-Albanian enclave.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For Western Europe, the idea of an independent Kosovo or of a
Kosovo joined to Albania is more inconceivable than for the United
States, European diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   First, a breakaway Kosovo would set a precedent for other
separatist groups in Europe. Second, and less openly expressed, is
the fear that Kosovo, whose ethnic Albanian population is mostly
Muslim, could become an island of Islam in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   As preparations get under way for Kosovo's reconstruction,
comparisons were being made Thursday to the efforts made in Bosnia
after the peace accord in 1995. There were many lessons to be
learned, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, the reconstruction in Bosnia has been hampered
by poor management, competition among international agencies and
slow funding from the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gazeau-Secret called the Bosnia experience a ``disaster''
which, she said, should not be repeated in Kosovo. The head of the
OSCE office in Bosnia, a former American ambassador, Robert Barry,
said that the Bosnia efforts had gone poorly. Funds pledged by the
European Union had been extremely slow to materialize, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at least in Bosnia, there were institutions, though not
very good ones.''
</P>
<P>
   One important difference was that almost as soon as the Dayton
peace accords were signed, Bosnia was admitted to the World Bank
and other international financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo will not have such a luxury because its banks have been
part of the Yugoslav banking system and thus are banned, under
current sanctions, from international loans. Kosovo will no longer
be reliant on Serbia's banks or economy, a factor that will push it
further away from Serbia, economists said.
</P>
<P>
   A new court system and a police force would also have to be
created. ``There are no judges in Kosovo because they were all
Serbs,'' Barry said. ``What is to be done with people when they are
arrested? Who are they to be turned over to?''

   SAN FRANCISCO _ The National Semiconductor Corp. reported its
fifth consecutive quarterly loss Thursday, but its results
essentially met analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The company's executives said National Semiconductor was on
track to return to profitability by its fiscal second quarter,
which ends in November. National said last month that it would exit
the personal computer microprocessor business, which has suffered
heavy losses amid the continuing price wars between the Intel Corp.
and Advanced Micro Devices Inc.
</P>
<P>
   For its fiscal fourth quarter, which ended May 30, National
reported a loss of $783.5 million, or $4.65 a diluted share,
compared with a loss of $212.4 million, or $1.29 a share, in the
quarter a year earlier. Revenue fell 6 percent, to $477 million
from $510 million.
</P>
<P>
   The results include one-time charges of $688.4 million related
to the exit of the microprocessor business and sale of a plant in
Portland, Me., and $55.1 million related to inventory write-offs
and product returns. Excluding charges, the loss would have been
$40 million, or 24 cents a share, compared with $69.3 million, or
42 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The operating earnings matched analysts' estimates, according to
the First Call Corp., which tracks company earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Before the results were announced, shares of National
Semiconductor rose $1.8125, to $22.50, on the New York Stock
Exchange. The shares have rallied since the company announced last
month that it was leaving the PC microprocessor business, and
analysts say the company's non-PC businesses should sustain
profitable growth once the microprocessor unit is divested.
National paid $550 million to acquire the Cyrix Corp. in 1997 in
order to enter the business.
</P>
<P>
   Halla said that the company was seeing strong orders for analog
chips, which are used to process audio and video, and that its
strategy of producing so-called systems on a chip for the
information appliance market had begun to bear fruit, including an
order for chips to power a new device to be marketed by America
Online.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, National reported a loss of $1 billion, compared
with a loss of $98.6 million in fiscal 1998.

NATO ENTRY INTO KOSOVO TO BE DELAYED UNTIL SATURDAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ NATO Thursday night scrubbed plans for a
dawn entry into Kosovo by British paratroopers on Friday,
suspending its peacekeeping operation for at least 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The British paratroopers were to have lifted off by helicopter
at 4 a.m. from the rapidly swelling military compound here as an
advance guard to secure the main highway running from the border to
Pristina, Kosovo's provincial capital, but a Western official said
the deployment was likely to be delayed until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The paratroopers were to be swiftly followed by other British
soldiers as the lead element of the multinational peacekeeping
force intended to end the 11-week-old war in which Serbian forces
hounded more than a million members of the Kosovar Albanian
majority from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which had been kept secret, was quietly canceled
Thursday night, as was a technical and logistical briefing for
reporters that had been scheduled earlier in the day, at which NATO
officers had said they would outline the deployment of the various
forces, predominantly British, French, Italian and American at this
point, and their schedule for entering Kosovo behind the departing
Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said Thursday night that the delay was a result
of difficulty the Serbs were having in mounting their withdrawal. A
Western official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said the
Serbian withdrawal had been slowed by a fuel shortage and damaged
equipment as well as by land mines and a fear of moving out troops
at night when they might be vulnerable to the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian withdrawal is supposed to be completed within 11
days under the terms of the agreement signed on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The force commander, British Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson, promised
at a news conference Thursday night, that ``we shall be off
quickly,'' and that his troops would act in a manner ``both robust
and evenhanded.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to a question about whether the peacekeepers would
aid investigators from the International War Crimes Tribunal in the
Hague and whether they would arrest war crimes suspects in their
territory, Jackson was vague on the subject of cooperation and
suggested that Bosnia, where major indicted suspects have roamed
free amid U.N. forces would be a model for his operation.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the peacekeepers face a daunting task. One immediate
fear, Jackson said, was mines and perhaps booby traps in areas the
Serbs are abandoning.
</P>
<P>
   In the longer run, what the peacekeepers must deal with is the
deep-seated hatred both ethnic groups feel toward each other.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Western peacekeeping efforts in Somalia, Haiti and
Rwanda, among other places, the soldiers heading for Kosovo will be
hobbled by their own goals: they want to ensure the safety of the
Albanians, but not give victory to the KLA, which commands
widespread loyalty among the displaced Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was very careful Thursday night to direct his remarks
about the ``evenhandedness'' of his troops at least as much at the
ascendant KLA fighters as against the departing Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence and noncompliance will not be tolerated,'' he said.
``We want a secure environment for the return of all refugees.
There will be peace and security to all the people of Kosovo. The
armed Kovoso groups, we will require them to demilitarize. We want
the people to have the confidence to return to a normal way of
life.''

REFUGEES IN MACEDONIA REJOICE AT KOSOVO PACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SKOPJE, Macedonia _ An ebullient Mustaf Domaneku arrived at the
main border crossing into Kosovo at 8:45 a.m. Thursday, determined
to return home in front of the NATO troops. Nine-year-old Burhan
Ferati packed up his toys and clothes in his tent in a refugee camp
this morning and announced to his mother, ``I'm preparing to go to
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   And Emrush Demnika cheered with 200 other men Thursday night as
they craned their necks to see the extraordinary announcement on a
small television set in their refugee camp that Yugoslav forces
were actually withdrawing from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good,'' Demnika stammered as an infectious grin spread
across his face. ``I can't describe with words what I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   In bustling camps and remote villages, refugees who had wrapped
themselves in a self-protective cocoon of cynicism since diplomatic
``breakthroughs'' over Kosovo were announced last week began
cracking smiles Thursday and actively considering the possibility
that they could soon, in fact, be returning home.
</P>
<P>
   The mood among refugees is gradually shifting from a blunt
refusal to believe anything said by Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to creeping optimism that their nemesis may finally be
cornered. The pressure that led many to flock toward the
opportunity to go abroad is easing, refugees and aid workers said,
and the idea of returning home is taking hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, people were forming big crowds whenever there was the
chance to go abroad,'' said Avni Rrustemi, a 25-year-old carpenter
living in the Stenkovec I refugee camp. ``Now, everyone is sitting
in front of their tents making plans about going back.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Joseph, an aid worker in the Stenkovec camp, said the first
sign of a mood shift was occurring in a camp that has suffered
flashes of violence in recent days. Saturday, a mob of angry Kosovo
Albanians tried to beat to death a gypsy they accused of committing
atrocities. And Monday, roughly 150 refugees grew unruly when they
were told a rumor that Denmark was accepting volunteers to go
abroad was untrue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's sinking in,'' Joseph said. ``The prospect of
returning home is slowly catching fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The humanitarian evacuations to Western Europe and the United
States have had the effect here of focusing many refugees'
attention on how to go abroad, not how to return home, Joseph and
other aid workers said. Refugees living in superheated tents, where
temperatures can rise to over 100 degrees, became anxious, or
angry, that others were getting the chance to go abroad instead of
them.
</P>
<P>
   But news of peace is resulting in changing attitudes, with
several people Thursday announcing they would now rather go home
than go abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Naser Krasniqi, 27, said he had turned down the opportunity to
go to Sweden this Tuesday. ``We were on the list,'' he said,
referring to the daily flight lists posted on camp bulletin boards
that refugees anxiously pore over. ``I want to go back to Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   The new optimism was also evident in smaller villages. Hisa
Luma, a 39-year-old former policeman living as a refugee in the
remote border village of Jazince, said he felt ``more and more
convinced each day'' that this agreement is different than past
ones.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel more confident because the agreement was signed by the
army,'' he said. ``The army is not like the politicians. They won't
change it.''
</P>
<P>
   The new energy and optimism of Luma and Domaneku, the refugee at
the border Thursday morning, present a problem for NATO and the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials announced their plans for the return of the
refugees Thursday and estimated that, at the earliest, refugees
could begin returning to Kosovo in three weeks. Paula Ghedini, a
spokeswoman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees,
said the repatriation would be ``one of the most complicated
operations we've ever seen. There are so many political and
military and security sensitivities.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials plan to return the refugees to their regions by bus.
But they first want troops to clear Kosovo of mines. They also want
food and rebuilding supplies to be in place before the refugees
arrive. Half the homes in Kosovo are believed to have been damaged.
Ms. Ghedini said she was ``fairly certain'' the vast majority of
refugees would be back home before winter. Whether refugees will
abide by that timetable remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   While most refugees said they would wait, Luma and Domaneku both
said they would go to their home towns in southeastern Kosovo on
their own, either by driving in now or by hiking over the
mountains. U.N. officials said hundreds of men might do the same
thing, acting as ``scouts'' for their families to determine whether
homes are habitable for women and children.
</P>
<P>
   Standing at the border Thursday morning, Luma said he wanted to
go into Kosovo before NATO troops did, so they would not slow him
down. Having lost one foot already to a mine, he said he did not
care if he lost the other.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was one of the first ones thrown out,'' he said. ``I want to
be the first one to go in.''

U.S. IS FALLING SHORT OF ITS HEALTH GOALS FOR 2000

 By PHILIP J. HILTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The nation has met only about 15 percent of its health goals for
the year 2000, set 20 years ago, the Department of Health and Human
Services reported Thursday, but progress has been made on another
44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For about 20 percent of the objectives, the nation is getting
less healthy and is moving away from the goals, said Surgeon
General David Satcher at a news conference at Harvard Medical
School in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways we are doing well,'' Satcher said, ``and in
others we still have challenges and more to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Donna E. Shalala, the secretary of health and
human resources, said, ``As the century draws to a close, we can be
proud that we have made significant strides in improving the health
of Americans.'' Shalala said the progress report ``lets us measure
the overall progress we have achieved in preventing disease and
promoting health.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, Healthy People 2000 Review, outlined 319 different
health goals for the nation that were set at the start of 1979 and
reviewed in 1989. They include hoped-for progress on such disparate
measures as infant mortality, the rate of dental cavities, average
physical activity, teen-age pregnancy, hearing impairment and the
rates of a variety of diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Among the areas where goals have been met are reductions in
infant mortality, childhood mortality and breast cancer deaths.
Among those where the report showed the nation was getting worse
were in the level of physical activity, the number of children
taking physical education and the number of people overweight or
obese.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Julius Richmond, the former surgeon general, who established
the Healthy People 2000 program, said that watching the change in
health patterns over the past 20 years had produced some surprises.
Among the most surprising is a 35 percent drop in heart disease and
a 65 percent decline in strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just came unexpectedly,'' Richmond said ``and we are
still not sure of all the factors that contributed to it.''
</P>
<P>
   A disappointment among the data is that while infant mortality
has continued to decline, and is almost at the goal, there remains
a great disparity between the rate for whites and for blacks. The
death rate among black infants is about twice that for whites, he
said. ``and has been that way for decades.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very disappointing,'' Richmond said.
</P>
<P>
   Satcher said that other health disparities among ethnic groups
were also troubling. Hispanic people are twice as likely as whites
to be diabetic and African-Americans have a disproportionately high
death rate from diabetes. African-Americans are also much more
likely than whites to be hospitalized or die from asthma, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Satcher also noted that some of the most important challenges
were in diet and fitness.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, the percent of Americans who are
overweight was about 26 in the mid-1970s. The government
established a goal for the year 2000 of 20 percent of the
population, and many people believed it might be achieved as more
Americans appeared to become interested in nutrition and fitness
over the past 15 years. But instead, the number of people
overweight rose to 35 percent by 1995, the latest year for which
data was given in the report.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, about 15 percent of adolescents were overweight,
Satcher said, and that figure has risen to 24 percent. ``And there
are several categories in which more than half the adults are
overweight,'' he said, ``for example Hispanic and African-American
women.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anne Becker of the Harvard Medical School and the Harvard
Eating Disorders Center said that there was a paradox in the latest
data.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are spending $33 billion a year on dieting products
and services,'' Becker said. ``There has been a proliferation of
weight loss programs and pills. One would think that would have
some effect on losing weight.''
</P>
<P>
   Another figure in the report suggested that while diet pills and
plans may be widespread, sensible weight-loss plans are declining.
The report noted that ``sensible weight loss practices among
overweight people 12 years and older'' had dropped substantially,
to 15 percent of people using them in 1995 from 25 percent of
people using them in 1985. The goal for 2000 was 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A sample of figures given in the new report, the last report
before the government begins work on its Healthy People 2010 goals
and data, include these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Average daily intake of vegetables, fruits and grains among
those older than 2: In 1989, an average of 4.1 servings; in 1996,
an average of 4.7 servings. The goal for 2000 is 5.
</P>
<P>
   _ Breast-feeding shortly after birth: 54 percent of women did so
in 1988; 62 percent did in 1997. The goal is 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mothers who die in childbirth: It was 6.6 per 100,000 live
births in 1987; it rose to 7.5 in 1997. The goal is 3.3.
</P>
<P>
   _ Proportion of students, grades 9-12, who participated in daily
school physical education: It was 42 percent in 1991; it declined
because of budget cuts to 27 percent in 1997. The goal is 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Proportion of children using seat belts and safety seats: It
was 48 percent in 1988; it rose to 61 percent in 1996. The goal is
70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Infant mortality: It was 10.1 in 1987; it dropped to 7.1 in
1997. The goal is 7.
</P>
<P>
   The goals were set by groups of experts from federal, state and
local governments, as well as outside experts, who passed their
recommendations to a steering committee of officials the Department
of Health and Human Services for approval.

LAWMAKERS SQUARE OFF OVER PEACEKEEPER FUNDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To an outsider, the debate on the floor of the
House of Representatives might have seemed inconceivable: whether
the United States should block funding for peacekeeping troops in
Kosovo, just as months of NATO bombings were coming to an end with
a celebrated peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   But this was not about peace. It was not even, some members
conceded, simply about U.S. soldiers' lives or the federal budget.
It was politics, and as the debate lasted into the night _ with
frantic last-minute negotiations to avoid bringing the provision to
a vote _ House Republicans were clearly frustrated they had not
turned the Balkan conflict to their advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was timing, several congressional aides said. With
the vote coinciding precisely with the agreement in Belgrade,
Republicans found it difficult to criticize U.S. military strategy.
Many instead turned to questioning whether the Clinton
administration had actually won and when Congress could be asked to
pay for efforts to rebuild Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new and perhaps more troubling phase for our
country,'' said Representative Floyd Spence, a South Carolina
Republican who chairs the House Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is victory? Well, let the president call it whatever he
wants,'' said Representative William Goodling, a Pennsylvania
Republican on the House International Relations Committee. ``I call
it a total disaster. It's going to be billions and billions of
dollars for something we have no national security interest in. It
is a complete national security interest for Europe. And they sat
there and did nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans had argued the provision to cut off funding for
peacekeeping troops was necessary because otherwise too much money
would be depleted from overall military funding.
</P>
<P>
   But their real intent was to oppose the Clinton administration,
members on both sides of the aisle said. The move would be
considered a routine partisan strategy on any other day, but it
could appear anti-patriotic on the heels of the administration's
military success.
</P>
<P>
   And so Thursday, after hours of behind-the-scenes negotiation
between House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, House Democrats and the
White House, a last-minute deal was struck. President Clinton
promised that the Kosovo effort would be paid for ``without harming
military readiness.'' That allowed Republicans to retreat from
their demand that the peacekeeping funding cutoff be included in
the $288.8 billion defense spending bill. In the end, the House
voted 270-155 to remove the provision from the bill, which was
expected to pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans were embarrassed,'' said Representative Barney
Frank, a Newton Democrat. Explaining why the Republicans were
willing to reach an agreement, he added, ``Hastert is trying to
rehabilitate himself after his screw-up over airstrikes,''
referring to last month's House vote against supporting the U.S.
military effort.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John F. Kerry also said House Republicans had been on
the brink of making a ``very dangerous move with very serious
ramifications,'' saying it was ``incomprehensible that we'd fight a
war...and then just turn our backs on peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people really need to sort of stand back and take a
deep breath, and be very careful of trying to use politics here,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The debate came a day after the House voted to end the U.S.
peacekeeping mission in Haiti, where troops have been installed for
nearly five years. In a 227-198 vote, the House approved pulling
U.S. forces out of Haiti by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   And yet it was clear that the debate over Kosovo is far from
over. Still to be resolved is the issue of helping rebuild the
Yugoslav province, as well as supplying economic aid to the entire
region. Many members, including Democrats, are urging Europe to
foot the bill.
</P>
<P>
   But only a few had hope that partisan politics would now be put
aside. Senator Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat on the Senate
Armed Services Committee, said he hoped the victory in Kosovo had
``silenced those critics who were reflexively anti-Clinton and
viewed this...as a political opportunity to do damage to the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, now, as we go forward, we can focus on the
substance rather than the politics,'' he said.

COMPANIES PLAN SUPER JUMBO JETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Think Boeing's 747-400 _ with room for 416 passengers in three
classes and more than 550 in a domestic version used by Japan Air
Lines _ is a big airplane?
</P>
<P>
   Think again.
</P>
<P>
   In 2004, Airbus plans to have the first flight of the A-3XX, a
double-decker airplane that that will seat between 550 and 650
passengers with three classes of service. It's wingspan will be 261
feet 10 inches _ nearly the length of a football field and 50 feet
longer than the 747s.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is also developing 747 models that might seat as many as
100 more people in three classes than the 747-400.
</P>
<P>
   These super jumbo jets or, in industry parlance, ``very large
transport'' are expected to meet the increasing demand for air
travel, especially in transoceanic, European-Asian and inter-Asian
routes.
</P>
<P>
   While the planes will be aerospace engineering marvels, they
will also create significant problems for everyone from passengers
to ramp service personnel, airport operators and emergency crews.
</P>
<P>
   And there is growing concern about the ability to evacuate the
airplanes in the 90 seconds required under federal law, especially
because the Federal Aviation Administration is considering a
regulation change that could do away with a live evacuation drill
and use instead computer simulations relying on data from previous
drills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more people you can cram into an aircraft, it means the
more people who will die if there is an accident,'' said
Christopher J. Witkowski, director of air safety and health for the
Association of Flight Attendants. ``If manufacturers can't meet the
current standard with a live drill, they should reduce the number
of seats on their airplanes.''
</P>
<P>
   Airbus officials scoff at the suggestion that the plane will not
be safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, we believe computer simulated evacuation is the
safe way to go because pople are injured in the drills, but if
authorities decide otherwise, we would obviously concur,'' said
Mary Anne Greczyn, a spokeswoman for Airbus Industrie of North
America. ``If there were a safety question, we would not build the
aircraft.''
</P>
<P>
   In the closely regulated world of commercial aircraft
manufacturing, the number of seats that a plane may accomodate is
based on several criteria. First, the number of exit doors
determines roughly how many people may fit on an airplane. But
airlines and manufacturers have also had to demonstrate evacuation
procedures with a full drill by having a large number of volunteers
try to successfully leave the airplane within 90 seconds with dim
lighting and half of the exits blocked.
</P>
<P>
   While planes configured with first, business and economy class
sections hold fewer passengers than they are certified for,
replacing the drill with a computer analysis concerns some.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real problem when you get bigger and bigger,'' said
Paul Hudson, executive director of the Aviation Consumer Action
Project. ``The mathematical theory, the queuing theory, is that the
speed of the queue is governed by its slowest member. You don't
take average speed, which the computer model does. A line of 500
people will move much more slowly than fives times the speed of 100
people and the FAA is ignoring that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is about the evacuation of an airplane that size,''
said Hal Salfen, director of consumer affairs for the International
Airline Passanger Association. ``If there was an accident, they
would have an awful difficult time evacuating that many people.''
</P>
<P>
   An FAA spokeswoman said the super jumbo jets are still too early
in their design phase to know whether special certification issues
would be required. But Airbus anticipates the A-3XX will receive
certification and enter service in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   That is not too soon for airports and firefighters to start
planning for the super jumbo jet.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Heathrow to JFK market, you have a lot of carriers
dispatching two 747s within three hours and they would put in one
larger aircraft if they had it,'' said Richard Marchi, senior vice
president for technical and environmental affairrs at Airports
Council International in North America. ``Now, we process 350
people each time over three hours, but if you have 600 people on
one flight it will increase the `peaking' at check-in and moving
people through the facility.''
</P>
<P>
   Marchi said huge planes would have no problem at new airports
like Denver, but operating restrictions would have to be placed? in
older airports, where tight gate space would create problems.
</P>
<P>
   The A-3XX is not expected to require a longer runway than a
Boeing 747-400, which can land at Logan. But the plane's 1.2
million pounds of weight will require airports to reinforce
taxiways, bridges and culverts that were built to withstand the
747-400, which weighs about 900,000 pounds, said Marchi.
</P>
<P>
   ACI estimated that airports will have to spend between $50
million and $100 million in upgrades to handle super jumbo jets.
</P>
<P>
   At Logan, in addition to trying to build a new runway, Massport
also wants to spend $35 million on a new centerfield taxiway to
supplement two taxiways so close to the terminals and each other,
that officials are concerned that wingtips of current jumbo jets
will strike other planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wingspans of the A-340, the 747-400 and the 777 do not
allow us to simultaneously taxi those airplanes on the inner and
outer taxiways,'' said Thomas Kinton, director of aviation for
Massport. ``The midfield taxiway will not give us seemless movement
around taxiways, but it does give the tower ability to get planes
in and out of the congested gate areas more easily.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And we will have to worry about dealing with 600 or 700
victims in an accident, so we will have to step our emergency plan
and foucs on that,'' said Kinton.
</P>
<P>
   Aircraft firefighting and rescue is a specialized field. Under
federal regulations, the longer the plane, the more equipment,
personnel and fire suppression material on hand. But with super
jumbo jets, it may not be enough, becuase the length of the planes
will not increase as much as their wingspan and interior size.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these larger planes coming out, additional technology
will have to evolve,'' said Gary Schott, chairman of the Aircraft
Rescue and Firefighting Working Group. ``They'll put severe
limitations on us because they will carry a lot more people and a
lot more fuel.''
</P>
<P>
   If traveling in close quarters with 600 other people seems
daunting to the most jaded traveler, consider baggage handlers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The loading and unloading of someting that size will impose a
tremendous burden on ramp service personnel,'' said James Sprang, a
spokesman for the International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers. The planes will most likely require two loading
bridges for passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus, however, believes the turnaround time of the A-3XX will
be similar to that of a 747 and estimates future demand for air
travel will result in the need for some 1,300 new aircraft with
room for 400 or more passengers. As a result, it expects to spend
about $10 billion to develop the A-3XX to meet that need. The cost
of the plane is expected to be $213 million and up.
</P>
<P>
   Some 20 airlines, including United and FedEx, have been invited
to work with Airbus in development of the A-3XX.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is working on plans for new 747s with more capacity, but
it is not considering developing a new type of aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that we don't believe there is a market for it,''
said Boeing Commercial Airplane spokesman Randolph C. Harrison.
``Some airlines would like to have it, but the issue is whether
there is enough of a market to make a business case for the
research and development costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing thinks the answer is no. One reason is the company sees
regulatory and technological changes doing for transpacific routes
what they did to transatlantic ones in the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Open skies policies allowed more flights from the US to more
overseas cities, and regulations allowed two-engine aircraft to fly
over the Altantic _ and more recently the Pacific. As a result,
there has been rapid growth in flights from smaller East Coast
cities, like Pittsburgh, to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Jenkins, director of the Aviation Institute at the George
Washington University, says that putting 600 people on one plane
instead of 700 people on two will not necessarily save an airline
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an incredible marketing risk in a plane that big,''
said Jenkins. ``It is much easier to market more frequent flights
with 200 seats than one flight with 600 seats. Smaller planes give
you more flexibility in routes and the off-season. If there is a
downturn, that plane will eat you up on cost.''

VENTURE CAPITALIST, FATHER HAS GOOD ADVICE FOR NAVIGATING BOTH
WORLDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wanted: Qualified applicant for critical leadership position.
Must be able to effectively balance short and long-term goals, make
strategic decisions, and effectively motivate subordinates. Must be
willing to build teamwork and cultivate values. Negotiation skills
essential.
</P>
<P>
   Sound like a great executive position? You're right, it is. It's
called being a parent.
</P>
<P>
   The skills of parenting and management are not that far apart
(something many moms have known for years.)
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hirschfeld, venture capitalist and father, has written a
book especially for dads. It's called ``Business Dad; How Good
Businessmen Can Make Great Fathers (and Vice Versa.) (Little Brown,
1999, $23.)
</P>
<P>
   Read as either a business book or a parenting book, it has good
advice for navigating the sometimes chaotic world of work and
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some problems at first adjusting to life as a father and
a businessman,'' said Hirschfeld, who has two children, ages 5 and
2. ``I got complacent after my son was born. I wasn't being a full
partner. It took a lot of encouragement from my wife to get me up
to speed.''
</P>
<P>
   It helped that his wife, Julie Hirschfeld, is a family
therapist. She's also co-author of the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have my priorities straight now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the process of straightening them out, he landed on a theory
that he felt would help other fathers feel more confident and
capable at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day when my son was 3, I came home from a long day
negotiating deals, and ended up negotiating with him about his
bedtime,'' he said. ``The light bulb went off.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to be two different people at work and at
home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The life of a manager can be broken down into four activities:
Gathering information, making decisions, executing decisions and
managing other people.
</P>
<P>
   Parenting requires many of the same skills it takes to do those
tasks.
</P>
<P>
   To gather information, for example, you must be able to listen,
empathize, observe and employ critical thinking techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Those skills will give you the information you need to make
decisions in a rapidly changing environment.
</P>
<P>
   The workplace is constantly changing, and kids change every time
you blink, he said. ``In both business and fathering, keeping up is
much easier than catching up.''
</P>
<P>
   Certain people management skills also translate well into family
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentoring at work is morally right, and smart since you get
better work and support from subordinates,'' he said. ``This
applies ten-fold with your kids.''
</P>
<P>
   And tolerance is critical for both dealing with employees and
children. ``Kids are harder to manage than employees, but the basic
skill set is the same,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschfeld hopes that couching parenting advice in the language
of business, will inspire men to be more confident in their
parenting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wives spend more time with children and naturally become
experts,'' he said. ``That can be intimidating for fathers.''
</P>
<P>
   The culture of many corporations doesn't encourage men to feel
entitled to take time with their families, Hirschfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a kind of social expectation about macho, mucho
hours,'' he said. ``At work there's a culture of face time. Worth
is based on how many hours you spend at the office, not on what
you've actually accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   That forces fathers to put in quantity time at the office and
quality time at home when it should be the other way around, he
said. The office is the place to be efficient, while kids need as
much time with their parents as they can get.
</P>
<P>
   That corporate culture won't change, however, until men start
speaking up about their family commitments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys have to stop being silent and say, `Look, I'd like to
stay, but I promised I'd read my son a book before he goes to bed,'
'' he said. ``It's gonna take individuals to change the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Many companies already have programs to help employees balance
work and family needs, but men often don't take advantage of them,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those policies, such as flex-time, telecommuting, parental
leaves _ it doesn't say anywhere that they're for mothers, but
that's the way it usually works out,'' he said. ``A lot of managers
still think of working parents as mothers only. ''
</P>
<P>
   Men have been afraid to speak out about their desire to spend
time with their families, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschfeld has already adapted his work life to his family life.
A former New York City-based investment banker, he now works as a
venture capitalist, which gives him more flexibility to do some
work from home.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschfeld admits the business and parenting parallels only go
so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't fire your kids,'' he said. And you can't go around
giving orders and expecting people to jump at them.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't even work at the office in the long run,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And there are certain management skills you shouldn't try at
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delegating at work is rewarded, but if you delegate too much
at home, you stop being an active father,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There's one more thing to leave at the office, he said. ``Kids,
God bless them, aren't built for taking meetings.''

<P>
   Why must Bell Industries, a computer services company in El
Segundo, Calif., go all the way to India to hire programmers? The
company's co-chairman, Theodore Williams, thinks it's because
America doesn't have its priorities straight.
</P>
<P>
   Williams says his frustration at being unable to find enough
qualified Americans to fill his company's needs is why he backs
Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities, a group of business
people he helped found that is campaigning for fundamental change
in the way the government uses its resources.
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of Williams and other members of the group, the
shortage of programmers is symptomatic of an education system
starved of money and hurting American competitiveness while
billions of dollars are lavished on unproductive military spending.
</P>
<P>
   The group wants higher budgetary priority given to schools,
health care for children and other programs to insure America's
future economic vitality.
</P>
<P>
   Though it was organized by an unabashed liberal activist, Ben
Cohen, co-founder of Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade, and has attracted
names that are decidedly not part of the business mainstream, like
Paul Newman and Ted Turner to its list of members, the group is
made up mostly of executives and business owners who hope their
practical business background will give them credibility with
lawmakers and voters.
</P>
<P>
   The group steers away from the usual ideological and partisan
camps. It does not ask its members about their party affiliations,
and in interviews several members maintained that eliminating waste
and encouraging wiser spending were goals that fit as well with a
conservative agenda as with a liberal one.
</P>
<P>
   ```Conservative' means prudence, and `conservative' means not
spending money indiscriminately without a return,'' said Arnold
Hiatt, chairman of the Stride Rite Foundation and one of the
group's founders. ``I think an awful lot of money is being spent,
particularly in the Defense Department, not for the right
reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Pacifism isn't on the agenda either. ``We are in favor of a
strong military,'' said Bruce Klatsky, chairman and chief executive
of the Philips-Van Heusen Corp., a clothing and shoe manufacturer,
and another founder of the group. ``What we are against is the
waste in the military.''
</P>
<P>
   The group's profile rose considerably when, late last year, it
began an advertising campaign arguing that, with the cold war over,
billions of dollars could safely be cut from nuclear weapons
programs and from new generations of fighter aircraft and attack
submarines meant to replace models that are already the world's
best.
</P>
<P>
   In expressing these views, the business group relies on several
military advisers, including Lawrence Korb, assistant defense
secretary under former President Ronald Reagan, and Paul C. Warnke,
who was former President Jimmy Carter's chief arms negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   The money thus saved can be spent on education, health and other
programs that Cohen and other members of the group argue will
provide the highest possible returns for the country.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the group's message is anathema to the
military industry. The Pentagon spent $44 billion on weapons last
year, the least in more than a decade, said John W. Douglass,
president and chief executive of the Aerospace Industries
Association of America, in an interview. Overall, he said, arms
spending has fallen by 70 percent since the end of the cold war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to try to say that Americans have two choices, education
or Pentagon waste, is just an outrageous oversimplification and
unfair statement,'' Douglass said.
</P>
<P>
   The business leaders' group counters that military spending is
already on its way back up. Even before NATO began bombing
Yugoslavia in late March, the Clinton administration was asking
Congress for the biggest increase in military spending since the
1980s, an additional $112 billion over the next five years,
bringing the Pentagon budget up to $319 billion by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that we're in a warlike state creates a climate for
larger budget increases and less examination of the wastefulness
that already exists,'' said Newman, in an interview conducted
before the Kosovo peace agreement was concluded late last week.
</P>
<P>
   The business leaders' group has grown from 5 members (Cohen,
Williams, Hiatt, Klatsky, and Alan Hassenfeld, chairman and chief
executive of Hasbro Inc.) in 1996 to 450 today.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to ads, the group is using its money to pay for a
bus tour called ``U Slice the Pie.'' It began in April in
Washington and is to run through November, spending a lot of time
in Iowa, an early stop in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   At events like county fairs and church picnics, three young
actors present the group's message using huge inflatable displays
with statistics on budget allocations, military industry lobbying
and job creation. The bus itself is painted to look like piles of
cash. Some of the executives have spoken at the bus stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue of federal budget priorities is kind of dry,'' said
Cohen. ``It's kind of off-putting to people. The object of the `U
Slice the Pie' performance is to make it fun and exciting.''

THREE FORMER CELTICS NOMINATED FOR HALL OF FAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Celtic contingent in the Basketball Hall of Fame is about to
grow. The only unknown is by how many.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin McHale, Dennis Johnson, and JoJo White were among 13
nominees for the Class of '99 to Springfield. McHale is a deadbolt
lock; they might as well commission the program piece. Johnson,
twice nominated before, and White, are less certain, although a
case can be made for both.
</P>
<P>
   Three other nominees also have Celtic ties: ex-Georgetown coach
John Thompson, who backed up Bill Russell for 74 games in the
mid-1960s, Wayne Embry, who played two seasons for the Celtics,
and, alas, Bob McAdoo, who was with Boston for one stormy stretch
(20 games) in 1978-79.
</P>
<P>
   Four other ex-NBA players were nominated: Maurice Cheeks, the
late Gus Johnson, Sidney Moncrief, and Chet Walker. Also nominated
were Mount St. Mary's coach Jim Phelan, whose 800-442 record gives
him more wins than any other active college coach; Tex Winter, an
assistant Chicago Bulls coach and proponent of the triangle offense
who has spent 52 seasons at Division 1 college and NBA teams _ more
than any active coach, and Morgan Wootten, the legendary coach at
DeMatha High School in Washington, D.C., whose record of 1,185-178
is the best ever for a high school coach.
</P>
<P>
   The inductees will be announced in 10 days. The enshrinement
ceremony is scheduled for Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics' media guide lists 25 individuals in the Hall of
Fame with ties to the team, some as fleeting as McAdoo's. Pete
Maravich, for instance, played in just 26 games for the 1979-80
Celtics. Dave Bing spent one season with Boston. McHale will be No.
26.
</P>
<P>
   McHale spent his entire, 12-year career with the Celtics,
racking up numerous individual honors along with three championship
rings. He also was named as one of the top 50 players of all time
in the NBA's 50th anniversary season. His frontcourt teammate,
Larry Bird, was enshrined last year.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson twice has been nominated (1995, '96) and fallen short.
He was never one for individual statistics, but he also owns three
title rings, one from Seattle (1979) and two with Boston (1984,
'86.) He was widely seen as one of the best defensive guards of his
time and was the consummate big-game player. Bird has referred to
him as ``the best teammate I ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   White, also a two-time nominee, was a member of the 1974 and '76
Celtics title teams and also won a gold medal at the 1968 Olympics
at Mexico City. He spent 10 seasons with the Celtics before
finishing his career with less luminous stops in Golden State and
Kansas City. (He also returned in 1987 to play five games for the
CBA Topeka Sizzlers.)
</P>
<P>
   Thompson played 64 games for the 1964-65 champion Celtics and
stuck around for 10 games the following season. He retired from
Georgetown earlier this year, having made 14 straight NCAA
appearances and winning the title with Patrick Ewing in 1984. Embry
played two seasons for the Celtics, 1966-68, getting a ring with
the 1967-68 team. He was then taken by Milwaukee in the expansion
draft.

 &HT;    Rocker shooting to the top
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ How could something other than a radar gun come so
close to measuring John Rocker, the Atlanta Braves' left-handed
relief pitcher, whose 100 mph fastball has helped him become the
hottest young closer in the National League?
</P>
<P>
   Especially three years ago, when Rocker was just another starter
in the Braves' minor-league organization, trying to figure a way
up. And maybe even out.
</P>
<P>
   In his hometown of Macon, a counselor friend of Jake and Judy
Rocker who was trying to become certified in temperament therapy
was looking for guinea pigs for a case study. She had no idea how
close she had come to pegging John Rocker. But it's clear now.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, Rocker has moved from starter to
reliever, minor-leaguer to major-leaguer, set-up man to
pressure-cooking closer after taking over for the ineffective Mark
Wohlers and injured Kerry Ligtenberg. It's obvious why: Rocker's
fastball regularly flashes 97 and 98 on the Turner Field
speed-of-pitch indicator. But the answer to how it happened can be
found in Rocker's personal research into his own temperament.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker had to take care of the hot head and the perpetual knot
in his stomach before he discovered what his arm could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would get so nervous before games,'' Rocker said. ``Because
subconsciously and consciously, I would know that if I pitched bad
I was going to live (mad) for the next five days. If I pitched
good, I'd get to be happy for five days. My whole life revolved
around how I played. ... I guess I finally decided to adopt (a new)
attitude before I had a nervous breakdown.''
</P>
<P>
   A change of mindset
</P>
<P>
   After being drafted by the Braves as an 18th-round pick in 1993,
John Rocker was looking for perfection during the 1995 season in
Class A Macon.
</P>
<P>
   He found frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker put on a regular show for teammates with his bullpen
antics. Biting balls. Letting the throw back from a catcher hit him
in the chest. Flinging balls over the bullpen fence. And that was
just warming up.
</P>
<P>
   He was cracking under the pressure of trying to develop in his
hometown and was sent to the Braves' short-season rookie-league
team in Eugene, Ore., in the middle of the season. It wasn't until
two years later, as a starter in AA Greenville, that Rocker started
to rethink his approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was having a relatively good year, but there were a lot of
guys who were getting a lot more attention than I was,'' Rocker
said. ``I've never doubted my ability, but I was confused as to why
I was always overlooked. I just realized that I had a lot going for
me other than baseball. I had my school paid for. I came from a
good family and would be all right if baseball never panned out. I
quit putting so much pressure on myself.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of that season in Greenville, Rocker discovered how
well he could pitch when he relaxed, winning his last start of the
regular season and his only start in the playoffs.He almost was
untouchable, with only one bad outing late in the season, and had
been invited to pitch in the Arizona Fall League.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time since high school, I could go out and just
enjoy playing,'' Rocker said. ``I started to carry that same
aggressiveness and enjoyment for playing, rather than trying to
play well out of fear _ `If I don't play well, what's going to
happen to me?' ... I'd still lose it when I would have a bad game,
but my head would be cleared a lot quicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned to play more under control. If a guy hit a double
off the wall and I walked somebody, I wasn't fearful of, `If I give
these runs up, I'm going to have a 5 ERA.' You'd look at it as a
challenge, `Let's see if I can get myself out of this.'''
</P>
<P>
   Proving he belongs
</P>
<P>
   Rocker drew on that experience one month ago in San Francisco.
He'd just blown his second save in five chances and had a 1-2
record with a 4.35 ERA. He entered an 8-8 game in the 10th inning,
pitched two scoreless innings and got the win. Since then, he
hasn't allowed a run in 16 appearances. He's 2-2 with a 1.69 ERA
and is fifth in the National League with 13 saves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just said I'd go out and pitch aggressively, be determined
to have confidence in everything I did and just enjoy the
competition, rather than being out there so scared of screwing
up,'' Rocker said. ``I pitched well there and then had another
pretty good outing against Chicago, and next thing you know I have
confidence from good outings. ... I know the performance I've had
the last month has proved to everybody I can do this job. It takes
some of the edge off.''
</P>
<P>
   Bringing the heat
</P>
<P>
   When he's throwing strikes, Rocker combines a dominant fastball
with a good slider that makes him devastating.
</P>
<P>
   ``When somebody throws the ball 98, you've got to gear up for
that (on) every pitch,'' fellow reliever Russ Springer said. ``When
he throws something else, you got no chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker was named National League pitcher of the month in May
after saving nine of 10 opportunities. With every good outing, he
has quieted questions about whether he could handle the job,
including those by Braves general manager John Schuerholz.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd feel better if there was somebody who'd been there a
longer period of time and was more veteran at it, but it doesn't
concern me,'' Schuerholz said. ``There are a lot of clubs who would
take this inexperienced, young 95-mph closer we have and put him on
their club right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Springer, who has set up Billy Wagner in Houston, Ricky
Bottalico in Philadelphia and Lee Smith and Troy Percival in
California, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've set up for some of the premier closers in baseball, and
he's legit,'' Springer said. ``He's got the mentality, and he's
certainly got the stuff. He's just now learning the reliever role,
and he's doing a heck of a job.''
</P>
<P>
   And that just might be it for Rocker, who finally has figured
out that pitching is just his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I treat it just like what it is, just being a game, a segment
of life,'' Rocker said. ``I try not to get so wrapped up in every
little facet of the game that I let it consume me and control me,
and that if anything on the field goes wrong I let it carry over
into the way I live the rest of my life and let it ruin that, too.
Now, it bothers me when I give up a lead, but I don't let it eat at
me.''

NATO ORDERS HALT TO BOMBING OF YUGOSLAVIA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO suspended its 11-week bombing campaign
against Yugoslavia on Thursday after Serb troops began to withdraw
from Kosovo. An international force that will oversee the return of
refugees as well as police the province, possibly for years, could
begin to move in Friday, the alliance said.
</P>
<P>
   As armed units of President Slobodan Milosevic's army and police
moved in convoys north toward Serbia, the North Atlantic Council,
NATO's political arm, accepted that the pullout was genuine, and
NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana ordered a halt to the
airstrikes that began March 24.
</P>
<P>
   Solana, backed by President Clinton and British Prime Minister
Tony Blair, warned that the bombing would resume if the Serbs
backslide on the 11-day withdrawal plan. When challenged on whether
the 19-member alliance had the will to renew air attacks, Solana
said: ``I will speak the answer in a monosyllable: Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Security Council quickly approved a resolution
mandating the international force that will sweep into Kosovo
behind the departing Yugoslav troops. The North Atlantic Council,
made up of an ambassador from each NATO nation, stood ready at
alliance headquarters here in the Belgian capital to issue the
activation order for the occupation force from Macedonia to cross
into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second time since the breakup of the former
Yugoslavia began in 1991 that a U.N.-backed force has been
dispatched to the Balkans to mop up a geopolitical mess created by
Milosevic's nationalistic reaching. A similar force remains in
Bosnia-Herzegovina in a bid to stabilize a shaky peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   The multinational force is expected to eventually number more
than 50,000, including 7,000 U.S. troops. The final deployment
count will depend on how many, if any, troops are contributed by
Russia. Talks continued Thursday in Moscow on working into the
operation Russian forces, who refuse to be under direct NATO
command.
</P>
<P>
   The international force will establish a headquarters at the
provincial capital, Pristina, and begin to prepare for the return
of many of the almost 1 million ethnic Albanians who fled or were
driven away from Kosovo by Milosevic's troops over the past 15
months. More than 800,000 of the departures came during the NATO
bombing campaign. Another 500,000 are counted as displaced persons
still in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The international force also will be guarding against outbreaks
by rebels of the Kosovo Liberation Army. Solana warned that
``violence or noncompliance by any party will not be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   To signify Clinton administration reluctance that the United
States lead another peacekeeping force in Europe, British and
French troops will be at the head of the deployment. A British
officer, Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson, will command the force, and NATO
announced Thursday his deputy will be a French general, Jean-Claude
Thomann.
</P>
<P>
   The first of the U.S. forces, an armored contingent, will follow
quickly. Under the NATO command plan, U.S. forces will be primarily
in southeastern Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of NATO nations acknowledged that they face a daunting
task to rebuild Kosovo, which has been shattered by Serb forces and
pummeled by the NATO bombardment, and to deal with the perpetual
threat to regional stability posed by Milosevic. But they expressed
confidence in the correctness of their aggressive course and relief
that the alliance's first-ever operation against a sovereign nation
had succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``War can be necessary sometimes to uphold civilization, and
this was one,'' Blair told a news conference in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have a chance to replace violence with peace,''
President Clinton said at the White House. ``We now have a moment
of hope. We have to finish this job and build a peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The European Union is intent on a Balkans-wide rebuilding
campaign likely to cost between $20 billion and $100 billion. A
donor conference will be called soon, but the EU has ruled out
helping the Serbian section of Yugoslavia, which includes the
capital Belgrade, as long as Milosevic is in power.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot expect democracies to prop up dictatorships,''
Blair said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, in an address on Serb television, was neither defiant
nor contrite. He sidestepped details of how the NATO bombing has
savaged his nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people are the heroes,'' Milosevic said. ``We survived and
defended the country. I wish all citizens of Yugoslavia much joy
and success in the reconstruction of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Official Yugoslav notice that the pullout was under way came
from Nebojsa Vujovic, deputy foreign minister, who said: ``Units of
the Yugoslav army and police started their withdrawal in absolute
order, implementing a very accurate, precise mechanism for
withdrawal.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the first departures was a 100-vehicle convoy, with about
2,000 Serb troops, that drove out of Kosovo at Merdare, about 20
miles north of Pristina. It was followed by about 20 cars filled
with ethnic Serbs fleeing Kosovo because of uncertainty about what
they face at the hands of returning ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Although NATO had its own technical means of verifying that the
military withdrawal had begun, the way to calling off the air
attacks was eased by the unblinking coverage of cable news
channels, including live broadcasts of a Yugoslav military convoy
moving north out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As the North Atlantic Council was about to suspend the bombing,
a western diplomat said it was ``certification by CNN,'' and even
Solana mentioned the U.S.-owned outlet in briefing reporters about
the council's action.
</P>
<P>
   The multinational force will be only the latest in a long line
of foreign occupiers in the Balkans, a list that over the last half
dozen centuries has includes the Ottomans, Hapsburgs and Nazi
Germans. Each has paid at least lip service to the desire to create
a civil society.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. resolution establishes a civil authority, and U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan will appoint the chief administrator.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, only the force of Marshal Tito's guile, will
and secret police held together the region's fiery ethnic brew that
most basically divides along religious lines _ Muslims left from
the Ottoman occupation and the Christianity of more indigenous
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic in his television address stressed that ``we have not
given up Kosovo.'' The peace proposal he rejected before the NATO
bombing campaign called for an independence referendum in Kosovo
after three years, but the provision was dropped in the latest
plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question of possible independence of Kosovo is closed,''
Milosevic said. ``There can be only talks about autonomy and
nothing else.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Milosevic's withdrawal of autonomy from the province,
which before the recent exodus was 90 percent ethnic Albanian, that
triggered a decadelong conflict culminating in the NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   If the United Nations retains authority over the Kosovo peace
process, it is doubtful a referendum would ever be held under its
auspices, because China or Russia would veto the move in the
Security Council.

   WASHINGTON _ After declaring Thursday night that NATO had
``achieved victory'' in the war in Kosovo, President Clinton warned
the people of Serbia that as long as Slobodan Milosevic remained
their leader, they would get no help in reviving their bomb-scarred
land.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, noting that Milosevic had been indicted as a war
criminal, addressed the Serbian people directly, saying, ``So long
as he remains in power, there will be no support for the
reconstruction of Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   After maintaining a cautious reserve in the days since a deal
with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was first reported last
Friday, Clinton went on national television Thursday evening to
declare victory in an air war that had been given little chance of
success by experts, and that had posed serious political risks for
the administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight for the first time in 79 days the skies over
Yugoslavia are silent,'' the president declared. ``The demands of
an outraged international community have been met. I can report to
the American people that we have achieved victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he said that the Yugoslavs could have kept Kosovo as part
of their country without driving out or killing anyone, and
``without inviting a single NATO bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You too have suffered in Mr. Milosevic's war,'' the president
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton devoted much of his 13-minute address to a ringing
justification of the war, whose length, cost and destruction had
roused unease and doubt among Americans and in NATO.
</P>
<P>
   As he did in his address announcing the start of the bombing on
March 24, Clinton invoked images of unspeakable atrocities waged by
Milosevic first against Croatians, then against Bosnians, and
finally against Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should remember that the violence was the culmination of a
10-year campaign by Mr. Milosevic to exploit ethnic and religious
differences,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, Clinton said, 500 villages were burned, men were
separated from their families and killed, women were raped,
children watched parents die, and people were made to abandon their
hones.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget the Kosovo refugees I recently met,''
Clinton said. ``Some of them could hardly talk about what they had
been through.''

 &HT;    SEC top league for titles
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Southeastern Conference has left little room this
year for argument about the nation's top league in men's athletics.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nine men's sports the conference competes in nationally,
an SEC school has won seven NCAA titles and will try for an eighth
beginning today as Alabama competes in the College World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Based on recent history, the Crimson Tide could fare well in its
final collegiate championship of the season. The SEC has won five
of the last nine College World Series titles.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how Alabama finishes at the CWS, the conference
already has reached new levels of success this season. The seven
men's titles are a conference record, and with three women's titles
_ Georgia in gymnastics and in swimming and diving and Florida in
soccer _ the conference has hit double figures for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've reached a high-water mark on total championships,'' said
Mark Womack, SEC executive associate commissioner. ``We had won
nine championships in 1992-93 and in 1995-96, counting both men's
and women's sports. We won three in women's this year, and with
seven already from the men, that's our greatest year yet.''
</P>
<P>
   To carry the SEC superiority even further, the conference had
nine of its 11 women's sports reach the final four, and, with the
men's success, the league could have one of its schools finish in
the final four in 17 of its 20 sports.

DOW DROPS FOR THIRD DAY AS INTEREST RATES EDGE UP  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks staged a broad retreat on Thursday as
long-term interest rates climbed another notch.
</P>
<P>
   All three main gauges succumbed to the selling pressure, which
left the Nasdaq composite index with a loss of 34.73 points, or 1.4
percent, to 2,484.62, wiping out the bulk of Wednesday's sizable
advance.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average slumped for the third straight
day, falling 164 points at one point before a late rally cut the
loss to 69.02 points, or 0.7 percent, to 10,621.27.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 15.82 points, or 1.2
percent, to 1,302.82.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rising interest rates, an overly strong economy and a likely
increase by the Federal Reserve are depressing stocks,'' said
Frederick Taylor, chief investment officer at the U.S. Trust Co..
</P>
<P>
   Investors were uneasy ahead of government figures to be released
Friday on retail sales and producer prices for May, reports likely
to weigh heavily on Federal Reserve policy deliberations at the end
of the month. Most analysts expect the central bank to raise
overnight lending rate between banks by a quarter-point, a belief
buttressed by Japan's report Thursday that its economy not only
expanded in the first quarter for the first time since the summer
of 1997 but did so at a blistering annual pace of nearly 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese recovery, even if less robust than the statistics
suggested, was regarded as one less reason for the Fed to worry
about the world economy when it considers whether to raise interest
rates at home.
</P>
<P>
   Scrutiny of the Fed for clues to its intentions has become so
intense, analysts said, that the Dow's late-session bounce
reflected the fact that Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, chose to
avoid even a hint of tighter credit in delivering the commencement
address at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Byron R. Wien, chief U.S. strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, is one of a dwindling minority who thought the Fed would
hold off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they'll raise rates at the end of the month,''
he said, adding that the Fed would probably have to raise rates by
a half-point during the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Higher rates, he contended, do the most damage to stocks of
fast-growing companies that until recently have propelled the long
bull market. In coming months, Wien predicted, investors will be
more partial to less expensive, more pedestrian stocks and ``value
will do better than growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a pattern was in evidence Thursday as drug, financial and
consumer stocks were among the most heavily battered of blue chips.
</P>
<P>
   Procter &AMP; Gamble fell 3, to 89\, despite being maintained as a
``top pick'' by Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. The stock lost 2 9/16
on Wednesday when it detailed job cuts associated with its
reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Alcoa and International Paper, two hard-core
cyclicals whose runups this year have elevated their price-earnings
ratios, were the Dow's two biggest gainers, rising 1}, to 64}, and
1 11/16, to 53}, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in long-term interest rates, which left the yield of
the 30-year Treasury bond at 6.06 percent, the highest since April
1998, put pressure on bank, brokerage and other financial stocks.
J.P. Morgan shed 2|, to 127\; Merrill Lynch fell 2 9/16, to 70, and
American Express dropped 2, to 123[.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer was the biggest casualty in the drug group, skidding 5],
to 99 9/16, as analysts lowered earnings estimates. Nearly 16
million shares changed hands, nearly quadruple the recent average.
The company's shares fell 6 1/16 on Wednesday as the government
restricted use of a new antibiotic to severely ill patients.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was the biggest drag on the S.&AMP; P. 500, falling 2
7/16, to 79~. Then came Pfizer; Merck, down 2, to 67~; General
Electric down 1 11/16, to 101; Cisco Systems, down 3 5/16, to 110
7/16, and America Online down 5{, to 105{.
</P>
<P>
   With the approach of Friday's data on the economy, many
investors remained on the sidelines. Volume on the New York Stock
Exchange was 716.6 million, compared with the even more sluggish
662 million on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly twice as many Big Board issues fell as rose and more than
twice as many made new lows as new 52-week highs.

KNICKS ARE A GUILTY PLEASURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the day of Sports Judgment, I will have to answer to the
basketball gods for this. My punishment will be severe. And it
should be. What I have done is pathetic. No, it's worse than that.
It's unethical. Immoral. Ridiculous. A joke. I have taken an
interest in the New York Knicks. That is so disgusting that it
makes me feel ... fascinated.
</P>
<P>
   See? I'm a bad person. How can I possibly be fascinated by the
Knicks? Next thing you know, I'll be the star of Spike Lee's new
film, ``He Got (No) Shame.''
</P>
<P>
   No one outside of New York is supposed to like this team. It
seems as if the Knicks left the set of ``The Jerry Springer Show,''
slipped on some shorts and headed to the Eastern Conference finals.
If they win Game 6 Friday night at Madison Square Garden, they will
knock Larry Bird and his Pacers out of the playoffs. The NBA began
seeding its playoff teams, 1 through 8, in 1984. The Knicks would
become the first No. 8 seed to advance to the Finals. They would
also become the first unlikable underdog in modern sports history.
But I kind of like them. Please forgive me.
</P>
<P>
   You know what watching the Knicks will do? It will teach you
about being a sports fan. It will let you know if you love sport
for sport itself or if you love it, in part, for the people who
play it. I say that because the Knicks are the ultimate mixed
feelings team. Look at their roster and you can easily find someone
who makes you want to praise them while they're working and boycott
them when they aren't.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with Larry Johnson. If there are any honest Knick
fans in the house, they will tell you that they wanted this man
traded two months ago. He's got an outrageous contract, which is
only exceeded by his outrageous sense of court fashion. Johnson
thinks it's fashionable to tuck his jersey into his athletic
supporter, leaving the supporter exposed. I know: That's not
exactly DKNY material. One of his most memorable Garden
performances was cussing out a New York reporter after the reporter
had the nerve to ask for an interview. He has been the subject of
complaints from women who aren't named Mrs. Johnson, women who say
he has fathered and not always supported their children.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't seem like a lot to like. But Bird probably wishes he
could take the heart of Johnson and put it in 7-foot-4-inch center
Rik Smits. Even with Patrick Ewing out, Smits has still struggled
to stay on the court. And when he is on the court, for an average
of only 20 minutes per game, he isn't doing much. Johnson? He won
Game 3 with a 4-point play (and drew a fine afterward for refusing
to talk about it). In Game 5, he made two 3-pointers in the fourth
quarter, shots that were taken in front of the Indiana bench. You
should have seen the look on Coach Bird's face. He knows true
champions make shots like that, rather than moan about missed
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Johnson began his remarks by saying that ``all
praises are due to Allah.'' I have no doubt that Allah knows
Johnson; I wonder if Johnson knows Allah. Marcus Camby was across
the room when Johnson said that and burst into laughter.
</P>
<P>
   You do remember Camby, right? He was the most dominant college
player in the country in 1996. His University of Massachusetts team
was one of only two to hand a defeat to Rick Pitino's champions
from Kentucky, a group that included pros Antoine Walker, Ron
Mercer, Derek Anderson, Tony Delk, and Walter McCarty. That UMass
team was also stripped of its Final Four status by the NCAA. Camby
had contact with a sports agent and took gifts from him. It was
literally a tale of sex, lies, and cash.
</P>
<P>
   But in this best-of-seven series, Bird has also wished he had
someone like Camby. The Pacers coach said Camby has been the best
player of the series ``and he gets better every game.'' The last
time he took the floor, he had 21 points, 13 rebounds, and six
blocked shots. Dale and Antonio Davis may be stronger, Smits may be
taller, and every Pacer may have more playoff experience, but no
one has been able to handle Camby.
</P>
<P>
   You want to know why I really shouldn't like the Knicks? Their
fans. They chanted the name of coach Jeff Van Gundy during their
last playoff series, a tribute to the coach who was on the verge of
being replaced a month ago. They should have been chanting:
``Er-nie Grun-feld.'' He is the former general manager who traded
for Camby and Latrell Sprewell. Grunfeld was fired for his efforts,
mostly because Van Gundy either couldn't or wouldn't make Camby and
Sprewell regulars in the starting lineup. Since that time, Sprewell
has emerged as the team's most explosive player.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen months ago, the Wall Street Journal had a story in
which the headline ``Jail Sprewell'' appeared, a reference to the
player choking his former coach. Knicks executive Dave Checketts
said at the time that a player such as Sprewell couldn't play for
his team. Guess what happened Thursday. All the New York papers had
stories praising Sprewell _ who now collects sizable paychecks from
Checketts _ for helping lead the Knicks toward the Finals. Come on.
Tell me you don't like that just a little.
</P>
<P>
   If you think the Knicks are tough to deal with now, wait until
you see what happens if they make it to the Finals. The last time
they were there, in 1994, one of their broadcasts was interrupted
when a man and his friend climbed into a white Ford Bronco and
drove around the highways of Los Angeles. What will be the New York
encore for that?
</P>
<P>
   I like the Knicks. I know I'll be punished for this. Maybe I'll
become the Sisyphus of 1999, sentenced to eternally push
basketballs while listening to Marv Albert's New York commentary.
Yes. Marv Albert. Another controversial Knick. I like him, too.

INITIAL INDONESIAN VOTE TALLY FAVORS OPPOSITION PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ An unofficial vote sample issued Thursday
showed that the opposition party of Megawati Sukarnoputri was
likely to emerge from Monday's election in the strongest position
to form a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
   But the sample, based on voting for two-thirds of the seats in
Indonesia's Parliament, indicated that the governing party, Golkar,
would remain a strong political force in the country it has
dominated for three decades.
</P>
<P>
   The count, from 11 of Indonesia's 27 provinces, was conducted by
Rectors Forum, an independent local group operating with foreign
financing and expertise. It carried out a tabulation based on what
it said was a statistically strong sample of 3 percent of the
votes.
</P>
<P>
   The sample was intended as a baseline against which to verify
the official results. But the government's count continued to go so
slowly Thursday that the group decided to issue its partial figures
to answer a growing outcry for information on the vote.
</P>
<P>
   As of late Thursday, the official count had reached only about
10 million out of a total of about 112 million votes cast, far too
low to allow for credible projections, electoral experts said. That
count, too, showed a lead for Mrs. Megawati's party, the Indonesian
Democratic Party of Struggle.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the 48 parties in the race is expected to gain a
majority, and the leader in the vote count will not necessarily win
the competition for Indonesia's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The votes that are being counted are for 462 parliamentary seats
that will form the core of a partly appointed 700-member assembly
that is to choose the President later this year.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the results emerging now will simply position the
leading parties for the next stage: coalition building, influence
peddling and the possible big-money sale of seats from party to
party.
</P>
<P>
   But a big victory could put the leading party in a commanding
position. Two foreign election experts, extrapolating from the
material provided by Rectors Forum, said Mrs. Megawati's party
could be approaching a convincing margin of victory.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the initials of her party, one of the experts said:
``PDIP has done as well or better than people would have thought it
would do in Java. What this is telling me _ this is real ball park
_ is that it got at least 35 percent nationally.''
</P>
<P>
   But the expert, speaking on condition of anonymity, added: ``It
looks like Golkar got at least 20 percent. That's very interesting.
Golkar has not crashed and burned. It is going to continue to be a
strong political presence.''
</P>
<P>
   Golkar, led by President B.J. Habibie, remains the party with
the strongest nationwide network, the most money to spend and a
grass-roots loyalty in many poor areas that has remained immune to
the changes that have transformed much of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Mrs. Megawati's party wins by a margin big enough to
sweep up other parties in its momentum, political experts say,
Golkar is in the stronger position to gain ground in the next
stage.
</P>
<P>
   The Rectors Forum sampling suggested that this next stage of the
fight could be particularly rough and tumble. The parties of the
country's two other most prominent political figures both appeared
to have fallen short of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   If these second-tier parties are not strong, coalition building
could be fluid and unpredictable. ``Things could get very
interesting,'' the electoral experts said.

NATO HALTS BOMBING AS SERBS BEGIN WITHDRAWAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With victory at hand, NATO suspended its punishing
79-day bombing campaign of Yugoslavia on Thursday as Serb troops
began their pullout from Kosovo and hundreds of thousands of ethnic
Albanians had reason to believe they soon could go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can report to the American people that we have achieved a
victory for a safer world, for our democratic values, and for a
stronger America,'' President Clinton said in a televised address
from the Oval Office Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The president praised the 19-member NATO alliance for its
solidarity and resolve, thanked Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin
for his diplomacy, and urged the Serbian people to blame President
Slobodan Milosevic for their suffering and the ethnic cleansing in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as he remains in power, as long as your nation is
ruled by an indicted war criminal, we will provide no support for
the reconstruction of Serbia,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's 15-minute speech came after a day of fast-moving
developments. NATO Secretary General Javier Solana called a halt to
the airstrikes after confirming the Serb convoys were rolling in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, the United Nations Security Council passed a
resolution for a NATO-led force of nearly 50,000 to keep the peace
in Kosovo and ensure the refugees' safe return and resettlement. On
the Macedonia border, troops in the international force began
amassing for a mission that could start as early as Friday.
</P>
<P>
   British Lieutenant General Michael Jackson, who will lead the
peacekeeping troops, pledged ``robust and even-handed treatment''
of anyone who violates the terms of the agreement. The accord,
signed Wednesday night by NATO and Yugoslav generals, ends
hostilities in Kosovo and provides for the withdrawal of all
Serbian forces in 11 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clock started ticking last night,'' Jackson said in
Skopje, Macedonia. During the pullout, Jackson added, ``violence or
noncompliance, wherever it may come from, will not be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said the military mission had ``brought an end to
a vicious campaign of ethnic cleansing'' in Kosovo, while
inflicting ``far, far fewer'' civilian casualities than occurred in
the Gulf War. But he said the next phase would be dangerous, and
``formidable challenges'' _ including clearing land mines,
rebuilding homes, and accounting for the missing _ were ahead for
NATO peacekeepers as they return an estimated 863,000 refugees to
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past four months, we have seen some of the worst
inhumanity in our lifetime, but we've also seen the bravery of our
troops, the resolve of our democracy, the decency of our people,
and the courage and determination of the people of Kosovo,''
Clinton told reporters Thursday morning. ``We now have a moment of
hope, thanks to all those qualities, and we have to finish the job
and build the peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The president refused to say when NATO peacekeepers might end
their mission in Kosovo, and he dodged the question of whether
Milosevic had to be removed from power first. He said he ``didn't
see'' how Serbia could become integrated into Europe until it had a
leader committed to a multiethnic Yugoslavia and a democracy
guaranteeing human rights.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, Milosevic appeared on state television and declared
victory because Kosovo had not gained its independence from
Yugoslavia. ``We never gave up Kosovo,'' Milosevic said. ``We
survived and defended the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic said reconstruction of the country would begin
immediately, but under indictment for war crimes, he is not in a
good position to ask developed countries and international
organizations for aid.
</P>
<P>
   The UN resolution, adopted 14-0 with China abstaining,
authorizes the UN to set up an interim civilian administration in
Kosovo to oversee refugee resettlement and to promote the
establishment of substantial autonomy and self-government within
Kosovo. It also demands the demilitarization of the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army, which has been fighting for independence for the
Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this resolution, the United Nations Security Council has
charted the way toward a better future for the inhabitants of
Kosovo,'' Secretary General Kofi Annan told the council.
</P>
<P>
   Because China did not veto, speculation rose here that Beijing
had wrested concessions from the US on one of several matters,
including a report on the bombing of the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade, and China's admission to the World Trade Organization.
Talks on details over China's admission were suspended by China
after the embassy bombing.
</P>
<P>
   A Chinese government spokesman at the UN denied any deals were
struck. ``We have no self-interest in this matter, we only want the
charter of the UN to be followed,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said the agency
was preparing to take the first convoy of ethnic Albanian refugees
to Kosovo as soon as it gets a ``green light'' from the NATO-led
security force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We _ all the UN agencies _ will go with them,'' said Dennis
McNamara, the UN's special envoy for refugees. ``We will take them
back to their homes when it is safe and help them rebuild. But we
urge the refugees to be patient. Our message to them is: wait until
it is safe.''
</P>
<P>
   Solana said US General Wesley Clark, NATO's top commander,
informed him that the Serb withdrawal had begun. Both intelligence
reports and CNN broadcasts, Solana said, showed long lines of Serb
convoys in Kosovo heading north toward Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   With the withdrawal underway and ``if everything goes OK,''
Solana said, ``tomorrow we may see the first K-FOR (Kosovo
peacekeeping force) soldiers deployed in Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who will lead the peacekeeping troops, said, ``It is
inevitable that some unpleasantries will greet them.'' Jackson said
the Yugoslav military has been cooperative in providing data on
land mines, and he had unconfirmed reports Serb units were
dismantling devices on bridges and tunnels as they retreated.
</P>
<P>
   About 4,000 US troops, equally divided between Marines and Army
soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division, will be in the first wave
of 23,000 international peacekeepers in Kosovo, said General Hugh
Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The province is
being divided into five military sectors run by the British,
Germans, French, Italians, and Americans. The force will grow to
50,000, including 7,000 Americans, who will be in place in the next
four weeks, Shelton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke by telephone Thursday to alliance leaders as well
as to Yeltsin. In Moscow, Yeltsin called the suspension of NATO
airstrikes ``a step in the right direction,'' and Russia's defense
minister gave preliminary approval for a Russian airborne brigade
of 2,500 men to join the peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
   But after a day of talks, US, Finnish, and Russian generals were
unable to agree on whether Moscow's troops will interact with the
rest of the peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has promised up to 10,000 troops but insists its units
should not be under NATO command. Russian officials have suggested
that Kosovo could be divided to give the Russians a sector of their
own. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who arrived in
Moscow Thursday for talks with Russian leaders, ruled out a
``Russian sector'' and said all the peacekeeping troops would ``be
under one command arrangement.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised his foreign policy team and NATO military
leaders for staying the course amid criticism that the air war was
ill-conceived and inadequate for defeating Milosevic. He singled
out Defense Secretary William S. Cohen as ``vindicated'' by
developments so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Kosovo, we did the right thing,'' Clinton said Thursday
night. ``We did it the right way. And we will finish the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Senators Edward M. Kennedy and John Kerry, Democrats of
Massachusetts, said they were encouraged by the Serb withdrawal but
said the next week would be crucial in whether the peace will keep.
``Moving in there is not going to be easy,'' Kerry said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, Cohen and Shelton gave the most detailed
briefing to date on what they said was the success of the NATO air
campaign: 80 percent of Yugoslavia's fighter aircraft and
surface-to-air missiles destroyed; more than 50 percent of its
artillery and 33 percent of its armored vehicles in Kosovo wiped
out; and half of Milosevic's defense industry damaged or destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   NATO aircraft flew thousands of missions, lost two planes, and
no fliers, although two pilots were killed while training. Of more
than 23,000 bombs and missiles dropped, 20 missed their targets and
killed civilians, Cohen said.

CAN THEY WORK WITHOUT A NET?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Los Angeles Dodgers and Anaheim Angels cable viewers must feel
like they've got to keep one hand on the remote and the other on
their wallets.
</P>
<P>
   But what's generally considered irrational behavior at this
point might just be wasted energy once Fox Sports Net's two
Southern California channels sort out their latest publicity
nightmare, made more confusing by those trying to explain two
separate things that have been combined to hit at once.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder cable subscribers have had the issues blurred by
their operators, who want to avoid looking like the tightwad bad
boys they often are portrayed (and rightly so) to be, and by Fox
brass, who don't want to look like price-gauging maniacs. Both have
thrown their arguments out at the court of public appeal.
</P>
<P>
   First, in the Fox-Charter/Marcus issue, Fox has acres of legal
ground to stand on during this skirmish with the new owners of the
cable company that serves 90,000 subscribers, including the cities
of Burbank and Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus happily signed a contract more than three years ago to
pay Fox X amount of cents per subscriber for FSW and FSW2. When
billionaire Paul Allen's Charter company bought the system late
last year, it decided to pay the Y amount to Fox that was in the
Charter contract. Y is less than X in this example, pennies on
paper, but thousands of dollars per month after the decimals are
done.
</P>
<P>
   So figure out who had the right to get mad in that issue? Fox's
last resort _ to turn off the juice to Charter/Marcus' customers
last Saturday morning after months of threats _ seems to have
finally grabbed their attention.
</P>
<P>
   But where Charter/Marcus has taken this to another level and
looks at it as a two-pronged attack is with the second issue _ a
Fox surcharge, which again is the company's legal right, for all
cable operators who are receiving twice the amount of Dodgers and
Angels games this season.
</P>
<P>
   For years, TV viewers in L.A. have cried for more Dodgers and
Angels games, especially when compared to what fans in Chicago and
New York have available for their NL and AL teams. Now that the
extra games are here _ FSW2 doubled the number of Dodgers games
this year from 40 to 80 and went from zero to 40 on the Angels for
FSW _ it's clear the terms of the contracts Fox signed with cable
operators have changed. But the cable operators knew this might _
and probably would _ happen when signing the deals in the last few
years.
</P>
<P>
   Century, Cox, TCI and DirecTV have already honored the surcharge
without complaint, again a pennies-per-customer increase. If
Charter/Marcus, Media One, Time Warner and Comcast systems don't
get on board by July 6, they'll have to explain to their customers
why the Dodgers suddenly disappeared from FSW2. Or why there's no
more Angels after Aug. 3. Those channels won't be switched off as
in the Marcus situation because that's not the issue. Fox will
simply supply alternative programming from the Fox Sports Net.
</P>
<P>
   The response from Charter/Marcus to both these issues has been
to lump them together and complain that it doesn't want to pay
anymore for the Fox Group's fiscal irresponsibility. Its claim that
Fox is trying to recoup cash to pay the contract of Dodgers pitcher
Kevin Brown certainly is an easy out and catches the public's
attention, but a business 101 student knows that simply ain't so.
Ironically, that's almost verbatim the argument spewed by Fox
nemesis Ted Turner before a group of cable operators last month in
Las Vegas, where he made a promise that his cable networks (HBO,
TNT, TBS and the Cartoon Network) would not take back local
advertising time for itself as Fox's over-the-air network recently
decided to do to recoup ad revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, the surcharge issue works both ways. If Fox ever
reduced the number of games in the contract, it would refund money
to cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   So if the situation was so despicable, why have four major cable
companies already signed up? Will the other four big cable
companies eventually pay the surcharge? Sources within each company
are definitely not as vindictive as Charter/Marcus and say they
enjoy the benefit of more Dodgers games and will likely pay.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, meanwhile, don't seem too worried, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it is in the best interest of the Dodgers and their
fans to have the games distributed as widely as possible,'' said
Brent Shyer, the team's director of media relations and
broadcasting. ``Already a number of major cable systems have signed
up and we look forward to all remaining cable operators signing up
as quickly as possible. Fans will want to see more games as the
chase for the division title heats up.''
</P>
<P>
   And by then, cooler heads should prevail.
</P>
<P>
   __ Fox Sports mess, part II: Two months after Fox Sports Net and
Student Sports publications proclaimed they would sponsor and
televise a national prep-football championship tournament for the
2000 season, a louder backlash from some top high school
administrators across the country has threatened to stop it before
it happens.
</P>
<P>
   An opinion piece in the June 7 Street &AMP; Smith SportsBusiness
Journal written by Jack Roberts, the executive director of the
Michigan High School Athletic Association, notes that within 90
minutes of Fox's press release announcing the game, the MHSAA
declared none of its 620 member high schools that play football
would participate.
</P>
<P>
   The National Federation of State High School Associations has
already urged its members to avoid participation, emphasizing that
its bylaws prohibit any game or tournament designed to award a
national championship. The Washington Post reported Tuesday that
Florida, Texas and Ohio likely won't approve teams from those
states to join either, which would pretty much take the steam out
of the tournament's claim of a national title.
</P>
<P>
   ``The network has gone from an ally to enemy with the
announcement,'' wrote Roberts in SBJ. ``My guess is a real
championship game will never occur, but what will happen is serious
stress to what has been an excellent adventure between Fox Sports
Net's regional affiliates and high school associations to convey
what is pure and wholesome about school sports, in sharp contrast
with most televised sports on other levels.'' &QL; 
WHAT SMOKES
</P>
<P>
   __ Ready to see Marv Albert show off his Fox attitude? Rumors
continue that he'll be added to the network's NFL coverage this
fall. And why not? He proved himself working for TNT on the NBA. &QL; 
__ During the second period of Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Finals
between Buffalo and Dallas, a Fox camera found a woman in the
stands wearing a Stars jersey. But then she started moving around
and before you knew it, she was lifting the jersey to breast-feed
an infant. Which, to some viewers, is more offensive than a woman
just wanting to expose herself. &QL; 
__ ESPN, ESPN2 and CBS gang up for College World Series coverage,
starting today with two games. Saturday afternoon's Cal State
Fullerton-Stanford game goes to ESPN2 at 5 p.m. (with Mike Patrick
and Harold Reynolds), and each team plays its second game Monday on
ESPN. CBS has a first-round game Saturday morning, as well as the
one-game final next Saturday. &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES
</P>
<P>
   __ ESPN will use a three-man booth _ Mike Tirico, Kirk
Herbstreit and Lee Corso _ on its Thursday-night college football
game of the week. Herbstreit, good. Corso, not good. &QL; 
__ Not so much that the series-premiere episode of HBO's drama
series ``Arli$$'' was about as remarkably more miserable than
anticipated _ if it means anything, Robert Wuhl has credit for
co-writer and director, as well as, of course, lead actor _ but
they misspelled Keith Olbermann's name in the closing credits. It
would have been tough to get it right since a Fox Sports News
graphic that spelled Olbermann's name appeared during his cameo at
the beginning of the show. Just 11 episodes left in this batch. &QL; 
__ And be sure to watch Fox Sports News on Sunday to see
Olbermann's rendition of the Wrigley Field seventh-inning serenade,
continuing a tradition that ESPN's Chris Berman and Dan Patrick
have now joined this year _ a celebration of pseudo-celebrities who
can't sing.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton declared victory Thursday over
Serb forces he blamed for ``some of the most vicious atrocities in
Europe'' since World War II, and he urged the country to shoulder
the added perils of securing peace in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may well be casualties,'' Clinton warned the nation in a
televised Oval Office address, as 3,000 U.S. Marines and Army
soldiers mustered in Macedonia for imminent deployment in NATO's
peacekeeping force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Clinton said, the troops will enter Kosovo
heavily armed and with orders to shoot to kill if anyone _ Serb or
otherwise _ threatens the peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will have the means and the mandate to protect itself while
doing its job,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   After 11 weeks of air strikes, Clinton said NATO had scored an
important win over one of the worst chapters in the history of this
bloody century.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have achieved a victory for a safer world, for our
democratic values and for a stronger America,'' Clinton said, hours
after NATO suspended its air strikes against Yugoslavia.
``Aggression against an innocent people has been contained and is
being turned back.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton laid the blame for atrocities in Kosovo squarely at the
feet of Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia,
accusing him of waging a 10-year campaign of aggression against
non-Serbs throughout the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should know that your leaders could have kept Kosovo as a
part of your country without driving a single Kosovar family from
its home, without killing a single adult or child, without inviting
a single NATO bomb to fall on your country,'' Clinton said, in a
passage addressed to the people of Serbia. ``You endured 79 days of
bombing, not to keep Kosovo a province of Serbia but simply because
Mr. Milosevic was determined to eliminate Kosovar Albanians from
Kosovo _ dead or alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton vowed that U.S. aid to Serbia _ excluding the shattered
province of Kosovo _ would be limited to humanitarian assistance so
long as Milosevic, indicted by the United Nations tribunal on war
crimes for alleged atrocities in Kosovo, remains in office in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as he remains in power, as long as your nation is
ruled by an indicted war criminal, we will provide no support for
the reconstruction of Serbia,'' Clinton said. ``But we are ready to
provide humanitarian aid now and to help to build a better future
for Serbia, too, when its government represents tolerance and
freedom, not repression and terror.''
</P>
<P>
   Bracing the country for years of peacekeeping operations
involving thousands of U.S. troops, Clinton declined to set a date
certain for bringing American forces home from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should put a timetable on it,'' Clinton told
reporters at the White House earlier. ``We will define our
objectives and proceed to implement them.''
</P>
<P>
   After months in which Serb troops, police and paramilitary thugs
have forced more than a million ethnic Albanians to flee their
homes in Kosovo, Clinton said the U.S. peacekeeping commitment
there is open ended.
</P>
<P>
   That approach differed sharply from Clinton's pledge in December
1995 that U.S. peacekeepers would remain in Bosnia for only one
year. There are still 6,200 U.S. troops in Bosnia, part of a larger
NATO peacekeeping force there of some 31,000. There are no plans to
remove the force.
</P>
<P>
   Some 7,000 U.S. troops are staging to deploy into Kosovo as part
of a larger NATO force expected to crest near 50,000 forces.

6,400 RECEIVE DEGREES FROM HARVARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ On a day graced by clear blue skies and
polite protests, Harvard University observed its 348th commencement
Thursday, conferring degrees on 6,400 graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Holding red balloons, three dozen or so protesters left their
seats during an address by Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan
and headed for a ``counter-commencement'' outside the university's
gates.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators, who have staged a half-dozen rallies on labor
issues this spring in Harvard Yard, said they were protesting
Greenspan's economic policies and his selection as speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard senior Selamawi Asgedom, a refugee from the war between
Ethiopia and Eritrea, delivered the student English address,
telling graduates to work for change in distant lands, as well as
in their own communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big, sweeping revolutionary actions are always the most
noticeable,'' he said. ``But quite often, it will be the small
things that all of us can do that have the most impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Hazel Trice Edney, who delivered the Graduate English Address,
closed her remarks with the words: ``Take a chance, won't you?
Knock down the fences that divide. ... Reach out, Harvard. Reach
out, America. Reach out, world. Freedom lies just on the other
side.''
</P>
<P>
   For the women of Radcliffe College, it was a bittersweet day,
marking the last commencement exercise for the 100-year-old
institution, which will be supplanted by the Radcliffe Institute
for Advanced Study.
</P>
<P>
   While praising the ``indelible mark'' that Radcliffe has made on
the university, Harvard president Neil Rudenstine told alumni and
graduates that the new institute would provide opportunities for
the study of women, gender, and society. He pledged Harvard's full
support for the institute.
</P>
<P>
   The university conferred honorary degrees on Greenspan;
economist Kenneth Arrow; Harvard's Bernard Bailyn, professor
emeritus of early American history; cartoonist Herbert Block;
economist Andrew Brimmer; scientist David Cox; literary theorist
Julia Kristeva; and novelist Mario Vargas Llosa.

MORGAN AND VULCAN INVEST IN 2 ELECTRONIC TRADING SYSTEMS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: In 2nd graf, reference to E(STAR)Trade (STAR) should be
replaced by symbol)  By SHOLNN FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The race on Wall Street to build and expand
computer-based trading systems is picking up speed. J.P. Morgan &AMP;
Co. and the venture capitalist Paul G. Allen each announced new
investments Thursday in the fast-growing services.
</P>
<P>
   Through his venture capital firm Vulcan Ventures, Allen will
make a $25 million investment in Island ECN, a large electronic
communications network. Vulcan will get a 12 percent stake in
return. J.P. Morgan will purchase a 20 percent stake in
Archipelago, whose other major investors include Goldman, Sachs and
E(STAR)Trade. Terms of the Morgan deal were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Banks and brokerage firms are looking at ECN's as something
they need to be involved in,'' Bruce W. Weber, associate professor
of computer information systems at City University of New York.
``They're selling part of ownership to get necessary funding to
handle growth.''
</P>
<P>
   The trading systems are intended to provide investors with an
alternative, lower-cost market in which they can meet and trade
stocks. About a dozen electronic trading networks have sprung up,
most in the last three years. Their goal is to cut out
intermediaries between buyers and sellers in Nasdaq stock
transactions. Together, these networks, including Island,
Archipelago and Instinet, which is owned by Reuters, account for
about 30 percent of trading in Nasdaq stocks, though they all use
slightly different methods to tally their transactions.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokesman said Archipelago, which is three years old,
executed about 375 million trades in April, up from 170 million in
December 1998. Five percent of Morgan's investment comes through
the mutual fund group American Century Cos., in which Morgan holds
a 45 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   Island says it completes about $5 billion in transactions a day.
Earlier this year the company said it was preparing to file with
the Securities and Exchange Commission to become an exchange.
Allen's investment follows the announcement last month of a $25
million investment from the Waterhouse Investor Service. Island's
brokerage affiliate, Datek Securities, recently announced that it
had received an unspecified investment from Allen's group.
</P>
<P>
   Matt F. Andresen, president of Island ECN, said the additional
capital will help build a regulatory infrastructure needed to
become a national securities exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, two of Wall Street's largest investment
houses _ Goldman, Sachs and Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. _ announced that
they were joining forces with Bernard L. Madoff Investment
Securities, a large stock trading firm, to form a new company to
offer investors access to an electronic communications network for
trading.

   E-MAIL `WORM' SPREADING AND DESTROYING DOCUMENTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Computer researchers reported a malicious computer program that
destroys documents created by popular Microsoft software programs.
The program, a form of computer attack known as a worm, shows up as
an attachment to e-mail that appears to come from someone known to
the computer user.
</P>
<P>
   Several corporations said their computers had been infected by
the program and moved to limit the damage, in some cases by
shutting down their e-mail systems.

   BANK OF ENGLAND CUTS KEY RATE
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of England unexpectedly cut Britain's benchmark
interest rate to 5 percent, its lowest level in more than 20 years,
to weaken the pound, which has risen against the euro, and spur a
slow-growing economy.
</P>
<P>
   STAKES BOUGHT IN TRADING SYSTEMS
</P>
<P>
   With the race on Wall Street to build and expand computer-based
trading systems picking up speed, both J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co. and Paul
Allen, who heads the venture capital firm Vulcan Ventures,
announced new investments in the fast-growing services. Vulcan will
invest $25 million for a 12 percent stake in Island ECN, a large
electronic communications network. Morgan will buy 20 percent of
Archipelago, whose other major investors include Goldman, Sachs,
for undisclosed terms.

<P>
   STOCKS SLIDE AS BOND YIELDS CLIMB
</P>
<P>
   Stocks staged a broad retreat as long-term interest rates
climbed, with the yield on the 30-year Treasury rising to 6.06
percent, from 6.02 percent on Wednesday. The NASDAQ composite index
fell 34.73 points, or 1.4 percent, to 2,484.62, while the Dow Jones
industrial average slumped for a third day, falling 69.02 points,
or six-tenths of a percent, to 10,621.27. The Standard &AMP; Poor's

<P>
   `CUSTOMER SERVICE' PACT UNRAVELS
</P>

 &HT;    Bush Gallery at the National Museum of the Pacific War set to
open
 &HT;    By Mike Kelley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREDERICKSBURG, Texas _ Thursday afternoon, between Midway
Island and Guadalcanal, war was raging. This was a war against time
and it looked like time surely must win. In the building a block
off Main Street, electrical cables and half-assembled Lucite
displays littered the floor. Amid the smell of paint and a din of
hammers, saws and drills, Helen McDonald surveyed her allied forces
of contract workers and volunteers. She looked at her watch.
``Twenty hours,'' she said. ``We'll make it.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald is curator of exhibits and programs for the Admiral
Nimitz Museum, whose huge new expansion, the George Bush Gallery of
the National Museum of the Pacific War, will be dedicated today.
Former President George Bush will cut the ribbon.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for the the $3 million expansion began about five years
ago. Nearly all the money was raised by the museum's nonprofit
foundation through private donations.
</P>
<P>
   The Nimitz Museum honors Fredericksburg native Fleet Adm.
Chester W. Nimitz, who was commander-in-chief of Allied forces in
the Pacific during World War II. The museum once was a hotel, which
Nimitz' grandfather bought in 1855.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the new expansion, adjacent to the original museum,
``is to teach young people that there were a lot of sacrifices,
lessons to be learned . . . and to tell that story to future
generations so they won't have to relive it,'' says retired Rear
Adm. C.D. ``Chuck'' Grojean, director of the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Bush was the last American president to serve in WWII and was
the youngest aviator in the Navy when he was shot down in the
Pacific in 1944. Among the museum's features will be film of his
rescue by an American submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will enter the new facility's 25,000 square feet to
find themselves on the deck of a mock Japanese submarine, watching
the lights of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, twinkle in the distance.
They'll share space with the only real, remaining mini-sub that
participated in the attack which brought America into the war.
</P>
<P>
   The trip through the new museum's labyrinth is then
chronological. There is a deck hatch from the sunken battleship
U.S.S. Arizona. One huge display features a B-25 bomber launching
from the carrier Hornet for the Tokyo raid of April, 1942. Entering
the room trips a light beam at which the plane's propellors turn as
its engines roar to life.
</P>
<P>
   Turn a corner and here are Marines at Henderson Field on
Guadalcanal, surrounded by crates of ammunition, talking about
heading back to their foxholes before dark, so they're not shot at
by their own sentries. The depth of research is such that the
simulated palm trees are exactly the kind that grew there.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout are hundreds of photos and artifacts _ uniforms and
helmets, binoculars and weapons, both Allied and Japanese. There
are displays about the home front, minorities and women in the
service.
</P>
<P>
   And there is the scribbled note dropped to American POWs by a
Corsair pilot near war's end: ``Hi fellows. You'll be free by
tomorrow. Our planes have landed on a field nearby . . . Loads of
luck. God bless you. Ensign Skomisdak, Toledo, Oh.''

GUN-CONTROL BILL IN PERIL AS HASTERT STEPS BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Speaker Dennis Hastert said Thursday that he
would not pressure House Republicans to vote for new restrictions
on firearms, seemingly distancing himself from several Republican
gun-control proposals introduced earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert's decision not to push for a party-line position, coming
in the wake of complaints from conservatives and moderates about
the proposals, raised questions about whether the House would
approve modest gun-control measures similar to those passed by the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert's remarks also provoked complaints from some House
Republicans that he was again failing to exert the leadership
needed on a touchy political issue, and the confusion and disarray
evident among House Republicans on Thursday suggested that they
might be fated to suffer the same kinds of political embarrassment
around gun control that Senate Republicans had.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing a fresh defeat for their party leadership, some
Republicans worked on Thursday night to redraft gun-control
proposals unveiled earlier this week to try to soften them and make
them more palatable to conservatives in the party.
</P>
<P>
   But that strategy contained the risk that a coalition of
Democrats and moderate Republicans would reject the weakened
language. Those Democrats and Republicans have already complained
that the proposals in place need to be toughened.
</P>
<P>
   Those measures were introduced Tuesday by Rep. Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., who heads the House Judiciary Committee and is typically
more supportive of gun control than other House Republicans.
Republican aides had said Hastert generally supported the package,
and Hastert had given no indication to the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, Hastert held those measures at arm's length as it
became clear just how divided his conference was over the measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry Hyde certainly has his own personal feelings about what
should be done,'' he said. ``I have my own personal feelings about
what I think is common-sense legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert declined to get too specific about those feelings, which
he said would not prevent Republicans and Democrats from getting to
vote on a wide variety of gun-control measures that appealed either
to conservative or liberal sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we are going to whip this bill,'' Hastert said,
referring to the process by which party leaders exhort party
members to fall into a given line. ``We are letting everybody have
some type of amendment out there so they can express their view.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert's remarks underscored the broad ideological spectrum
among Republicans on gun control, a divide which could bode ill for
the passage of any legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conference is all over the map,'' said House Majority Whip
Tom DeLay. DeLay and Majority Leader Dick Armey oppose several
aspects of Hyde's proposals.
</P>
<P>
   As Hastert seemed to cut those proposals loose Thursday, Hyde
said he was reminded of the impeachment proceedings, when party
leaders left him to run the show and absorb any blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, God,'' Hyde chuckled, ``I'm running out of fingerprints.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Marge Roukema, R-N.J., who favors gun control, said Hastert
was staying true to his laissez-faire ways.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Republican aides said Hastert blundered in the first
place by letting Hyde's proposals be the first out of the gate,
because those measures never had the blessing of a large number of
Republicans or even fellow Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   These restrictions were modeled in large part on the Senate
legislation, but Democratic advocates Thursday continued to decry
the ways in which the restrictions were less strict, and said that
they would push for tougher proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., said Thursday night that
Democrats had determined that only about 30 party members might
defect and vote with conservative Republicans on gun control, but
that as many as 40 Republicans could side with Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Given the Republicans' narrow majority in the House, she said,
``It's going to be really, really close.''
</P>
<P>
   But the initial fight for Democrats is making sure that the
House Rules Committee allows their gun-control proposals to the
floor. All the gun measures will be offered as amendments to a
juvenile crime bill that is scheduled for debate Wednesday.

ANTLEY INSISTS HE'S NOT A HERO - OR GOAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Chris Antley isn't sure he saved
Charismatic's life. He IS certain he didn't cost the colt a Triple
Crown.
</P>
<P>
   Antley came home to Hollywood Park on Sunday and was greeted by
a series of ovations _ recognition for thinking quickly to pull
Charismatic to a halt and manually support the fractured left
foreleg after the Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   But the jockey was aware that some in the crowd probably thought
his aggressive tactics early in the Belmont wore out Charismatic
and caused his third-place finish behind long shots Lemon Drop Kid
and Vision and Verse.
</P>
<P>
   Both might be true. Or neither.
</P>
<P>
   Antley said he did what any rider would do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I saved Charismatic,'' Antley said Thursday in
the Hollywood Park jockeys room. ``I did what my conscience felt.
There was no thinking involved.''
</P>
<P>
   He tried to steer Charismatic as straight as possible as he
slowed abruptly. Then he jumped to the ground and held the leg so
the horse wouldn't put weight on it before veterinarians arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew the sesamoids (small bones in the ankle) weren't
broken, because he wasn't standing on the ankle. I knew (the cannon
bone) wasn't broken clean through,'' Antley said. ``But I also knew
the pain threshold that thoroughbreds have. You see so many horses
break down and _ what do they do? _ they go hobbling off.''
</P>
<P>
   What Antley did next might have limited the damage to racing
from another televised breakdown: He cried, demonstrating that
people in the sport do care about the horses, which might have come
as news to nonfans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want that big story to end that way _ in disaster,''
Antley said. Letters and e-mail had convinced him Charismatic was
``the people's horse.'' He thought of what the horse's fans must
have been feeling. Also, Antley felt a particular bond with
Charismatic, because he equated his own comeback from weight
problems with the colt's rise from the claiming ranks.
</P>
<P>
   The emotions that built up during three rugged weeks of
anticipation, TV appearances and soul-searching spilled over in
tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything just came to a head on Belmont day,'' said Antley,
who was worn out and suffering from a cough Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Charismatic's fractures have been surgically repaired,
and he's expected to go to stud as a healthy horse, Antley said
he's ``not upset anymore.'' But some are upset with Antley for
letting Charismatic race within a length of the fast pace set by
the filly Silverbulletday. Charismatic had won the Kentucky Derby
and the Preakness with sweeping rallies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I rode him the same way as I did in the other races. It just
didn't shape up the same way,'' Antley said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He said he kept Charismatic on a long rein leaving the starting
gate and let the colt set his usual pace. In the Derby and the
Preakness, other horses surged past, but in the Belmont ``everybody
was taking hold.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was comfortable (dueling for the lead). He was galloping,''
said Antley, noting that front-runners did well at Belmont Park
that day. ``I do believe, if (he hadn't been injured), he'd have
won by 10 (lengths).
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't blame being close (to the pace) for losing the race.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Unretirement party: Antley will be at Churchill Downs on
Saturday to ride Silver Charm against Victory Gallop in the Stephen
Foster Handicap and to take part in the track's Kentucky Derby
Alumni Day celebration. Antley won the Derby aboard Strike the Gold
in 1991 and then aboard Charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   Antley said he was first contacted about the event in November _
when he'd been sidelined for a year with weight problems. The
invitation said he would be honored among ``retired jockeys.''
</P>
<P>
   He has saved the invitation and hung it on his refrigerator _
``my danger zone'' _ as a motivator.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, another invitation arrived, making no mention of
Antley's supposed retirement.
</P>
<P>
   __ The weekend: Sunday's $350,000 Shoemaker Mile drew exactly
the kind of major U.S. turf horses Hollywood Park envisioned when
it raised the race's purse in 1996. But those U.S. stars _
including Brave Act, Hawkley Hill, Ladies Din and Lord Smith _ will
have to beat Argentine import Chullo.
</P>
<P>
   Before the trip to North America and a 15-month layoff caused by
physical problems, Chullo won six of eight starts and more than
$500,000, his victories including the Argentine Derby by four
lengths over Lazy Lode.
</P>
<P>
   Chullo, a 5-year-old ridden by Chris McCarron, could be the
latest South American star for trainer Richard Mandella.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might be a real super horse,'' said Mandella, whose South
Americans have included Gentlemen, Sandpit, Siphon, Romarin, Memo,
Malek and Puerto Madero.
</P>
<P>
   Mandella appears to be out of his deep slump. He has saddled a
winner each of the past four days at Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   __ A lot to pick from: Hollywood Park will guarantee a $1
million pick-six pool on Sunday, and there's no mandatory payout,
so a Wednesday carryover is possible.
</P>
<P>
   The pick-six, on races 5 through 10, drew almost 10 horses a
race. &QL; 
A WEEK AT THE RACES
</P>
<P>
   __ Hollywood Park leaders: Jockeys (through Wednesday): Alex
Solis, 30 wins; David Flores and Emile Ramsammy, 23; Garrett Gomez,
22; Laffit Pincay, 19. Trainers: Ron McAnally, 18; Julio Canani,
10; Ted West, 9; Bob Hess Jr. and John Sadler, 8. &QL; 
__ Handicapper helper: Win bettors are getting more than their
money's worth from leading trainers McAnally (profit: 83 percent)
and Canani (profit: 77 percent). But not from leading rider Solis
(loss: 25 percent). &QL; 
__ On the stakes schedule: At Hollywood Park: Saturday, $100,000
Valkyr Handicap, California-bred fillies and mares 3 and up, 5{
furlongs on turf; Sunday, $250,000 Shoemaker Breeders' Cup Mile,
3-year-olds and up, 1 mile on turf, and $125,000 Super Diamond
Handicap, California-bred 3-year-olds and up, 1 1/16 miles. At
Belmont Park: Saturday, $350,000 Brooklyn Handicap, 3-year-olds and
up, 1[ miles. At Churchill Downs: Saturday, $750,000 Stephen Foster
Handicap, 3-year-olds and up, 1[ miles. &QL; 
__ Mileposts: This Triple Crown thing seems to be catching on:
Hollywood Park handled $21.8 million in wagers Saturday to set a
Belmont Park-day record for the track _ after setting Kentucky
Derby- and Preakness-day records in May. Each day's betting made
Hollywood Park's all-time top 10. . . . Strub winner Event of the
Year has been retired and will go to stud in 2000 at
breeders/owners John and Betty Mabee's Golden Eagle Farm near San
Diego. The Mabees considered trying to bring the 4-year-old back to
racing after his knee injury heals. . . . Solis, who is from
Panama, and Iggy Puglisi, who is from Argentina, skipped Thursday's
Hollywood Park races so they could complete the process of becoming
U.S. citizens. . . . Cash Asmussen, subbing for Corey Nakatani, won
an international jockeys' competition in Sweden this week. He beat
Laffit Pincay, Kent Desormeaux and others. Pincay rode a winner to
bring him within 83 of Bill Shoemaker's record 8,833. . . . Pincay,
Desormeaux, Eddie Delahousaye, Chris McCarron and Chris Antley will
be part of Kentucky Derby alumni-day ceremonies Saturday at
Churchill Downs. . . . The county-fairs racing season starts next
week with the opening of Stockton on Wednesday. . . . Nakatani is
two victories away from No. 2,000. . . . New face in the Hollywood
Park jockeys room: Greg Childs, 37, one of the leading riders in
Australia. . . . Gary Stevens rode three winners in his first week
in England. He was third aboard Beat All in the Epsom Derby and had
three second-place finishes on that Saturday card. . . . Puerto
Madero worked a half-mile in :47 3/5 Tuesday to stay on target for
the June 27 Hollywood Gold Cup. . . . Hollywood Park favorites are
winning at a high 37.5-percent clip. . . . Maui Bopper knows her
place: The claiming filly has finished second in nine of her past
10 races. . . . Standardbred great Niatross died at age 22.
Niatross was the first to pace a mile under 1:50 and won 37 of 39
starts before retiring in 1980. And his offspring have earned more
than $57 million.

MORGAN STANLEY'S GENERAL COUNSEL RESIGNS IN INFORMANT PAYMENT
SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill.) (rk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's general counsel stepped
down from her job and a senior in-house lawyer resigned in
connection with a $10,000 payment to a police informant, as the
Wall Street giant sought to end what two top executives said in a
statement was ``a difficult time for our firm.''
</P>
<P>
   Christine A. Edwards, the general counsel, stepped aside and
accepted a part-time role as an advisory director, Morgan Stanley
said, calling the decision voluntary and against the wishes of the
firm's management committee.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe R. Sonnenborn, a managing director in the legal
department who had been suspended with pay last month, resigned
under pressure. Carol Bernstein, a third in-house lawyer who
reported to Sonnenborn and had also been suspended with pay last
month, will resume her duties.
</P>
<P>
   The personnel changes were announced together with the results
of an internal investigation into the circumstances surrounding
Morgan Stanley's decision to pay $10,000 to Charles Joseph Luethke,
an informant involved in the arrest last year of former employee
Christian L. Curry.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, conducted by Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &AMP;
Garrison, a Manhattan law firm, found that there was ``no
satisfactory explanation'' for why Morgan Stanley failed to keep
the Manhattan district attorney's office informed about
developments in the Curry case. That failure prompted the district
attorney's office to launch a criminal investigation of Morgan
Stanley's conduct, which is ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard on our organization to see the firm's name look
bad in the public domain day after day,'' said Philip J. Purcell,
Morgan Stanley's chairman and chief executive officer ``That's why
the pressure was on to get this out publicly, get the facts out,
and hope it's the end of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Purcell and John J. Mack, Morgan Stanley's president, said they
were especially dismayed at how their legal department responded to
requests for information about the $10,000 payment from the
district attorney's office. It took six weeks to inform the
district attorney's office about the payment, a Paul, Weiss report
on the matter said.
</P>
<P>
   The internal investigation also found that legal department
officials did not respond quickly even after the district attorney
had issued two grand jury subpoenas to the firm last October.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is our interaction with the D.A.,'' said Mack.
``Our employees do not understand how this breakdown happened with
the D.A., and we want to lay it out for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards, the general counsel, was not found to be directly
responsible for the mistakes, according the the Paul, Weiss report.
She was informed of the $10,000 payment to Luethke a short time
before it was made, the report said, but was not kept abreast of
troubles with the district attorney's office. Ms. Edwards decided
to step down on her own, and a statement issued by the firm quoted
her as saying that the problem ``happened on my watch.''
</P>
<P>
   The 47-year-old general counsel, who earned $7.5 million in
total compensation last year, had been a close colleague of
Purcell. They served together at Dean Witter before that retail
brokerage firm merger with Morgan Stanley two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, both worked at Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. The families of
Purcell and Ms. Edwards still live in Chicago, and the two
sometimes commute together to Chicago and back to New York, where
Morgan Stanley is based.
</P>
<P>
   Both Purcell and Mack said they were surprised by Ms. Edwards'
decision to step down and said that they had not pressured her to
do so. They said she would continue to handle some legal and public
affairs issues for the firm in her new role.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the blame for the mistakes surrounding the $10,000
payment fell on Sonnenborn, a 15-year veteran of Morgan Stanley.
Sonnenborn was the senior-most official involved directly in
managing the relationship with Luethke, authorizing the $10,000
payment and dealing with the district attorney's office, people
close to the firm said. Sonnenborn did inform Ms. Edwards about the
payment before it was made, but only one day before, and then not
in detail, the internal report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, the report suggested, Sonnenborn did not
keep Ms. Edwards abreast of brewing troubles with the district
attorney's office. Ms. Edwards did not learn until May of this year
that the district attorney had convened a grand jury to issue
subpoenas to the firm half a year before, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also reiterated that neither Purcell nor Mack knew of
the payment to Luethke, adding that they did not learn of it until
April of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Sonnenborn could not be reached for comment Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's two top executives also sought to clear up confusion
about Morgan Stanley's own descriptions of the payment to Luethke.
It called it a ``mistake in judgment'' in one statement last last
month. Earlier this week, it referred to the payment in court
documents as a ``reward'' for Luethke that its lawyers deemed
``entirely legal.''
</P>
<P>
   The two are not contradictory, Purcell said. He said that the
payment should never have been made. But he said that the payment
itself was not illegal. He said he understood the decision to make
the reward payment to a good Samaritan who helped thwart a crime,
but did not agree with the decision.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Legal or not, both Morgan Stanley and the district attorney's
office view the payment as a mistake. The reason is that the
payment appeared to reduce the chances of persuading a jury to
convict Curry, who was charged with conspiracy to plant fake e-mail
messages on Morgan Stanley's computers. The payment was seen as
likely taint the credibility of Luethke, who had a role in the
Curry arrest, people close the case said.
</P>
<P>
   That would have been true even if Morgan Stanley had immediately
told prosecutors about the payment and entered it into its books
properly. But the firm did not. To this day, prosecutors are still
piecing together what happened. But several people see the events
as having unfolded in the following way.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley paid Luethke $10,000 late last August, a few days
after Curry's arrest, apparently intending it as a gratuity for the
tip Luethke provided. The firm did not inform the Manhattan
district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of September, the office had learned of the payment _
possibly from Luethke. The office then asked Morgan Stanley about
it. According to people involved, Ms. Bernheim, one of the in-house
lawyers, denied having paid the informant. People close to Morgan
Stanley, however, said that Ms. Bernheim might have answered `no'
to a narrowly phrased question about whether Luethke had
``extorted'' money from the firm rather than deny outright the fact
of the payment.
</P>
<P>
   By early October, Ms. Bernheim and Sonnenborn acknowledged to
prosecutors that they had paid Luethke. But prosecutors weren't
satisfied. Among the concerns was that the firm had paid Luethke by
wire transfer to a numbered account, not by check. Morgan Stanley
also could not produce the kind of documentation that would
normally accompany a payment to an outside vendor.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, when Morgan Stanley produced accounting records, that
only complicated things. The records showed that the payment had
been assigned a billing code that Morgan Stanley used when it paid
millions of dollars in settlements stemming from the Orange County
bond-trading scandal, a completely unrelated event.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley told prosecutors that the error was made in the
firm's accounting department. Sonnenborn and Ms. Bernheim had
intended that payment to be assigned to the real-estate finance
division, where Curry had worked, prosecutors were told.
</P>
<P>
   Some people involved said they believed that Morgan Stanley was
acting in a way that suggested it wanted to disguise ties to
Luethke. Morgan Stanley insisted all along that it had no such
intention. Months passed without a resolution. The fact that the
case was handled by three different assistant district attorney's
during nine months did not help matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one big comedy of errors,'' said one person close to the
case.
</P>
<P>
   It is still possible that Morgan Stanley could face criminal
charges. If prosecutors decided that the firm had sought to falsify
business records to disguise a payment it thought to be criminal,
the firm could be charged with a felony under New York state's
general business laws, people close to the case said.
</P>
<P>
   But several people involved said they considered it more likely
that prosecutors would accept Morgan Stanley's arguments that the
errors were unintentional. The personnel changes at Morgan Stanley
and the bad publicity the firm has suffered have are likely to be
considered punishment enough, these people said.

BUSH TO OPEN IN IOWA, AMID TEXAS-SIZED HOOPLA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Iowa, N.H.)   (af)  
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As big and noisy as the annual Pork Expo is for
Iowa this weekend, the arrival there of Gov. George W. Bush as a
front-running presidential candidate who has yet to make his first
major national speech is looming even larger.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor will formally touch down on Saturday in Cedar
Rapids, brandishing incumbent-like trappings and perhaps
dangerously high expectations, with more than 100 reporters in tow
to hear his maiden address and signal the official opening of the
year 2000 marathon to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely has such an untested national candidate arrived in Iowa,
the starting point in the grueling presidential race, in such a
theoretically favorable position as Bush. A generation ago, Jimmy
Carter arrived there, famously carrying his own garment bag, to
make the state a foundry for political underdogs.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party leaders felt obliged to begin attacking Bush
Thursday, even before he landed, obviously respecting the long
early lead he holds in the Republican field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear plenty of people are looking to pounce,'' said
David Beckwith, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, which is
formally in an ``exploratory'' state. ``We realize this is a
hazardous situation, indeed. But the ground looks very fertile out
there for Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation would have to go back to a war hero, Dwight D.
Eisenhower in 1952, to find someone this untested emerging this far
ahead of his party's pack without being vice president or having
run for national office before, said Ralph Reed, the Republican
campaign strategist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He arrives with the classic tension of the front-runner
candidacy: he cannot afford to drift back toward the rest of the
pack, but he has to get his hands dirty in grass-roots politics,''
Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   In Bush's dense media shadow, three of his Republican
challengers will be in Iowa at the same time, vying nearby in hopes
of an overflow of attention before the Bush party, moving grandly
as a presidential entourage, flies on to New Hampshire to begin
priming the second stage of the nominating competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to thank the governor for serving as our advance team
this weekend,'' said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Elizabeth Dole,
who will be working the annual state fairgrounds throng at the Pork
Expo in Des Moines while Bush begins sketching his views before the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole will be followed by two other rivals, former Gov.
Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Rep. John R. Kasich of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Other Republicans who made sure to visit Iowa this week in
advance of the feared Bush tide included former Vice President Dan
Quayle; Steve Forbes, the millionaire publisher; Gary Bauer, the
religious conservative, and Patrick J. Buchanan, the television
commentator.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan demonstrated the power of the Iowa caucuses in 1996
when he finished a strong second to Bob Dole and went on to defeat
Dole in the New Hampshire Republican primary before the party
rallied round Dole in subsequent contests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The premium for a candidate in Iowa is that he seems to be at
ease with the people and enjoy retail campaigning,'' said Bruce F.
Nesmith, chief of political science at Coe College in Cedar Rapids.
</P>
<P>
   Nesmith said numerous Bush endorsements from Iowa officials had
been compounding ``the general aura of inevitability'' that the
governor bears upon arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the main event for Bush will be the Cedar Rapids stop
and his speech at a barbeque in nearby Amana that his staff has
been polishing for months as his campaign's initial template. While
reaching out to the national mainstream, the governor will be
competing in a state where politics has a powerful constituency of
social and religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen rivals are focusing on that vote, too, but Bush's
supporters claim he will show he is well prepared to boast such
conservative credentials as a law he just signed in Texas requiring
parental notification in cases of abortions for teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his record were lambasted here Thursday morning by the
Democratic Party leadership at a breakfast of political
journalists. The party's co-chairmen, Roy Romer and Joe Andrews,
described Bush as ``anointed'' but unproven, one of many incumbents
who profited from the booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   The two Democrats wielded a 13-page critique of Bush's record as
governor, contending that ``35 or 40 other governors'' can claim
his sort of progress. They predicted that, like the Titanic, Bush's
maiden voyage could soon ``hit the iceberg'' of closer public
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   In a rejoinder, Beckwith, the Bush campaign spokesman, happily
remarked, ``The Democrats are panicking very, very early.''
</P>
<P>
   There are essentially two caucus races going on in Iowa, in the
view of Dennis J. Goldford, chief of politics and international
relations at Drake University in Des Moines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who will be the establishment conservative candidate, Bush or
Dole or Forbes? And who will emerge from the crowd of
religious-social conservatives?'' Goldford asked. ``Right now, Bush
is kind of sucking up all the political oxygen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But his difficulty is he doesn't want to be the inevitable
candidate who came out of here like Walter Mondale,'' Goldford
added, referring to the damage suffered by Mondale in Iowa when his
slippage as the front-runner in the 1984 Democratic race only fed
the rival candidacy of Gary Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Experts are hard pressed to explain the precise reasons why Bush
is showing such a large early lead over the rest of the Republican
field. Party professionals point to his popularity in a big state
and the Republicans' general hunger to regain the White House.
</P>
<P>
   While the governor's polling numbers in the absence of
campaigning have been strong with the public, a recent CBS News
poll found that when questioners distinguished between Bush and his
father, former President George Bush, the governor's rating was
lower. The younger Bush was rated 15 points higher when his father
was never mentioned in the pattern of questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to have to start filling in the blanks,'' said
Peverill Squire, a political science professor at the University of
Iowa in Iowa City. ``I can't think of anybody who has come into the
state with such expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed envisioned Bush entering the arena juggling the needs to be
gaffe-proof in behavior and visionary enough in message to start
justifying the early hyperbole. ``And he needs to appear at ease,
to be enjoying himself,'' Reed added to this tricky prescription.
``He will.''

AFTER SIX FAILURES, TEST OF ANTIMISSILE SYSTEM SUCCEEDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.M.)   (af)  
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a succession of well-publicized failures, the
Pentagon announced Thursday that a 20-foot missile had slammed into
a test rocket high above the New Mexico desert Thursday morning, a
potential breakthrough in the ``Star Wars'' technology intended to
protect the United States from missile attack.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first successful test of the Army's troubled $3
billion antimissile system, a project that has been seen as the
forerunner of a much larger program to shield the nation from the
threat of missiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's significant because it demonstrates that the technology
can be made to work,'' said Brig. Gen. Richard Davis of the
Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization, which manages
the program. ``It is a major milestone, because this is our first
successful interaept, but we still have a ways to go.''
</P>
<P>
   In the test, the Pentagon said, a missile flying at supersonic
speed 24 miles to 60 miles above the White Sands Missile Range in
New Mexico _ the exact altitude was not revealed _ hit and
destroyed a test rocket fired minutes earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the rocket had been designed to resemble a Scud
ballistic missile like those fired by Iraq in the Persian Gulf war
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Six earlier test shoot downs failed, prompting critics of the
program in and out of the government to suggest that using missiles
to destroy missiles would never be practical.
</P>
<P>
   And even Thursday, the critics said that the successful test of
the Army's Theater High-Altitude Area Defense, or Thaad, rocket
proved little.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite possible for a system to work well in tests and
fail in the field,'' said the Union of Concerned Scientists, which
is often critical of Pentagon weapons systems. In a statement, the
group described the test as a ``relatively trivial step.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics have said that deployment of an antimissile system might
lead Washington to abandon the proven approach of diplomacy and
arms control in favor of a potentially false sense of security
backed up by a faulty defense system.
</P>
<P>
   But even the harshest attacks on the antimissile program
Thursday could not overwhelm the sense of delight and relief felt
by many in the Defense Department _ and at Lockheed Martin Corp.,
the prime contractor _ who have staked their careers on the
technology.
</P>
<P>
   At a Pentagon news conference, Davis said the test proved that
the Defense Department now had ``the guidance control, accuracy and
the processing that allows us to hit a bullet with a bullet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It provides a capability against the entire threat regime that
we expect to be encountering,'' he said. ``We're obviously
concerned because of the growing theater missile defense threat.
Twenty-five countries currently have theater ballistic missiles.''
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed by reports that North Korea and Iran are testing
ballistic missiles and that China has obtained some of the
Pentagon's most sophisticated weapons technology, Congress has
pressed the Defense Department to deploy an ambitious missile
defense system early in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, dropping his opposition to such a concept,
has pledged $6.6 billion in next year's budget to develop a
national missile defense system, although he has decided to delay a
decision on whether to actually build one until the middle of next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Thaad missiles are part of a small arsenal of similar
defensive weapons the Pentagon is developing. The culmination of
the program is intended to be a large interceptor meant to shield
the nation _ not just soldiers, ships and battlefields _ from enemy
attack.
</P>
<P>
   The next test of the system is scheduled for July and will be
conducted at a higher altitude, more than 60 miles up.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Army's contract with Lockheed Martin, there must be
three successful tests of the missiles before the program can go
into something closer to full production.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier test failures had brought calls from Congress for
the Army to find a competitor to Lockheed Martin, which was fined
$15 million after the most recent failure in March.
</P>
<P>
   The project has cost more than $3 billion since it began in
1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``There had been a problem with respect to the quality of the
hardware,'' Davis said of Lockheed. ``We have expressed that in the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said a new management team at Lockheed had ``turned the
program around.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the important message here is we really want
success,'' he said. ``The whole idea is not to penalize the
contractor but to have a teaming relationship that we can all get a
win-win situation and have a capability delivered to the country.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman from Lockheed did not return a telephone call
Thursday.

 &HT;    Anti-Wicca movement has mixed support
 &HT;    By Kim Sue Lia Perkes
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A conservative public policy organization said
Thursday that religious-based political groups are committing
political suicide by calling for Christians to boycott joining or
re-enlisting in the Army until witchcraft rituals are banned from
Army posts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This brings back the specter of the Salem witch trials,'' said
Marc Levin, vice president of the American Freedom Institute. ``In
addition to being wrongheaded, conservative calls for a boycott of
the military are politically suicidal. Support for the military is
a bedrock conservative principle.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the 13 national groups that originally called for the
boycott Wednesday, the American Family Association, has withdrawn
its support.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Trueman, director of governmental affairs for the American
Family Association, said his group was asked Wednesday by a
conservative Christian organization to join in a statement against
the practice of the Wicca faith on military bases, but was unaware
the news release would call for an Army boycott.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were totally blindsided by this,'' Trueman said. ``We don't
support witches, obviously, but calling for a boycott is not
something we would do.''
</P>
<P>
   The call for a boycott came after publicity stemming from an
Austin American-Statesman story last month about Wiccans at Fort
Hood in Killeen. The Army post for three years has sanctioned a
Wicca group by providing on-base space for rituals.
</P>
<P>
   Heading the boycott is the Free Congress Foundation, led by Paul
Weyrich in Washington, D.C., a nationally known Christian
conservative credited with coining the phrase ``Moral Majority.''
</P>
<P>
   In its literature, the foundation says it ``works against the
government encroachment on individual liberties.'' But those
liberties do not extend to sanctioned witchcraft on Army
installations, said William S. Lind, director of the foundation's
Center for Cultural Conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some things should be discriminated against,'' Lind said.
``All religions are not equal. Satan should be discriminated
against.''
</P>
<P>
   Hal Seimer, president of the Austin-based American Freedom
Institute, said that thinking goes directly against the
conservative position that promotes religious values in the public
arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's insane about it is that we fight for the freedom to
practice religion in public, and now the conservatives who seek to
deny these groups their right to worship are espousing the
philosophy of 'freedom of religion for me and not for thee,' ''
Seimer said.
</P>
<P>
   Wicca, a neo-paganist faith whose adherents call themselves
witches, is rooted in pre-Christian Europe. Adherents celebrate the
cycles of the sun and moon and believe in the dual deity of god and
goddess. ``Although these groups are pagan, they are not satanic,''
Siemer said. ``Many of our founding fathers were not Christians but
were Deists. . . . As long as a religious group does not advocate
an illegal or unpatriotic position, which Wiccans do not, they
should be allowed freedom on worship on U.S. military
installations.''
</P>
<P>
   The groups calling for the boycott along with the Free Congress
Foundation include the Christian Coalition, Traditional Values
Coalition, Christian Action Network, Religious Freedom Coalition,
Home School Legal Defense Association, American Association of
Christian Schools, I Love Jesus Worldwide Ministries, the Madison
Project, 60 Plus, American Council for Immigration Reform, and
Tradition, Family, Property Inc.

   Jeff Van Gundy parked his Honda Civic and hustled through a
hallway last week, a rumpled bag in his hand that contained a
sandwich he bought from the back of a wobbly lunch truck.
</P>
<P>
   Routinely parked on a worn spot beside a two-lane road near the
Knicks' practice facility at the State University of New York at
Purchase, this kitchen on wheels is frequented by road crews,
students, police officers and Van Gundy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd better get going,'' the Knicks' coach told someone who
inquired where to get a decent lunch in the area. ``It's gone by 3
p.m.''
</P>
<P>
   This is experience talking. This is a coach who has been here
long enough to understand what hour things come _ and go around _
during his 10-year tenure with the Knicks' organization. He has
trudged through the long, thankless hours as an assistant and
endured the criticism as head coach of a team that is one victory
away from eliminating the Indiana Pacers in the Eastern Conference
finals and advancing to the league championship series against the
San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   A victory Friday night in Game 6 at Madison Square Garden, and
the Knicks celebrate into the night. Just one more victory and Van
Gundy will instantly receive a one-year $3.5 million extension of a
contract that has one year and $2 million remaining.
</P>
<P>
   In this scenario, whether he is eventually dismissed by the
Garden hierarchy for Phil Jackson, or decides to leave with a
settlement out of distaste for the cloak-and-dagger machinations of
the Garden's president, Dave Checketts, or he remains with the
team, Van Gundy will have the satisfaction of success to ease the
sting of a tumultuous season.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other year, the Van Gundy critiques _ everything
from his overt loyalty to Patrick Ewing to whether he trusts Marcus
Camby _ have become like daily advice from Ann Landers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes they're on results, sometimes they're on
relationships,'' Van Gundy said Thursday, less than 24 hours after
his team won Game 5 on Indiana's home floor. ``It depends on if
we're winning or losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just really thankful that I'm a part of a team that's
still playing. And what small part I play in it, I take very
seriously. I do the job the best I can. If you become paralyzed by
the thought that you may be criticized for doing something, you're
never going to be the risk taker you need to be as a good coach.
Risk taking is part of it. If it doesn't work out, you've got to
accept the responsibility for it not working out.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy has been uncommonly daring during the conference
finals once faced with the season-ending injury of Ewing after Game
2. Although the Knicks won Game 3 on a 4-point shot aligned with
the stars from Larry Johnson, Van Gundy tinkered with fate. After
resisting voices calling for him to start Latrell Sprewell almost
all season, he put him in the lineup for Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't seem like such a hot idea when Sprewell responded with
a meager performance: 6-for-14 shooting in a 90-78 loss. Van Gundy
stuck to his plan, though. In Game 5, Sprewell scored 29 points in
Wednesday's dramatic victory that included other games of chance
for Van Gundy. He allowed Allan Houston to play with three fouls in
the third quarter and with four early in the fourth, but he sat
down Camby for the bulk of the third quarter with three fouls to
make sure he was around for the finish.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Houston guarded Mark Jackson while Charlie Ward
took over the Reggie Miller watch. Miller scored (30 points) but so
did Houston (19), who was also able to hold off Jackson in the
post. Unencumbered by fouls, Camby played the fourth quarter freely
and took over the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking to someone close to me when I was discussing,
between Games 3 and 4, whether to start Sprewell,'' Van Gundy said,
not identifying the person. ``That person, whom I really trust,
said to me: `Well, if you want to avoid criticism, don't start him.
That's the safe way to play it. Then you have to decide whether you
want to avoid criticism more than you want to win.' To me, that was
an easy decision. Winning is all that matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, by starting Latrell, it was neither genius last night
nor stupidity in Game 4. It was what I felt was in the best
interest of the team. That's how I make every decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The most nondescript of coaches has a chance to finish an
Eastern Conference coaching journey that has pitted him against
Miami's Pat Riley, Atlanta's Lenny Wilkens and Bird _ a trifecta
consisting of ring-holders, record-holders and legends.
</P>
<P>
   But Van Gundy is quick to remind everyone that they are not
there yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, it's how do we break the cycle: win, lose, win, lose,
win,'' Van Gundy said of this seesaw series. ``It's very difficult
to win two in a row. The team that has had the mental edge coming
off a loss has won the next game. We have to avoid that.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said: ``I think Jeff has done an excellent job. We had a
rough first of the season, but we responded well. And he's a great
coach for this team. He gets along with the guys and everything.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that it was ``just disturbing'' to hear reports of
Jackson's imminent arrival.
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, Van Gundy was probably a little rumpled and
frayed when the plane touched down from Indiana in the early hours
Thursday morning, but he took a few minutes to speak with his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spoke 5 or 10 minutes on the plane about what we need to
do,'' Van Gundy said. ``We'll find out, and see what happens. I
think we know what we have to do.''

   LOS ANGELES _ USC has used its final basketball scholarship by
signing 6-foot-4, 200-pound shooting guard Malachi Thurston of
Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Thurston played this past season at The Hotchkiss School, a prep
school in Lakeville, Conn. He averaged 24 points, nine rebounds and
three assists per game last season.
</P>
<P>
   He selected USC over Oregon. Thurston played high school
basketball at Marin Academy in Oakland. Because he committed after
the signing period, Thurston cannot sign a letter of intent.
</P>
<P>
   He instead signed a nonbinding scholarship agreement, which
means he is not bound to the university.

 WASHINGTON: been through.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though delivered in solemn tones, as befits a historic message
proclaiming victory in war, Clinton's message contained
considerable satisfaction and relief.
</P>
<P>
   He praised NATO for having remained steadfast through its first
united military action, an achievement often doubted as the 19
member nations struggled for unanimity through the increasingly
troubling campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO has achieved the campaign as a united alliance,'' Clinton
said. ``Nineteen democracies came and stayed together through the
stiffest military challenge in NATO's 50-year hist/ry.''
</P>
<P>
   The president also emphasized that not a single soldier was
killed in combat, and he noted that the Russians, for all their
opposition to the allied bombing, had been instrumental in its
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton also stressed that ``formidable challenges'' lay
ahead. He said NATO remained ready to resume attacks should the
Yugoslavs falter in their withdrawal; he described the enormity of
the problem of bringing back hundreds of thousands of Kosovo
refugees to destroyed homes; he spoke of the problem of
demilitarizing the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   The 50,000 NATO peacekeeping soldiers, including 7,000
Americans, still face possible casualties in Kosovo. And there is
the daunting challenge of rebuilding a region battered by war,
hostility and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The European Union and the United States must plan for
tomorrow, not just today,'' he said, pointedly adding, ``Our
European partners must provide most of the resources for this
effort, but it is in America's interest to do our part as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the brief address, however, the president's dominant
theme was that when people were repressed for their religion and
nationality, ``the world did not look away.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have sent a message of determination and hope to all the
world,'' Clinton said. ``Tonight I ask you to be proud of your
country, and proud of the men and who serve. In Kosovo we did the
right thing, and we did it the right way, and we will finish the
job.''
</P>
<P>
   While considerable questions and criticism persist _ including
charges from congressional Republicans that the withdrawal of
Yugoslav troops had been achieved at exorbitant cost, and that
rebuilding Kosovo and Serbia would cost many billions more _ the
administration seems satisfied at this juncture to relish the fact
that NATO forced Milosevic to back down.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton claimed that the campaign had achieved its goals, which
included creating the conditions to bring home the refugees. But
that stood somewhat at variance with the fact that the purge of the
Albanians became systematic and much more extensive only after the
NATO bombing began on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, in fact, Clinton declared that NATO's purpose was
to avert a ``humanitarian disaster'' in Kosovo and to prevent a
wider conflict. In the end, more than 850,000 Albanians were driven
out and many of their properties destroyed, and the stability of
neighboring Macedonia and Albania is not assured.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Clinton declared that from the beginning, the
allies had three objectives in Kosovo, all of which had been met:
the withdrawal of Yugoslav forces, the deployment of a NATO-led
security force and the return of the Kosovars to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, the White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart,
said Clinton had made a series of calls to leaders of NATO and its
member countries, as well as President Boris Yeltsin of Russia, to
share the moment, but also to caution ``that there remains a great
deal of hard work to be done.'' On Friday Clinton is scheduled to
visit Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, the staging base for B-2
sorties to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   At a Pentagon news conference, Defense Secretary William Cohen
and Gen. Henry Shelton, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
joined in trumpeting the victory with color briefing slides and a
videotape of retreating Yugoslav forces taken by an unmanned drone.
</P>
<P>
   They also provided the most detailed accounting to date of what
allied planes had destroyed: 450 artillery pieces, 220 armored
personnel carriers, 120 tanks, more than half of Yugoslavia's
military industry, and 35 percent of the country's electrical
power.

 WASHINGTON: electrical power.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The officials said allied warplanes had flown 35,000 missions,
including just under 10,000 bombing runs, dropping 23,000 bombs and
missiles. About a third of these were guided weapons, dropped
largely by B-52 and B-1 bombers against Yugoslav troops in the past
few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic miscalculated badly,'' Shelton said. ``He did not
believe that NATO would carry through on its threat to use air
power, and he surely did not expect that the alliance could sustain
and increase that effort as the operation progressed over the last
79 days.''
</P>
<P>
   The satisfaction and relief were even more evident in an earlier
statement by Clinton in which he thanked various participants in
the military and diplomatic drama of the past month and a half.
``There are so many people to thank,'' he began, borrowing a tone
from awards ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   From his own team, he singled out Vice President Al Gore, who
had the most to fear politically from a conflict that threatened to
stretch into his presidential campaign, but now could claim that he
had contributed to the peace through his camaraderie with the
Russian envoy, Victor Chernomyrdin. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, reportedly the most hawkish administration official on
Kosovo, was praised by Clinton for her ``passionate commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   The president reserved the highest praise for Sandy Berger, the
national security adviser, ``who has barely slept for the last
three months.''
</P>
<P>
   All those he named had come under varying degrees of criticism
for the operation, and in naming them Clinton appeared to be
vindicating their judgment. But while there was general agreement
that Clinton and his lieutenants could feel satisfaction at their
escape from potential disaster, there was no certainty that they
would harvest long-term political benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Already through the jubilation, the critics could be heard. At a
congressional debate on financing the security forces, Republicans
took turns casting aspersions on the claims of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to go in there and do what we have done is
unconscionable,'' said Rep. Randy Cunningham, R-Calif. ``We have
killed civilians. That is not a win. Hundreds of thousands of
people are refugees. That is not a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mark Souder, R-S.C., declared, ``After 11 weeks of bombing
we have a settlement we probably could have achieved at the
beginning. If this is a victory, what would defeat look like?''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Manzullo, R-Ill., said: ``Milosevic is still in power. We
have destroyed a country. This war should never have been
started.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also continuing criticism from experts on foreign
policy, though some acknowledged they had been wrong in their
conviction that bombs alone would not bring Milosevic to heel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would sum it up this way,'' said Leslie Gelb, president of
the Council on Foreign Relations: ``The feeling is the situation
was very bad to begin with, and NATO and the Clinton administration
made it worse, and much to the surprise of the critics, they came
out with a deal far better than anyone expected. But they got it at
a hell of a heavy cost, and because of that, people aren't going to
give President Clinton credit for `success.'''
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon news conference, Cohen said the Defense
Department would request additional spending from Congress to pay
for the 7,000 American troops who are to join the NATO force.
Congress has already approved $5.5 billion in additional spending
through Sept. 30, for the air war only. Some unspent money will go
toward returning American aircraft and troops to their home bases,
and the rest will go toward the cost of the peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   But it will not be enough. Cohen declined to estimate how long
the Americans would remain in Kosovo, but he said it would cost
about $1.5 billion to $2 billion a year, roughly what it costs to
keep the 6,900 American peacekeeping troops still in Bosnia.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC has reached a two-game agreement to play
Auburn in football during the 2002 and 2003 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans will play Auburn at the Coliseum on Aug. 31, 2002,
then travel to play the Tigers in Alabama on Aug. 30, 2003. CBS has
expressed interest in televising the 2003 game.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 2002 and 2003, we get an extra game and we also wanted an
intersectional game,'' said USC associate athletic director Daryl
Gross.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans will play 12 games in each of those seasons.
</P>
<P>
   USC is also close to signing a contract for a two-game series
with Brigham Young for the 2003 and 2004 seasons. The Trojans would
play BYU at the Coliseum on Sept. 6, 2003, and at BYU on Sept. 4,
2004. Another possibility being discussed is a three-game series
with Wyoming starting in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   __ Morton hired: USC has officially hired Steve Morton as its
tight- ends coach. Morton was the offensive-line coach at
Washington under Jim Lambright. He served as a volunteer coach at
USC during spring practice.
</P>
<P>
   Morton had hoped to land an offensive-line coaching position
before deciding to accept an offer from USC coach Paul Hackett. He
begins working full-time on July 1. Morton replaces assistant head
coach Larry Petroff, who will concentrate on administrative duties.

FBI QUESTIONS HOUSTON ATTORNEYS ABOUT MORALES, TOBACCO SUIT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (See optional ending) 
 
By DEBORAH TEDFORD 
and CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The FBI has questioned at least three local lawyers as
part of a Houston-based investigation of former Attorney General
Dan Morales' handling of the state's multibillion-dollar tobacco
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   None of the lawyers contacted Thursday would say what agents had
asked them. But the witnesses include Joe Jamail, a high-profile
Houston attorney who has alleged that Morales improperly solicited
$1 million from each of several attorneys he considered hiring for
the tobacco case.
</P>
<P>
   Morales, who was unavailable for comment Thursday, denied those
allegations when they were raised in a document filed in federal
court last year.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent inquiry is detailed in letters from John Cornyn,
Morales' successor as attorney general, authorizing five Houston
lawyers and one in Dallas to answer the FBI's questions. An agent
had asked Cornyn to waive the lawyers' obligation to the state
under attorney-client privilege, an ethical constraint.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the FBI witness list are Wayne Fisher, Ronald Krist, E.
William Barnett and William Slusser, all of Houston, and Dallas
attorney Tom Luce. None was hired to represent Texas in the tobacco
suit, but all were believed to have been considered by Morales for
the job.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher and Krist already have given FBI agents the details of
conversations they had with Morales. Krist said he was interviewed
as recently as last week, but neither he nor Fisher would discuss
details.
</P>
<P>
   Jamail said Thursday that he also has been interviewed by
federal investigators. He, too, declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Slusser declined to comment, and Barnett and Luce were
unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston investigation is one of two stemming from the
landmark tobacco suit, which produced a $17.3 billion settlement
for Texas taxpayers but sparked a controversy over the fees paid
several private lawyers hired by Morales on contingency agreements
to help represent the state.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Umphrey, a plaintiffs' attorney from Beaumont who
eventually headed the team of private lawyers in the tobacco case,
said Thursday that he did not receive any improper solicitations
from the former attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just didn't happen to us. All I know about it is what I
read in the papers,'' said Umphrey, who was not on the FBI's
witness list.
</P>
<P>
   Five well-known plaintiffs attorneys, including Umphrey, were
awarded a total of $3.3 billion by a national arbitration panel for
their work for the state. Those fees are to be paid by cigarette
companies.
</P>
<P>
   A separate federal investigation in Austin is looking into
Morales' hiring of another Houston lawyer, Marc Murr, in the
tobacco litigation. Morales tried to help Murr, a longtime friend,
collect hundreds of millions of dollars in legal fees although
other lawyers said Murr did little work in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Murr dropped a claim for $260 million in legal fees last month,
one day after Cornyn accused him and Morales of falsifying
signatures and backdating contracts that Murr purportedly had with
the state.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge David Folsom of Texarkana formally dismissed
Murr's claim Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn _ in near-identical letters to Jamail, Fisher, Krist,
Barnett, Slusser and Luce in March _ said he had been contacted by
Michael Mee, an FBI agent.
</P>
<P>
   The agent, Cornyn said, ``asked me to consider waiving any
attorney client privilege which might exist between the state of
Texas and you concerning certain discussions in 1995 regarding your
possible employment in the tobacco litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn told the lawyers that no attorney-client privilege
existed because they were not hired to represent the state in the
tobacco case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly can appreciate the fact that you may be
uncomfortable discussing these matters with the FBI without an
express written waiver from this office. Thus, I want this letter
to confirm that you have my permission as the state's top lawyer to
discuss this matter with the FBI,'' Cornyn wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Chronicle obtained the letters from the attorney
general's office under an open records request this week.
</P>
<P>
   Jamail's allegations against Morales surfaced in a 1998
document, filed as part of an effort by seven state legislators to
block payment of what they considered ``excessive'' legal fees to
the Umphrey team of outside lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The document, prepared from memoranda provided by Jamail, said
the $1 million that Morales allegedly solicited from each lawyer
was ``purportedly for the purpose of defending General Morales
against possible attacks from the tobacco companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The document did not specify what types of attacks.
</P>
<P>
   A Morales spokesman said last year that the only money that
Morales asked the lawyers to provide was for lawsuit expenses. Each
of the five lawyers in the Umphrey group agreed to risk $2 million
of their own money in return for a 15 percent contingency
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers later estimated they actually spent $40 million
during their two years of work on the case. Cigarette companies
have reimbursed them for that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Houston attorney Michael Gallagher, who was Fisher's law partner
in 1995, said he was called by a federal investigator several
months ago. But he said he could provide little information because
he never attended a tobacco-related meeting with Morales.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher said he and Fisher turned down an opportunity to
become involved in the lawsuit because they had some ``grave
concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   A federal source said the Houston investigation centers on
possible violations of the Hobbs Act. A Department of Justice
manual for prosecutors describes the 48-year-old law, with its
extortion element, as a tool used by federal law enforcement
agencies to combat state and local corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, to obtain a bribery conviction, prosecutors must show
that a payoff influenced the actions of a public official. But
under the Hobbs Act, prosecutors must show only that officials and
go-betweens took property or money ``that was not due them or their
office'' _ whether or not the payments had any real effect.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, previously undisclosed FBI documents in another
Houston case indicate that Morales initially lied to agents who
were investigating bribery allegations against former Houston City
Councilman Ben Reyes.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed in his office March 20, 1997, Morales told FBI
agents Ronald Stern and Carlos Stella that he never talked to Reyes
about an official opinion on the eligibility of both convention
center hotel proposals for special tax benefits, according to the
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Although Reyes had urged Morales to issue an opinion favorable
to developer Wayne Duddlesten in a Dec. 13, 1995, letter, Morales
insisted he never discussed the matter with the then-councilman and
had not even seen Reyes in about two years.
</P>
<P>
   But agents returned to Morales' office three weeks later _ armed
with evidence of a Dec. 13, 1995, telephone conversation and a Dec.
19 meeting involving Morales, Reyes and an undercover FBI
operative.
</P>
<P>
   According to an internal document, Morales changed his statement
after agents Ronald Stern and John Bienkowski confronted him by
reading a portion of the Dec. 13, 1995, transcript in which the
opinion was discussed by Morales and First Assistant Attorney
General Jorge Vega.
</P>
<P>
   ``After hearing the quote, Morales stated that he did recall
having a conversation with Reyes over the telephone regarding the
convention center hotel. Morales recalled that Reyes wanted the
attorney general's opinion to allow the Duddlesten group to receive
the tax benefits associated with House Bill 2282,'' the document
states.
</P>
<P>
   Although Morales' Dec. 15, 1995, opinion was favorable to both
proposals, Morales has said he was not influenced by Reyes'
request.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Reyes and Betti Maldonado, the former Houston port
commissioner, were convicted of bribery after being caught in an
FBI sting that was linked to the hotel project. They plan to
appeal.

 Labor Unions Gain Ground in Legislature  &HT;     By Ilana DeBare 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
We're not in a new century yet _ but when it comes to labor
legislation in California, it's starting to feel that way.
<P>
   Labor unions are making more headway in Sacramento than they
have in 16 years, and their efforts could change some aspects of
life on the job for everyone from working parents to independent
contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Unions are backing an ambitious array of about 20 bills that
address issues such as overtime pay, civil rights for contract
workers, and using sick leave to care for sick kids.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the labor bills have sailed smoothly through either
the Assembly or Senate. More significantly, unions are hoping that
Democratic Governor Gray Davis will sign the bills once they've
been approved by both houses _ something that rarely happened
during the past 16 years of Republican governors.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 16 years, the pendulum swung very far one way, so it's
time it swung back toward California workers,'' said Assemblyman
Darrell Steinberg, a Sacramento Democrat who is carrying several
major bills for the union movement. ``Labor is going to make gains
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Business groups, meanwhile, hope that Davis' efforts to carve
out a middle-of-the-road image will lead him to rein in or veto
some of the labor proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labor has been very effective so far, but I do believe the
governor will be tempered in the number of bills he signs and what
he signs,'' said Jack Stewart, president of the California
Manufacturers Association.
</P>
<P>
   So far, labor has racked up two clear victories with Davis'
help.
</P>
<P>
   On June 1, the governor signed a bill backed by state
construction unions that reversed an effort by former Governor Pete
Wilson to lower the wages paid on public works projects.
</P>
<P>
   And last month Davis' office weighed in to support AB60,  &LR; a bill
by Assemblyman Wally Knox, AB60, that would restore overtime pay
after eight hours _ one of labor's top priorities for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilson administration had replaced California's longtime
eight-hour overtime law with one requiring overtime after a 40-hour
week.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions asked Knox, a Los Angeles Democrat, to carry a bill
repealing the change, which they said cost California workers about
$1 billion a year in lost overtime pay.
</P>
<P>
   As the Assembly prepared to vote on the bill last month, Davis
pressed Knox to make some minor modifications in response to
employers' concerns. When the Assembly approved the bill with
Davis' amendments, the governor's signature became a near
certainty.
</P>
<P>
   Labor activists cheered the progress of the legislation, AB &LR;  60,
 &LR; which still must win Senate approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we have a lot of work ahead of us, but union members
and working families are optimistic about the future,'' said Sharon
Cornu, a spokeswoman for the California Labor Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Business groups remained unhappy about the bill, even with
Davis' amendments. ``It started out very badly and was reduced to
maybe simply bad,'' said Fred Main, senior vice president of the
California Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, labor and business are sparring on other issues that
could affect thousands of California workers:
</P>
<P>
   _Labor is pushing two work-related bills that were passed last
year but vetoed by Wilson. One of them AB109,  &LR; says that companies
offering sick leave must let workers use up to half their sick time
to take care of ill children.
</P>
<P>
   The other one SB 26,  &LR; would overturn a court case that weakened
state laws against age discrimination _ making it illegal to hire
or fire people in a way that disproportionately affects one age
group.
</P>
<P>
   _Labor is also pushing two complex bills AB 633 and AB 1127, &LR; 
 &LR; that would beef up penalties and enforcement procedures for
employers who violate wage laws or occupational safety laws.
</P>
<P>
   _Labor is supporting three bills to significantly increase
benefits for workers compensation, unemployment insurance, and
state disability insurance.
</P>
<P>
   _And labor is backing several measures that would give more
legal protection to independent contractors, who make up a growing
percentage of the workforce. One broad civil rights bill _ AB 1670
_  &LR; includes a section saying that contractors and regular employees
must be covered by state anti-discrimination laws. AB 1127,  &LR; An
occupational safety bill would make employers liable for safety
violations affecting contractors, not just employees.
</P>
<P>
   Business groups are attacking most of labor's measures as ``job
killers'' _ warning that they will force companies to shut down or
leave the state because of increased costs and paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   But despite business opposition, most of these bills will
probably be approved by the Legislature, both houses of which are
controlled by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The wild card remains Davis _ and how much he feels he can do
for his longtime allies in labor without jeopardizing his
middle-of-the-road image.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally feel there are certain injustices that have to be
corrected,'' said Senator Martha Escutia, the Huntington Park (Los
Angeles County) Democrat who wrote the age discrimination bill.
``If the governor feels we're jamming him with too much (labor
legislation), that's his problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of these bills will reach Governor Davis' desk,'' said
Main, ``but whether they will be vetoed or amended is the $64
question.''

NEW MEDICAL DEVICES ARE SAVING LIVES BUT KILLING HEALTH
CARE  FINANCES
</HEADLINE>
 _ SF CHRON   &HT;     By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
New medical devices may be revolutionizing the field of medicine
and saving lives, but government officials and insurance executives
are increasingly fearful that a steady stream of costly, new
medical gadgets could break the health care bank.
<P>
   Those concerns took center stage at a conference yesterday in
San Jose attended by some 400 executives representing all branches
of the medical devices industry.
</P>
<P>
   Medical devices encompass a wide variety of hardware used in the
treatment of disease, from a simple blood pressure cuff to the most
sophisticated system for open heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. sales of such devices totaled $17 billion in 1998,
according to analyst David Lothson with PaineWebber in New York.
More than 300 medical device firms are based in the Bay Area, said
J. Casey McGlynn, a partner with the Wilson Sonsini Goodrich &AMP;
Rosati law firm, which organized the event.
</P>
<P>
   Although the conference treated other topics _ like the
difficulty of raising money, given Wall Street's Internet mania _
several speakers addressed the question of whether and how
government agencies and HMOs might get a handle on the
cost-effectiveness of new medical technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good old days in medical devices, where the doctor wanted
it so the insurers paid for it, that's over,'' said Susan Bartlett
Foote, a former medical devices lobbyist in Washington, D.C. ``The
current environment in Washington is, `You cost too much, we have
to do something about it.'''
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate her point, Foote displayed a chart showing
per-capita health care spending in the United States during the
past four decades. In 1960, $141 was spent per person. In 1996, the
latest year for which she had government data, it was $3,781.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one would argue that new medical devices solely are
responsible for that steep rise, a recent report issued by the
Public Policy Institute _ a San Francisco nonprofit think tank _
singled out new medical gadgets as one of the drivers of health
care inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a strong consensus that technology diffusion _ the
development of new technologies and their introduction into medical
practice _ is one of the most important factors driving health care
costs,'' noted authors Laurence Baker and Joanne Spetz.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, a health research professor at Stanford University, and
Spetz, a Public Policy Institute economist, went on to suggest that
``policymakers need to consider limiting tech availability in order
to restrain health care cost growth.''
</P>
<P>
   To screen new technologies, Spetz and Baker say lawmakers could
revive a program they tried and abandoned in the 1980s that
requires health care providers to get a ``certificate of need''
proving that their community needs a new MRI &LR;   &LR; scanner or open
heart surgery center.
</P>
<P>
   Although such proposals remain only conjectural, a top federal
health care policy official at yesterday's conference said his
department is considering whether and how cost-effectiveness
testing should factor into deciding whether Medicare should pay for
new medical technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get more for our money or the same for less,'' said
Jeffrey Kang, a director of clinical quality with the Healthcare
Financing Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The agency HCFA  &LR; helps govern the Medicare program, which pays a
huge portion of the nation's medical bills. Kang said lawmakers
have focused on ways to bring the growth in Medicare spending,
which had been running 10 to 12 percent a year, down to more like 2
or 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At present, the federal government doesn't have an explicit
cost-effectiveness program, but Kang told the group that he thinks
it should be developed.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of taking products through new cost-effectiveness
tests, on top of current safety tests by the Food and Drug
Administration, only complicates the job of industry executives.
They're already struggling in a tight market to raise the $20
million it can take to bring a new device from concept to market.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never been a more difficult time for medical-device
financing,'' said Richard Ferrari, chief executive of
CardioThoracic Systems in Cupertino.
</P>
<P>
   His company, which already has a technology on the market,
illustrates how the industry keeps inventing new miracles. Ferrari
sells a system that allows surgeons to perform open heart surgery
while the patient's heart is beating.
</P>
<P>
   Up until now, patients who went in for a bypass operation would
be given a drug to slow and eventually stop their heart from
beating. At the same time, they would be hooked up to machine that
would fill their lungs with air and pump blood through their
arteries.
</P>
<P>
   Rebounding from that heart-stopping experience is the most
painful part of the patient's recovery. Ferrari's system
essentially is a vice that hold's the patient's beating heart
absolutely still while the surgeon performs the bypass.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrari said his system costs less than current open heart
techniques and allows the patients to recover more quickly because
they never had to have their heart stopped and restarted.
</P>
<P>
   But his system is a refinement on a current technique, so it's
easier to make direct comparisons. But how would a company prove
the cost-effectiveness of an entirely novel device that wasn't
comparable to anything in the market. Who would make the judgment?
Those were the sorts of questions being asked, but not necessarily
answered, at yesterday's conference.

 Melissa's Evil Twin Attacks PCs  &HT;     By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
A virulent new computer program masquerading as e-mail has wiped
out the files of thousands of PC users in at least three countries.
<P>
   The ExploreZip.worm _ the latest in a string of malicious
Internet bugs that is drawing comparisons to the widespread Melissa
virus _ prompted the temporary shutdown of e-mail servers at
Microsoft, Intel and Lucent Technologies. Computer security experts
said they received scattered reports of data damage from AT&AMP;T,
Boeing and General Electric and consumers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Melissa's evil twin sister,'' said Brian McElroy,
senior product manager at Trend Micro Inc., an antivirus software
maker in Cupertino. ``It has a destructive payload.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It swept through here like a cyclone,'' said the employee of
one Fortune 500 company, who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ExploreZip is classified as a worm, and not a virus, because it
can't replicate itself. Computer viruses like Melissa, which
surfaced in March, reproduce themselves. Melissa choked e-mail
servers with a deluge of messages but did not destroy data.
</P>
<P>
   The new computer strain, which originated mysteriously in
Israel, was discovered on Wednesday. It already has infected at
least 10,000 PCs at scores of companies in the United States,
Germany and France. Antivirus experts also have reported incidents
in Israel, South Africa, the Czech Republic, Peru and the United
Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Like Melissa, ExploreZip is disguised as an e-mail that appears
to be a reply to an earlier message. ``Hi (Recipient Name)! I
received your e-mail and I shall send you a reply ASAP,'' the
message states. ``Till then, take a look at the attached zipped
docs.'' &UR;  &LR; (Zipped docs refer to a compressed file sent along with
e-mail.)
</P>
<P>
   If opened, the ``zipped--files.exe'' attachment infects the
e-mail software and destroys the content of Microsoft Word, Excel
and PowerPoint documents and programming files.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key issue here is that (these) messages are very credible
and normal-looking replies to messages you have sent earlier,''
said Mikko Hypponen, manager of antivirus research at Data Fellows
Corp. in San Jose. ``You're quite likely to trust these messages
and open the attachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer-security firm Network Associates has given ExploreZip a
``high risk'' classification _ its most dangerous. They said it
would take days before they could accurately assess damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``These programs are becoming more sophisticated and more
deadly,'' said Wes Wasson, director of security product marketing
at Network Associates. ``(ExploreZip) doesn't spread as quickly as
Melissa, but it delivers a far more destructive payload.
</P>
<P>
   ``Melissa was a wake-up call,'' Wasson said. ``If it hadn't
opened our eyes to these types of worm programs, the damage from
this latest program would be far more severe.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Network Associates officials said they don't know who created
the new bug and have notified the FBI, the Department of Justice
and the Department of Energy.

Pittsburgh said it received 20 calls yesterday from victims of the
worm program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too soon to compare to Melissa, but we're taking it quite
seriously,'' said CERT spokesman Bill Pollak.
</P>
<P>
   Symantec, Network Associates' rival, said about a dozen U.S.
companies have been bitten by the ExploreZip bug, but it declined
to name those affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a scale of one to four, this is about a two, maybe three,''
said Joe Wells, founder of the WildList Organization International
in Newbury Park, which tracks computer viruses. ``Melissa was a
four. With this new worm, you have to run a program; Melissa was
spread by simply clicking an attachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Security experts advise computer users to delete any suspicious
e-mail. They suggest companies block the destructive program by
shutting down e-mail servers and Internet gateways.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft spokeswoman said the software giant closed its
e-mail servers for precautionary reasons a few hours yesterday
morning. She said it found no signs of ExploreZip after
``cleaning'' its system.
</P>
<P>
   ExploreZip is the fourth cyberattack to wipe out data and
paralyze computer systems this year. Melissa, Chernobyl and
BackDoor-G already have wreaked havoc on thousands of computers.
Antidotes for all four programs are readily available via the
Internet.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Pac Bell Gets OK to Raise Some Rates  &HT;     By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Insuring the telephone wiring inside your home and making a
person-to-person call is about to get more expensive under rate
increases approved yesterday by state regulators.
<P>
   The California Public Utilities Commission approved Pacific
Bell's request to increase ``inside wire repair'' insurance to
$1.20 per month from 60 cents per month. The PUC also granted Pac
Bell the right to raise rates on person-to-person calls to $4 from
$2.95.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling also opens the door to more increases down the road
on other services such as collect and calling card calls.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the PUC approved Pac Bell's request to
recategorize many of its services as ``fully competitive.'' Pac
Bell can raise rates more easily on competitive services than on
regulated ones. Classifying services as competitive means that the
market dictates the rates _ not state regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's meeting was the first one attended by two new &LR; 
 &LR; commissioners appointed on Wednesday by Governor Gray Davis. One
of the new appointees, Carl Wood, had not been sworn in and did not
vote. The other new commissioner, Joel Hyatt, abstained from the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   However, a temporary commissioner appointed last week, Loretta
Lynch, voted against the proposal, which passed 3-1. The proposal,
drafted by Commissioner Henry Duque, recommended increasing the
inside wiring fees and reclassifying services but rejecting Pac
Bell's request for rate increases on other services.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell had asked to raise the maximum rate it could charge for
collect calls to $1.60 from 95 cents, for calling card calls to 60
cents from 35 cents and for bill-to-third number calls to $1.60
from 95 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC said Pac Bell had not justified its need for higher
rates. But by reclassifying those services as competitive, &UR;  &LR; Pac
Bell can more easily raise the rates for those services in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not good for consumers,'' said Paul Stein, an attorney
with The Utility Reform Network, a consumer group in San Francisco.
``Reclassifying these services as competitive means the commission
would be very hard pressed to deny a request by Pac Bell to raise
rates.''
</P>
<P>
   John Britton, a spokesman for Pac Bell, said the company may
seek rate increases on collect and other calls in the future but
has no immediate plans to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few weeks, Pac Bell will increase the cost of inside
wire repair for the 6 million customers who pay for the service.
</P>
<P>
   About 60 percent of Pac Bell's customers pay the monthly fee so
they can get phone wiring problems inside their homes fixed for
free by Pac Bell. Those who don't have the inside wire repair plan
can either pay Pac Bell for repairs or hire somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   Britton praised the ruling, saying the company had been charging
less than what it costs to provide inside wire repair. Pac Bell had
asked the PUC to let it raise rates on the service to $1.50, but
Britton said the company was satisfied with $1.20.
</P>
<P>
   A PUC administrative law judge had recommended letting Pac Bell
raise inside wiring rates to just $1. Duque drafted the winning
proposal that allowed $1.20.
</P>
<P>
   The law judge's proposal, which was supported by consumer
groups, also recommended denying Pac Bell's request to reclassify
inside wiring as a competitive service. But Duque said Pac Bell had
proved that the inside wire market was open to competition so it no
longer needed to be regulated.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is virtually a monopoly service. There aren't many other
options besides Pac Bell for inside wiring,'' said Kelly Boyd,
senior telecommunications analyst with the Office of Ratepayer
Advocates, the consumer arm of the PUC.
</P>
<P>
   Stein, with TURN, said most customers don't even know they can
go to another company besides Pac Bell for wiring repairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of confusion about this service,'' Stein said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that even with minimal competition, Pac Bell has not
lost any market share on inside wiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competition is supposed to bring lower prices and more
options, but so far, all we've seen are rate increases for basic
services,'' Stein said.
</P>
<P>
   Britton defended Pac Bell, saying customers are seeing the
benefits of competition. He pointed to ads in the Yellow Pages for
electricians who will work inside wiring as proof.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of other companies advertising for customers'
business,'' Britton said.

 _ SF CHRON   Going From Big to Small 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I have worked in field sales for a large corporation with $10
billion in annual sales revenues for almost five years. Recently,
the company went through a merger and I decided to leave. I am
currently in negotiation with a much smaller niche player with
about $25 million in annual sales. Any things I should bear in mind
when moving from such a large company to a smaller one?
</P>
<P>
   A: Hats off to you for asking this question. Too many people
change jobs without realizing they're also changing corporate
cultures _ and sometimes end up paying a steep price in gaffes or
misunderstandings. Here are a few tips from people who have worked
with both big and small companies:
</P>
<P>
   _Before you take the job, make sure you're comfortable with the
values and work style of the owner or chief executive. Even more
than at a big company, that person will set the tone for your daily
work life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to spend a lot more time with the person you work
for than if you were at a big company,'' said Igor Sill, an
executive recruiter with the Geneva Group International in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   _Keep your antennae out for office politics. At big companies,
you can sometimes use an organizational chart to figure out who the
key players are. At small companies, titles are less meaningful:
The CEO's secretary may be the one who really controls the budget.
</P>
<P>
   _Be prepared to take risks. ``Small companies are interested in
growth, and growth depends on trying new things,'' said Jim Kouzes,
a management consultant with the Tom Peters Group in Palo Alto and
author of ``The Leadership Challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   _Be willing to do more with less and to wear more hats than at
your previous job. ``Before, you may have had the resources to put
together a $300,000 marketing campaign, while now there may be a
$10,000 marketing budget for the whole company,'' said Roger King,
an executive recruiter with TechSearch in Sausalito.
</P>
<P>
   _Button your lip when you're tempted to lecture people about the
way your old company did things. Sure, your old firm was big and
successful. But your new colleagues will get very sick, very fast,
of hearing, ``When I was at XYZ Corp., we did things this way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask people things _ don't tell them,'' said Mitchell Marks, a
San Francisco management consultant and author of ``Joining Forces:
Making 1+13 in Mergers and Acquisitions.'' ``Instead of saying that
your old company never had this many meetings, ask questions like
`Why do you have this meeting every month?'''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Taxes and the Baby Sitter
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have hired a baby sitter to care for my two children at
home after school. What kinds of tax papers do I need to file as
her employer?
</P>
<P>
   A: The short answer is: Probably more tax papers than you want.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with federal taxes, which are somewhat easier than
state taxes. If you pay the baby sitter less than $1,100 a year,
you don't have to pay any federal employment taxes, according to
Oakland accountant David Roberts. Or if she's taking care of the
kids in her own home _ rather than yours _ you don't have to pay
federal employment taxes.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if the sitter is earning more than $1,100 per
quarter while working in your home, you will need to obtain her
Social Security number and fill out a W-2 for her by January 31
each year. You don't need to withhold any federal taxes from her
paychecks. Instead, you can pay Social Security and Medicare taxes
for her once a year, by filing a Schedule H with your annual tax
return.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the considerably more complicated California state tax
picture. ``The state doesn't have the equivalent of Schedule H,
where you can just throw all the payroll taxes in with your annual
filing,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   If you pay the sitter less than $750 per quarter, you don't have
to file any state tax documents. But if you pay more than $750 per
quarter, you must file a registration form (DE 1HW) with the state
Employment Development Department.
</P>
<P>
   If your sitter is paid $750 to $999.99 per quarter, you must pay
state disability insurance. If she is paid $1,000 or more per
quarter, you must also pay unemployment insurance and employment
training taxes.
</P>
<P>
   You'll have to file quarterly reports on your sitter's wages
with the state, but you may not have to make tax payments every
quarter. For example, if you pay her less than $20,000 per year,
you can make state payroll tax payments on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
   More confused than ever? Call your local office of the state
Employment Development Department and ask for a copy of the 1999
Household Employers Guide (DE 8829). It's also available online at
 &LR; www.edd.cahwnet.gov &LR;   &LR; /De8829.pdf.  &LR; For U.S. taxes, see the IRS
Household Employer's Tax Guide (Publication 926) at
 &LR; www.irs.ustreas.gov. &LR;

ED ARNOLD ON THE MOVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a page out of Ed Arnold's busy date book:
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday: Attend a board meeting for the Salvation Army. Serve
as MC for an entrepreneur of the year reception. Drop by a
children's hospital for a function featuring former Dodger Matt
Luke.
</P>
<P>
   Today: Finish jury duty. Attend a meeting regarding upcoming
events for the Boy Scouts of America. Serve as MC for the opening
ceremonies of the Southern California Special Olympics at Long
Beach State.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday: Help organize a charity event for foster kids.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday: Anchor KTLA's Sunday night sports show.
</P>
<P>
   Monday: Find a new job.
</P>
<P>
   Television's unquenchable need to fix things that aren't
necessarily broke claimed the 1968 Long Beach State grad late last
month. After 13 years as KTLA's reliable No. 2 sportscaster,
someone who brought more to the table than just scores, the station
decided it was time for a change. His last sportscast will be on
June 30.
</P>
<P>
   The reason provided was typically vague. Station management said
it wanted to go in a different direction and find someone with more
energy.
</P>
<P>
   The subtext? KTLA is an affiliate of the infant WB Network, and
its prime time programming (8-10 p.m.) is aimed at a young, urban
crowd. KTLA's Nielsen ratings for its 10 p.m. newscast have been in
decline for a while, losing viewers to competitors at KTTV (Fox)
and KCOP (UPN), whose news shows also follow programming aimed at
the young.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Arnold's misfortune was turning 59 and letting some of his
hair turn gray. The fact that he did good work and his charity work
was a tremendous resource for the station couldn't overcome his
birth certificate.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our business, we all eventually face it, and my contract
was up,'' said Arnold this week between engagements. ``It does have
a lot to do with the programming. KTLA is trying to reach a
particular audience, and that factors into a lot of decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   In an industry that likes to remake itself every few months, the
L.A. market sports-wise has been pretty static. The only major
personnel changes have been the arrival of Newy Scruggs at KCOP and
KABC's trade of Todd Donoho for Bill Weir. The only new sports
programming has been Scruggs' underpromoted and poorly scheduled
half-hour show on Sundays and KCBS' NFL-driven Sports Central.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold believes more fundamental change is coming, and it's not
good news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consultants are playing way too much of a role in the
decisions for local news,'' he said, ``and one of their suggestions
is to cut back on sports. Jim Hill is getting little more than a
minute for sports on the 11 p.m. newscast at KCSB, and only KNBC is
regularly giving all the scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consultants say that no one cares, and that real sports
fans watch ESPN or Fox Sports News. But not everyone has 30 or 60
minutes to watch SportsCenter. Plus, whenever there's a major
sports story, it gets bumped to the top of the newscast.''
</P>
<P>
   Money could have been a factor in KTLA's decision. Even though
Arnold has always been cast as a No. 2 man, often by choice because
of his civic work, his contract reflects 30 years experience in the
market. (Tony Hernandez is KTLA's lead sportscaster.) The trend of
hiring young has the side benefit of smaller salaries.
</P>
<P>
   But Arnold gave KTLA exceptional residual value with his more
than 200 days of charity work a year. It's one thing for viewers to
see his face on TV, and another altogether for potential viewers to
see his face in person at community events.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the aforementioned events, Arnold will be feted soon at
a Black Chamber of Commerce event; will host the Boys Scouts golf
tournament; will serve as grand marshall of a parade in Tustin; and
will host the annual Huntington Beach July 4 parade.
</P>
<P>
   During the course of a normal year, Arnold will also work for
the Goodwill Industries, March of Dimes, Marine Corp Toys for Tots,
cystic fibrosis, the Orange County Multiple Sclerosis Society,
Rancho Santiago College Foundation, fund drives at KCET and KOCE,
and Rotary and Friars events. He also was integral in a
fund-raising campaign that once saved 49er football, and has been
the regular announcer for the Tower of Power Sunday telecasts for
38 years.
</P>
<P>
   You tell me what's more valuable -- Arnold's steady sportscasts
and his community profile, or some wise ass sportscaster with video
of a squirrel who surfs?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not ready to retire,'' he said. ``My own long range goal
was to work at least until 2002. But I doubt if I'll get many TV
opportunities because of my age. Things aren't moving in that
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Arnold will pinch-hit for some of the talk show hosts at radio
station KRLA in August and has received some other feelers from
radio. There is even a modest ``Save Ed'' campaign on the Internet
(home.digitalcity.com/Los Angeles).
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that's flattering,'' said Arnold. ``Hey, if things don't
work out, I'll just have more time to play with my two
grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   ZAMBONIED: Fox Sports is preparing to bid adieu to the NHL, with
two Stanley Cup finals telecasts left (Games 5 and 7), if
necessary). The end will mark Fox's first losing effort since it
entered the sports realm.
</P>
<P>
   cf,hel,8,8.2 AND NOW THE NEWS Arnold, a native of Arkansas,
first visited Southern California while he was in the Marines and
never left. He served at El Toro for three years, then went right
to Santa Ana College (now Rancho Santiago) after his discharge. He
eventually wound up at Long Beach State, earning a degree in speech
and broadcasting. ... KCOP is expected to add Michelle Bonner as a
sports anchor sometime in July. She comes from Houston... KTTV will
air a postgame baseball show, Fox Extra Innings, after Fox Saturday
telecasts this season. Rick Garcia hosts. ... ESPN Classic will
debut a new one-hour show titled ``NBA Vintage'' next Thursday (8
p.m.), hosted by Robin Roberts and produced by NBA Entertainment. A
different current star will be linked to a legend, featuring
footage and interviews with both players. The first episode
features Julius Erving and Grant Hill. A future episode will
feature Jerry West and Kobe Bryant (July 1). Classic also airs a
U.S. Open marathon Saturday and Sunday in advance of the upcoming
1999 event next week. ... ESPN's Lee Corso and Kirk Herbstreit will
leave the safety of their studio to become the new co-analysts on
Thursday night college football games this fall. Thankfully, the
closest the insane Corso will get to L.A. is Oregon in the
season-opener (against Michigan State). ... Fox's baseball coverage
Saturday featuring interleague play earned a 3.2 Nielsen, up three
percent from Fox's previous high for its first telecast. Here's a
little statement on the status of baseball here while Fox earned a
10.0 rating for the Yankees-Mets in New Jack City, the
Dodgers-Angels game did a 4.1 locally. ... Fox's Hardcore Baseball
Tuesday will look at father-son combos, including the obvious
(Bonds, Griffey) and the more obscure, like Torrance's Jason
Kendall and his dad Fred. ... NASCAR rules! CBS has added a
half-hour prerace show (9:30 a.m.) to its coverage of a NASCAR race
from Michigan Saturday (10 a.m.), and it will provide a weeks worth
of drop-in NASCAR programming on prime time shows leading up to the
Pepsi 400 on July 3. ... Sunday's Tiger Woods-driven coverage of
the Memorial earned CBS a 3.8, the highest rating for the tourney
in a decade. ... Monday's edition of ``Real Sports'' on HBO takes a
look at the shaky relationship between baseball and its umpires.
... CBS has added former Toronto Blue Jays star Joe Carter to its
College World Series broadcast team. CBS will air Texas A&AMP;M-Florida
State Saturday and then the title game a week later. ESPN and ESPN2
provides the meat of the CWS coverage, including the Fullertons
against Stanford Saturday (5 p.m.). Harold Reynolds and Joe Morgan
will split analysis duty. ...
</P>
<P>
   THE WORLD OF TV SPORTS ACCORDING TO ME: A suggestion in this
space a few weeks ago, that KXTA (1150 am) rerun an hour or two of
Jim Rome's show at noon instead of any live talk, caught fire with
several readers. Personal mail, phone calls and email indicates a
lot of Rome's fans sleep in, and that a rerun of The Jungle is
preferable to anything or anyone KXTA program director Mike
Thompson airs between Rome and Dodger games. ... Speaking of
XTRA/KXTA management, a pox on both houses for some erratic
programming decisions, like airing NBA playoff games on XTRA on
weekends but not during the week; for the over-the-top Dodger KXTA
pregame shows featuring Vic Jacobs, who set a new world record for
shilling by defending footloose Chan Ho Park; and for Saturday's
decidedly non-sport romance/sex talk show. What's up with that? ...
Confidential your-eyes-only memo to KCOP/KXTA double threat Newy
Scruggs: Save yourself ... Here's a trend to mull: Fox's NHL
coverage in cities like Birmingham are outdrawing major cities like
Chicago, New York and Philadelphia that have NHL teams. I'd
classify this as bad news, not good. Major market tune out is
deadly. ... The X Games begin June 27 on ESPN, ESPN2 and ABC. Plan
your vacations accordingly.

$40million business park planned for Moorpark 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOORPARK _ Hoping to capitalize on growth in the high-technology
sector, a Long Beach-based developer will build a $40 million
business park on 33 acres along the Moorpark Freeway.
</P>
<P>
   Cypress Land Co. recently bought the parcel from a family trust
and plans to start construction during the first quarter of next
year. The purchase price was not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The project, called the Moorpark Corporate Center, will have
more than 500,000 square feet of space in a series of buildings
ranging in size from 15,000 square feet to 120,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   It will be at the southwest corner of the freeway and New Los
Angeles Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Cypress officials could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tingus, vice president of the San Fernando Valley office of
the Seeley Co., which brokered the deal, said Cypress is hoping to
capture some spillover of business from companies in the West San
Fernando Valley or east Ventura County that want to expand but
cannot find suitable sites in those locales.
</P>
<P>
   Seeley will start looking for tenants in the first few months of
next year, Tingus said.
</P>
<P>
   Lease rates have not been set, but they will be less than what
companies pay along the Ventura Freeway corridor. That area, which
stretches from Calabasas to Camarillo and is known as the 101 Tech
Corridor, has become a magnet for high-tech and biotech companies.
The most well-known is probably Amgen Inc., the world's largest
biotechnology company, which is headquartered near the Ventura
Freeway a few miles west of the Moorpark Freeway.
</P>
<P>
   There should not be a shortage of potential tenants because the
Moorpark market is short on buildings larger than 40,000 square
feet, Tingus said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That type of product is the kind we are finding the high-tech
users are going for,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Seeley broker John DeGrinis said vacancy rates in the Moorpark
area are running about 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Cypress has built and owns more than 2.5 million square feet of
industrial office parks in Southern California.!

TEXAS FAMILY WINS $234 MILLION JUDGMENT AGAINST RUSSIA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ED ASHER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A Texas family who claimed that ancestral property in
St. Petersburg, Russia, was illegally seized has won a $234 million
judgment against the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
   Houston attorney Lee Alexander Magness and his mother and aunt
said the government expropriated the property twice, after the
Russian revolution in 1917 and again in 1994 after the family
reclaimed it.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge David Hittner, who had earlier rejected the
Magness request to hold a Romanov jewel exhibit touring this
country as collateral, awarded the damages this week.
</P>
<P>
   A representative of the Russian Embassy and the Russian
Federation's attorney, Tim Dickinson, could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident we can collect the judgment,'' said the
Magness attorney, Daniel B. Nelson. ``There are post-judgment
methods and remedies we can undertake. But I don't want to discuss
that at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Magness' mother, Nina Schroder Magness, and aunt, Agnes Schroder
Atkins, are daughters of Johann Schroder, who in 1917 owned three
valuable properties in St. Petersburg: the K.M. Schroder Piano
Factory, now known as the Red October Factory; a retail shopping
center and a 30-room downtown mansion, Hittner said in his ruling.
</P>
<P>
   All were seized by the communists after the Bolshevik revolution
in 1917, he said. The family claimed the property then was worth
more than 16 million gold rubles, or about $162 million.
</P>
<P>
   After the fall of communism, the Russian government initiated
reforms, including laws that prohibited the nationalization or
expropriation of foreign investments, Hittner said.
</P>
<P>
   The Magnesses traveled to St. Petersburg in 1994 to reclaim the
family fortune. After presenting historic documents showing they
were Schroder's heirs, the family was assured by Russian
authorities that they would receive titles to the property,
Hittner's ruling said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Magness also purchased two antique Schroder pianos, one
built in 1889 and the other in 1910, according to the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Later in 1994, the Russian Federation claimed that all of the
properties were ``national treasures'' or ``historical'' in nature
and expropriated them, Hittner said.
</P>
<P>
   The Magness family sued in 1997 to stop the Russian Ministry of
Culture from removing a touring $100 million Romanov jewel exhibit
from Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The jewels belonged to Russia's ruling Romanov family overthrown
by the communists.
</P>
<P>
   After Hittner refused to stop the tour, the Magness family
pressed on with its lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Hittner's ruling said the Russian government's seizure of the
Schroder property violated international law.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted that the family was never compensated.
</P>
<P>
   Hittner also awarded Lee Magness $400,000 for the two pianos.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of his ruling, interest on the award is building at
an estimated $31,000 per day.

HAVING FUN AND MAKING HISTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are two females shattering racial barriers without
seemingly breaking a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   They get along fabulously on the court and famously off it.
</P>
<P>
   They pursue lives outside their sport as vigorously as they go
after returns.
</P>
<P>
   They are on the verge of something big.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you've heard of them?
</P>
<P>
   No, not Serena and Venus Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Meet Annett Buckner Davis and Jenny Johnson Jordan, who are
taking the beach volleyball scene by tsunami, the same way the
Williams sisters are the tennis world.
</P>
<P>
   They've known each other since they entered UCLA together in
1991. They shared a dorm room as freshmen and have been close as
kin since.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't get together in beach volleyball until August of
1997, which means they're in their incubation period as far as the
sport goes. Heaven help their competitors when they finally hatch.
</P>
<P>
   The best two-man teams generally are composed of players with
beach backgrounds as sweeping as the shoreline. It takes time to
learn how best to cover so much space (agoraphobics need not
enter). A lot of sand has to pass through the hour glass before
beach players have much of anything to fall back on besides their
athleticism.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, in the third event they entered, Buckner Davis, 25, and
Johnson Jordan, 26, became the first African-American pair to reach
a final in a Women's Professional Volleyball Association
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Their breakthrough title so far has eluded them. They're chasing
it again this week, at the Women's Pro Beach Open in Hermosa Beach,
Calif..
</P>
<P>
   Buckner Davis has taken their string of seconds _ they added two
more this past month, in Huntington Beach and Clearwater, Fla. _ in
stride. Not so with Johnson Jordan, the list-making,
sideline-pacing, strategy-mapping, order-craving one in the
partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jenny and I have different perspectives,'' Buckner
Davis said the other day with a laugh. ``She's kind of like, `I'm
tired of getting second.' She wants to get to the number one spot.
Of course I want to get there too, but I look at our inexperience
and I feel blessed to be where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson Jordan readily acknowledged: ``I'm more task-oriented. I
stress more about things. I'm constantly thinking. Annett is more
laid-back.''
</P>
<P>
   Their personalities complement each other and so do their
playing styles. Johnson Jordan is a solid passer and her defense is
airtight. Buckner Davis is a power hitter who loves to finish what
Johnson Jordan sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are kind of fit for each other,'' Buckner Davis said. ``Her
strengths are my weaknesses and her weaknesses are my strengths.''
</P>
<P>
   Their partnership works because they complete each other. Too
many other partners _ in sports, business, life _ compete against
each other for attention, for superiority, for praise. That's
particularly true in the self-absorbed world of beach volleyball.
Predictably, there's more partner-swapping on the sand than at
1970s key parties.
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing how many people a player can use and discard on her
way to the top. Buckner Davis and Johnson Jordan, frankly, aren't
that ambitious. Of course they want to earn one of two spots on the
U.S. Olympic team in 2000 and be the best at what they do. But they
refuse to pursue those goals at the expense of their family values.
</P>
<P>
   Both players are close to their families and everyone on both
sides are related by sports. Buckner Davis' father, Cleveland
Buckner, played for the New York Knicks in the early 1960s (he gets
so keyed up watching the Knicks play now, his doctors have
suggested he give his heart a rest and just read about their NBA
Finals pursuit in the newspaper). Her husband, Byron Davis, is a
former UCLA swimmer who missed making the 1996 U.S. Olympic team by
two places in the 100-meter butterfly. Like his wife, he is
training (at USC) for a shot at the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson Jordan's father is decorated Olympic decathlete Rafer
Johnson. Her husband Kevin Jordan is a former football player at
UCLA who is leading the Athletes in Action ministry on campus after
retiring from the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love volleyball, but we have a life outside of it,'' said
Johnson Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Added Buckner Davis: ``We both have strong family support. We
both kind of put volleyball in perspective. It's a great thing and
we feel blessed to be doing what we're doing. But if it was taken
away from us, it wouldn't be the end of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the end of their world in 1998, but professional
volleyball players could see it from there. There was too much
greed and not enough giving back by too many players. After a
while, there wasn't enough style or substance for the sponsors, who
took their cash elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The player-run WPVA was disbanded, forcing the players to adopt
a have-passport-will-travel mentality. Which spun Johnson Jordan's
orderly world right off its axis.
</P>
<P>
   One trip she'll never forget. She and Buckner Davis were flying
home to L.A. from a tournament in Portugal via Paris. The first leg
of their flight was delayed, which caused them to miss their
connection, which forced them to spend the night in Paris and catch
a flight to L.A. the following day, which made them miss their
flight to Japan for their next tournament, which meant they had to
purchase a new ticket to Japan and take a flight that touched down
six hours before their first match.
</P>
<P>
   Even the hard-to-ruffle Buckner Davis had to admit, ``A lot of
the travel was stressful.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why you won't find the pair griping about the morning
commute on the 405 this week. Oldsmobile, a sponsor of USA
Volleyball, is backing a handful of domestic tournaments, and other
companies _ this week it's Mervyn's and Paul Mitchell Salon
Haircare _ have stepped forward to sponsor other events.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year has been a complete turnaround,'' Johnson Jordan
said. ``We get to play at home and there are great, competitive
events. Sponsors are willing to back beach volleyball again. It's
great to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckner Davis and Johnson Jordan are the type of players _ and
people _ that make a person want to watch.

AIRBUS OUT TO MAKE A BIG SPLASH AT PARIS AIR SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For the next week, at least, a bullish Airbus
Industrie has the home field advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts say it's a no-brainer that the European
airplane-maker will be out to make a splash _ and a statement that
it has arrived as The Boeing Co.'s equal _ when the world's biggest
air show opens Saturday at Le Bourget field outside of Paris, where
Charles Lindbergh landed his Spirit of St. Louis in 1927.
</P>
<P>
   This is the 30th anniversary of the launch at the 1969 Paris Air
Show of the A300, the first jetliner Airbus built in what then
appeared to be a Don Quixote quest to one day be the equal of
mighty Boeing in commercial aviation.
</P>
<P>
   But The Boeing Co. will not go quietly into the night at the
last big air show of the millennium. Although the aerospace giant
is well behind Airbus in announced new orders this year, it is
expected to have improved its anemic order book by the time the
show ends next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing will announce at least one ``significant'' order in
Paris, which involves a mix of next generation 737s and other
models, according to people familiar with the deal. In addition,
Boeing has several smaller orders to announce. But one order that
Boeing had been counting on from China Airlines may not be
finalized in time to be announced in Paris as hoped, sources said.
China Airlines, the largest carrier in Taiwan, has been negotiating
with Boeing for up to a dozen 747s. The order would be worth as
much as $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, Boeing and Airbus both have used the Paris show
to beef up their order books.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, Boeing has announced firms orders for 52
planes worth $3.9 billion. Airbus has announced firm orders for 153
planes.
</P>
<P>
   That represents a sharp decline for both airplane makers from
1998, when Boeing had 656 orders and Airbus had 556. After several
boom years, the industry cycle has clearly turned, in part due to
the Asian economic crisis and the fact that many of the major
airlines have already placed orders for new Airbus or Boeing planes
to replace aging fleets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Airbus has been doing very well at winning narrow-body
airplane orders,'' said analyst Peter Jacobs of Seattle's Ragen
MacKenzie. ``Right now, as was the case in 1998, narrow body orders
are a much higher percentage of overall orders.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Boeing's orders are down, the company is in much
better shape than it was two years ago when production problems led
to several billion dollars in write-offs. Those problems continued
for much of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing will deliver a record 620 planes this year, compared with
fewer than 300 for Airbus, and analysts say the Seattle-based
company is doing what it needs to do to regain its financial
footing and its reputation on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing executives have said they will no longer compete with
Airbus for market share if it means they can't make money on the
planes they sell.
</P>
<P>
   But the rivalry remains intense, and this year it will play out
during the air show against the backdrop of several developing
stories that will occupy much of the industry talk at Paris.
</P>
<P>
   One of those stories is the future of Boeing's 717.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing will use the event to showcase the newest and smallest
member of its jetliner family. The 100-seater so far has had
disappointing sales. To try and find more customers, Boeing will
take the plane on a 10-day European tour after the air show as part
of an intense marketing blitz.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts say this could be the last chance for the 717
to prove itself, and Boeing could decide to kill the Long Beach,
Calif.-based program if sales don't pick up.
</P>
<P>
   The Airbus answer to the 717 is the A318, which is not yet in
production, and Airbus plans a media briefing at Paris to tout the
virtues of its plane.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks, what amounts to civil war has broken out
within the Airbus consortium over the development of the A318.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the four Airbus partners, Aerospatiale Matra of France
and Daimler Chrysler Aerospace of Germany, are squabbling over the
allocation of work for the new plane. Though Airbus officials
declined comment, the respected industry publication Flight
International reported this week that there is even confusion
whether the Airbus board actually gave its approval for the launch
of the A318. Airbus boss Noel Forgeard officially announced the
launch of the A318 in April.
</P>
<P>
   The four Airbus partners have been trying for some time to
transform the consortium into a single corporate entity to better
compete with Boeing. That transformation was to have taken place
this year, but progress has been slowed by political bickering.
</P>
<P>
   The latest spat could work in Boeing's favor as it pushes the
717. Industry executives and analysts will be paying close
attention to anything Airbus officials have to say in Paris about
the reported A318 rift, and the progress towards turning Airbus
into a single corporate entity.
</P>
<P>
   Another story that will be followed closely at the Paris show is
the proposed A3XX super jumbo jet that Airbus has been talking
about for several years. This is the plane Airbus needs to break
Boeing's stranglehold on jetliners that can carry more than 400
passengers. The A3XX would carry as many as 600 people. But the
development costs are least $10 billion, and perhaps as high as $15
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Boeing decided not to proceed with the
development of a similar-size jumbo jet, arguing the worldwide
market is not big enough to recover the staggering developement
costs. Boeing's latest long-range market forecast, which the
company plans to make public Monday at the air show, reportedly
shows that the market for a super jumbo has declined to fewer than
400 planes, according to a person familiar with the forecast. The
forecast looks at the commercial aircraft market for the next 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   While commercial aviation will make news at Paris, so will the
defense side of the aerospace industry. The airshow opens just days
after NATO's long air war against Yugoslavia ended.
</P>
<P>
   The ear-splitting thunder of fighters will fill the skies daily
over Le Bourget field. Lockheed Martin's F-16 will be at Paris, as
will the Eurofighter and Russian fighters.
</P>
<P>
   But missing from Paris this year will be any fighter with
Boeing's name on it. Because of the air war over Yugoslavia, the
U.S. military could not spare either an F-18 Hornet or an F-15
Eagle, a Boeing spokesman said. Both fighters are built by Boeing
in St. Louis have been used extensively in the air campaign.

CLINTON SEES `FORMIDABLE CHALLENGES' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton savored victory while warning of
the ``formidable challenges'' ahead in the Balkans as he addressed
the nation Thursday for the first time since Serb troops agreed to
leave war-torn Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In an appeal to Serbians, he suggested they replace President
Slobodan Milosevic if they expect help in rebuilding their bombed
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demands of an outraged and united international community
have been met,'' Clinton said in a prime-time televised address on
the same day that NATO forces verified Serb troop withdrawals from
Kosovo and halted the 79-day bombing campaign in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can report to the American people that we have achieved a
victory for a safer world, for our democratic values and for a
stronger America,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said challenges remain as NATO forces enter Kosovo
to ensure the return of ethnic Albanian refugees and to maintain
the peace.
</P>
<P>
   While the president noted there were no direct U.S. combat
casualties during the bombing campaign, he said ``this next phase
also will be dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bitter memories may still be fresh and there may well be
casualties.'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that the United States will contribute 7,000 of the
50,000 peacekeeping soldiers in Kosovo, which will be under NATO
control.
</P>
<P>
   While the bulk of Clinton's 15-minute speech was aimed at a
domestic audience, he also directed part of his message at Serbs,
suggesting that their suffering was due to the ``ethnic cleansing''
policies engineered by Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should know that your leaders could have kept Kosovo part
of your country without driving a single Kosovar family from its
home, without killing a single adult or child, without inviting a
single NATO bomb to fall on your country,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He further suggested that until Milosevic is removed, the Serbs
may continue to suffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as he remains in power, as long as your nation is
ruled by an indicted war criminal, we will provide no support for
the reconstruction of Serbia,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ``We are ready to provide humanitarian aid now and
help build a better future for Serbia, too, when its government
represents tolerance and freedom, not repression and terror.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton defended NATO's military air campaign, saying that ``we
have averted the wider war this conflict might well have sparked.''
</P>
<P>
   And clearly with an eye on his own legacy, the president said:
``Because of our resolve, the 20th century is ending, not with
helpless indignation, but with a hopeful affirmation of human
dignity and human rights for the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's address capped a day devoted to thanking aides
and international allies while pounding out details of the
complicated NATO peace effort in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Clinton continued to deal with complications at
home as some Republicans in Congress sought unsuccessfully to limit
funding for the peacekeeping mission.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike earlier in the week, when the administration remained
wary about commenting on the peace process, the White House
appeared ready Thursday to begin the victory lap.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Clinton appeared before reporters in the
White House briefing room to announce the suspension of the NATO
air campaign and the beginning of the Serb withdrawal from the
province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he felt vindicated by the bombing's success, the
president responded: ``The United States should feel vindicated
when the people go home, and when they're safe and when we can say
that we, as a nation, have played a role in reversing `ethnic
cleansing.'''
</P>
<P>
   The president spent much of the day calling many of the world
leaders that have stood with him during a sometimes unpopular
military campaign. Among the first to hear from Clinton was British
Prime Minister Tony Blair, who has been a firm U.S. ally and among
the most hawkish proponents of the use of military force.
</P>
<P>
   The president also spoke to the Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema
of Italy, from where many of the bombing missions were staged, and
President Jacques Chirac of France, whom he will visit next week.
</P>
<P>
   He also telephoned Russian President Boris Yeltsin, who was
critical of NATO's bombing campaign but who later was instrumental
in helping forge the peace accord with the Serb leadership.
</P>
<P>
   And despite a somewhat strained relationship with the
congressional GOP leadership, which has been less than supportive
of the bombing, Clinton spoke to leaders of the House and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton also chatted
with Wesley Clark, supreme commander of NATO, and told him that
``the future is now what we need to concentrate on.''
</P>
<P>
   In his conversation with Blair, Clinton also was moving on to
the next step, speaking about the urgency to get a civilian
administration up and running in Kosovo, Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters, Clinton stressed the challenges that
remain ahead, including the operational difficulties of moving in a
50,000-person peace force.
</P>
<P>
   Also mindful of Milosevic's dubious record of credibility,
Clinton warned that the bombing could resume if the Yugoslav army
failed to live up to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, we have to make sure that Serbs keep their
commitments,'' he said. ``That means the forces must rapidly and
peacefully leave Kosovo under the agreed timetable, 11 days from
yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will continue in a celebratory mode today as he travels
to Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri to thank military personnel.
Whiteman is the home of the 509th Bomb Wing and was the staging
base for the B-2 bomber sorties to Yugoslavia.

MacKenzie. ``Right now, as was the case in 1998, narrow body orders
are a much higher percentage of overall orders.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Boeing's orders are down, the company is in much
better shape than it was two years ago when production problems led
to several billion dollars in write-offs. Those problems continued
for much of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing will deliver a record 620 planes this year, compared with
fewer than 300 for Airbus, and analysts say the Seattle-based
company is doing what it needs to do to regain its financial
footing and its reputation on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing executives have said they will no longer compete with
Airbus for market share if it means they can't make money on the
planes they sell.
</P>
<P>
   But the rivalry remains intense, and this year it will play out
during the air show against the backdrop of several developing
stories that will occupy much of the industry talk at Paris.
</P>
<P>
   One of those stories is the future of Boeing's 717.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing will use the event to showcase the newest and smallest
member of its jetliner family. The 100-seater so far has had
disappointing sales. To try and find more customers, Boeing will
take the plane on a 10-day European tour after the air show as part
of an intense marketing blitz.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts say this could be the last chance for the 717
to prove itself, and Boeing could decide to kill the Long Beach,
Calif.-based program if sales don't pick up.
</P>
<P>
   The Airbus answer to the 717 is the A318, which is not yet in
production, and Airbus plans a media briefing at Paris to tout the
virtues of its plane.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks, what amounts to civil war has broken out
within the Airbus consortium over the development of the A318.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the four Airbus partners, Aerospatiale Matra of France
and Daimler Chrysler Aerospace of Germany, are squabbling over the
allocation of work for the new plane. Though Airbus officials
declined comment, the respected industry publication Flight
International reported this week that there is even confusion
whether the Airbus board actually gave its approval for the launch
of the A318. Airbus boss Noel Forgeard officially announced the
launch of the A318 in April.
</P>
<P>
   The four Airbus partners have been trying for some time to
transform the consortium into a single corporate entity to better
compete with Boeing. That transformation was to have taken place
this year, but progress has been slowed by political bickering.
</P>
<P>
   The latest spat could work in Boeing's favor as it pushes the
717. Industry executives and analysts will be paying close
attention to anything Airbus officials have to say in Paris about
the reported A318 rift, and the progress towards turning Airbus
into a single corporate entity.
</P>
<P>
   Another story that will be followed closely at the Paris show is
the proposed A3XX super jumbo jet that Airbus has been talking
about for several years. This is the plane Airbus needs to break
Boeing's stranglehold on jetliners that can carry more than 400
passengers. The A3XX would carry as many as 600 people. But the
development costs are least $10 billion, and perhaps as high as $15
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Boeing decided not to proceed with the
development of a similar-size jumbo jet, arguing the worldwide
market is not big enough to recover the staggering developement
costs. Boeing's latest long-range market forecast, which the
company plans to make public Monday at the air show, reportedly
shows that the market for a super jumbo has declined to fewer than
400 planes, according to a person familiar with the forecast. The
forecast looks at the commercial aircraft market for the next 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   While commercial aviation will make news at Paris, so will the
defense side of the aerospace industry. The airshow opens just days
after NATO's long air war against Yugoslavia ended.
</P>
<P>
   The ear-splitting thunder of fighters will fill the skies daily
over Le Bourget field. Lockheed Martin's F-16 will be at Paris, as
will the Eurofighter and Russian fighters.
</P>
<P>
   But missing from Paris this year will be any fighter with
Boeing's name on it. Because of the air war over Yugoslavia, the
U.S. military could not spare either an F-18 Hornet or an F-15
Eagle, a Boeing spokesman said. Both fighters are built by Boeing
in St. Louis have been used extensively in the air campaign.

 WASHINGTON: electrical power.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The officials said allied warplanes had flown 35,000 missions,
including just under 10,000 bombing runs, dropping 23,000 bombs and
missiles. About a third of these were guided weapons, dropped
largely by B-52 and B-1 bombers against Yugoslav troops in the past
few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic miscalculated badly,'' Shelton said. ``He did not
believe that NATO would carry through on its threat to use air
power, and he surely did not expect that the alliance could sustain
and increase that effort as the operation progressed over the last
79 days.''
</P>
<P>
   The satisfaction and relief were even more evident in an earlier
statement by Clinton in which he thanked various participants in
the military and diplomatic drama of the past month and a half.
``There are so many people to thank,'' he began, borrowing a tone
from awards ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   From his own team, he singled out Vice President Al Gore, who
had the most to fear politically from a conflict that threatened to
stretch into his presidential campaign, but now could claim that he
had contributed to the peace through his camaraderie with the
Russian envoy, Victor Chernomyrdin. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, reportedly the most hawkish administration official on
Kosovo, was praised by Clinton for her ``passionate commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   The president reserved the highest praise for Sandy Berger, the
national security adviser, ``who has barely slept for the last
three months.''
</P>
<P>
   All those he named had come under varying degrees of criticism
for the operation, and in naming them Clinton appeared to be
vindicating their judgment. But while there was general agreement
that Clinton and his lieutenants could feel satisfaction at their
escape from potential disaster, there was no certainty that they
would harvest long-term political benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Already through the jubilation, the critics could be heard. At a
congressional debate on financing the security forces, Republicans
took turns casting aspersions on the claims of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to go in there and do what we have done is
unconscionable,'' said Rep. Randy Cunningham, R-Calif. ``We have
killed civilians. That is not a win. Hundreds of thousands of
people are refugees. That is not a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mark Souder, R-S.C., declared, ``After 11 weeks of bombing
we have a settlement we probably could have achieved at the
beginning. If this is a victory, what would defeat look like?''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Manzullo, R-Ill., said: ``Milosevic is still in power. We
have destroyed a country. This war should never have been
started.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also continuing criticism from experts on foreign
policy, though some acknowledged they had been wrong in their
conviction that bombs alone would not bring Milosevic to heel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would sum it up this way,'' said Leslie Gelb, president of
the Council on Foreign Relations: ``The feeling is the situation
was very bad to begin with, and NATO and the Clinton administration
made it worse, and much to the surprise of the critics, they came
out with a deal far better than anyone expected. But they got it at
a hell of a heavy cost, and because of that, people aren't going to
give President Clinton credit for `success.'''
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon news conference, Cohen said the Defense
Department would request additional spending from Congress to pay
for the 7,000 American troops who are to join the NATO force.
Congress has already approved $5.5 billion in additional spending
through Sept. 30, for the air war only. Some unspent money will go
toward returning American aircraft and troops to their home bases,
and the rest will go toward the cost of the peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   But it will not be enough. Cohen declined to estimate how long
the Americans would remain in Kosovo, but he said it would cost
about $1.5 billion to $2 billion a year, roughly what it costs to
keep the 6,900 American peacekeeping troops still in Bosnia.

R.J. REYNOLDS PLANS DIVIDEND AFTER SEPARATION FROM NABISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To ease the separation anxiety investors may feel
when R.J. Reynolds leaves RJR Nabisco behind, the company is
planning to dispense a generous dividend.
</P>
<P>
   Though RJR has refused to say how big that payout will be, a
tobacco company stock analyst for Goldman, Sachs estimates it will
be $3.25 a share this year. That would be a whopping 9.7 percent
yield based on the when-issued price Thursday of $33.375 a share
for RJR, which has been part of RJR Nabisco for 14 years but will
stand as its own company and its own stock on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Cohen, the Goldman analyst, forecasts about $6.50 a share
in cash earnings at the tobacco company and expects the dividend to
be at least half that amount. ``It's  &UR; very &LR;  generous,'' Cohen said
of the anticipated payout.
</P>
<P>
   The RJR board, which has only filled five of its nine seats
according to a recent securities filing, will meet this summer to
decide the dividend. A company spokeswoman, Maura Payne, would not
comment on Cohen's estimate and said no dividend policy had been
established yet.
</P>
<P>
   A big payout could help soothe jittery investors. The tobacco
giant has been battered by a string of costly settlements and could
be subject to much more litigation, including a lawsuit from the
federal government that President Clinton discussed in his State of
the Union Message.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's estimate puts the payout ahead of that on the 30-year
Treasury bond, now yielding 6.06 percent, and much greater than
that on the average stock in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index,
which is 1.24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It would also be far higher than the 4.17 percent from Philip
Morris. RJR Nabisco now has a 6.34 percent dividend yield, while
Nabisco gives shareholders 1.79 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts expect the spun-off RJR to be a vigorous company,
able to maintain that size payout. Long burdened by billions of
dollars of debt from the 1988 leveraged buyout of RJR Nabisco by
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co., the tobacco company will be
competing against its archrival, Philip Morris, for the first time
with money to spend on marketing its brands, including Camel,
Winston, Salem and Doral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they're on the same playing field, and RJR is definitely
in a position to compete,'' said Emanuel Goldman, a global
consumer-products analyst for Merrill Lynch. ``What you had
previously was Philip Morris in another stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco is also contracting, with plant closings commonplace and
sales volume shrinking. Takeover opportunities have largely dried
up. Thus tobacco companies tend not to face big capital
expenditures, Goldman noted. ``If you don't have the capital
needs,'' he said, ``and you aren't planning to acquire anything, it
makes sense to pay out to your shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   On RJR's books, as the curtain rises, is some $2 billion in cash
left over after RJR Nabisco sold its international division to
Japan Tobacco and paid down $6 billion of debt that had been on
RJR's balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   The $8 billion sale was announced in March, along with the news
that the domestic tobacco division would be spun off. The plan
prompted a brief protest from Carl C. Icahn, RJR Nabisco's biggest
shareholder, who nominated his own board but dropped the effort
before the annual meeting last month.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn said that shareholders would be better off if the Nabisco
food holdings were a separate company, instead of tobacco. He
expressed concern that Nabisco would be subject to future tobacco
lawsuit claims should RJR be unable to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Steven F. Goldstone, the outgoing chief executive of RJR
Nabisco, disputed that suggestion. ``Nabisco would take the point
of view that they were never in the tobacco business,'' he said in
a recent interview in his office, where he has a cabinet for the
Mallomars, Wheat Thins, Lifesavers and other Nabisco brands and a
separate one _ much farther from his desk _ for the cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm separating these businesses for financial and strategic
reasons,'' he said, ``not for legal reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, RJR Nabisco, whose stock symbol was RN, ceases to
exist. The stock rose 56.25 cents Thursday, to $32.3125. The
tobacco company will be traded as RJR, and the holding company
becomes NGH. And whether the promise of a hefty dividend is enough
to guarantee investors' loyalty _ even a dividend described as
``attractive, competitive and sustainable'' in the road show now
making the rounds _ remains to be seen.

WITH CAMBY REJUVENATED, A LOST SEASON IS SAVED  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In late March, with the New York Knicks floundering, Coach Jeff
Van Gundy spoke to his players before a practice in Sacramento,
Calif. The one Knick singled out most for sacrificing playing time
in the name of the team was Marcus Camby, the 24-year-old forward
who privately wondered if he would have a chance to show off his
skills.
</P>
<P>
   If Van Gundy thought he was staving off a young player's
frustration with genuine praise, Camby perceived the coach's words
to mean something totally different. He believed Van Gundy was
stroking his ego for no other reason than to prepare Camby for not
playing more minutes during the team's Western road swing.
</P>
<P>
   The level of mistrust between the two became a prism for the
once-fractured Knicks, who less than two months ago were all on
separate pages.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, with Camby lifting his arms to the Madison Square
Garden rafters and leading their rejuvenation, the Knicks have an
opportunity to become the first eighth-seeded team in league
history to advance to the National Basketball Association finals.
With a 3-games-to-2 lead over Indiana, they can wrap up the Eastern
Conference final and continue their surprising post-season surge.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation of Camby in New York _ from disgruntled role
player to skyscraping star _ is extraordinary and stunning.
Replacing one of the most popular Knicks of the last two decades,
Charles Oakley, Camby was scrutinized and pilloried more than New
Coke.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, the notion that this doe-eyed 7-footer would
emerge as the most terrorizing force in the series seemed
far-fetched. But the disbelief has disappeared as Camby has
scorched the Pacers by averaging 14.2 points, 11 rebounds and 3
blocked shots against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a gift that a lot of us wish we had,'' said Chris
Childs, the Knicks' point guard. ``That age and that height. As
long as he continues to work _ we told him from Day 1 to go as hard
as you can and play the game like you know how to play it _
everything will fall in place.''
</P>
<P>
   How a player noted for poor work ethic and inconsistency in
Toronto developed into an elastic, shot-blocking demon over the
last five months is a tale not only of perseverance, but maturity,
tolerance and, above all, patience.
</P>
<P>
   Camby demonstrated that rare virtue for a young athlete in his
Game 5 demolition of Indiana on Wednesday night, biding his time on
the bench for 10 minutes in the third quarter as Van Gundy waited
to insert him back into the game after a stirring first half in
which he picked up three fouls.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about managing fouls with our big guys as much as we
can,'' Van Gundy said today. ``Certainly, his play warranted him
playing earlier. But I didn't want him to be at risk with four
fouls, because I wanted him to finish.''
</P>
<P>
   He finished with 21 points, 13 rebounds and 6 blocked shots,
leading New York to a 101-94 victory before a stunned and almost
angry crowd at Market Square Arena. Along with Latrell Sprewell,
Allan Houston and Larry Johnson, this kid with arms that go on
forever had pinned their team's best shots against the glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just itching to get back in there,'' Camby said. ``You
always want to get in there and play, but I just have to be patient
like I have done all year. When I got in there, I just wanted to
make the plays.''
</P>
<P>
   When Camby was acquired last June for the popular Oakley, Dave
Checketts, the Madison Square Garden president, said that it was
the most difficult move he had ever made. But Checketts also made a
point to insure his critics that it would ultimately be the right
move, that Camby would be the kind of player to help scale the
emerging power in the East, the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   Checketts, more than anyone, understood how hard that thought
would be for fans to digest. He returned to his Connecticut home
the night of the deal and informed his wife, Deb, that the team had
moved Oakley.
</P>
<P>
   ``You traded Oak?'' Deb asked incredulously. ``What are you,
crazy? He was New York. He was the Knicks. You can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby did not make the adjustment easier when he reported to
training camp in less-than-perfect shape. He quickly became the
flashpoint for a covert feud between the former general manager,
Ernie Grunfeld, and Van Gundy.
</P>
<P>
   Having staked his professional reputation on acquiring Camby for
the workmanlike Oakley, Grunfeld wanted Camby to play more minutes.
Van Gundy wanted Camby to earn those minutes, and refused to
compromise on what he thought was best for the team.
</P>
<P>
   Winning seems to cure all ills, and Camby appears to have set
aside whatever reservations he had about Van Gundy. But there was a
time they spoke infrequently.
</P>
<P>
   Whether there is a lingering residue of resentment is unclear.
Because Camby did not blossom until late in the season, his agent,
Alex Johnson, did not have the leverage to secure the maximum $78
million contract extension for his client this past February.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Camby signed for an incentive-laden deal worth $48
million, $32 million of which is guaranteed. Essentially, by not
waiting to sign in the off season, Camby may have lost about $30
million.
</P>
<P>
   On another level, who is to say how much Camby's perseverance _
proving he belonged and earning his minutes on a playoff-hardened
team _ enriched his development as a player?
</P>
<P>
   Beyond practice wars, he began working long hours with the
conditioning coach, Greg Brittenham, to increase strength, stamina
and flexibility. Soon, all the old labels heaped on Camby in
Toronto _ too soft, too carefree and lack of desire _ began to
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toughest thing for Marcus was when people in the
organization were publicly questioning him,'' said Rick Kaplan, who
serves as Camby's media relations adviser. ``He felt the whole
time, other than Day 1 of training camp, he did everything that was
asked of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then to be asked about Oakley every day, it was tempting
for him to blow up, say something. But he never pouted. Truthfully,
I didn't know if he had it in him. For him to go through all this
and play like he's playing, it's inspirational.''
</P>
<P>
   The gifted physical specimen who single-handedly has rejected
the Pacers over the last 10 days has been a work in progress,
growing, maturing and getting better every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marcus has been great in this series,'' said Van Gundy, who
had little time to work with Camby this season due to the labor
strife between the players and owners. ``I don't know if he's
better than I expected. I really didn't know him as a player.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy added: ``I didn't see him much in Toronto, and the
lockout hurt. The thing that he's done all season is make steady
progress, especially his conditioning. He's felt more comfortable
and gotten more minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he stands one game from the finals, looking taller and more
talented than ever.
</P>
<P>
   There is delicious twist here: The player whom Van Gundy once
had the least amount of faith in became trustworthy enough to help
save the Knicks' season and perhaps the coach's job. &QL;

DEBTS TROUBLING MOSCOW'S MR. FIX-IT
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In a nation where not much seems to work, the
all-powerful mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov, has earned a reputation
as Mr. Fix-it.
</P>
<P>
   After inheriting a grimy Soviet museum piece of a city in 1992,
he has, with plenty of political elbow grease and borrowed money,
turned it into something almost befitting its status as one of
Europe's largest cities. Russians approve, and now Luzhkov is among
the early favorites to succeed Boris Yeltsin as the country's next
president.
</P>
<P>
   And so the conversations unfolding lately between Luzhkov's
aides and some European bankers are far more interesting than the
typical banker-borrower face-off. For transforming Moscow has cost
billions of dollars, and suddenly Luzhkov's can-do government is
having trouble paying the tab.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's immediate troubles come from three German and Swiss
banks that lent the city $200 million in 1997, then quickly got
cold feet. Instead of the leisurely repayment plan initially
envisioned, the banks grasped an escape clause and demanded half
their money back last year, and the rest _ with interest _ by next
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The acting director of the Moscow City Loan Committee, Sergei
Pokhomov, says the city will hand over every cent ``in an orderly
and civilized manner.'' But not by Thursday's deadline. The money
simply isn't there.
</P>
<P>
   The city did make a $23.8 million interest payment on a Eurobond
loan on May 31. Defaults on Eurobonds are almost unheard of; next
to repudiating a nation's sovereign debt, nothing ruins a
government's credit rating faster or for longer.
</P>
<P>
   Pokhomov nevertheless declined to guarantee that the city would
always meet such lofty obligations. ``The only thing I can say is
that there will be a desperate search for money, and I can't
exclude our having certain problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of Luzhkov's political ambitions, this cash crunch
could not have come at a worse time. His well-laid plan was to
breeze to re-election as mayor, then hit the presidential campaign
trail next spring.
</P>
<P>
   But forces opposed to his presidential bid _ among them,
apparently, Yeltsin _ gummed up that strategy last month by
fielding a mayoral opponent, former Prime Minister Sergei
Kiriyenko. Kiriyenko immediately said he would make an issue of
Luszkov's management of Moscow, where, he charged, nothing gets
done without a bribe and the city's finances are suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing as Kiriyenko was in charge when Russia's own economy
collapsed last August, that may not seem a stroke of political
genius. But Kiriyenko may have struck a nerve: Luzhkov's spokesman
was forced to deny rumors that the City Council moved up the
mayoral election to beat a looming default on the city's debt. And
Kiriyenko was far ahead of Luzhkov in a recent poll.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the mayor is to blame can be debated, but there is
little question that Moscow is in a fiscal bind. During Russia's
brief go-go days, the city built and renovated with abandon thanks
to nearly $2 billion in loans from Western banks and investors who,
like Luzhkov, believed the boom would endure. It did not, and now
as the loans come due, Moscow is paying a heavy price.
</P>
<P>
   An example: The $200 million loan European bankers are trying to
reclaim was worth about a billion rubles when Moscow got the money
in 1997. Today, repaying that principal would cost 5 billion
rubles.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, the city might borrow Western currency elsewhere.
But Westerners are so gun-shy of Russia, Pokhomov says, that they
are already snatching back their old loans.
</P>
<P>
   The city could simply walk away from the loan, but only to its
own ruination. Much of Moscow's foreign debt, including $1 billion
in Eurobonds, contains clauses allowing other lenders to call their
loans should the city stiff even one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody seems to know how likely default is, because nobody
outside Luzhkov's aides has a complete grasp of Moscow's finances.
His unique approach to budgeting includes a public accounting for
many run-of-the-mill expenses, but conceals the rest _ perhaps 40
percent of all spending _ in a rat's nest of accounts he often
personally controls.
</P>
<P>
   That unaccountable cash helped Luzhkov jump-start Moscow's
economy _ and create new streams of revenue _ by putting city
property and money into an empire of construction projects and
businesses. The city has stakes in 500 Moscow companies and
controls nearly 200 of them outright
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear how many of those investments have soured since
last August's fiscal collapse, because most of their books are not
open.
</P>
<P>
   The elegant underground mall opposite the Kremlin, which soaked
up $425 million in city money, has shifted from upscale shops to
less classy retailing. Outside experts say it has been a drain on
the city treasury, though city officials disagree.
</P>
<P>
   The Zil truck plant in Moscow, beneficiary of some $60 million
in loans, employs 23,000 workers and, according to The Moscow
Times, produced less than one truck per employee in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   And the Bank of Moscow lost $250 million _ more than a quarter
of its assets _ when the August crash rendered government bonds
worthless.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Moscow City Council's budget committee,
Michael Vyshegorodtsev, said in an interview that the Council was
determined to take more direct control of the off-the-books
accounts. But he said that fiscal collapse has not made the city's
many businesses unprofitable, ``just less profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscow will need whatever profits it can find to pay the
mountain of debt facing it in the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   In written answers to questions, city officials said last month
that Moscow has made $255 million in loan payments since the crash
last August, not including May's Eurobond payment. Two more
Eurobond interest payments, totaling about $40 million, are due in
November.
</P>
<P>
   All told, domestic and foreign loan payments comprise a
manageable 10 percent or so of the 1999 city budget of 73 billion
rubles, or $3 billion. But that does not account for inflation,
more than 20 percent so far this year, which would raise the cost
of loan repayments and government services alike.
</P>
<P>
   The city clearly feels the pinch. Spending for items like
building restorations and traffic lights has been slashed, and the
next budget will be even tighter.
</P>
<P>
   From a political point of view _ no small matter to a
presidential hopeful _ there may not be a lot of choice. Luzhkov
already has had to put his populist image at risk, boosting rents,
utility rates and the sales tax to replace revenue lost to the
economic downturn. Once he could have looked to his mentor Yeltsin
for help.
</P>
<P>
   But that relationship has soured, and political experts now say
the president could make the mayor's life even harder by moving the
headquarters of big city taxpayers, like the nation's gas and
electricity monopolies, out of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard enough for a Muscovite to become president in Russia,
where the power and wealth of the capital city are almost
universally envied and resented. Should Moscow tumble from its
fiscal pinnacle into the swamp of Tatarstans and Yakutias, which
borrowed a lot and can pay only a little, there may be no return
for Luzhkov.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even those people who hate him as a Muscovite still tend to
say, `If he was able to do this for Moscow, maybe he'll be able to
do the same for us,''' said Masha Lipman, the deputy editor of the
weekly news magazine Itogi. ``He wants the election to be held as
soon as possible _ before the economy collapses.''
</P>
<P>
   That race may go down to the wire. Moscow's largest foreign-debt
payment ever _ a whopping $500 million Eurobond payoff _ is set for
May 31, 2000. Russia's presidential election will take place the
next month.

 &HT;    Pilot hurt slightly as plane noses into house

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ As Sylvia Graham sat in her television
room Thursday morning reading a newspaper story about the best of
the high-school graduating class, she heard a loud boom.
</P>
<P>
   She had been planning to go back to bed to sleep off a sinus
infection. Instead, dressed in her pink pastel housecoat and
cream-colored nightgown, she stepped outside to see whether
lightning had struck her home.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, 77, found a bleeding woman walking from a crashed Cessna
182 that was pressed up against her house near Lantana.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Eikenberg of West Palm Beach asked to use a phone to
call her husband, Terry. He's a paramedic, she said. Graham took
one look at Eikenberg and invited the stranger into her home,
offering a towel to wipe off her cuts. Graham later chuckled and
said, ``Who would expect an airplane in their house at 9 in the
morning?''
</P>
<P>
   Eikenberg, 42, a student pilot, was taking a practice solo
flight from the Lantana Airport. Shortly after taking off, she
radioed the airport with electrical problems, airport officials
said. Her power cut out, and the engine sputtered in the plane that
she owned with her husband.
</P>
<P>
   She tried to land on the runway twice, but the power problems
prevented the landings. She then planned to glide the plane to an
empty field between Interstate 95 and Lantana Road.
</P>
<P>
   But the plane clipped a power line and a palm tree over Lake
Bass Circle. The line fell to the ground, knocking out power to the
area for more than an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The Cessna dived into Graham's yard. It nearly pulled an
aluminum awning off a window and moved one of the front porch's
steel posts almost 6 inches. But the nose did not break through the
front wall.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 40 gallons of gas dripped from the plane onto the grass,
said Nigel Baker, Palm Beach County Fire-Rescue battalion chief.
</P>
<P>
   With gas on the ground and an electrical wire down, rescue
officials worked quickly to prevent an explosion. They sprayed the
plane and covered the ground with a neutralizing foam. They also
evacuated three neighboring homes until the power line was fixed
and the plane removed.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors, mainly women and children, spilled into the street to
see what was behind the police tape and emergency vehicles'
flashing lights. They later joked about who heard the crash and who
slept through it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up with a fireman in the front living room,'' said Toni
Harris, who lives next to Graham. She and her daughter had slept
through the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Atkinson had peeked out her kitchen window as she
cleaned and saw the unmistakable plane's tail facing her home. The
response from the 911 operator: Are you sure it's a plane?
</P>
<P>
   Looking at Eikenberg's brown and white plane with a broken left
wing and a crumpled nose, rescue workers called her lack of serious
injuries amazing. She was treated at JFK Medical Center. She could
not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``By keeping the plane under control and flying at a very low
speed, she was able to minimize the damage,'' said J. Steve Marlowe
of the Lantana Airport Aircraft Pilots Association.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Aviation Administration Officials started preliminary
investigations Thursday for the FAA and the National Transportation
Safety Board, said Tim Monville, an NTSB investigator.
</P>
<P>
   Workers from the Lantana Airport towed the plane away from
Graham's home, and rescue workers reopened Lake Bass Circle to
traffic about five hours after the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the afternoon, Sylvia Graham, still wearing her
floor-length robe, returned home with her husband, Walker. She was
looking forward to going back to bed.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
INDIANAPOLIS _ The New York Knicks have talked about it since the
final buzzer sounded Wednesday on their 101-94 victory over the
Indiana Pacers in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That win at Market Square Arena gave the Knicks a 3-2 lead in
the best-of-seven series, and they can wrap things up tonight at
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   However, in their only previous shot at closing out a playoff
series at home this postseason, the Knicks lost Game 4 of the first
round to the Heat and had to finish the job by winning the deciding
game at Miami Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks say they have learned their lesson and are
concentrating on winning tonight's game, for more than the obvious
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mistake we made after Game 3 against Miami is the mindset
that we don't want to go back to Miami,'' said Knicks coach Jeff
Van Gundy. ``That shouldn't be. We shouldn't focus on what we don't
want, but what we want. All we want to do is get to the Finals, get
a chance to play San Antonio, get a chance to win the championship.
That's the biggest mental factor _ focus on what we want and not
what we don't want.''
</P>
<P>
   It took a last-second runner by Allan Houston to polish off the
perenially underachieving Heat, and the Knicks, the No. 8 seed in
the East, have used that shot as a springboard to where they are
now _ one game from the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to win it for the fans at home _ they've been very
supportive, especially for myself, coming from everything I had
gone through in the past,'' Latrell Sprewell said. ``They've been
there for me. I would like to finish it off there in front of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine how the New York fans feel. The Knicks won Game 3 at
Madison Square Garden, but it took a play that bordered on the
miraculous _ a four-point play by Larry Johnson _ to eke out the
victory. The Pacers responded by dominating Game 4, cruising to a
12-point win, so the Knicks are anything but comfortable at home.
</P>
<P>
   Especially because they must play without center Patrick Ewing,
who tore his left Achilles' tendon and will watch tonight's game _
and the rest of the playoffs _ from the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great opportunity _ we're one away from the Finals,''
Kurt Thomas said. ``That's all we're thinking about. We're not
thinking negatively. And we definitely don't want to come back
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did coach Larry Bird and the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   For Indiana, the conference finals have been one missed
opportunity after another _ and plenty of missed shots. And now the
Pacers, who were the favorites in the East after taking the Bulls
to seven games in last year's conference finals, are on the verge
of being eliminated by a most unlikely opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a situation we want to be in, but that's the way it
is,'' Bird said after losing Game 5. ``We played two very good
games in New York last time. I'm very confident we'll give the
maximum effort. It's going to be tough. The only thing is, we have
to have everybody play. It's very disappointing that in a game like
this (Game 5), for some reason some of our guys just didn't play.''
</P>
<P>
   The name Rik Smits comes to mind. Smits is playing with
chronically sore feet and a broken toe on his left foot, but that
doesn't explain the struggles he has endured. Foul problems have
limited Smits to just 20 minutes per game, and he has scored more
than 12 points just once in the series. Worse, the 7-4 center has
been outrebounded by 6-3 point guard Mark Jackson (27-19).
</P>
<P>
   Those problems came to a head Wednesday, when the Pacers had a
chance to go a game up on the Knicks. Smits hit just one of his
first 10 shots and finished 4-of-14 from the field, scoring only
eight points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Bird said. ``I have no answers. I really
thought Rik would come out and have a big game (Wednesday). It
didn't happen, and I don't know why.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither do his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big part of our success,'' Jackson said of Smits. ``We
need him to score and to be a presence down low. That's when we're
at our best.''
</P>
<P>
   Smits shrugs when pressed about his problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get passive, I end up not playing well at all,'' Smits
said. ``It really hasn't seemed to make much of a difference this
year. If I get fouls, I don't play well. If I don't get any fouls,
I haven't been playing all that well.''
</P>
<P>
   And one game from advancing to the NBA Finals, the Knicks hope
that trend continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an impossible dream two months ago,'' Herb Williams
said. ``We've proven to be a pretty good team after all.''

IN PICKING TEAM, MRS, CLINTON AGREES WITH MAYOR 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Now she's really hit a nerve.
</P>
<P>
   If Hillary Rodham Clinton was looking for a way to get under
Rudolph Giuliani's skin, she may have found it Thursday. She
claimed lifelong allegiance to the New York Yankees, the mayor's
hometown team; pulled a Yankees cap over her hair, and used the
power of her current out-of-town address to pose with the Bronx
Bombers on her own turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, I've always been a Yankees fan,'' the first lady,
who was born and bred in Chicago, asserted Thursday morning to
Katie Couric on NBC's ``Today Show'' in anticipation of the
championship team's visit to the White House Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   When the puzzled Ms. Couric said she thought Mrs. Clinton was a
lifelong Chicago Cubs fan, the first lady, in a classic Clintonian
gesture, quickly claimed loyalty to the Cubs, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a Cubs fan,'' said Mrs. Clinton, who threw out the first
pitch at Wrigley Field in Chicago on opening day in 1994. ``But I
needed an American League team because when you're from Chicago,
you cannot root for both the Cubs and the Sox. I mean, there's a
dividing line that you can't cross there. So as a young girl, I
became very interested and enamored of the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, who has portrayed himself as the reigning No. 1
Yankees fan, was gracious upon hearing of Mrs. Clinton's comments,
of course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be more than happy to teach anybody in the White House
about the history of the Yankees, or go over statistics with
them,'' the mayor told reporters at New York City Hall when asked
if his team was betraying him for a White House photo opportunity
with the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Show them where Yankee Stadium is located, where Shea Stadium
is located,'' the mayor continued, warming to the possibilities.
``I could take them through things. Or we could discuss, `Where
were you when Reggie Jackson hit three home runs to win the 1977
World Series?' I was at Yankee Stadium. Or, `Where were you when
the Yankees won the 1996 World Series at home?' Gee, I was there.
Or, um, `Who do you think was a better center fielder _ Joe
DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle, Bernie Williams?' Things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he hit on what he seemed to think was the best idea of all:
``Under the right set of circumstances,'' the mayor posited, ``we
could even have a debate about this.''
</P>
<P>
   They might compare photo ops. Giuliani could show scores of
pictures of himself, including one from earlier this month at
DiMaggio's funeral at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York, where he
sat with George M. Steinbrenner III, the Yankees' principal owner,
and Yogi Berra, the legendary catcher and former manager.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady could show her pictures from, well, Thursday,
also with Steinbrenner and the whole team arrayed in front of the
White House's gleaming white South Portico, which was ringed with
red geraniums.
</P>
<P>
   And herself in her cap.
</P>
<P>
   In the clearest sign yet that Mrs. Clinton intends to run for
the U.S. Senate from New York, she gleefully donned a Yankees cap,
ignoring one of the principal rules of politics: Never wear the
hat. Politicians are given hats all the time; the smart ones just
grin and do not put them on because they usually look too silly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going to relish this moment together,'' Mrs.
Clinton, who almost never attends sports-related events at the
White House, told a lawnful of fans as she scrapped her prepared
remarks. She introduced Steinbrenner, thanking him for ``standing
up for this franchise'' and ``helping to create one of the greatest
baseball teams of all time.''
</P>
<P>
   The players were charmed but not fooled. Asked if the mayor or
the first lady was a bigger Yankees fan, Dave Cone, the pitcher,
told reporters: ``Mayor Giuliani has the edge. He's been a lifelong
fan.'' Of the Clintons, he said: ``We welcome them with open arms.
We'll show them Yankee Stadium any time.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the first lady's declaration of her lifetime loyalty to
the Yankees came as a bit of a surprise. As recently as Saturday,
she was neutral, ducking the question of whether she would root for
the Yankees or the Mets. She said the ``politic'' answer was that
she would root for both.

   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO suspended its bombing of Yugoslavia on
Thursday after Yugoslav troops began withdrawing from Kosovo,
halting an assault that rained 23,000 bombs and missiles on
Yugoslavia without losing the life of a single NATO fighter.
</P>
<P>
   The halt in the bombing after 78 days set the stage for the U.N.
Security Council's swift approval of a resolution that permits
50,000 international peacekeepers to move in to help more than a
million ethnic-Albanian refugees driven out of Kosovo to try to
return.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's secretary-general, Javier Solana, announced the
suspension of the bombing in midafternoon European time _ morning
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would urge all parties to the conflict to seize this
opportunity for peace,'' he said, adding that the moment was a
result of allied determination and intense diplomacy by many
countries, including Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Allied leaders on both sides of the Atlantic were restrained in
claiming victory in a fight that took a toll not only on the Serbs
and Kosovars, but also at times on the allies themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to finish the job and build the peace,'' President
Clinton said Thursday, while Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain
said, ``I feel no sense of triumph now, only the knowledge that our
cause was just and rightly upheld.''
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac of France said, ``A page has been
turned in the conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   With their approval and that of other allied leaders, Solana
halted the bombing after Gen. Wesley Clark, the supreme allied
commander in Europe, confirmed that the withdrawal of 40,000
soldiers, police officers and paramilitary units had begun at
midday.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred Yugoslav army military trucks bearing soldiers
clogged the road north from Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, on
Thursday, more than 12 hours after Yugoslav military commanders
agreed to allied terms with the commander of the peacekeeping force
in Macedonia on Wednesday night. Allied commanders swore vigilance
to make sure the Yugoslav forces lived up to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, in his first address
to his people regarding the conflict with NATO, did not claim
victory for the government on Thursday, but instead thanked
ordinary citizens for their contributions and sacrifices. In the
televised address, he said, ``The aggression is over, happy peace
to us all.''
</P>
<P>
   The first deployment of NATO peacekeeping troops had been
scheduled for Friday, but it will probably be delayed until
Saturday because Yugoslav forces have encountered difficulties in
carrying out their withdrawal, Western officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs are having trouble getting their equipment out,'' a
senior Western official said. ``Their equipment is broken and out
of fuel'' and they need more time to clear the road of mines. The
official said the Serbs were afraid of moving at night because they
fear the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Once bombs were no longer falling _ a condition Russia, China
and France had set for a Security Council vote _ the Council
reconvened in New York City Thursday and quickly approved a
resolution that had been worked out earlier this week in Cologne,
Germany, by the European allies, the United States, Russia, Canada
and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The vote Thursday morning, 14-0 with one abstention, China's,
put Kosovo under international civilian control and placed the
peacekeeping force under U.N. authority.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson of Britain, the force commander, was
set to start leading the 18,500 European and American soldiers in
Macedonia into Kosovo. NATO ambassadors met again Thursday night
and approved an operation order clearing the way for the move,
which is expected eventually to involve a total of around 50,000
troops, mostly Europeans from allied and other countries, with
about 7,000 Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops, expected to number about 2,500, could also join
if Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and American military
negotiators who met Russian officers in Moscow on Thursday could
work out command arrangements for them.
</P>
<P>
   Russia was vehemently opposed to the NATO bombing and says it
will not put its troops under the alliance's orders.
</P>
<P>
   Allied warplanes flew their last 82 strike missions on
Wednesday, the allied command said, but will continue flying
reconnaissance missions to monitor the Yugoslav withdrawal, which
is to be completed within 11 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence or noncompliance by any party will not be
tolerated,'' Solana warned. But he said that the alliance and other
international organizations would now try to help all the ethnic
groups of Kosovo, including the Serbs, to build a society free of
the repression that had spawned the conflict in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing campaign sorely tested and profoundly transformed
the 50-year-old alliance, which never fired a shot in anger during
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   In the end it was diplomacy, by Western powers and by Russia,
that tipped the balance, convincing President Slobodan Milosevic
that he had no choice but to accede to international demands and
make peace in Kosovo. Now the alliance has taken on the challenge
of keeping the peace, a challenge that may prove even more
difficult than waging the air war.
</P>
<P>
   Preserving unity among 19 allies during more than two months of
a bombing campaign was a formidable task, one that allied diplomats
from several countries said Solana had handled with diplomatic
skill.
</P>
<P>
   From Britain, which alone among the allies argued for
preparations for an invasion of Kosovo with ground troops to force
Milosevic to accept their will, to Greece, where opposition was
strong to using force against a fellow Orthodox Christian nation,
the allies constantly questioned the air war strategy, but never
could agree on anything better.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Solana always insisted, NATO's air war was about
human values, about 21st-century Europe not tolerating the
throwback to 20th-century totalitarian brutality that the allies
said Milosevic's ``ethnic cleansing'' in Kosovo represented.
</P>
<P>
   In this, NATO had public opinion behind it on most of the
Continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Milosevic didn't reckon with,'' a European diplomat at
NATO said, ``was the effect on public opinion of seeing all those
hundreds of thousands of refugees streaming out of Kosovo. It
reminded all Europeans of the scenes they had seen during World War
II and caused immediate and long-lasting revulsion.''

<P>
</P>
<P>
   NATO's bombing took the highest toll on Serbia, where Milosevic
addressed his compatriots on television after the bombing ended
Thursday and called for unity to rebuild the country.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, foreign
ministers of the world's seven largest industrial democracies plus
Russia met with Balkans leaders in Cologne, Germany, on Thursday
and agreed to commit money and effort to a stability pact.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Schroeder Plan,'' which European leaders say could cost $5
billion to $6 billion a year for many years, aims at raising all
the Balkans to an economic and social level on a par with the rest
of Europe, in an effort to make another war there, after a decade
of ethnic conflict, as unthinkable as it is now in France, Britain
or Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europe cannot be fully secure unless its southeast corner is
free from strife,'' Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said in
Cologne on Thursday, warning Milosevic against putting political or
military pressure on Montenegro, another constituent republic of
Yugoslavia, whose leaders did not support his attacks in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Now NATO hopes its relationship with Russia can slowly begin to
recover from the damage it suffered from the bombing campaign. It
began to improve after President Boris Yeltsin named former Prime
Minister Victor Chernomyrdin as a special envoy on Yugoslavia last
month, but Russian officials have refused to attend regular
meetings at the alliance headquarters since the bombing began on
24.

 WASHINGTON: electrical power.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The officials said allied warplanes had flown 35,000 missions,
including just under 10,000 bombing runs, dropping 23,000 bombs and
missiles. About a third of these were guided weapons, dropped
largely by B-52 and B-1 bombers against Yugoslav troops in the past
few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic miscalculated badly,'' Shelton said. ``He did not
believe that NATO would carry through on its threat to use air
power, and he surely did not expect that the alliance could sustain
and increase that effort as the operation progressed over the last
79 days.''
</P>
<P>
   The satisfaction and relief were even more evident in an earlier
statement by Clinton in which he thanked various participants in
the military and diplomatic drama of the past month and a half.
``There are so many people to thank,'' he began, borrowing a tone
from awards ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   From his own team, he singled out Vice President Al Gore, who
had the most to fear politically from a conflict that threatened to
stretch into his presidential campaign, but now could claim that he
had contributed to the peace through his camaraderie with the
Russian envoy, Victor Chernomyrdin. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, reportedly the most hawkish administration official on
Kosovo, was praised by Clinton for her ``passionate commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   The president reserved the highest praise for Sandy Berger, the
national security adviser, ``who has barely slept for the last
three months.''
</P>
<P>
   All those he named had come under varying degrees of criticism
for the operation, and in naming them Clinton appeared to be
vindicating their judgment. But while there was general agreement
that Clinton and his lieutenants could feel satisfaction at their
escape from potential disaster, there was no certainty that they
would harvest long-term political benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Already through the jubilation, the critics could be heard. At a
congressional debate on financing the security forces, Republicans
took turns casting aspersions on the claims of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to go in there and do what we have done is
unconscionable,'' said Rep. Randy Cunningham, R-Calif. ``We have
killed civilians. That is not a win. Hundreds of thousands of
people are refugees. That is not a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mark Souder, R-S.C., declared, ``After 11 weeks of bombing
we have a settlement we probably could have achieved at the
beginning. If this is a victory, what would defeat look like?''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Manzullo, R-Ill., said: ``Milosevic is still in power. We
have destroyed a country. This war should never have been
started.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also continuing criticism from experts on foreign
policy, though some acknowledged they had been wrong in their
conviction that bombs alone would not bring Milosevic to heel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would sum it up this way,'' said Leslie Gelb, president of
the Council on Foreign Relations: ``The feeling is the situation
was very bad to begin with, and NATO and the Clinton administration
made it worse, and much to the surprise of the critics, they came
out with a deal far better than anyone expected. But they got it at
a hell of a heavy cost, and because of that, people aren't going to
give President Clinton credit for `success.'''
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon news conference, Cohen said the Defense
Department would request additional spending from Congress to pay
for the 7,000 American troops who are to join the NATO force.
Congress has already approved $5.5 billion in additional spending
through Sept. 30, for the air war only. Some unspent money will go
toward returning American aircraft and troops to their home bases,
and the rest will go toward the cost of the peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   But it will not be enough. Cohen declined to estimate how long
the Americans would remain in Kosovo, but he said it would cost
about $1.5 billion to $2 billion a year, roughly what it costs to
keep the 6,900 American peacekeeping troops still in Bosnia.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Computer researchers Thursday reported a
malicious computer program that is spreading rapidly through the
Internet, attacking Microsoft's e-mail programs and destroying
documents created by popular Microsoft software programs, including
Word, Powerpoint, Excel and other applications.
</P>
<P>
   A number of large corporations, including Boeing, A.T.&AMP;T. and
General Electric, said they had computers infected by the program
and moved to limit the damage, in some cases by shutting down their
e-mail systems. Employees of Microsoft, Intel and the anti-virus
software maker Symantec said they had also been hit.
</P>
<P>
   The program, a form of computer attack known as a worm, shows up
an an e-mail attachment. It held the potential to be far more
dangerous than the Melissa computer virus, which spread rapidly in
March as a sort of e-mail chain letter but was not designed to
destroy files.
</P>
<P>
   The new program is known as a worm rather than a virus because
it able to transmit itself through the Internet under its own
power. In contrast viruses spread by hitchhiking by attaching to
documents, programs or disks.
</P>
<P>
   The program, began spreading Wednesday in Europe and the United
States. Several anti-virus software companies said they believed
that the program had originated in Israel, because the first sample
had been discovered in that country.
</P>
<P>
   At AT&AMP;T's headquarters in Basking Ridge, N.J., the company
intercom broadcast an alert at lunch time warning employees that
the program was spreading and a spokesman said he believed that
several hundred computers had been infected within the building.
</P>
<P>
   At the Intel Corp., the program was first discovered during the
day at the company's development facility in Israel and computer
administrators severed networks linking the company to Europe and
the United States to halt the spread of the program, according to
an internal company memo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gone and past, it's a great tornado that zoomed through
and left,'' said Pam Wickham, a spokeswoman at General Electric.
She said the company had been warned on Wednesday and that
anti-virus software had been quickly distributed, minimizing the
impact.
</P>
<P>
   The worm e-mail is particularly dangerous, anti-virus experts
said, because it contains the message: ``I received your e-mail and
I shall send you a reply ASAP. Till then, take a look at the
attached zipped docs. Bye.''
</P>
<P>
   One employee at an e-commerce firm said two of her colleagues
encountered the virus Thursday morning, with one employee losing
all files on his hard drive. The attachment apparently came from an
employee of Microsoft, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The worm is transmitted by Microsoft e-mail programs and uses
those programs' features to spread itself to other computer users
who have sent e-mail messages from the infected machine. Microsoft
officials said they were aware of the attack and were gathering
information on it. During a day a number of anti-virus companies
updated their programs and posted scanning utilities to their web
sites to fend off the attack.
</P>
<P>
   However, anti-virus experts said that the program was difficult
to detect and that the best defense was for computer users to
resist opening electronic mail attachments from strangers.
</P>
<P>
   The worm preys on Microsoft e-mail programs like Outlook,
Outlook Express and Exchange, and other programs that use a
Microsoft protocol called MAPI. It uses those programs' features to
spread itself to other computer users who send mail messages to the
infected machine. The program which comes in an innocuous file
identified as zip_files.exe is an example of a kind of attack known
as a Trojan Horse because it fools computer users into executing a
malicious program by opening the attached mail document.
</P>
<P>
   The program then creates another file named explore.exe that is
launched every time the infected computer is restarted.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of ``social engineering'' relies on the gullability of
computer users who are lulled into believing that the program has
actually been sent as a reply from the person who they recently
sent an electronic mail message.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Explore worm is even worse because you get it from someone
you know,'' said David Chess, a research staff member at the Watson
Research Laboratory in Hawthorne, N.Y. ``People are going to be
lulled into to thinking it is OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the worm establishes itself on a computer, it
systematically searches for documents created by the three programs
that are part of the Microsoft Office Suite, Word, Excel and
Powerpoint as well as some programmers' files and erases them.
</P>
<P>
   Word is the world's most widely used word processing software
and Excel is the most widely used spreadsheet program. PowerPoint
is software for creating graphical business presentations on a
computer screen.

</P>
<P>
   Thursday, experts at anti-virus firms said the new program
represented a disturbing trend in the virus underground which
appears to be developing more lethal programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last few weeks we've begun to see attempts by virus
writers to combine the rapidly spread capability of the Melissa
program with a more destructive payload,'' said Wes Wasson,
director of security product marketing at Network Associates, a
Silicon Valley software developer. He said he expected to see a
number of copycat programs in the future as virus writers attempt
to mimick the Explore program.
</P>
<P>
   Network Associates has recently established ``risk assessment''
guidelines for gauging the danger of new malicious programs and
</P>
<P>
   Wasson said the company had assigned the Explore worm a ``high''
rating, its most threatening category because of its destructive
ability.
</P>
<P>
   The new program is known as a worm rather than a virus because
it able to transmit itself through the Internet under its own
power.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``worm'' was coined by science fiction author John
Brunner in his novel Shockwave Rider. In the novel, worms were
programs created by a rebel group that helped destroy an oppressive
computer network.
</P>
<P>
   Although the new Explore worm does not have the ability to
spread as quickly as the Melissa virus, it still has the capability
to quickly proliferate because an infected machine attempts to
infect any other computer that it receives mail from, computer
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worm has the ability to create a ping pong effect,'' said
Wasson.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Computer Emergency Response Team at Carnegie
Mellon University in Pittsburgh said Thursday that they were still
assessing the situation and had not decided whether they would
release an alert.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still trying to understand the scope of the problem a
little better,'' said Shawn Hernan, a CERT security expert. He said
that by late in the afternoon on Thursday the security organization
had received only ten reports of worm infections, however, he said
that the program had spread rapidly at the afflicted organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday a number of virus experts said they were puzzled by the
recent destructive bent within the virus writing community. Many of
the programs in the past have been written as a form of cybernetic
graffiti and are annoying but do not do physical damage.
</P>
<P>
   However, a program such as the Explore worm has the power to
destroy years of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine what these people who write these programs are
thinking,'' said Chess, the IBM researcher.

MICROSOFT AGAIN DUELS WITH WEB BROWSER WITNESS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the government's final witness on the stand in
federal court Thursday afternoon, lawyers for the Microsoft Corp.
were obviously eager for an opportunity to mount a demonstration of
how it was impossible to remove the company's World Wide Web
browser from its Windows 98 operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demonstration is so dramatic that I think you will
appreciate it,'' Steven Holley, a Microsoft lawyer, told a clearly
amused Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   `` Holley really wants to run this program,'' the judge said
with a smile and a shake of the head. So he told the witness,
Edward W. Felten, a Princeton University computer scientist, to
``click on whatever he tells you to click on,'' using the laptop
computer Holley had supplied.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was a program that Felten had written to strip Windows
of its Web-browsing capability _ something Microsoft insists cannot
be done. Central to this antitrust case is the government's
assertion that Microsoft included its Internet Explorer Web browser
with Windows to trump its main competitor in the browser business,
Netscape Communications, now part of America Online.
</P>
<P>
   When Felten first appeared as a government witness in December,
he showed that his removal program could easily eliminate the
browsing function from Windows. But Microsoft argued that all he
had done was to hide it. Microsoft's effort a few weeks later to
debunk Felten's testimony using videotaped demonstrations was
riddled with errors and misleading assertions that turned it into a
courtroom embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Felten offered a new removal program that he said
repaired some flaws Microsoft had pointed up in the original. As
required, he had given Microsoft an advance copy of it, and the
company again set out to debunk it.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft representatives bought a Toshiba laptop computer at a
local store. They placed it on the witness stand with Felten,
hooked up a phone line and asked him to run his removal program.
</P>
<P>
   Felten objected, asserting that Toshiba had loaded a dozen
additional programs on the machine, including some that offered
Internet access. ``There's more than one browser on this machine,''
he said. `My program is not intended to run on this configuration.
Whatever behavior Holley is asking me to create, I don't know what
effect all of this will have on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the trial, this sort of assertion would have been
likely to bring an angry reaction from the judge. But often now, as
testimony winds toward a close, Jackson seems simply amused by the
foibles of the lawyers and witnesses. So he asked Felten to
proceed, in a manner suggesting that none of it was likely have
much effect on the case.
</P>
<P>
   With the browser theoretically removed, Holley asked Felten to
press the control key and the N key _ a combination that brings up
a new Window in Microsoft programs. When he did, Internet Explorer
appeared on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Felten appeared momentarily flustered but recovered quickly,
saying: ``I don't what happened; this is a context in which the
removal is not supposed to be run. But in any case, you have just
demonstrated a bug; that's all.`
</P>
<P>
   Holley gleefully responded, ``It's a pretty big bug, isn't it.''
After a few minutes of back-and-forth, the judge noted, ``I think
you have both made your points; I don't think further experiments
are going to change the minds of either of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courtroom later, David Boies, the government's lead
trial lawyer, said, ``If you have two or more browsers on the
machine, and you remove one browser, that leaves one or more
browsers on the machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Holley countered, ``The demonstration would have come out
exactly the same way on a virgin machine. None of this changes one
teeny-weeny bit the fact that all this guy is doing is hiding the
browser.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, Felten had found flaws in many of Microsoft's
arguments for tying the browser to Windows, suggesting that
Microsoft's behavior often contradicts its words.
</P>
<P>
   Steven C. Holtzman, a government lawyer, recalled the testimony
of James Allchin, a senior Microsoft executive, who said it was
extraordinarily important to outside software developers writing
programs for Windows to know that the browser was already there so
they would not have to ship a copy with their programs.
</P>
<P>
   But Felten pointed out that half a dozen Microsoft programs,
like Money and Front Page, are shipped with Internet Explorer
included. Jackson asked him, ``Why do they do it?''
</P>
<P>
   Among the tens of million of personal computers in use, Felten
said, many different versions of Internet Explorer are installed _
or no version at all. As a result, no software developer _ not even
Microsoft _ can assume it is there.

 HMOs WARNED ON RECRUITING ONLY FIT MEDICARE CLIENTS  
 (af)  
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For years, federal officials say, they have heard
reports that health maintenance organizations try to recruit
healthy elderly people by marketing insurance at sports clubs,
dance halls and places inaccessible to the sick and disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, in a new policy statement, the federal government
demanded a halt to such practices. And it threatened to fine HMOs
that skimped on necessary care.
</P>
<P>
   June Gibbs Brown, inspector general of the Department of Health
and Human Services, issued a compliance manual for HMOs explaining
how they can police themselves to prevent violations of Medicare
fraud and abuse laws. Similar standards will apply to Medicaid, the
health program for low-income people.
</P>
<P>
   In the compliance manual the government said it was ``very
concerned about the practice known as cherry-picking, or selective
marketing,'' by which HMOs try to sign up healthy patients while
discouraging enrollment of the sick and disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown also expressed concern about the accuracy of data
submitted to the government.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said some HMOs delayed reporting a patient's
death in order to continue receiving monthly Medicare payments.
Likewise, they said, some HMOs receive inflated payments because
they report incorrectly that some patients are in nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   An HMO gets $1,200 to $1,400 a month for a nursing home resident
compared with $500 for an average Medicare patient.
</P>
<P>
   In paying HMOs, Medicare assumes that they will enroll a
representative mix of elderly people. But if an HMOs patients are
healthier than the average, the government says, the plan's costs
will be lower, and Medicare will overpay.
</P>
<P>
   HMOs deny that they avoid sick patients. But there is an immense
financial incentive for them to do so. The most expensive 5 percent
of Medicare beneficiaries cost almost as much as the remaining 95
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown said it was inappropriate for HMOs to ``target
healthier beneficiaries'' _ for example, by marketing their plans
in health clubs or on the upper floors of buildings with no
elevators.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, an HMO can be fined up to $100,000 if it is
found to have discouraged the enrollment of Medicare beneficiaries
because of their anticipated need for medical services. In
addition, a health plan may be fined up to $25,000 if it fails to
provide medically necessary services covered by Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, one HMO settled a case for $50,000 after
confirming that its marketing director had told his staff that the
company was enrolling too many sick people. Another HMO paid
$250,000 to settle charges that it had denied certain benefits to
Medicare patients.
</P>
<P>
   Karen M. Ignagni, president of the American Association of
Health Plans, which represents the managed-care industry, said:
``We welcome the guidance from the inspector general. But we
completely reject the caricature of HMOs as marketing only to
healthy individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, Ms. Ignagni said, health plans have many
patients with serious illnesses, and federal Medicare payments are
so inadequate that many HMOs are pulling out of the government
program.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, federal investigators have focused on overpayments in
the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program. But Thursday they
said they were stepping up investigations of HMOs, which get $35
billion a year to care for more than six million Medicare
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   D. McCarty Thornton, chief counsel to the inspector general,
said HMOs must not ask Medicare beneficiaries about their medical
condition before allowing them to enroll. Also, Thornton said, it
is improper for a Medicare HMO to conduct a special campaign to
re-enroll former subscribers who had low medical costs.
</P>
<P>
   John T. Bentivoglio, a Justice Department official, said federal
prosecutors were investigating ``the selective enrollment of
relatively healthy beneficiaries, to keep costs low, and
allegations of health plans' causing the disenrollment of
beneficiaries requiring expensive care.''
</P>
<P>
   In its compliance guide, unveiled Thursday at a conference of
health care lawyers and auditors, the government offered this
advice:
</P>
<P>
   _ Each HMO should have a written compliance program, a
compliance officer and a special telephone line to receive
complaints from employees, doctors and patients about possible
fraud and misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   _ An HMO should distribute copies of its compliance policies to
all employees, doctors and independent contractors who may be
affected. Some HMOs have contracts with tens of thousands of
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   _ HMOs may use their own employees to recruit subscribers, but
should not hire outsiders as marketing agents, because such agents
are harder to control. HMOs should not use doctors to recruit
subscribers, especially if the doctors are rewarded for signing up
customers.
</P>
<P>
   _ If an HMO discovers evidence of misconduct, it should report
the problem to federal authorities within 60 days. If the health
plan was overpaid, it should repay the government and take other
corrective action.
</P>
<P>
   Just as doctors and hospitals may violate the law by performing
too many tests and procedures, Ms. Brown said, HMOs can violate the
law by withholding or delaying care they promised to provide to
Medicare beneficiaries.

   The nation has met only about 15 percent of its health goals for
the year 2000, set 20 years ago, the Department of Health and Human
Services reported Thursday, but progress has been made on another
44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For about 20 percent of the objectives, the nation is getting
less healthy and is moving away from the goals, said Surgeon
General David Satcher at a news conference at Harvard Medical
School in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways we are doing well,'' Satcher said, ``and in
others we still have challenges and more to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Donna E. Shalala, the secretary of health and
human services, said, ``As the century draws to a close, we can be
proud that we have made significant strides in improving the health
of Americans.'' Shalala said the progress report ``lets us measure
the overall progress we have achieved in preventing disease and
promoting health.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, Healthy People 2000 Review, outlined 319 different
health goals for the nation that were set at the start of 1979 and
reviewed in 1989. They include hoped-for progress on such disparate
measures as infant mortality, the rate of dental cavities, average
physical activity, teen-age pregnancy, hearing impairment and the
rates of a variety of diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Among the areas where goals have been met are reductions in
infant mortality, childhood mortality and breast cancer deaths.
Among those where the report showed the nation was getting worse
were in the level of physical activity, the number of children
taking physical education and the number of people overweight or
obese.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Julius Richmond, the former surgeon general, who established
the Healthy People 2000 program, said that watching the change in
health patterns over the past 20 years had produced some surprises.
Among the most surprising is a 35 percent drop in heart disease and
a 65 percent decline in strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just came unexpectedly,'' Richmond said ``and we are
still not sure of all the factors that contributed to it.''
</P>
<P>
   A disappointment among the data is that while infant mortality
has continued to decline, and is almost at the goal, there remains
a great disparity between the rate for whites and for blacks. The
death rate among black infants is about twice that for whites, he
said. ``and has been that way for decades.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very disappointing,'' Richmond said.
</P>
<P>
   Satcher said that other health disparities among ethnic groups
were also troubling. Hispanic people are twice as likely as whites
to be diabetic and African-Americans have a disproportionately high
death rate from diabetes. African-Americans are also much more
likely than whites to be hospitalized or die from asthma, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Satcher also noted that some of the most important challenges
were in diet and fitness.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, the percent of Americans who are
overweight was about 26 in the mid-1970s. The government
established a goal for the year 2000 of 20 percent of the
population, and many people believed it might be achieved as more
Americans appeared to become interested in nutrition and fitness
over the past 15 years. But instead, the number of people
overweight rose to 35 percent by 1995, the latest year for which
data was given in the report.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, about 15 percent of adolescents were overweight,
Satcher said, and that figure has risen to 24 percent. ``And there
are several categories in which more than half the adults are
overweight,'' he said, ``for example Hispanic and African-American
women.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Anne Becker of the Harvard Medical School and the Harvard
Eating Disorders Center said that there was a paradox in the latest
data.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are spending $33 billion a year on dieting products
and services,'' Becker said. ``There has been a proliferation of
weight loss programs and pills. One would think that would have
some effect on losing weight.''
</P>
<P>
   Another figure in the report suggested that while diet pills and
plans may be widespread, sensible weight-loss plans are declining.
The report noted that ``sensible weight loss practices among
overweight people 12 years and older'' had dropped substantially,
to 15 percent of people using them in 1995 from 25 percent of
people using them in 1985. The goal for 2000 was 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A sample of figures given in the new report, the last report
before the government begins work on its Healthy People 2010 goals
and data, include these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Average daily intake of vegetables, fruits and grains among
those older than 2: In 1989, an average of 4.1 servings; in 1996,
an average of 4.7 servings. The goal for 2000 is 5.
</P>
<P>
   _ Breast-feeding shortly after birth: 54 percent of women did so
in 1988; 62 percent did in 1997. The goal is 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mothers who die in childbirth: It was 6.6 per 100,000 live
births in 1987; it rose to 7.5 in 1997. The goal is 3.3.
</P>
<P>
   _ Proportion of students, grades 9-12, who participated in daily
school physical education: It was 42 percent in 1991; it declined
because of budget cuts to 27 percent in 1997. The goal is 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Proportion of children using seat belts and safety seats: It
was 48 percent in 1988; it rose to 61 percent in 1996. The goal is
70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Infant mortality: It was 10.1 in 1987; it dropped to 7.1 in
1997. The goal is 7.
</P>
<P>
   The goals were set by groups of experts from federal, state and
local governments, as well as outside experts, who passed their
recommendations to a steering committee of officials the Department
of Health and Human Services for approval.

EDITORIAL: PEACE AND THE KLA 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Friday, June 11: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The quality of the peace that NATO can bring to Kosovo in the
coming months will depend in large measure on the cooperation it
receives from the commanders and fighters of the Kosovo Liberation
Army. The settlement terms fall short of the KLA's goal of an
independent Kosovo. But more than 11 weeks of NATO bombing have won
Kosovars a high degree of political autonomy and made it possible
for more than a million displaced people to return safely to their
homes. The KLA should demobilize its guerrilla units, surrender its
heavy weapons and trust NATO peacekeepers to provide physical
security for all of Kosovo's people.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Liberation Army as it exists today is an amalgam of a
few hundred veteran ideologues and thousands of less politicized
recruits who joined after Serbian forces stepped up repression in
Kosovo last year. Its ground offensive in the last days of the NATO
bombing campaign helped draw Serbian forces into the open where
allied pilots could hit them, probably speeding the end of the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA's political leadership and military chain of command are
fluid and unclear to outsiders. Its most visible leader is a
relative moderate, Hashim Thaci, the organization's political
director. Thaci accepted the compromise peace terms agreed to
earlier this year in Rambouillet, which will be the basis for
United Nations administration of the province. Those terms require
the KLA to disband its fighting units and hand over its heavy
weapons. KLA members are allowed to keep their personal weapons, a
realistic concession in a province where most people have guns.
</P>
<P>
   Thaci has assured NATO leaders in recent days that he will
comply with the peace agreement. But his orders may be resisted by
others out to settle scores with Serbian civilians and rival
Albanian politicians. The KLA's chief competitor used to be the
nonviolent democrats led by Ibrahim Rugova. But Rugova's talks with
Slobodan Milosevic this spring while Serbian forces were expelling
hundreds of thousands of Kosovars have discredited him and most of
his followers. Kosovo's main political contest is now between the
pragmatic and radical wings of the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   In the days immediately ahead, the NATO-led peacekeepers must
assume direct responsibility for security at all levels in Kosovo,
including not just military tasks but many police duties as well.
Once peace takes hold, local police forces will be organized and
trained under international supervision. If the KLA willingly
demilitarizes, many of its current fighters should be able to move
smoothly into new roles as police in Albanian Kosovar communities,
helping to make the autonomy and security promised by the peace
agreement a tangible reality. KLA resistance to the agreement would
only doom Kosovo to additional misery and bloodshed. &QL;

AIRLINES AGREE ON PLEDGES TO MAKE TO THEIR CUSTOMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Fourteen passenger airlines have agreed to a
``customer service commitment'' that is intended to pre-empt
legislation pending in Congress. But a news conference called
Thursday morning at the Air Transport Association to announce the
plan was canceled by the airlines, apparently because of a
disagreement with lawmakers that occurred minutes before the
briefing was supposed to begin.
</P>
<P>
   As United Airlines chairman and chief executive Gerald Greenwald
apologized for not having anything to say, staff members at the
transport association scurried around a conference room trying to
gather up press kits that had been set out for distribution. The
association, which says its members carry 95 percent of all
passenger traffic, is the industry's main lobbying arm.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines' customer service commitment includes promises to
``quote the lowest available fare for which the customer is
eligible'' to people who telephone for tickets, and to hold
reservations for 24 hours, without requiring immediate purchase, so
that customers can comparison-shop.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines are also promising to tell customers about delays
or diversions when they are known in advance and to give some
information on redemption of seats with frequent flier miles,
although not as much data as some legislation would require.
</P>
<P>
   And they are promising to ``make every reasonable effort to
provide food, water, restroom facilities and access to medical
treatment for passengers aboard an aircraft that is on the ground
for an extended period of time without access to the terminal.''
That provision grows out of a monumental tie-up in Detroit last
winter during a snowstorm, when thousands of passengers on
Northwest Airlines sat for hours on planes without food, water or
usable toilets. Under the promise, airlines would share gates
during such emergencies, making it easier to unload planes.
</P>
<P>
   But the agreement broke down, and people involved in the
negotiations became like passengers after a semi-audible
announcement over an airport public address system, giving
different explanations of who had said what to whom and what it
meant.
</P>
<P>
   Some congressional aides said Thursday that they were told
Wednesday night that no announcement was imminent. But when they
were presented with the deal Thursday morning, there was not enough
time for members of Congress to decide whether it was sufficient to
merit dropping the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Airline executives were describing the provisions of the
agreement to officials of the Clinton administration Thursday
morning as if they were still planning to go ahead with the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Greenwald, in a brief statement to reporters, said, ``The
commitment of the airlines to improved customer service is real;
after all, airline passengers are the heart of our business.''
</P>
<P>
   The airlines' proposal does not cover as much ground as some of
the legislation, which is intended to guarantee ``passenger
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Some proposals before Congress would require the airlines to pay
passengers who are stranded for more than two hours. In addition,
some bills would allow ``back to back'' ticketing, in which a
passenger buys two round-trip tickets, with a Saturday night
stayover on each, and then throws away half of each round-trip and
flies more cheaply than would be possible with a straightforward
purchase. Another practice that some bills would legalize but the
airlines are trying to stamp out is ``hidden city'' ticketing, in
which a passenger buys a ticket from city A to city C and gets off
in city B, an intermediate stop, paying less than a simple ticket
to city B.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines differ in how they treat passengers who do not fly all
segments for which they hold tickets and in how they disclose their
policies on such tactics. The airline proposal would have the
carriers disclose their policies.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines also said they would provide information on when a
passenger would have to change planes at an intermediate stop, on a
trip described by the airline as a single ``flight'' with a single
flight number, and information regarding aircraft seat width and
leg room.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., who is co-author of one passenger bill
with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said through a spokesman that some
parts of the package were too vague and that it lacked clearly
enforceable standards.

EDITORIAL: STUDENTS FIRST, ATHLETES SECOND 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Friday, June 11: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Basketball is the richest college sport, with a television
contract worth nearly $2 billion. It is also the most troubled
college sport. Players fail to graduate in alarming numbers. Others
transfer repeatedly in search of more playing time elsewhere. Still
others leave early in search of a professional career.
</P>
<P>
   This sorry record has now prompted a National Collegiate
Athletic Association advisory committee to consider a plan that
would make freshmen ineligible for the sport, forcing them to focus
on academics for their first year on campus. The plan makes good
sense _ and should probably be expanded to football.
</P>
<P>
   Freshmen did not become eligible to play varsity sports until
1972, when the games, especially basketball, began to attract more
television attention and revenues expanded. Eager to get the best
talent into harness as quickly as possible, coaches junked a system
that had traditionally allowed freshmen to get their bearings at
college while playing a modest schedule of 10 or so basketball
games a year. As things now stand, freshmen who make the varsity
team endure a grueling schedule that begins in October and runs
into March, with as many as 40 games, constant practices and a
rigorous travel schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Athletic directors who defend freshman eligibility argue that
many students handle the schedule well, finishing their degrees on
time. But the latest statistics show that graduation rates for
basketball players have actually declined, despite more rigorous
admissions standards that have raised the graduation rates for
college athletics as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Smith, formerly the basketball coach at The University of
North Carolina, serves on the NCAA committee that will deliver its
recommendations to the organization's board of directors later this
month. Smith is one of a group of distinguished coaches who were
early critics of freshman eligibility. Even though he coached
talented freshmen like Michael Jordan, Smith maintains that varsity
play in the freshman year is contrary to a student's best interest,
making the adjustment to college more difficult than it already is.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed plan, players would still get scholarships.
The only difference is that they would have to focus on the books
for a year. Revoking freshman eligibility is a common-sense
solution to a deepening problem.

METS' WOES ARE HARD TO CONCEAL BENEATH A FAKE MUSTACHE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Mets' version of Inspector Clouseau, that master of
disguise, could be in trouble. Bobby Valentine is under
investigation by the National League for donning sunglasses and a
fake mustache _ or was it a strip of black tape? _ and returning to
the dugout after his ejection from the game Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The masquerade is only one of several issues that have immersed
the Mets in a sea of turmoil that is reminiscent of, well, as a
member of the Mets' organization asked Thursday, ``Is this what it
was like with the Yankees?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, only Billy Martin never disguised himself so that no one
would recognize him. If only he had, he might have avoided all of
those bar fights. But that's another time and another story. This
one is about the Mets and their attempt to get their season back on
the playoff track.
</P>
<P>
   With their current winning streak, they may be headed there, but
the ancillary developments left Steve Phillips, their good-natured
general manager, gasping for air Thursday. More than 30 minutes
into a conference call with reporters, he said: ``When can we talk
about baseball? We won four in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   About 90 percent of the call was consumed by Bobby Bonilla and
his recalcitrance in the face of his demotion to bench status. He
refused to pinch-hit in the game with Toronto on Tuesday night, and
Valentine chose punitively not to ask him to pinch-hit on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   But just as with other elements of Yankeeland East, Valentine
apparently triggered this one, too, and not simply by deciding he
could no longer abide Bonilla's presence regularly in the outfield.
Bonilla, an associate said, was irate that Valentine told a
reporter about his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Mets have a decision to make: what to do about Bonilla.
Phillips readily acknowledged that it had become an ``extremely
difficult'' matter. ``It's something that should and needs to be
resolved sooner rather than later,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bonilla crisis never had to develop. The Mets never had to
bring Bonilla back. It was a step _ they were warned before they
took it _ that could boomerang. Talk about throwing good money
after bad. Fred Wilpon and Nelson Doubleday didn't make their
millions making deals like this one.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets could have released Mel Rojas last winter and paid him
$4.5 million, his salary for the 1999 season. But nooooooo, they
had to get equal value for him, and oh did they. Bonilla has been
every bit as bad for them this season as Rojas was for them last
year.
</P>
<P>
   But economically, Bonilla is far more costly. Subtracting the $1
million they received from the Dodgers in the deal, the Mets will
spend $10.8 million on Bonilla for this year and the next. In
monetary terms alone, they are out a net of $6.3 million, which
could have paid a good player a nice salary for one year.
</P>
<P>
   To Valentine's credit, he did not want Bonilla in the first
place. As soon as the trade was announced last November, he talked
about the risk Bonilla posed. ``The risk,'' he said, ``is whether
or not he catches the ball when it comes down.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Mets, who owe Bonilla $9.6 million for the rest of this
season and next, are faced with the likelihood of having to release
him.
</P>
<P>
   This predicament comes at a confusing time for the Mets. An
eight-game losing streak produced grumbling from some players about
Valentine's ever-changing lineup, and it was accompanied by the
surprise sacking of half of Valentine's coach staff over his
strenuous objections.
</P>
<P>
   But since the changes _ and no one is suggesting cause and
effect here _ the Mets have won four straight, winning the last two
without the pinch-hitting help of the sulking hulk. Yet the winning
streak has been punctuated by the manager's decision to initiate
verbal battles with reporters he doesn't like, fabricating or
imagining incidents or situations to support his arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Inspector Clouseau. Ejected in the Toronto half of the
12th inning for arguing a call against Mike Piazza, Valentine
reappeared on the bench in a disguise: black Mets T-shirt,
baseball-type cap, sunglasses and a fake mustache.
</P>
<P>
   The television camera quickly spotted him and focused on him
periodically the rest of the game, but he later tried to deny he
was that masked man.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was somebody else who didn't look like me,'' Valentine said
weakly.
</P>
<P>
   But just as Inspector Clouseau never tricked anyone, Valentine
did not fool the league office. Katy Feeney, the league's senior
vice president, said the league was investigating the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting information,'' she said. ``We don't have
everything yet, but we're getting it. We'll have the rest of it
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeney said managers have been fined or reprimanded for
remaining in the tunnel leading from the dugout to the clubhouse
after they had been ejected. ``But,'' she added, ``I don't remember
anybody being fully back in the dugout nor do I remember anybody
being in disguise.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeney said it was her understanding that the fake mustache
actually was a piece of black tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll look at the film and see if we can tell,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no question, however, that the man sitting in the
Mets' dugout was not Peter Sellers.

POLISH FIRST LADY'S ARMOR: ELEGANCE, TACT, AND BACKBONE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland _ The first lady of Poland said she gave Hillary
Rodham Clinton some helpful hints when they first met in Cracow
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her that from my point of view, I should always be
three steps behind my husband,'' Jolanta Kwasniewska, the young,
elegant wife of president Aleksander Kwasniewski, said.
</P>
<P>
   She added with a bright smile, ``And I think in the next term of
President Clinton, Hillary was even more steps behind her husband
than I. And that is one of the reasons that she has such good press
and high popularity now.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly four years after her husband's election, Mrs.
Kwasniewska, 43, is one of the most admired _ and closely watched _
women in Poland. When Pope John Paul II arrived at the Gdansk
airport last Saturday, Polish reporters on the tarmac spent little
time measuring the handshake between the Polish pope and the
ex-Communist president.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, as Mrs. Kwasniewska, a practicing Catholic, curtsied
and kissed the Pope's ring, the reporters craned for a glimpse of
the First Lady's hemline. It was just below the knee.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer who exchanged her real estate business for charity work
after the election, but never lost her taste for alluring designer
clothes, Mrs. Kwasniewska (pronounced kvash-NYEFF-ska) was
described early on as a combination of Jackie Kennedy and Hillary
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she has proven to be something quite different _ a
post-feminist First Lady who has reaped the rewards of emancipation
by assuring the world that she doesn't mind subordination.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, her tenure in the Presidential Palace exemplifies
some of the contradictions that sprang up during the country's
fast, edgy transition from Communism to capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Feminist issues were largely buried under the broader Polish
struggle for freedom from a totalitarian state. When democracy
suddenly sprang loose, many battles for women's rights were either
swept under the rug or skipped forward in the race for
Westernization.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kwasniewska explained that she eschews politics, advising
her husband only on matters related to her social causes, yet she
did not hesitate to speak her mind on one of the more divisive
issues currently churning in Poland.
</P>
<P>
   The lower house of Parliament, which is dominated by right-wing
parties, recently approved legislation that could inhibit the use
of amniocentesis, a prenatal diagnostic test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is terrible,'' Mrs. Kwasniewska said swiftly.
``It's the first time in my life I have heard such stupid
information. I think that the members of our Parliament made a
mistake _ and think that prenatal testing is pornography.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she would do her best to block it. ``I think it is just
a mistake and I will talk to my husband,'' she said firmly. ``I am
sure that as soon as possible it will be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Her candor was all the more surprising given the timing. On
Friday, she is to be host to John Paul II during his courtesy visit
to the Presidential Palace, where he will pray in the palace
chapel.
</P>
<P>
   The Pope warned against amniocentesis in his 1995 encyclical
``Evangelium Vitae'' (``The Gospel of Life''), saying it was
acceptable only as a means of treating an unhealthy fetus and
complaining that it was too often used as a pretext for what he
called ``eugenic abortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kwasniewska defended the diagnostic test as a means of
giving a defective fetus early treatment. But her explanation that
Poland's rate of spontaneous abortions as a result of the test _ 2
percent and the same as other countries and ``quite normal,'' _ is
unlikely to delight the Vatican or Poland's conservative bishops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she would feel offended if someone called her a
feminist,'' said Eleonora Zielinska, a feminist and law professor
at Warsaw University. ``But by my standards, she is one.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kwasniewska's self-assurance is bolstered by the obvious
pride Poles take in her glamour and dedication. She started gently
with conventional causes, setting up a foundation to help children
and the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   She has since expanded into more daring areas, campaigning for
greater breast cancer awareness and early testing, as well as
compassionate care for AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is perceived as a strong woman,'' said Monica Olejnik, a
prominent political journalist in Warsaw. ``But what is important
to Poles is that she is not seen as controlling her husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Novelty also helped. Poland was accustomed to dowdy, anonymous
wives of Communist Party leaders. Her immediate predecessor, Danuta
Walesa, wife of the founder of Solidarity, Lech Walesa, who was
president from 1990 until 1995, stayed in Gdansk to raise their
eight children, and was far less visible.
</P>
<P>
   ``My situation is different,'' Mrs. Kwasniewska said. ``I only
have one child and I am full of energy, I hate when I have nothing
to do, it would kill me.''
</P>
<P>
   Poles in fact describe her as the country's first first lady,
which deeply irritates Walesa. They had met only once, at a hotel
elevator in Washington, at the ceremonies surrounding the inclusion
of Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary into NATO in April.
</P>
<P>
   But for once, it seems, Mrs. Kwasniewska's legendary charm
failed. Back home, he continues to complain that Mrs. Kwasniewska
had a much softer life than his first lady, who had to run their
modest home _ and represent him _ when he was jailed during martial
law in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Kwasniewska's husband was a junior minister in the
Communist government during those dark days. When democracy emerged
he formed a new, non-Marxist party and ran a youthful,
American-style campaign against Walesa, promising pragmatism and
economic reform. In office, he has earned most voters' respect but
she is the one they love.
</P>
<P>
   He is an atheist, and her Catholicism is seen as his best bridge
to the powerful church. (There is a chaplain in the Presidential
Palace who celebrates Mass daily.)
</P>
<P>
   During the interview, she wore a form-fitting, Italian-made navy
pants suit. At official functions, she wears skirts, and conceded
with a smile that they have grown longer over the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   She recalled that while in Washington last spring, she caught a
television interview with Monica Lewinsky, whose celebrity status
became a hot topic among the other first ladies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am sorry, she is not a star,'' Mrs. Kwasniewska said hotly.
``In Poland we've known what her kind of profession is for hundreds
of years. If she were my daughter, I would tell her to get plastic
surgery and leave the country. To escape the shame.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she admired Mrs. Clinton's fortitude and restraint,
noting with a laugh that if her husband had put her in a similar
situation, ``he would get a black eye.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she didn't know whether she would have chosen the same
path as the Clintons. Again, the first lady didn't hesitate to
bring up divorce, which is legal in Poland but condemned by the
Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no obligation to live together, there is the
opportunity to build a new life, to find a new husband or wife, and
sometimes that is better _ truth is better than lies,'' she said
pensively. ``But it's easy to talk in theory, life is rarely so
simple.''

METHODIST'S FACE DECISION ON 68 MINISTERS WHO BLESSED SAME-SEX
UNIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ When leaders of the United Methodist
Church's Northern California and Nevada region meet here on June
15, they will begin grappling with the unusual decision of whether
to charge 68 ministers with violating church law for having jointly
blessed a same-sex union in January.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony was public, held in the convention center here,
with more than 1,000 people attending and wide news coverage.
</P>
<P>
   A church spokesman said that never before had so many ministers
faced the possibility of a formal charge of disobedience, which
could lead to a church trial. Trials themselves, in which a
conviction can carry penalties as severe as removal of ministerial
credentials, have been rare _ until recently _ in the denomination,
which has 8.5 million members.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the Rev. Greg Dell, a minister in Chicago, was
suspended from office by an ecclesiastical court after it found him
guilty of violating church law for having blessed the union of two
gay men.
</P>
<P>
   A year earlier, the Rev. Jimmy Creech, of Omaha, Neb., was
acquitted after conducting a ceremony for two women. But Creech's
bishop removed him from his pulpit. An official complaint, which
can lead to a trial, has been filed against Creech for a same-sex
union he recently performed in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   These events illustrate the escalating tension within many
mainline Protestant churches over how to respond to gay and lesbian
members. Among Methodists, the second-largest Protestant
denomination after the Southern Baptist Convention, the debate has
focused on clergy members' blessing same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the denomination's policy-making body, the General
Conference, added a sentence to the ``Book of Discipline,'' the
church rulebook: ``Ceremonies that celebrate homosexual unions
shall not be conducted by our ministers, and shall not be conducted
in our churches.''
</P>
<P>
   Creech was the first minister charged with violating the
statement. But in his defense, he successfully argued that the
statement was not binding, because the conference placed it in a
rulebook section reserved for advisory matters. Last August,
however, the denomination's Judicial Court ruled that the statement
had legal force, meaning a minister could be removed for violating
it.
</P>
<P>
   One minister who particularly objected to the ruling was the
Rev. Don Fado, pastor of the 900-member St. Mark's United Methodist
Church in Sacramento, a minister of 40 years' experience, who is
married and has four children and nine grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's contradictory to other parts of our ministry,'' Fado
said.
</P>
<P>
   He cited another statement in the rulebook, which describes
homosexuals as ``individuals of sacred worth who need the ministry
and guidance of the church.'' The court's ruling, he said, ``turns
around and says you can't give them prayers and blessings.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sermon to his congregation last October, Fado, 65, said he
wanted to protest the ruling by publicly blessing a same-sex union.
He said he hoped to enlist at least 50 ministers to join him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will have to be a unique couple that will want such a
ceremony,'' Fado said, ``and be willing to put up with the
publicity that will accompany it.''
</P>
<P>
   That week, Jeanne Barnett and Ellie Charlton, members of St.
Mark's, volunteered. They were well known in the Methodists'
California-Nevada Conference, a regional jurisdiction that includes
400 congregations, Ms. Barnett, 69, as its lay leader, Ms.
Charlton, 64, as a trustee. They had been together 15 years.
``We're out to everyone,'' Ms. Charlton said.
</P>
<P>
   They planned the ceremony for St. Mark's, but decided to move it
to a larger site as word spread nationally among friends and others
who supported same-sex blessings.
</P>
<P>
   In March, two months after the ceremony, Bishop Melvin G.
Talbert, the conference's leader, announced legal proceedings
against Fado and the 67 other ministers, all from Northern
California and Nevada. But in his statement, the bishop also said
he strongly disagreed with the Judicial Council's ruling, saying it
infringed on a minister's ``sacred pastoral role.'' But he said
that as bishop, he was obliged to uphold the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Talbert described Ms. Barnett and Ms. Charlton as ``honorable,
loyal and dedicated followers of Jesus Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. James V. Heidinger II, president of Good News, an
evangelical caucus within the denomination, said the number of
ministers involved in the case made it an important one for the
California-Nevada Conference and the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be real concern to see whether that annual
conference has the will and ability to hold any of those clergy
accountable,'' Heidinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Fado and the other ministers will face a trial will be
up to the conference's committee on investigations. Under Methodist
rules, it has considerable time and latitude to deal with
complaints against ministers and can try to reach a resolution
short of a trial. A church spokesman said Methodist culture
encouraged resolving such disputes outside the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   The next major event in the denomination is the quadrennial
General Conference, which meets in May 2000. Fado said he hoped it
would move to allow individual clergy members greater freedom on
this issue. But Heidinger said that he doubted there would be a
majority at the General Conference in favor of changing the ban on
same-sex ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Talbert, for his part, said he did not believe that the church
needed to have a position on every issue. In some cases, he said,
judgment should be left to God.

EXCERPTS FROM JUSTICES' OPINIONS ON CHICAGO LOITERING LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from the Supreme Court's
decision Thursday overturning a Chicago ordinance on loitering. The
vote in Chicago vs. Morales was 6-3. Justice John Paul Stevens
wrote the majority opinion, which was signed by Justices David H.
Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote a
concurring opinion, which was also signed by Justice Stephen G.
Breyer. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote a concurring opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a dissent, as did Justice Clarence
Thomas. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Scalia both signed
Thomas' dissent.

</P>
<P>
   FROM THE DECISION
</P>
<P>
   By Justice Stevens
</P>
<P>
   The basic factual predicate for the city's ordinance is not in
dispute. As the city argues in its brief, ``the very presence of a
large collection of obviously brazen, insistent, and lawless gang
members and hangers-on on the public ways intimidates residents,
who become afraid even to leave their homes and go about their
business. That, in turn, imperils community residents' sense of
safety and security, detracts from property values and can
ultimately destabilize entire neighborhoods.'' The findings in the
ordinance explain that it was motivated by these concerns. We have
no doubt that a law that directly prohibited such intimidating
conduct would be constitutional, but this ordinance broadly covers
a significant amount of additional activity. Uncertainty about the
scope of that additional coverage provides the basis for
respondents' claim that the ordinance is too vague. . . .
</P>
<P>
   While we, like the Illinois courts, conclude that the ordinance
is invalid on its face, we do not rely on the overbreadth doctrine.
. . .
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, as the United States recognizes, the freedom
to loiter for innocent purposes is part of the ``liberty''
protected by the due process clause of the 14th Amendment. We have
expressly identified this ``right to remove from one place to
another according to inclination'' as ``an attribute of personal
liberty'' protected by the Constitution. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Vagueness may invalidate a criminal law for either of two
independent reasons. First, it may fail to provide the kind of
notice that will enable ordinary people to understand what conduct
it prohibits; second, it may authorize and even encourage arbitrary
and discriminatory enforcement. Accordingly, we first consider
whether the ordinance provides fair notice to the citizen and then
discuss its potential for arbitrary enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is established that a law fails to meet the requirements of
the due process clause if it is so vague and standardless that it
leaves the public uncertain as to the conduct it prohibits.'' The
Illinois Supreme Court recognized that the term ``loiter'' may have
a common and accepted meaning, but the definition of that term in
this ordinance ``to remain in any one place with no apparent
purpose'' does not. It is difficult to imagine how any citizen of
the city of Chicago standing in a public place with a group of
people would know if he or she had an ``apparent purpose.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   Since the city cannot conceivably have meant to criminalize each
instance a citizen stands in public with a gang member, the
vagueness that dooms this ordinance is not the product of
uncertainty about the normal meaning of ``loitering,'' but rather
about what loitering is covered by the ordinance and what is not. .
. .
</P>
<P>
   The city's principal response to this concern about adequate
notice is that loiterers are not subject to sanction until after
they have failed to comply with an officer's order to disperse.
``(W)hatever problem is created by a law that criminalizes conduct
people normally believe to be innocent is solved when persons
receive actual notice from a police order of what they are expected
to do.'' We find this response unpersuasive for at least two
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   First, the purpose of the fair notice requirement is to enable
the ordinary citizen to conform his or her conduct to the law. ``No
one may be required at peril of life, liberty or property to
speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes.'' Although it is
true that a loiterer is not subject to criminal sanctions unless he
or she disobeys a dispersal order, the loitering is the conduct
that the ordinance is designed to prohibit. If the loitering is in
fact harmless and innocent, the dispersal order itself is an
unjustified impairment of liberty. If the police are able to decide
arbitrarily which members of the public they will order to
disperse, then the Chicago ordinance becomes indistinguishable from
the law we held invalid in Shuttlesworth vs. Birmingham. Because an
officer may issue an order only after prohibited conduct has
already occurred, it cannot provide the kind of advance notice that
will protect the putative loiterer from being ordered to disperse.
Such an order cannot retroactively give adequate warning of the
boundary between the permissible and the impermissible applications
of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the terms of the dispersal order compound the inadequacy
of the notice afforded by the ordinance. It provides that the
officer ``shall order all such persons to disperse and remove
themselves from the area.'' This vague phrasing raises a host of
questions. After such an order issues, how long must the loiterers
remain apart? How far must they move? If each loiterer walks around
the block and they meet again at the same location, are they
subject to arrest or merely to being ordered to disperse again? As
we do here, we have found vagueness in a criminal statute
exacerbated by the use of the standards of ``neighborhood'' and
``locality.'' We remarked in Connally that ``both terms are elastic
and, dependent upon circumstances, may be equally satisfied by
areas measured by rods or by miles.''
</P>
<P>
   Lack of clarity in the description of the loiterer's duty to
obey a dispersal order might not render the ordinance
unconstitutionally vague if the definition of the forbidden conduct
were clear, but it does buttress our conclusion that the entire
ordinance fails to give the ordinary citizen adequate notice of
what is forbidden and what is permitted. The Constitution does not
permit a legislature to ``set a net large enough to catch all
possible offenders, and leave it to the courts to step inside and
say who could be rightfully detained, and who should be set at
large.'' This ordinance is therefore vague ``not in the sense that
it requires a person to conform his conduct to an imprecise but
comprehensible normative standard, but rather in the sense that no
standard of conduct is specified at all.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   The broad sweep of the ordinance also violates ``the requirement
that a legislature establish minimal guidelines to govern law
enforcement.'' There are no such guidelines in the ordinance. In
any public place in the city of Chicago, persons who stand or sit
in the company of a gang member may be ordered to disperse unless
their purpose is apparent. The mandatory language in the enactment
directs the police to issue an order without first making any
inquiry about their possible purposes. It matters not whether the
reason that a gang member and his father, for example, might loiter
near Wrigley Field is to rob an unsuspecting fan or just to get a
glimpse of Sammy Sosa leaving the ballpark; in either event, if
their purpose is not apparent to a nearby police officer, she may
indeed, she ``shall'' order them to disperse.
</P>
<P>
   (SCALIA DISSENT IN 2nd TAKE)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   FROM THE DISSENT
</P>
<P>
   By Justice Scalia
</P>
<P>
   The minor limitation upon the free state of nature that this
prophylactic arrangement imposed upon all Chicagoans seemed to them
(and it seems to me) a small price to pay for liberation of their
streets.
</P>
<P>
   The majority today invalidates this perfectly reasonable measure
by ignoring our rules governing facial challenges, by elevating
loitering to a constitutionally guaranteed right and by discerning
vagueness where, according to our usual standards, none exists. . .
.
</P>
<P>
   Both the plurality opinion and the concurrences display a lively
imagination, creating hypothetical situations in which the law's
application would (in their view) be ambiguous. But that creative
role has been usurped from the petitioner, who can defeat the
respondents' facial challenge by conjuring up a single valid
application of the law. My contribution would go something like
this: Tony, a member of the Jets criminal street gang, is standing
alongside and chatting with fellow gang members while staking out
their turf at Promontory Point on the South Side of Chicago; the
group is flashing gang signs and displaying their distinctive
tattoos to passersby. Officer Krupke, applying the Ordinance at
issue here, orders the group to disperse. After some speculative
discussion (probably irrelevant here) over whether the Jets are
depraved because they are deprived, Tony and the other gang members
break off further conversation with the statement not entirely
coherent, but evidently intended to be rude ``Gee, Officer Krupke,
krup you.'' A tense standoff ensues until Officer Krupke arrests
the group for failing to obey his dispersal order. Even assuming
(as the Justices in the majority do, but I do not) that a law
requiring obedience to a dispersal order is impermissibly vague
unless it is clear to the objects of the order, before its
issuance, that their conduct justifies it, I find it hard to
believe that the Jets would not have known they had it coming. That
should settle the matter of respondents' facial challenge to the
Ordinance's vagueness.
</P>
<P>
   None of the three factors that the plurality relies upon exists
anyway. I turn first to the support for the proposition that there
is a constitutionally protected right to loiter. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Of course every activity, even scratching one's head, can be
called a ``constitutional right'' if one means by that term nothing
more than the fact that the activity is covered (as all are) by the
Equal Protection Clause, so that those who engage in it cannot be
singled out without ``rational basis.'' But using the term in that
sense utterly impoverishes our constitutional discourse. We would
then need a  &UR; new &LR;  term for those activities such as political
speech or religious worship that cannot be forbidden even  &UR; with &LR; 
rational basis.
</P>
<P>
   The plurality tosses around the term ``constitutional right'' in
this renegade sense, because there is not the slightest evidence
for the existence of a genuine constitutional right to loiter.
Justice Thomas recounts the vast historical tradition of
criminalizing the activity. It is simply not maintainable that the
right to loiter would have been regarded as an essential attribute
of liberty at the time of the framing or at the time of adoption of
the 14th Amendment. For the plurality, however, the historical
practices of our people are nothing more than a speed bump on the
road to the ``right'' result. Its opinion blithely proclaims:
``Neither this history nor the scholarly compendia in Justice
Thomas' dissent, persuades us that the right to engage in loitering
that is entirely harmless in both purpose and effect is not a part
of the liberty protected by the due process clause.'' The entire
practice of using the due process clause to add judicially favored
rights to the limitations upon democracy set forth in the Bill of
Rights (usually under the rubric of so-called ``substantive due
process'') is in my view judicial usurpation. But we have, recently
at least, sought to limit the damage by tethering the courts'
``right-making'' power to an objective criterion. In Washington vs.
Glucksberg, we explained our ``established method'' of substantive
due process analysis: carefully and narrowly describing the
asserted right, and then examining whether that right is manifested
in ``our nation's history, legal traditions, and practices.'' The
plurality opinion not only ignores this necessary limitation, but
it leaps far beyond any substantive due process atrocity we have
ever committed, by actually placing the burden of proof upon the
defendant to establish that loitering is  &UR; not &LR;  a ``fundamental
liberty.'' It never does marshal any support  &UR; for &LR;  the proposition
that loitering  &UR; is &LR;  a constitutional right, contenting itself with
a (transparently inadequate) explanation of why the historical
record of laws banning loitering does not positively  &UR; contradict &LR; 
that proposition, and the (transparently erroneous) assertion that
the City of Chicago appears to have conceded the point. It is
enough for the members of the plurality that ``history (fails to)
persuade us that the right to engage in loitering that is entirely
harmless in both purpose and effect is  &UR; not &LR;  a part of the liberty
protected by the due process clause,'' (emphasis added); they
apparently think it quite unnecessary for anything to persuade them
that it  &UR; is &LR; . . . .

DODGERS COUNT ON BROWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With the exception of opening day and the six-run
disaster in Philadelphia, right-hander Kevin Brown has filled the
role of Los Angeles Dodgers ace to near perfection. He's been
outstanding at stopping or preventing losing streaks, going 5-1
with a 1.99 ERA following Dodgers losses.
</P>
<P>
   However, one thing manager Davey Johnson won't do is overextend
Brown by making him throw a Randy Johnson-ish 130 pitches in a
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he gets around 105 pitches, 110 pitches, he's pretty much
gone,'' Johnson said. ``He's gassed.''
</P>
<P>
   It's why Brown, who is ninth in the major leagues in average
pitches per start (109), is yet to throw a pitch in the ninth
inning this season. He threw 114 pitches in eight innings during
Wednesday's 7-2 win against the Texas Rangers. The most he's thrown
is 118 in an April 21 start against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   It's obviously a conclusion Johnson reached more from watching
Brown rather than examining his numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who is 7-3 with a 2.69 ERA, has given up earned runs
after the sixth inning on two occasions. Of course, one of those
was the three runs he surrendered in the eighth inning against
Atlanta. Still, Brown's ERA is 2.78 from the first to the sixth
inning and is 2.25 after the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so darn competitive,'' Johnson said. ``I know he always
wants to keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Vero Beach presses on: After meeting with Dodgers officials
last week, Vero Beach, Fla., and Indian River County will continue
their quest to keep the Dodgers' spring-training home in Dodgertown
despite having only $12.5 million in funding available.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not dead, in my opinion,'' Dodgertown managing director
Craig Callan said. ``The representatives here, (Indian River County
Administrator) Jim Chandler and (Vero Beach city manager) Rex
Taylor, it's my understanding they'll say, `Here's what we can do
and here's what we can't do.' We're still discussing things.''
</P>
<P>
   Callan said local officials, stung by Gov. Jeb Bush's rejection
of a bill that would have provided $7.5 million in funds, are
searching for alternative funding but are not optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Bush did sign the expected one-cent tourist
tax that can go towards the acquisition of a spring-training
complex that will provide part of the $12.5 million in funds the
city and county possess.
</P>
<P>
   __ FYI: The Dodgers certainly are a .500 club in many aspects.
Not only are they 29-29 overall, they're 18-17 against clubs with a
.500 or better record and they're 22-21 against right-handed
starting pitchers. Johnson said he might use lefty Dave Hansen as
the designated hitter when the Dodgers face right-handers in the
last two games of the series in Oakland. . . . The bullpen is 2-2
with a 1.58 ERA and five saves in the last 14 games. . . .
Outfielder Trenidad Hubbard, nicknamed ``The Solution,'' has six
hits in his last two games and is hitting .321. . . . Right fielder
Raul Mondesi drew his 29th walk Wednesday. He walked 30 times in
1998 and collected 159 walks in 2,886 at-bats before this season.

HIGHER MORT GAGE RATES DIS APPOINTING HOME BUYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CATHERINE REAGOR

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Home buyers got bad news Wednesday when mortgage rates
hit their highest level in nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
   The average interest rate on 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages
climbed to 7.51 percent from 7.41 a week ago and the highest since
September 1997, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Rates have been steadily rising since April and now are almost a
percentage point higher than in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disheartening,'' said Greg Sexton who is in the process
of buying a new east Mesa home with his fiance Cori Krawcyk. ``We
could have locked in at 7.25 (percent) just a few weeks ago.''
</P>
<P>
   That move would have saved the couple at least a few hundred
dollars a year. But like many other home buyers, they had no idea
rates would rise so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   A $150,000 mortgage with a 10 percent down payment of $15,000
costs a home buyer with a 7 percent mortgage $898 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The same loan with a 7.5 percent interest rate costs $943 each
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rates have gone straight up during the past few months,'' said
Terry Turk, president of Sun America Mortgage. ``Usually, they will
pause a few weeks after a big hike before going up again.''
</P>
<P>
   The average payment on a $100,000 loan with this week's rate is
$699. Exactly one year ago when the rate was 7.04 percent, the
payment on that same loan was $668.
</P>
<P>
   The hike in rates also has quashed the refinancing boom.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Luber of North American Mortgage said mortgage refinancings
have dropped off by 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Refinancings hit a high last year when rates hovered around 6.5
percent, a record low.
</P>
<P>
   Lenders say there are still plenty of people buying homes so the
new-mortgage business isn't taking a dive.
</P>
<P>
   Low mortgage rates have fueled the nation's and the Valley's
home markets for several years. In 1998, more than 100,000 deals
for new homes and existing houses were struck, making it a record
year.
</P>
<P>
   The average mortgage rate for 1998 was about 6.6 percent, nearly
a percentage point lower than today's rate.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists have warned that if rates go much higher, the
housing boom will start to wane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buyers have to remember that 7.5 percent is still low,'' said
Jay Butler, director of Arizona State University's Real Estate
Center. ``Rates will have to hit 9 percent for the market to really
slow.''
</P>
<P>
   Mortgage rates haven't been that high since almost a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve is expected to raise the federal funds rate
by a quarter to a half a percentage point later this month. The
current increase in mortgage interest rates is in anticipation of
that increase, economists say.
</P>
<P>
   Where loan rates go from here depends on how big the Fed's move
is and how it's received by the markets.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, buyers like Sexton are cautiously watching. He and
Krawcyk, like many other people purchasing new Valley homes, which
take months to build, don't have to lock into a rate right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``If rates don't go back down, we can still afford the house
with all the upgrades we want,'' said Sexton, an editor of a
Phoenix magazine. ``But it may push back when we can buy all the
new appliances and furniture that we want to fill it.'' &QL;

HURTING ANGELS KEEP EYES ON PRIZE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It's right there in black and white every day.
In newspapers, on stats sheets, for all the organization to see.
</P>
<P>
   It's the standings, the dreaded standings.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels don't like to look because it shows where they stand
_ last place. It doesn't seem to matter to them that at 28-31 they
wouldn't be in last place in any other division but the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't seem to matter that the combined record of the teams
in the AL West is 13 games over .500, the best of any division in
the American League and second-best in the majors behind the NL
Central (21 over).
</P>
<P>
   What matters is that the Angels are 7{ games out of first place
and in danger of falling too far out to have a chance to win the
division.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, they were 8{ games out, their largest
deficit under manager Terry Collins' two-plus years at the helm and
the biggest since they finished 19{ games out at the end of the
1996 season.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels admit they are trying to hang on and stay close until
key players return from injuries. Shortstop Gary DiSarcina should
be back within a couple of weeks. Right fielder Tim Salmon should
be back within a month. Center fielder Jim Edmonds should be back
in about two months.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, the Angels are doing everything they can to ignore
the standings and win every game possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never look at the standings until we're .500,'' first
baseman/DH Mo Vaughn said. ``It's too disappointing. We've got to
get to .500 before I look at the standings. It can be frustrating,
but there's still a lot of season to play. Once you get to .500,
you can take off from there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels haven't been at .500 since April 17, when they were
6-6. They've gotten to within one game of .500 a few times only to
lose their next time out.
</P>
<P>
   In order to get to .500, though, the Angels need to change their
recent pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more than one win every three or four days,'' pitcher
Tim Belcher said. ``We need to string some together. What we've
been putting out there on the field is better than what we've
shown.''
</P>
<P>
   The first-place Rangers reeled off nine consecutive wins
recently. But the last thing Collins does is think about what the
Rangers are doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't worry about them,'' he said. ``I've still got to
concern myself with my team. You take care of your own business, no
matter what the standings say. You've still got to compete.''
</P>
<P>
   What's strange is that the Angels are proving that the old adage
_ you win with pitching and defense _ isn't necessarily true. They
rank No. 1 in team defense (.985 fielding percentage) and No. 2 in
pitching (4.30 ERA) in the league, but they are No. 12 in team
batting average (.259) and No. 12 in runs per game (4.5).
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Seattle Mariners have a winning record (30-28)
despite the worst pitching in the league with an ERA just under 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hitters' league,'' Collins noted.

60 YEARS LATER, COOPERSTOWN HALL OF FAME STILL HOLDS MEMORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds., this story, eliminated earlier from NYTNS budget, is now
restored.)

 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The special two-car excursion train trudged cautiously along
rusty tracks into sleepy Cooperstown, N.Y. It had been 18 vexing
miles from Colliersville, a dicey journey across a railroad spur
virtually unexplored since the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   But this was no ordinary passenger train and its riders no
ordinary travelers. And after that day, June 12, 1939, Cooperstown
would never again be an ordinary upstate New York farm town.
</P>
<P>
   Stepping off the train just inside the village that morning were
Babe Ruth, Connie Mack, Walter Johnson, Cy Young, Honus Wagner,
Tris Speaker, Eddie Collins, Napoleon Lajoie, George Sisler and
Grover Cleveland Alexander. Ty Cobb would arrive later. So would 32
major leaguers to play an exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty years ago Saturday, the National Baseball Hall of Fame
staged its first induction ceremony, an event that has become a
standby of the American summer.
</P>
<P>
   They came that day in 1939, 11 honorees and nine eventual Hall
of Famers still in their primes, to celebrate something
unprecedented: a sports Hall of Fame. How they spent that day is a
story of a different America and its pastime.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth, for example, arrived in the village needing a shave. He
marched up Main Street in a tan double-breasted suit and buck wing
shoes with a retinue of children following at a respectful
distance. At the lone Main Street barber shop, the line was long
for the three chairs inside. Ruth waited at the back of the line.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb, meanwhile, came into town in a mad dash, like a man trying
to steal second base, gate-crashing the ceremony by climbing over a
railing and jumping down onto the makeshift dance band stage.
</P>
<P>
   Mack, born during the Civil War, stood throughout the
proceedings as resolute as the high, white-starched collar he wore
beneath his three-piece blue suit.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of a baseball Hall of Fame had been created three
years earlier but the museum was built to open in 1939 so that
baseball could mark the 100th anniversary of the game's founding. A
recent special commission verified the allegorical tale that placed
Abner Doubleday in a Cooperstown cow pasture laying out the ground
rules for the game in 1839. And even if subsequent research has
proved those findings specious at best, it went largely
unquestioned 60 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the country's 16 major league ball parks closed for the
day and NBC radio broadcast the festivities nationally. It was 22
days before Lou Gehrig had his famous day at Yankee Stadium, 80
days before Nazi troops would storm Poland, and 186 days before
``Gone With the Wind'' had its Atlanta opening.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen thousand people choked Cooperstown's Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a lot of pictures because none of us could believe this
was happening in our town,'' said Homer Osterhoudt, who as the
21-year-old son of a local farmer worked on the construction of the
three-story brick museum mixing mortar for the three-story colonial
edifice.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Walker, a lifelong Cooperstown resident who has worked
as an attendant at the Hall of Fame for the last nine years,
remembers sitting on her father's shoulders as an 8-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching Babe Ruth walk up Main Street heading for the
barber shop,'' Walker said at the Hall of Fame this week. ``My eyes
were as wide as saucers.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Talbot would become the Hall of Fame's director for 25
years, but in 1939 he was a 14-year-old escorted to Cooperstown by
his father from his nearby home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a pretty big day for a little burg like Cooperstown,''
Talbot said. ``You have to remember there was no TV. It's safe to
say that at least 90 percent of the people there that day had never
seen a major-league game played. I know I hadn't.''
</P>
<P>
   If today's Baseball Hall of Fame induction ceremonies are highly
orchestrated affairs, painstakingly planned to weigh security and a
crush of spectators, the first induction ceremony was folksy,
uncomplicated and homespun.
</P>
<P>
   There was a camaraderie; even Wagner and Cobb, once bitter
rivals, avoided another conflict by avoiding each other.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb, ever the competitor and aware that Ruth had seriously
taken up golf since his baseball retirement four years earlier,
left this note in Ruth's shoe after Ruth had changed to participate
in the exhibition game: ``I can beat you any day in the week and
twice on Sunday at the Scottish game.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike today, when induction ceremony speeches can be emotional
or caustic and almost always lengthy, the speeches delivered by
those honored in 1939 were exceedingly brief.
</P>
<P>
   Mack spoke first and thanked baseball officials, writers and
Cooperstown, among others. Speaker followed Mack to the microphone
and essentially said: ``Connie Mack said it all. Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   When the ceremony ended, the new Hall of Famers and the players
who came to Cooperstown for the exhibition game _ two from each
major league team _ marched in a parade up Main Street to Doubleday
Field, the mythical home of baseball's first game.
</P>
<P>
   There, Wagner and Collins chose sides, doing it sandlot style as
they went up a bat handle, hand-over-hand to decide who chose
first.
</P>
<P>
   And soon Mel Ott was playing catch with Charlie Gehringer. Dizzy
Dean and Lefty Grove were tossing the baseball back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner's team beat Collins' team, 4-2. A highlight was a
pinch-hit appearance by Ruth, who delighted the crowd with mighty
swings, even if the last one was a foul popout.
</P>
<P>
   Cobb went on the radio broadcast with Mel Allen during the game
to explain that he was late for the ceremony because he was looking
for a hotel room. The inductees, after all, were paying their own
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   At the stately Otesaga Hotel after the game, 14-year-old Fred
St. John watched as Ruth puffed on a cigar at the hotel entrance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The maitre d' called the Babe and others in for supper and I
asked Babe if I could take his picture,'' St. John said. ``He was
all alone and I'm trying to line up the photograph. He said: `Wait
a minute. You've got your finger on the lens.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He got me lined up right and I took the picture. He said,
`There, I don't want anybody to take a bad picture of me.'''
</P>
<P>
   The photo is in the Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the train that rumbled into Cooperstown with
guests of honor left with the same passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought it was something that would become a yearly
thing, recognized around the world,'' said Talbot, who along with
the others who witnessed the first induction will participate in a
60th-anniversary celebration tomorrow. ``I just thought it was a
nice day for Cooperstown.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it became the first day that Cooperstown became a word
for baseball immortality.  &QL;

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Computer researchers Thursday reported a
malicious computer program that is spreading rapidly through the
Internet, attacking Microsoft's e-mail programs and destroying
documents created by popular Microsoft software programs, including
Word, Powerpoint, Excel and other applications.
</P>
<P>
   A number of large corporations, including Boeing, A.T.&AMP;T. and
General Electric, said they had computers infected by the program
and moved to limit the damage, in some cases by shutting down their
e-mail systems. Employees of Microsoft, Intel and the anti-virus
software maker Symantec said they had also been hit.
</P>
<P>
   The program, a form of computer attack known as a worm, shows up
an an e-mail attachment. It held the potential to be far more
dangerous than the Melissa computer virus, which spread rapidly in
March as a sort of e-mail chain letter but was not designed to
destroy files.
</P>
<P>
   The new program is known as a worm rather than a virus because
it able to transmit itself through the Internet under its own
power. In contrast viruses spread by hitchhiking by attaching to
documents, programs or disks.
</P>
<P>
   The program, began spreading Wednesday in Europe and the United
States. Several anti-virus software companies said they believed
that the program had originated in Israel, because the first sample
had been discovered in that country.
</P>
<P>
   At AT&AMP;T's headquarters in Basking Ridge, N.J., the company
intercom broadcast an alert at lunch time warning employees that
the program was spreading and a spokesman said he believed that
several hundred computers had been infected within the building.
</P>
<P>
   At the Intel Corp., the program was first discovered during the
day at the company's development facility in Israel and computer
administrators severed networks linking the company to Europe and
the United States to halt the spread of the program, according to
an internal company memo.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives said that they cut off network connections
for several hours on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gone and past, it's a great tornado that zoomed through
and left,'' said Pam Wickham, a spokeswoman at General Electric.
She said the company had been warned on Wednesday and that
anti-virus software had been quickly distributed, minimizing the
impact.
</P>
<P>
   The worm e-mail is particularly dangerous, anti-virus experts
said, because it contains the message: ``I received your e-mail and
I shall send you a reply ASAP. Till then, take a look at the
attached zipped docs. Bye.''
</P>
<P>
   One employee at an e-commerce firm said two of her colleagues
encountered the virus Thursday morning, with one employee losing
all files on his hard drive. The attachment apparently came from an
employee of Microsoft, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The worm is transmitted by Microsoft e-mail programs and uses
those programs' features to spread itself to other computer users
who have sent e-mail messages from the infected machine. Microsoft
officials said they were aware of the attack and were gathering
information on it. During a day a number of anti-virus companies
updated their programs and posted scanning utilities to their web
sites to fend off the attack.
</P>
<P>
   However, anti-virus experts said that the program was difficult
to detect and that the best defense was for computer users to
resist opening electronic mail attachments from strangers.
</P>
<P>
   The worm preys on Microsoft e-mail programs like Outlook,
Outlook Express and Exchange, and other programs that use a
Microsoft protocol called MAPI. It uses those programs' features to
spread itself to other computer users who send mail messages to the
infected machine. The program which comes in an innocuous file
identified as zip_files.exe is an example of a kind of attack known
as a Trojan Horse because it fools computer users into executing a
malicious program by opening the attached mail document.
</P>
<P>
   The program then creates another file named explore.exe that is
launched every time the infected computer is restarted.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of ``social engineering'' relies on the gullability of
computer users who are lulled into believing that the program has
actually been sent as a reply from the person who they recently
sent an electronic mail message.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Explore worm is even worse because you get it from someone
you know,'' said David Chess, a research staff member at the Watson
Research Laboratory in Hawthorne, N.Y. ``People are going to be
lulled into to thinking it is OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the worm establishes itself on a computer, it
systematically searches for documents created by the three programs
that are part of the Microsoft Office Suite, Word, Excel and
Powerpoint as well as some programmers' files and erases them.
</P>
<P>
   Word is the world's most widely used word processing software
and Excel is the most widely used spreadsheet program. PowerPoint
is software for creating graphical business presentations on a
computer screen.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Thursday, experts at anti-virus firms said the new program
represented a disturbing trend in the virus underground which
appears to be developing more lethal programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last few weeks we've begun to see attempts by virus
writers to combine the rapidly spread capability of the Melissa
program with a more destructive payload,'' said Wes Wasson,
director of security product marketing at Network Associates, a
Silicon Valley software developer. He said he expected to see a
number of copycat programs in the future as virus writers attempt
to mimick the Explore program.
</P>
<P>
   Network Associates has recently established ``risk assessment''
guidelines for gauging the danger of new malicious programs and
</P>
<P>
   Wasson said the company had assigned the Explore worm a ``high''
rating, its most threatening category because of its destructive
ability.
</P>
<P>
   The new program is known as a worm rather than a virus because
it able to transmit itself through the Internet under its own
power.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``worm'' was coined by science fiction author John
Brunner in his novel Shockwave Rider. In the novel, worms were
programs created by a rebel group that helped destroy an oppressive
computer network.
</P>
<P>
   Although the new Explore worm does not have the ability to
spread as quickly as the Melissa virus, it still has the capability
to quickly proliferate because an infected machine attempts to
infect any other computer that it receives mail from, computer
researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worm has the ability to create a ping pong effect,'' said
Wasson.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Computer Emergency Response Team at Carnegie
Mellon University in Pittsburgh said Thursday that they were still
assessing the situation and had not decided whether they would
release an alert.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still trying to understand the scope of the problem a
little better,'' said Shawn Hernan, a CERT security expert. He said
that by late in the afternoon on Thursday the security organization
had received only ten reports of worm infections, however, he said
that the program had spread rapidly at the afflicted organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday a number of virus experts said they were puzzled by the
recent destructive bent within the virus writing community. Many of
the programs in the past have been written as a form of cybernetic
graffiti and are annoying but do not do physical damage.
</P>
<P>
   However, a program such as the Explore worm has the power to
destroy years of work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine what these people who write these programs are
thinking,'' said Chess, the IBM researcher.

YANKEES LIKELY TO BE ACTIVE IN TRADE MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Every couple of weeks or so, the Yankees' general
manager, Brian Cashman, touches base with other general managers,
to see what they are looking for, to see what they are offering.
Checking traps, he calls it.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, Cashman will be deeply involved in trade talks as
the Yankees try to refine their roster, plug holes, fill gaps.
Cleveland, the Yankees' primary competition in the American League,
will do the same; the Indians are said to be looking at the likes
of the right-hander Darryl Kile, currently with Colorado, in their
search for a front-line pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have not swapped prospects for an established
veteran since trading for Chuck Knoblauch in February 1998, but
that is probably what will take place before the July 31 trade
deadline. The Yankees' farm system, considered one of the best in
baseball, is teeming with talent even though some of their top
prospects, like pitcher Ryan Bradley, have struggled this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a lot to work with,'' a rival general manager
said. ``It's pretty amazing, considering how much talent they have
in the majors, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashman and manager Joe Torre will continue to evaluate the
needs of the major league club. The Yankees have considered five
left-field combinations this season and are now using the platoon
of the left-handed-hitting Tony Tarasco (who is batting .217) and
the right-handed-hitting Shane Spencer. Chad Curtis, Ricky Ledee
and Spencer all were given opportunities to win the job, and it is
expected that the veteran Darryl Strawberry will be suspended _
perhaps as soon as Friday _ for violating his aftercare program.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with other teams believe that, in the next month, the
Yankees will try to acquire an established left fielder with the
experience to help them in the playoffs. The Cincinnati Reds are in
contention for a playoff spot, but if they were to fall out, they
might make available the left-handed-hitting Michael Tucker or the
right-handed-hitting slugger Greg Vaughn (in the midst of a
disappointing season). The Detroit Tigers will listen to offers for
Bobby Higginson, and Kansas City's Johnny Damon might become too
expensive for the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   If Jason Grimsley and Ramiro Mendoza do not rebound from recent
failures, the Yankees will be in the market for a right-handed
set-up man, along the lines of Minnesota's Mike Trombley or San
Diego's Dan Miceli, and the Yankees could go after Detroit's Doug
Brocail or Todd Jones or Florida's Matt Mantei. There are few
quality left-handed relievers available. Kansas City's Matt
Whisenant throws hard but has been inconsistent, and the Yankees
have expressed interest in Pittsburgh's Jason Christiansen.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have the goods to make deals, though there might be
a few untouchables in their farm system. Alfonso Soriano, signed as
a free agent last year, is batting .336 with 13 home runs and 53
runs batted in for Class AA Norwich. Soriano is a shortstop, but
can play just about any position other than catcher. ``I don't know
if there's a more valuable minor league player in the business
right now,'' said Mark Newman, the Yankees' vice president for
player development and scouting.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Henson, the University of Michigan quarterback playing
third base for Class A Tampa, probably falls into the untouchable
category, along with the young slugger Jackson Melian, also playing
for Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams constantly ask for Bradley, a hard-throwing
right-hander who advanced from Class A to the major leagues last
year. Bradley has had control trouble this season with Columbus,
throwing 10 wild pitches and walking 30 in 65 2/3 innings, and
scouts with two other teams said they were leery of the stress his
delivery might place on his arm. Newman isn't worried. ``He had a
bad outing his last time out, but he had four good games before
that,'' Newman said. ``He's making progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Johnson is an aggressive left-handed-hitting first baseman
playing for Class AA Norwich, and the Yankees like his potential,
but he has a peculiar problem: Johnson keeps getting hit by
pitches, 23 times this year, tying an Eastern League record.
Johnson looms over the plate, and for that reason, the Yankees have
``padded him up,'' said Newman. ``He's the only player in our
system who we've given the Mo Vaughn treatment, pads all over
him,'' Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee has recovered from pneumonia and is trying to shorten his
swing and adapt to breaking balls, but circumstances are such that
Ledee will establish his career elsewhere. Ledee, currently with
Columbus, will remain in the minors for the time being, and because
he will be out of options next spring, the Yankees may look to
trade him in the next seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Donny Leon, a 23-year-old switch-hitting third baseman, might be
the organization's most tradeable commodity. He is batting .309
with nine home runs and 51 RBI at Norwich. Other Yankees prospects
who will be talked about in the weeks ahead: the left-handed
pitcher Ed Yarnall (Columbus), the right-handed pitcher Luis De Los
Santos (currently out with a rib-cage strain), and the right-handed
pitcher Todd Noel, whose fastball was recently clocked at 98 miles
an hour with the Tampa farm team.

CITIES AND STATES TOLD TO ALTER BOOKKEEPING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite public officials' protests, the accounting board that
sets the rules for how cities and states keep their books approved
a plan Thursday that will require governments to include the value
of roads, bridges and other infrastructure in their financial
statements.
</P>
<P>
   The new approach, which for example will require New York City
to value the Brooklyn Bridge and New York state to value 37,000
miles of highways, is part of a 200-page document that sets out new
accounting rules for state and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, praised by taxpayer groups, are aimed at helping
citizens know where their taxes are being spent and whether a
government's financial health is improving or deteriorating. The
rules will also help prevent a common ploy _ a current
administration's shifting costs to the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most significant change to occur in the history of
governmental financial reporting,'' said Tom Allen, chairman of the
seven-member Governmental Accounting Standards Board, which voted
unanimously to approve the new rules. ``Never before has the public
been able to get a comprehensive overview of a state or local
government's finances in one place.''
</P>
<P>
   But, citing the costs of researching assets that were built
decades ago, the Governmental Finance Officers Association vowed
yesterday to try to persuade the accounting board to abandon the
new valuation rule, which begins to take effect in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to do everything we can to get them to rescind
that decision,'' said Jeffrey Esser, executive director of the
association, which has 14,000 members. ``Do we really want to spend
scarce taxpayer dollars to gather this information when we could
instead spend it on education or garbage pickup?''
</P>
<P>
   Other financial experts, however, said they believed that the
cost would be worth the benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman Grossman, a managing director at Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp.,
which rates the quality of governments' financial health, said
disasters like the 1983 collapse of the Mianus River bridge on
Interstate 95 in Connecticut had brought the issue to the attention
of the accounting rule makers, who are based in nearby Norwalk.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules will require governments to determine how many
years their roads, prisons, schools, firetrucks and other major
assets will last, and Grossman said: ``The public should know the
condition of bridges and roads. Neglect of infrastructure brings
added cost to the government in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   But Esser called the new infrastructure rules ``the Full
Employment Act'' for the accountants, consultants and engineers
whom governments will have to hire.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Comptroller Phoebe Selden said the rules would require
the city to install a new computer system to track infrastructure
costs. ``This will take a long time,'' she said. ``We're talking
about our city streets, the curbs, the gutters, the sidewalks.''

DODGERS' START IS FOR THE BIRDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Davey Johnson had pitchers who couldn't pitch and
a catcher who couldn't throw.
</P>
<P>
   He had a clubhouse filled with stars, high-priced and
indifferent, an unpredictable owner and impatient fans with fading
memories of the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds familiar, it should. Johnson's 1996 Baltimore
Orioles yawned through the first four months of the season before
going on a run that got them within a few games of the World
Series. So if you like happy endings, maybe Johnson's first season
as Los Angeles Dodgers manager has a chance.
</P>
<P>
   It might be a little hard to see right now, says the Texas
Rangers' Rafael Palmeiro, Johnson's first baseman in Baltimore. But
if most people feel nothing but disappointment in Johnson's 29-29
club so far, Palmeiro is here to guarantee the Dodgers a place in
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trust me, they'll be there and Davey is the reason,'' said
Palmeiro, who had 142 RBI in 1996. ``Things started a little slow,
but we didn't get going until August. I mean, we came out right
after the All-Star break and were swept by the division leaders
(New York Yankees). How bad does that look?
</P>
<P>
   ``But we never doubted Davey would bring it together. He has
always been a winner and he makes you believe you are a winner,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 55, was beginning a two-year run with the Orioles in
1996 and qualified for the playoffs both seasons. He averaged 96
victories in six full seasons with the New York Mets. His
Cincinnati Reds teams had a .542 winning percentage in three years
and a playoff series victory over the Dodgers in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the respect of everyone who plays for him,'' Palmeiro
said. ``Respect can make or break a manager. It means everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Respect has enabled Johnson to avoid the criticism for the
disappointing season that continues tonight in Oakland with the
first of three games against the A's.
</P>
<P>
   The owners at Fox have come under fire for being heavy handed
and spending too much. Even new general manager Kevin Malone has
been chastised for brash World Series predictions and proclamations
that ``There is a new sheriff in town.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has been fired in New York, Cincinnati and Baltimore.
His confidence often has been called arrogance by owners, but he
always won.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been through some wars,'' Malone said, ``and that
obviously has helped shape the way he approaches his job.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Johnson is in Los Angeles and things are different. Or are
they?
</P>
<P>
   __ The Dodgers and Orioles were prototypes of building through
the farm system in the 1960s and '70s. When the talent pool dried
up, they tried _ mostly unsuccessfully _ to replenish through
trades and free-agent signings.
</P>
<P>
   __ Instead of Todd Hundley, who is drawing boos for his .224
batting average and the inability to throw out baserunners, the
Orioles had Chris Hoiles, who threw out just 15 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   __ The Dodgers might not have a dependable starting pitcher
beyond Kevin Brown, but the Orioles had little other than 19-game
winner Mike Mussina until Scott Erickson and David Wells came on at
the end.
</P>
<P>
   __ There were injuries to both bullpens. The Orioles lost
right-hander Armando Benitez and left-hander Arthur Rhodes for
extended periods. The Dodgers are without Antonio Osuna, whose
elbow surgery Johnson said has broken the link between the starters
and late-inning men Alan Mills and Jeff Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   __ Then there was the issue of clubhouse chemistry, a problem
with the Dodgers since Kirk Gibson left a decade ago. In Baltimore,
lines were starting to form between white and Latin players, many
of whom were becoming upset with double standards applied to Cal
Ripken Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of the obstacles, you have to keep moving, keep
working and always in a positive way,'' Johnson said. ``You have to
get the team believing in what you are trying to do, that your
moves are for the betterment of the team. In 1996 we overcame a lot
because we built confidence in the team that never wavered. That
will happen here, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the 1996 Orioles never dropped below second place in
the American League East, they went from 46-39 to 51-52 during a
three-week span in mid-July to fall 10 games behind the Yankees.
General manager Pat Gillick was ready to unload veterans Wells and
Bobby Bonilla at the July 31 trading deadline, but owner Peter
Angelos killed the deal.
</P>
<P>
   They picked up all-time Orioles great Eddie Murray for the
stretch and he hit his 500th career homer on Sept. 6. They finished
the final 59 games 37-22 and beat Cleveland in the first round of
the playoffs before losing to the Yankees in the American League
Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   But as in Baltimore, where there hadn't been a winner since
1983, Dodgers fans are uncomfortable with the slow start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did it take so long to come together? I guess that is the
$64,000 question,'' said Mills, who pitched in Baltimore from 1992
through last season. ``I don't think teams necessarily jell right
away. The Orioles had been together a while but had a new manager.
The Dodgers are still putting the pieces together.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the most glaring pieces is Hundley, acquired from the New
York Mets for his left-handed power even though he was recovering
from September 1997 reconstructive elbow surgery. He missed most of
spring training and has thrown out just 12 percent of opposing
baserunners.
</P>
<P>
   Hoiles was even worse defensively than Hundley but hit 25 homers
and drove in 73. Although there is not as much running in the
American League, Johnson never let Hoiles' problems infect the
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ran in that league, too,'' Johnson said Tuesday after the
Rangers stole six bases against Hundley. ``But that isn't going to
be the difference between winning and losing this thing. Teams
should be running on us right now. But his problems are more
mechanical than arm strength. By July, he should be OK and there
will be a lot of baseball left.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who played in the last two World Series before signing a
seven-year, $105 million contract last winter, says the key to
Johnson's success is the honesty he shows his players.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no self-promotion, no hidden agendas with him,''
Brown said. ``He isn't in the clubhouse much, he gives players
their room. But he lets them know he will accept nothing less than
winning.''

 &HT;    Ban fought on suits for medical mistakes
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Bonnie Strickland's mother died at 54 when
scar tissue blocked her colon. A doctor diagnosed it as stress, or
gas, until it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a second shock: Under a quirk in Florida law,
Strickland, as a child older than 25, could not sue for pain and
suffering resulting from a medical mistake that killed her parent.
All she could hope to collect was funeral costs, hardly enough to
interest a lawyer in taking the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was outraged by her medical treatment,'' said Strickland, a
St. Petersburg resident. ``When I found out about the law, I didn't
believe it. I walked into a bathroom and got physically sick.''
</P>
<P>
   The law protects doctors and hospitals _ but not airlines, drunk
drivers and virtually everyone else _ from such claims and should
be declared unconstitutional, lawyers for victims' children in two
South Florida cases argued Thursday before the state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Medical professionals contend the law has avoided frivolous
lawsuits and helped keep down overall health-care costs. Plaintiffs
face ``a very heavy burden'' to persuade the court to second-guess
the legislature and grant a right to sue that Floridians never had
before, said Janis Brustures Keyser, a West Palm Beach attorney
representing doctors and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome has relevance to millions of grown-up children of
elderly Floridians and _ to whatever extent it affects
malpractice-insurance rates _ to anyone who pays a medical bill.
Justices questioned both sides extensively Thursday but are not
expected to issue a decision for several weeks or months.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1990, children over 25 had little opportunity to sue for
pain and suffering in the wrongful death of a parent in any
circumstance. The same applied to parents of children over 25 who
died.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Florida legislators voted to allow such lawsuits
against negligent airlines, employers and others _ but protected
doctors and hospitals, who protested that there was a crisis in
malpractice-insurance rates.
</P>
<P>
   Because it arbitrarily leaves out a certain class of people, the
law is ``flawed, irrational and not reasonable,'' attorney Arnold
Ginsberg told the justices. He represents victims' children Lynn
Garber, Nathan Mizrahi and Ava Ruthman in consolidated Miami-Dade
cases against Mount Sinai Medical Center, Parkway Regional Medical
Center and several doctors.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsberg was joined by West Palm Beach lawyers Harriet Rae
Freeman and Theodore Babbitt of the Association for Responsible
Medicine, a victims' rights group.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that the predictions on which the 1990 law was based
were flawed.
</P>
<P>
   A Department of Insurance study projected a rise of 2.5 percent
annually in general liability insurance premiums and 4.5 percent
for malpractice insurance. It's impossible to know how accurate the
second prediction would have been if older children were allowed to
sue, but even the first prediction turned out to be overblown, the
attorneys contended.
</P>
<P>
   The crafting of the 1990 law really came down to politics,
Babbitt said after the hearing _ and there, the medical lobby won
the battle against the trial bar. Attempts to change the law have
been introduced in the legislature during each of the past three
years and have failed.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Medical Association President Glenn Bryan said: ``The
Florida Legislature acted responsibly in passing the 1990 version
of the Florida Wrongful Death Act. The legislature recognized the
extreme volatility of professional liability insurance in Florida
and properly exempted claims for medical malpractice from the
provisions of the act allowing suits for non-economic damages.''
</P>
<P>
   A strong disciplinary system within the profession _ not
lawsuits _ is the best way to hold physicians accountable, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits are ``not the proper means by which physicians should
be held accountable for their actions,'' Bryan said.
</P>
<P>
   The words bring little comfort to Strickland.
</P>
<P>
   ``My case was not frivolous,'' she said. ``My mother suffered
tremendously. I had no clue Florida's law said too bad, there's
nothing you can do.''

A LONG, HOT SUMMER SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Friday, June 11: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Each day seems to bring more dreary news about New York City's
public school system. Unfortunately, these excruciating details
about how poorly many of the city's students fare on new
standardized tests or how badly they perform after graduation have
produced more criticism and plans than promises of extra resources.
</P>
<P>
   The latest proposal from Chancellor Rudy Crew would end social
promotion in grades 3 to 12 after next year. This instant pass-fail
policy could mean that about a third of the city's schoolchildren
would find themselves in summer school. The lucky ones might have
air-conditioning and good teachers, but whatever their educational
draw, if they do not attend regularly and pass a final exam, they
would not move up a grade in September. One estimate is that next
year 360,000 students will attend summer school and 88,000 will
still fail the test.
</P>
<P>
   Some raising of standards in the city schools is definitely
necessary given the poor performance of students on reading,
writing and math tests. But improving the schools will not be as
easy as failing students. Many of these new tests, with strict time
limits and essays that test grammar, give educators far more
information about how well students are understanding math,
learning to read and write creatively and even learning how to
listen.
</P>
<P>
   But money for teacher training, smaller class size and
pre-kindergarten classes is stalled in the state legislature.
Students who fail cannot simply be shoved back into the same
classroom. They need remedial work, another costly item that
requires the attention of state and city budget makers.
</P>
<P>
   Crew started ending social promotion at a reasonable pace this
year by notifying 70,000 children that their attendance at summer
school was mandatory if they wanted to move up a grade in
September. With 130,000 more children also planning to attend
summer school, finding air-cooled classrooms and 10,000 teachers
who are not going on vacation or taking refresher courses has been
a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   But what is merely difficult this summer could be Herculean by
next summer. Without enough political and financial support, an end
to social promotion is little more than a political slogan that
sentences students to a long, hot, unproductive summer.

STATE APPROVES TWO ELECTRONIC GAMING SYSTEMS FOR INDIAN CASINOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT GAVIN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLYMPIA, Wash. _ The state Gambling Commission on Thursday
approved two electronic gambling systems for Indian casinos,
clearing the way for Washington tribes to install what are commonly
called ``cashless slot machines.''
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of the commission vote, the Muckleshoot Indian
Casino near Auburn had 100 of the machines up and running, and
planned to have 325 more operating by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   The Squaxin Island Tribe, which operates a casino near Shelton,
planned to open Friday with 98 machines, and quickly bring the
total to 150.
</P>
<P>
   Both tribes already had completed a rigorous review by the
Gambling Commission and were only waiting for the panel to give
final approval.
</P>
<P>
   The commission voted 3-1 to approve two electronic gambling
systems, one manufactured by Multimedia Games of Tulsa, Okla., and
the other by Sierra Design Group of Reno, Nev. The systems were
licensed after months of technical and legal scrutiny, including
testing at an independent laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   ``These new machines add a whole new dimension to our casino,''
said Virginia Cross, vice chairwoman of the Muckleshoot Tribal
Council. ``The machines will make the Muckleshoot Indian Casino a
destination location. They will add jobs and dollars to Auburn's
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Muckleshoots operate the largest casino in the state and
employ more than 900.
</P>
<P>
   The Squaxin Island Tribe said it hoped the machines will boost
revenues that have lagged behind projections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of revenues in most gaming jurisdictions are from
machines,'' said Dennis Wisner, chief financial officer of the
Squaxin Island casino. ``We're very anxious to add these machines
to help the overall economic viability of the tribe.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gambling Commission approved the electronic systems under an
agreement negotiated last year between Gov. Gary Locke and 12
Indian nations that operate casinos, including the Muckleshoots and
Squaxin Island tribe. The 10 other tribes now will be able to
install either system, once they complete the same pre-operation
review as the Muckleshoot and Squaxin Island casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Seven other tribes that don't have casinos also are covered by
the agreement, which says Indian casinos can operate up to 425
machines in the first year and 675 the second. They also can buy
machines from other tribes, allowing them to operate a maximum of
1,500 machines.
</P>
<P>
   The cashless slots are technically known as video lottery
machines. They are designed to fall within state law, which bans
slot machines, and are described as electronic versions of the
state lottery's scratch tickets.
</P>
<P>
   While said to have the look and feel of slot machines, they have
no lever to pull and no coins are dropped in the slot. Players
instead use electronic cards similar to debit cards to track
winnings and losings. They push buttons or touch screens to
``scratch'' an electronic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Under the federal law that regulates Indian gaming, tribal
casinos can only operate slot machines if allowed by state law. But
one tribe, the Shoalwaters, have defied state and federal
authorities and installed slots in their casino near Willapa Bay.
The federal government has sued.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, The Gambling Commission licensed another
manufacturer of electronic gambling systems, IGT of Reno, Nev.,
which now must submit its system to testing by the both the
commission and an independent laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth manufacturer, a subsidiary of the Oneida Indian Nation
of New York, is seeking licensing. The Oneidas operate a casino
under a state compact similar to Washington's and developed their
own system to fall within New York law, which also bans slots.
</P>
<P>
   Only Indian nations can operate casinos in Washington. The state
Legislature in 1997, however, allowed card rooms to offer
house-banked games, such as blackjack, which has led to the
proliferation of card rooms know as ``mini-casinos.''

EDITORIAL: A LONG, HOT SUMMER SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Friday, June 11: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Each day seems to bring more dreary news about New York City's
public school system. Unfortunately, these excruciating details
about how poorly many of the city's students fare on new
standardized tests or how badly they perform after graduation have
produced more criticism and plans than promises of extra resources.
</P>
<P>
   The latest proposal from Chancellor Rudy Crew would end social
promotion in grades 3 to 12 after next year. This instant pass-fail
policy could mean that about a third of the city's schoolchildren
would find themselves in summer school. The lucky ones might have
air-conditioning and good teachers, but whatever their educational
draw, if they do not attend regularly and pass a final exam, they
would not move up a grade in September. One estimate is that next
year 360,000 students will attend summer school and 88,000 will
still fail the test.
</P>
<P>
   Some raising of standards in the city schools is definitely
necessary given the poor performance of students on reading,
writing and math tests. But improving the schools will not be as
easy as failing students. Many of these new tests, with strict time
limits and essays that test grammar, give educators far more
information about how well students are understanding math,
learning to read and write creatively and even learning how to
listen.
</P>
<P>
   But money for teacher training, smaller class size and
pre-kindergarten classes is stalled in the state legislature.
Students who fail cannot simply be shoved back into the same
classroom. They need remedial work, another costly item that
requires the attention of state and city budget makers.
</P>
<P>
   Crew started ending social promotion at a reasonable pace this
year by notifying 70,000 children that their attendance at summer
school was mandatory if they wanted to move up a grade in
September. With 130,000 more children also planning to attend
summer school, finding air-cooled classrooms and 10,000 teachers
who are not going on vacation or taking refresher courses has been
a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   But what is merely difficult this summer could be Herculean by
next summer. Without enough political and financial support, an end
to social promotion is little more than a political slogan that
sentences students to a long, hot, unproductive summer.

RICK FIELDS, 57, WRITER ON BUDDHISM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rick Fields, a journalist, poet and leading authority on
Buddhism's history and development in the United States, died June
6 at his home in Fairfax, Calif. He was 57.
</P>
<P>
   Fields died of lung cancer, said Helen Tworkov, a longtime
friend and the editor in chief of Tricycle: The Buddhist Review, a
magazine that Field helped found in 1991 and that he worked for as
a contributing editor.
</P>
<P>
   Fields wrote several books, the best known of which is ``How the
Swans Came to the Lake: A Narrative History of Buddhism in
America'' (Shambhala, 1981).
</P>
<P>
   The book traces Buddhism's origins in the nation from Chinese
railroad workers and American transcendentalists like Henry David
Thoreau in the mid-19th century, to Japanese immigrants on the West
Coast at the turn of the century, to the writer Alan Watts and Beat
poets like Allen Ginsberg in the 1950s, to the mass popularity of
Zen Buddhism and the introduction of Tibetan Buddhism in the 1960s
and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   In a revised edition of ``How the Swans Came to the Lake'' that
was published by Shambhala in 1991, an additional chapter details
the fast growth of and broadening interest in Buddhism in the '80s
and early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick Fields was one of our foremost interpreters of Buddhism
for Americans,'' said Robert Thurman, professor of Indo-Tibetan
Studies at Columbia University and the nation's preeminent scholar
on Tibetan Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
   Fields started his journalism career with the Whole Earth
Catalog in 1969. In recent years, he was editor of Yoga Journal and
a contributing editor of New Age Journal. He had previously founded
the Loka Journal and was editor in chief of the Vajradhatu Sun,
which later became the Shambhala Sun. He was also a teacher for
several years at the Naropa Institute's Jack Kerouac School of
Disembodied Poetics in Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   His other books include ``Code of the Warrior'' (HarperCollins,
1991), ``The Awakened Warrior'' (Tarcher, 1994), ``Chop Wood, Carry
Water'' (Tarcher, 1984), ``The Turquoise Bee-Love: Poems of the
Sixth Dalai Lama'' with Brian Cutillo (HarperCollins, 1994) and
``Instructions to the Cook; A Zen Master's Lessons in Living a Life
That Matters,'' with Bernard Glassman (Bell Tower, 1996).
</P>
<P>
   Born Frederick Douglas Fields in Queens, New York City, he was a
track star at Andrew Jackson High School and attended Harvard
University. He was expelled from the university in 1964, said his
wife, Marcia, after an illicit off-campus liaison with a Radcliffe
College student.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dean told him he was a danger to Western civilization,''
Mrs. Fields said.
</P>
<P>
   After college, Fields, who was raised as an atheist, drifted
back to New York and became friendly with Ginsberg and the poet
Gary Snyder. Shortly afterward, he moved to California and became
part of the Zen centers in San Francisco and later in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '70s, he developed an interest in Tibetan Buddhism.
Since 1973, he had been a student of Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche and
other teachers in the Kagyu and Nyingma traditions of Tibetan
Buddhism.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by his parents, Al and
Reva Fields, of Keene, N.H., and his sisters, Laura Jawitz, of
Madison, N.H., and Joanna Bogin, of New Hartford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Fields' most recent book, published in 1997 by Crooked Cloud
Projects, consists of poetry dealing with his cancer. He spent much
of his final five years grappling with the subject from a Buddhist
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a life-threatening disease,'' he said in an
interview with Ms. Tworkov in Tricycle in 1997. ``My life is
threatening my disease, in that it is keeping the disease from
taking over. I have a disease-threatening life.''

GILES RICH, 95, U.S. JUDGE AND PIONEER IN PATENT LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Judge Giles S. Rich, the oldest active federal judge in U.S.
history, who helped draft the nation's patent laws and later, as a
patent judge, became a powerful advocate for the rights of
inventors, died June 9 at a hospital in Washington. He was 95.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was lymphoma, said Federal Judge Raymond C. Clevenger
III, who served with Rich on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Rich was a towering figure in patent and intellectual-property
law for a half-century, playing a leading role in the
transformation from a time when patents were enforced unevenly and
held in suspicion by many jurists, to a time when not only devices
and inventions but also theories and concepts came under protection
by the federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   Among other important decisions, Rich wrote an opinion on
mathematical algorithms, including one that the Supreme Court
declined to review this year, which held that formulations used in
computer programs were patentable. But perhaps his most well-known
opinion was a 1979 decision that held that genetically engineered
bacteria could be protected by patents.
</P>
<P>
   That decision, which was upheld by the Supreme Court,
``basically opened the doors to patent protection in the biotech
industry,'' said Donald Dunner, a longtime patent lawyer in the
Washington, firm Finnegan, Henderson, Farabow, Garrett &AMP; Dunner and
a close friend of Rich. ``Without that holding, we might not have
the biotech industry that we have today.''
</P>
<P>
   His opinions ``were bellwethers, opinions that mark the
boundaries, while lesser judges, like me, fill in the holes,'' said
Clevenger.
</P>
<P>
   Rich also had an enormous impact on his fellow jurists during
his 43 years on the bench, friends and colleagues said, by serving
as a mentor for newer judges who usually had relatively little
expertise in patent law when appointed.
</P>
<P>
   Giles Sutherland Rich was born on May 30, 1904, in Rochester,
N.Y., where his lifelong fascination with patents began. His
father, Giles W. Rich, was a patent lawyer for George Eastman, who
founded Eastman Kodak Co., and the young Rich would often accompany
his father to work and watch him draft patents for Eastman.
</P>
<P>
   During high school, his family moved to Manhattan. He graduated
from the Horace Mann School for Boys in 1922, Harvard College in
1926 and Columbia University School of Law in 1929. He joined his
father's law firm, Williams Rich &AMP; Morse, and by the early 1940s he
had begun lecturing on patent law at Columbia and become a
well-known member of the patent bar.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1950s, his Newtown, Conn., summer home occasionally
became a second office for him and a handful of other patent-law
experts as the site where they drafted much of the Patent Act of
1952, which is still the core of U.S. patent law.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Rich to the
U.S. Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, as the court was then
known. His stature, and that of his court, grew significantly in
1982 when Congress merged the court with the U.S. Court of Claims
and made it the sole place of appeal, prior to reaching the Supreme
Court, for essentially all U.S. District Court cases arising from
patent law.
</P>
<P>
   Rich was still carrying a full case load as late as May, and he
took pride in the length of service on the bench. Two years ago,
when Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote him a letter likening
his longevity to the consecutive-game streak of the famed Baltimore
Orioles shortstop, ``he got a big kick out of it,'' Clevenger
recalled, quoting Judge Rich as having said, ``the chief justice
thinks I'm in the same league with Cal Ripken.''
</P>
<P>
   An accomplished photographer, Rich was also renowned among
patent lawyers and judges for his curiosity and ease with gadgets
and the mechanics of everyday appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Dunner, whose father-in-law had constructed a treasured if
sometimes unreliable grandfather clock, recalled that Rich would
come to his home, oil-squirt-can in hand, to fix it. ``He was
fascinated by how things work,'' he said. ``If he had a case
involving the workings of a receiver or a transmitter or whatever,
he'd go out and buy a little kit and put it together to see how it
would work so he could learn about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The oldest member of the patent court, Rich nonetheless became
the first judge there to use e-mail regularly, Clevenger said.
Until early this week, he added, Rich lay on his hospital bed
reading e-mail messages from friends around the country in between
visits and telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Rich's first wife, Gertrude Verity Rich, died in 1953. He is
survived by his second wife, Helen, of Washington; a daughter,
Verity Hallinan, of Australia; and a granddaughter, niece and
nephew.

REV. H. BOONE PORTER, 76, EPISCOPAL THEOLOGIAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Fla., Kan., Mo.)  (mk) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rev. Dr. Canon H. Boone Porter, an Episcopal theologian and
liturgical scholar who played a leading role in modernizing the
church's Book of Common Prayer in 1979, died last Saturday at
Bridgeport Hospital in Connecticut. He was 76 and lived in
Southport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pneumonia, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Porter was an influential member of the Standing Liturgical
Commission, the panel of church experts who worked from 1960 to
1976 to revise the wording of the Holy Communion service into
plain, common, modern English. He became a principal architect of
the revision, writing most of Eucharistic Prayer A and part of
Prayer B, alternative versions of a major part of the ritual of
consecrating bread and wine.
</P>
<P>
   At his death Porter was senior editor of The Living Church, a
weekly magazine, to which he contributed articles until this year.
He was the magazine's editor and general manager in Milwaukee from
1977 until 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Porter taught at the Episcopal Church's General
Theological Seminary in New York. He was named a professor of
liturgy in 1960, when he established the first doctoral program in
liturgical studies in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970 he joined with former students, many of whom had become
church leaders, to explore the possibilities of liturgical renewal
that they hoped would reach out to minorities and rural Americans.
The group worked on redefining the Episcopal Church's relationships
with its members, an effort reflected in the wording of the new
Book of Common Prayer.
</P>
<P>
   The work of Porter and his committee was extensive and sometimes
controversial because of how much the 1979 revision differed from
centuries-old forms.
</P>
<P>
   The revised prayer book offers two alternative versions of the
communion service, Rite I and Rite II, and the Eucharistic Prayer
in four versions is in Rite II; the prayer is also called the Great
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1923 version of the Book of Common Prayer, in language
essentially unchanged since 1662, the celebrant of the Holy
Eucharist prayed, in part:
</P>
<P>
   ``All Glory be to thee, Almighty God, our heavenly Father, for
that thou, of thy tender mercy, didst give thine only Son Jesus
Christ to suffer death upon the cross for our redemption; who made
there, by his one oblation of himself once offered, a full perfect,
and sufficient sacrifice, oblation, and satisfaction, for the sins
of the whole world.''
</P>
<P>
   As rephrased by Porter, that passage in Eucharistic Prayer A now
reads:
</P>
<P>
   ``Holy and gracious Father: In your infinite love you made us
for yourself; and, when we had fallen into sin and become subject
to evil and death, you, in your mercy, sent Jesus Christ, your only
and eternal Son, to share our human nature, to live and die as one
of us, to reconcile us to you, the God and Father of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stretched his arms upon the cross, and offered himself, in
obedience to your will, a perfect sacrifice for the whole world.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving Milwaukee, Porter, who was over 70 at the time,
became a part-time student at the Yale Forestry School and received
a master's degree in environmental studies in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Boone Porter was born in Louisville, Ky., to a prosperous
family that founded Porter Paint Co. He graduated from Yale in 1947
and entered Berkeley Divinity School in New Haven to start his
studies of liturgy, graduating in 1950. He received a master's
degree in theology from the General Theological Seminary in 1952
and a doctorate from Oxford University in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Porter began his teaching career at Nashotah House Episcopal
Seminary in Wisconsin, where he taught church history, before
returning to General Theological as its first tenured professor of
liturgy. His courses attracted members of the next generation of
church leadership, and while in New York he also sat on committees
of his church's national headquarters in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 52 years, Violet Monser Porter;
three daughters, Charlotte Porter of Island Grove, Fla., Gabrielle
Dennison of Southport, and Clarissa Porter of Fairfield, Conn.;
three sons, H. Boone III, of Prairie Village, Kan., Michael, of
Summit N.J., and the Rev. Canon Nicholas Porter of Paris; a
stepbrother, William Wood of Captiva Island, Fla.; a stepsister,
Doris Spaulding of Louisville, and eight grandchildren.

EDITORIAL: GETTING THE FACTS ON RACIAL PROFILING 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Friday, June 11: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has made it clear that he finds racial
profiling, the targeting of suspects by race or ethnic background,
morally indefensible. On Wednesday he ordered federal law
enforcement agencies to find out ``exactly who is being stopped and
why'' by collecting more precise data on the race and gender of the
people they stop to question.
</P>
<P>
   The new executive order amounts to an acknowledgment that racial
profiling is a matter of concern not only for local police
departments but federal agencies as well, including customs,
immigration and drug enforcement agents. The federal Customs
Service has already begun a review of its inspection process
following persistent complaints that black and Hispanic people are
unfairly singled out for searches at airports and border crossings.
Clinton also strongly endorsed legislation sponsored by two
Democrats, Rep. John Conyers Jr. of Michigan and Sen. Frank
Lautenberg of New Jersey, that would provide funds to encourage
states to collect data on police stops.
</P>
<P>
   While there have been no nationwide studies analyzing the rate
of stops and searches by race, the anecdotal evidence strongly
suggests that racial profiling is a widespread problem. Moreover,
narrower surveys in New Jersey, Maryland and elsewhere have
produced findings that Conyers has called ``too outrageous to be a
mere coincidence.'' Requiring law enforcement agents to gather more
factual data is a useful if modest step toward raising their
consciousness about bias and developing a consensus around steps to
address it. &QL;

DEATH ORIGINALLY RULED ACCIDENTAL BECOMES A MURDER CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE LAMOY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Kan. _ On a cold, cloudy day three months ago,
family members found Patricia Noone at the bottom of a wooded
embankment near a creek across the street from her home.
</P>
<P>
   Noone, a 61-year-old widow, was lying between two logs, a tree
branch across her body. The mother of seven was wearing slacks and
a blouse, but no winter coat.
</P>
<P>
   She had disappeared 18 hours earlier from her home in the 1600
block of North 36th Street, about four blocks south of Parallel
Parkway and east of Interstate 635.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Noone had been outside all night, a night when
temperatures plunged to 29 degrees. Her body temperature was about
65 degrees when she arrived at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   She could not be revived.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Wyandotte County Coroner Alan Hancock ruled Noone's
death accidental.
</P>
<P>
   But Kansas City, Kan., police detectives considered her death
suspicious and refused to drop the case.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Wyandotte County District Attorney Nick Tomasic
charged Matthew Miles McSpadden with second-degree murder and
Noone's daughter, Hayley Evans _ McSpadden's girlfriend _ with
aiding a felon.
</P>
<P>
   Noone lived with McSpadden, 35, and Evans, 37. Both remained in
the Wyandotte County Detention Center Thursday. McSpadden's bond is
$100,000; Evans' is $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   McSpadden and Evans did not have attorneys as of Thursday and
could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Noone's oldest son, Rickey Noone, said McSpadden, Evans and
Noone apparently argued on March 10 and that Noone might have been
assaulted.
</P>
<P>
   Noone left the house about 6 p.m. March 10 and was found about
noon March 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how she got there (in the wooded area),''
Tomasic said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The break in the case came late last month when police received
a tip. They refused to reveal the tip or where it came from.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put enough feelers out there and everyone knows you're
trying to solve this,'' said Police Det. Greg Lawson. ``Eventually
somebody comes forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Police and Rickey Noone said that after family members found
Noone, an ambulance crew took her to Bethany Medical Center, where
emergency room personnel tried to revive her. She was pronounced
dead at 3:11 p.m. Detectives were notified about 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the call came in, it was nothing more than an elderly
person who walked away from a house,'' Lawson said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawson and Det. Bill Howard interviewed McSpadden and Evans and
some other family members at the hospital. They told the detectives
that Noone had left the house after an argument the previous day.
McSpadden and Evans reported her missing about 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Rickey Noone said Evans and McSpadden told him they had argued
with his mother before she left the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first it seemed reasonable (that she walked out), because I
knew they were in a fight,'' said Noone, who talked to detectives
at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock ruled Noone's death accidental, with the cause being
hypothermia. His autopsy report also noted, however, that Noone had
several small bruises she had suffered over several days before her
death. She also had fractured ribs and a bruise on the right side
of her forehead. Toxicology tests revealed that Noone had alcohol
and sedatives in her system when she died.
</P>
<P>
   Although Noone could have suffered the head wound during a fall,
it was the various other bruises that made detectives wonder
whether they had a case of elder abuse on their hands, Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   So the detectives kept Noone's file on their desk, following up
on leads as they surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we called it suspicious is because of the
circumstances,'' Howard said. ``She didn't have Alzheimer's, and
the position of her clothes and her body caused us not to think it
was an accident or a suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, detectives said, interviews with McSpadden and
Evans revealed small inconsistencies, which fueled police
suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Rickey Noone also was suspicious, but he didn't have
any evidence to give detectives.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he knew that his mother never would leave the house
without her purse, which she apparently did on March 10. She also
would have worn a coat, he said, because it was cold that evening.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Noone said, his mother wouldn't have walked into a
wooded area because she had diabetes and was unstable on her feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a case of elder abuse,'' Noone said.

 Fathering Court is helping men becoming better dads  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERICA THESING  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Steve McMichael smiled Thursday as he
graduated from a program that uses counseling, education and social
services instead of jail to make men into better fathers.
</P>
<P>
   McMichael was one of Jackson County Fathering Court's first five
graduates. The program began in March 1998 as an alternative to
jail for fathers delinquent in their child-support payments. It now
includes 45 men who are getting help with everything from job
training to transportation to housing.
</P>
<P>
   When the Jackson County prosecutor's office started the program,
Jane Knitzer, deputy director of the National Center for Children
in Poverty, called the effort unique, broad and interesting.
</P>
<P>
   It reflects a shift from jailing so-called deadbeat dads.
Experts have questioned that practice because jailed fathers cannot
earn money to pay child support.
</P>
<P>
   And the Fathering Court has some successes.
</P>
<P>
   Before enrolling in the program, none of the 45 men was
regularly paying child support. Now 26 are paying support, 30 are
working and 31 are spending time with their children. If the other
fathers stay on track, they, too, will earn a diploma from
Fathering Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely think it's made me a better person and a better
parent,'' McMichael said. ``I've got a new lease on life.''
</P>
<P>
   McMichael said that he had a $40,000-a-year job with the Post
Office when he divorced in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   At first, he paid child support regularly, but became depressed
after his divorce and left his Post Office job. He bounced through
other jobs and ended up living out of his car because he could not
afford a place of his own. Still he tried to make his child-support
payments, but fell behind.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1997 he wound up in court. At that time, the
fathering program was still on the planning table. When it was
ready a few months later, so was McMichael.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't have dug myself out of that hole by myself. Keep
the program going,'' he said. ``It was an opportunity for me to
turn myself around.''
</P>
<P>
   McMichael has now been paying child support for one year and is
employed full time. He said that he is also spending more time with
his sons, ages 12, 14 and 16. He wants them to avoid their father's
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the program, some fathers attended regular
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really helped me pay more attention to my kids,'' McMichael
said. ``Now I try and listen real hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Franklin of the National Center for Fathering held 15
two-hour sessions for McMichael and his peers. The participants
talked about their childhoods and their aspirations as fathers.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin said he learned some things from McMichael.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who would live in their car to support their children
_ that said a lot to me and to all of us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Beaird, Jackson County prosecutor, said he believes the
Fathering Court is the only program of its kind in the country. He
hopes it can serve as a national model and can expand to include
more than 50 participants, the current maximum number.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five (graduates) is a small number. We know that,'' Beaird
said. ``We're going to increase it and increase it and increase it
until we've got a program that's the pride of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fathering Court is supported by 30 local agencies. It costs
the county nothing. To expand it, the county is looking toward
national funding or government grants, said Melissa Mauer-Smith,
director of the family support division for the prosecutor's
office.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri divisions of family services and child-support
enforcement operate a similar program for noncustodial parents of
children on welfare. Parents Fair Share helps those parents _
usually fathers _ improve their education, find jobs, pay child
support and become more active in their children's lives. Hundreds
of Jackson Countians have participated.
</P>
<P>
   In the prosecutor's program, fathers are eligible for graduation
when they have held a job for several months, paid child support
for several months and are visiting their children regularly,
Mauer-Smith said. All charges related to child-support delinquency
are dropped at graduation, but that doesn't end the fathers'
connections to the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in this program have had trouble facing the
responsibility of a life they created,'' Beaird said. ``Our hope is
that we don't have to deal with them in a criminal setting (again),
but we're there. If they stumble, we're there for them.''

ADVERTISING: TWO LARGE AGENCIES REVAMP TO SERVE CLIENTS WORLDWIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.) (rk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two big agencies are embarking on reorganizations
that are indicative of the changes being made by Madison Avenue to
meet the needs of clients who market products and services
globally.
</P>
<P>
   One agency is D'Arcy Masius Benton &AMP; Bowles Communications in
New York, part of MacManus Group, which is combining
responsibilities for four regions into a trans-Atlantic operation
to be headed by two top executives.
</P>
<P>
   The other agency is McCann-Erickson North America, a unit of
McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, which is combining its two
agencies in San Francisco into a single shop named
McCann-Erickson/A&AMP;L, with billings estimated at $335 million.
</P>
<P>
   The DMB&AMP;B reorganization, effective immediately, unites
oversight for North America, Europe, the Middle East and Africa
under John Farrell and Susan Gianinno, who will share the title of
president for the new trans-Atlantic region.
</P>
<P>
   Farrell, 41, who had been president at DMB&AMP;B North America, also
becomes regional chief executive for the new regional operation.
Ms. Gianinno, 49, who had been chief branding officer and global
marketing director for DMB&AMP;B, will retain her worldwide branding
duties.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Selkowitz, chairman and chief executive at DMB&AMP;B,
described the reorganization as the largest undertaken by the
agency since it was formed in 1985 by the merger of Benton &AMP; Bowles
with D'Arcy MacManus Masius. DMB&AMP;B has billings estimated at $5.8
billion from clients like Coca-Cola, General Motors, Mars and
Procter &AMP; Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really changing how we work,'' Ms. Gianinno said
Thursday in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to make the borders between offices and regions
more invisible,'' she added, ``linking offices together to access
talent more broadly and open up opportunities to design service
offerings around clients, who are increasingly global.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrell, who joined Ms. Gianinno for the interview, said that an
earlier reorganization at DMB&AMP;B North America had helped that
regional office land new accounts including Capital One,
Firstsource.com, Ernst &AMP; Young and Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping to replicate some of the success, and the
different ways of working, on a broader basis,'' Farrell said.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, two executives will add the duties of regional
chief executive to their portfolios: Paulo Salles, 43, president at
DMB&AMP;B Latin America in Sao Paulo, Brazil, and Garry Titterton, 50,
president at DMB&AMP;B Asia-Pacific in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Also, David Jones, 52, who had been president at the United
Kingdom Group at DMB&AMP;B in London, will take the new post of
European client service director. There will no longer be a British
agency group post, nor will there be a replacement for Johan
Hofstra, who resigned abruptly last month as president for Europe,
the Middle East and Africa; his duties are being assumed by Farrell
and Ms. Gianinno.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore the message DMB&AMP;B is seeking to convey about the
extent of the reorganization, as of September its ``short-form
brand'' _ the nickname the agency uses informally _ will be changed
to D'Arcy from DMB&AMP;B The formal corporate name remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to McCann-Erickson, which is part of the McCann-Erickson
World Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, the
agencies being combined in San Francisco are McCann-Erickson San
Francisco, with estimated billings of $205 million, and Anderson &AMP;
Lembke, with estimated billings of $130 million.
</P>
<P>
   The merger comes two weeks after the two agencies teamed up to
win a large account from the Microsoft Corp., handing the
introduction of the Windows 2000 operating system in the United
States. McCann-Erickson/A&AMP;L will also work for clients including
Hewlett-Packard, Nestle, Safeway and SGI, formerly Silicon
Graphics.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Bishop, 37, a longtime McCann-Erickson executive who has
been president and chief executive at Anderson &AMP; Lembke, was named
executive vice president and chief executive at
McCann-Erickson/A&AMP;L. Ron Benza, 46, executive vice president and
general manager at McCann-Erickson San Francisco, is leaving to
consider opportunities in high-technology marketing, he said, after
exploring other posts at McCann-Erickson.
</P>
<P>
   The merger marks the disappearance of the full Anderson &AMP; Lembke
name; the agency's New York office was absorbed in March by an
Interpublic sibling, Angotti, Thomas, Hedge.
</P>
<P>
   But if DMB&AMP;B wants to go by D'Arcy, what's to prevent
McCann-Erickson/A&AMP;L deciding one day to rename itself
McCann-Anderson or even Lembke-Erickson? On second thought, wasn't
Lembke Erickson that famous Viking explorer?

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL SULLIVAN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
DALLAS _ Dallas Stars coach Ken Hitchcock talked of desperation. He
suggested his team might squeeze off 70 shots, if that's what it
took to dominate The Dominator. His Stars, in turn, assured a more
determined effort than they gave in the opening game of these
Stanley Cup Finals.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Desperation took more than 57 minutes to make a difference
Thursday night, but the Stars won't quibble about the wait. At the
end of a tense evening at Reunion Arena, Brett Hull's shot beat
Dominik Hasek at 17:10 of the third period, providing the
game-winner as Dallas beat the Buffalo Sabres 4-2 to even the
series at one game apiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to keep sending something at the net and
make something happen,'' said Hull, who watched linemate Mike
Modano leave the ice with about 10 minutes to play after injuring
his left wrist when he was checked into the boards.
</P>
<P>
   Hull finally made something happen. And for the Stars, it was
none too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Game 3 is Saturday night in Buffalo, but Dallas assured itself
of bringing the series back to Texas, which was by no means a
certainty for much of the evening. An empty-net goal by Derian
Hatcher with 25.8 seconds left gave the Stars a cushion, but it
came on the heels of a scramble on the other end in which Ed
Belfour struggled to keep the Sabres from sending another game to
OT.
</P>
<P>
   It was every bit that close, and a heavily favored Dallas team
had to feel fortunate about not leaving town with a 2-0 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a heck of a series,'' Hitchcock said. ``It's going to be
this way all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano, said Hitchcock, is day-to-day with an injury the coach
termed ``not serious.''
</P>
<P>
   A relatively uneventful first period ended on a livelier note as
emotions spilled over at the horn. Hasek, who earlier drew a charge
from Brian Skrudland in the corner, went down again when Modano
flipped him near the crease in the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough for guys to get out of the way all the time,''
Hatcher said. ``I know for a fact that Dominik is one to take the
odd dive here and there.''
</P>
<P>
   The ensuing mini-melee was much ado about nothing, because the
penalties canceled each other out. Still, the emotional ante
clearly had been raised after a relatively civil Game 1 and an
additional 20-minute standoff.
</P>
<P>
   If anyone responded to that early in the second period, it were
the Sabres, and Buffalo finally got tangible results.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Woolley, who scored the game-winner in overtime in Game 1,
was handling the puck at the point near the end of a power play
when he spotted Michael Peca alone across ice on the other side of
the net. Woolley slipped a pass that found its way through the
defense and Peca wristed a quick shot over a sliding Belfour,
making it 1-0 at 7:27 of the period.
</P>
<P>
   That lead held up for more than 10 minutes, including another
failed Dallas power play that drew boos from an increasingly
frustrated Reunion crowd. But the Stars came alive in the final two
minutes, and Jamie Langenbrunner evened the score when he deflected
a Richard Matvichuk blast by Hasek at 18:26 to even things up
entering the final 20 minutes of regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, though, Buffalo was having the best of it. The Sabres
had outshot the Stars 17-12 and had killed three more Dallas power
plays.
</P>
<P>
   A tripping penalty against Alexei Zhitnik at the end of the
second gave Dallas another power play chance to open the third, but
the Stars again failed to capitalize, making it 13 consecutive
successful kills for Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas got a rare goal from defenseman Craig Ludwig early in the
third to take a 2-1 lead, but it didn't last long. Within a minute,
Daryl Sydor was in the penalty box for a high stick, and Zhitnik
made the Stars pay when he picked up the rebound of a Curtis Brown
slap shot and poked it by Belfour to again tie the score at 2.
</P>
<P>
   The game seemed headed to overtime as the Stars flailed away,
but Hull finally found a bit of open space just inside the post and
blasted a shot past Hasek to allow Dallas to escape with the split.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just kept coming,'' Hitchcock said.

CASH COW SOON MIGHT BE A STRETCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) The administration's view of tobacco as a cash cow
calls for an economics lesson relating to the concept of
elasticity.
</P>
<P>
   As the GOP majority in Congress mulls deep cuts in domestic
programs such as education and health care to stay within mandated
spending caps, the White House budget director has urged a
revenue-enhancing alternative. High on his list is yet another hit
on smokers to raise about $8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Personal feelings about the merits of tobacco use aside, this
approach to tax policy gives irrationality a bad name. Its problem
is that it ignores the question of how large the cigarette tax
burden must get before smokers stop allowing government to rip them
off.
</P>
<P>
   When economists consider such matters, they do so in the context
of price elasticity of demand. It's used to quantify a consumer's
sensitivity to prices by measuring the change in demand for a good
or service as its price rises or declines.
</P>
<P>
   If, for example, demand for something is relatively elastic,
raising its price can be expected to reduce demand. If this sounds
counterintuitive, think of the situation as one where consumers are
flexible when it comes to need for the particular good. They may
cut consumption or substitute something else.
</P>
<P>
   If demand for something is relatively inelastic, on the other
hand, the effect of a price boost won't be as significant. This is
true, however, only up to a point, and defining that point is
tricky work.
</P>
<P>
   Those whose life's work has become enhancing government revenue
by taxing cigarettes have found smokers an inelastic lot. Despite
escalating taxes sending the cost of cigarettes into the
stratosphere, many Americans refuse to be deterred by the soaring
cost of their habit.
</P>
<P>
   This has led those in revenue-enhancing circles to assume the
sky's the limit as far as cigarette taxes are concerned. Facing a
fiscal challenge in Washington? No problemo. Just slap another few
billion dollars worth of tax levies on hapless smokers. Not only
will smokers put up with anything, but they also are one of the few
species unprotected by political-correctness constraints.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, however, inelasticity will start to turn elastic.
Those who can't afford the added cost will quit. Many for whom
money isn't a problem will also quit rather than allow themselves
to be cynically abused by their government.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the substitution option, but what substitutes for
cigarettes? Since corn silk and coffee grounds aren't acceptable
alternatives, what gets substituted is the source of the product.
When the price of legal cigarettes becomes too high, it's
reasonable to expect the emergence of a cigarette black market.
Where the illegal supply would come from remains to be seen, but
humankind has always been very creative in these matters.
</P>
<P>
   Government uses economists to figure price elasticities, and it
would be interesting to know whether the administration is
consulting them in its quest to see how long this golden goose can
be flogged before it dies.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, what makes this policy approach all the more bizarre
is that government pursues fairly expensive efforts to discourage
smoking while simultaneously using it as a cash cow.
</P>
<P>
   Go figure.

N.J. ASSEMBLY APPROVES PARENTAL NOTIFICATION BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ New Jersey moved closer Thursday to enacting its
first significant restriction on abortion in decades as the General
Assembly passed a bill that would require girls under 18 to notify
their parents before they can receive an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which received enthusiastic support from the
Assembly speaker, Jack Collins, is also expected to win approval in
the state Senate. If it passes, New Jersey would be the 38th state
to require that teen-agers receive parental notification or
parental consent to obtain abortions. Texas has approved a similar
bill, which is to take effect on Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey bill marks a departure for Gov. Christie Whitman.
She had been a staunch supporter of abortion rights who has opposed
parental notification in the past, but she has agreed to sign it.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion opponents hailed the vote, which was 59-17, and said
they hoped it signaled a turning point in the abortion debate in
New Jersey, which has historically had some of the most
unrestrictive abortion laws in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the polls show a shift in our favor, that a majority of
New Jersey residents now support some restrictions on abortion,''
said Marie Tasy, director of New Jersey Right to Life. ``The laws
are now starting to reflect that. It started two years ago, with
the partial-birth abortion vote, and now it has escalated with
this.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Legislature passed a ban on an abortion procedure
that its opponents call partial-birth abortion by overriding
Whitman's veto, but the governor has successfully challenged the
measure in court.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said last month that she supported the parental
notification bill after changes were made to broaden the
circumstances under which a judge could grant a waiver of the rule.
For instance, a teen-ager would be allowed to have an abortion if
she seemed mature enough to make that decision herself. And the law
would not apply to married teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion rights supporters, who were stunned late last month
when conservatives introduced the proposal and quickly won the
governor's support, vowed to continue lobbying against the parental
notification bill. Elizabeth Volz, president of the New Jersey
chapter of the National Organization for Women, said it was
irresponsible for state leaders to appeal to conservative voters by
restricting a young woman's access to a safe abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not stand by as young women are returned to the bad
old days of fear, humiliation and botched abortions,'' Ms. Volz
said.
</P>
<P>
   She said her group has tried to persuade the governor to reverse
her position in recent days to no avail. So NOW and other groups
that support abortion rights will conduct an emergency
demonstration on the State House steps on Monday in an effort to
sway state senators to oppose the bill. The Senate is expected to
vote on the bill next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were shocked by what the governor did,'' Ms. Volz said.
``Christie Whitman has always been pro-choice. So everyone was
stunned to see her take such an anti-choice position.''
</P>
<P>
   The notification bill is one of five pieces of legislation
introduced by conservatives last month in an effort to win
concessions from Whitman, who needs right-wing support for her race
for the U.S. Senate next year.
</P>
<P>
   In another action Thursday, the Assembly, whose members are up
for re-election this year, passed another conservative social
initiative: a bill that would mandate that teachers and students in
public schools begin each day by reciting the second paragraph of
the Declaration of Independence.
</P>
<P>
   Two other pieces of legislation proposed by conservatives are
likely to be voted on before the Legislature begins its summer
recess later this month. One would require sex-education
instructors to teach that abstinence is the only fail-safe way to
avoid contracting the HIV virus. The other would require parental
consent before a minor could get a tattoo. Another bill, which
would ban gay marriages, is unlikely to clear its committee before
the fall, said John Tomicki, executive director of the League of
American Families, who has coordinated the conservative legislative
blitz.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman John Rooney, who sponsored the parental notification
bill, said the measures were both good policy and sound politics.
Rooney, a Republican from Bergen County, said the notification bill
was primarily intended to protect parents, who he said should have
the right to be informed before their children make a major life
decision and undergo a complicated medical procedure.

   Laurie Lowenstein, executive director of Right to Choose, said
that if the notification measure is passed by the state Senate and
is signed into law as expected, it will mark the most momentous
setback for abortion rights since 1982, when the Legislature voted
to ban the use of public funds for abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Parental notification laws have survived court challenges in
many states. But Ms. Lowenstein said, ``The Legislature's action in
1982 was overturned in court, and we think this one is
unconstitutional, too.''

JUDGE DENIES KAUFFMANS' 1991 TAX REFUND CLAIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN T. DAUNER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Kan. _ A federal judge Thursday ruled that the
Ewing and Muriel Kauffman estates were not entitled to a tax refund
of nearly $22 million stemming from the buyback of Avron B.
Fogelman's interest in the Kansas City Royals.
</P>
<P>
   In a summary judgment, U.S. District Judge John W. Lungstrum in
Kansas City, Kan., ruled that on their 1991 joint tax return the
Kauffmans could not write off $35.8 million as a bad debt that they
said resulted from a $34 million loan on which Fogelman defaulted.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing Kauffman died in 1993, and Muriel Kauffman died in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   After the deduction was rejected by the Internal Revenue
Service, the Kauffman estates paid $22.8 million in taxes and
interest in 1995 _ most but not all of which was related to the
bad-debt claim _ and then filed suit in 1997 for a refund.
</P>
<P>
   The purported loan was the culmination of a complex series of
financial transactions that began in 1983 with the goal of Fogelman
eventually becoming majority owner of the Royals. It was derailed
in the late 1980s when his Memphis, Tenn., real estate empire
encountered severe financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   The purported loan was secured by 50 percent of the Royals stock
held by Fogelman. The stock was redeemed by the Royals in 1991
after Fogelman defaulted.
</P>
<P>
   The $34 million transaction was set up as a loan and designed to
protect Fogelman's stock, his only unencumbered asset, from his
creditors, who might try to grab it and sell or move the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   The Kauffmans said the Royals stock in 1991 had no value because
an attempt to sell the team at auction in December 1990 brought no
bids that would cover the Royals' existing financial obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Based on that claim, the Kauffmans took the entire $34 million,
plus interest, as a bad-debt deduction.
</P>
<P>
   Lungstrum found that under federal tax laws the transaction with
Fogelman was not a loan _ despite the way it was set up _ but a
stock redemption on which no deduction could be claimed.
</P>
<P>
   Before the transaction, in July 1990, Fogelman agreed to give up
any right to retain an ownership interest in the Royals even if he
had paid off the so-called loan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence in this case ... adds up to the legal conclusion
that the ($34 million) transaction was a redemption of Mr.
Fogelman's stock and not a bona fide debt,'' Lungstrum wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said Fogelman ``had no incentive or obligation to
repay his purported debt in `money,' and he parted with all of the
burdens and ... benefits of his Royals interest.''
</P>
<P>
   After recovering full ownership of the team, Ewing Kauffman left
the team to a charitable organization.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley D. Sears, the lawyer representing the Kauffman estates,
said he had not had time to study the ruling and could not comment.
The Kauffman estates are expected to appeal the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Justice said the
department did not comment on tax cases.
</P>
<P>
   Lungstrum gave the parties until July 17 to notify him if there
are any unresolved issues in the case.

BUSINESSMAN CONVICTED OF FRAUD BUT JURY DEADLOCKS ON PYRAMID
SCHEME 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LESLIE EATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Patrick R. Bennett, the businessman accused of
orchestrating one of the largest financial swindles in U.S.
history, was convicted Thursday of fraud and money laundering by a
federal jury in Manhattan _ but not of running a Ponzi scheme, a
charge that was at the heart of the indictment against him.
</P>
<P>
   The jury reported that it was deadlocked over 11 securities and
mail fraud charges that related to the operation of Bennett's
company, Bennett Funding Group, in Syracuse, which purported to
finance leases on office equipment like copiers and fax machines.
Prosecutors contend that the company was basically a giant Ponzi,
or pyramid, scheme that defrauded more than 10,000 investors, many
of them elderly people living in New York, New Jersey and Florida,
out of more than $600 million before it collapsed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Judge John Martin declared a mistrial on the unresolved charges;
prosecutors have not yet decided whether they will retry Bennett,
said Herbert Hadad, a spokesman for Mary Jo White, the U.S.
attorney for the Southern District of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's deadlock marked the second time a jury has been
unable to reach a verdict on those charges; in early March, a
different jury failed to reach a verdict on any of the charges in
the case except for some _ involving perjury and obstruction of
justice _ to which Bennett confessed on the witness stand. He did
not testify in the latest trial, which began in May.
</P>
<P>
   The charges Bennett was convicted of Thursday involved illegal
money manipulation and securities fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett faces a sentence of more than 20 years in prison on
those charges, and he was ordered to forfeit $109 million, money
his lawyers say he does not have.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Gombiner, one of Bennett's lawyers, said Bennett planned to
appeal the verdict. ``We think there are some significant legal
issues involving their failure to reach a verdict'' on the
underlying leasing issues, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett's lawyers described him as an inept businessman who was
overwhelmed by his rapidly growing company, rather than a criminal
mastermind. They did not deny that investors had lost huge sums
investing in Bennett leases and other securities, but suggested
that some of Bennett's business associates may have been
responsible for any fraud. Several of them, including Bennett's
brother, Michael, have pleaded guilty to various charges in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   The unresolved charges involved the assignment of office
equipment leases to investors, who were to receive monthly income.
The government contended that many investors were assigned
nonexistent leases, or leases whose income was committed to other
investors. In a Ponzi scheme, some of the money put in by later
investors is used to make payments to earlier investors, and some
is siphoned off by the scheme's operators.
</P>
<P>
   Martin revoked Bennett's bail and ordered him imprisoned
immediately, a move which some lawyers said is unusual for
white-collar defendants who have not yet been sentenced.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Bennett ``a totally amoral individual who would engage
in any criminal conduct that would benefit him in any way,'' Martin
said he was concerned that if Bennett remained out on bail, ``he
would look for some scheme to get money he needed without any
concern for the impact on others.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin warned Bennett that trying to keep any of the assets he
had acquired as a result of the fraud could lead to a longer prison
sentence. ``If, when we get to the time of sentencing, I find Mr.
Bennett and his family trying to hang on to money taken by this
massive fraud, that act will have consequences,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge may also impose fines, and require Bennett to pay
restitution to his victims. The victims may also apply to the
Justice Department to try to claim any money that Bennett forfeits
as a result of his conviction on the money-laundering charges.
</P>
<P>
   But whether he has any money to forfeit is unclear. Bennett owns
a large house outside Syracuse. Prosecutors said he spent millions
of dollars he took from Bennett Funding buying a local horse racing
track, hotels and several gambling enterprises. Breeden said he
believes the Bennett family has assets hidden overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett has said he is indigent.

 &HT;    University of Texas chancellor announces resignation
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ William Cunningham, a leading figure in Texas
higher education for the past 14 years, stunned lawmakers, faculty
and many others Thursday when he announced he will resign next year
to pursue interests in the business world.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, who has been chancellor of the 15-campus University
of Texas System since 1992 and was UT-Austin president the seven
years before that, said he is leaving ``the best job in the world''
because the system is in good shape and he wants to explore a new
career. He and his bosses _ the UT System Board of Regents _ said
the decision to resign by Aug. 31, 2000, was entirely Cunningham's.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, 55, is credited with extending higher education
opportunities in South Texas, raising the system's profile and
effectively courting donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sad to see him leave,'' said regents' Chairman Donald
Evans. ``He's an extraordinary leader for the UT System and the
state of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some lawmakers and others said privately that he
clashed with some legislators during the pressure-filled
legislative session that just ended. Cunningham also must work with
a Board of Regents that is drastically different than the one that
hired him as chancellor, when Democrat Ann Richards was governor.
The new board consists entirely of Republican Gov. George W. Bush's
appointees.
</P>
<P>
   Evans, a close friend of Bush's, said he has grappled with false
rumors for the past two years that Bush wanted a new chancellor _ a
claim Bush's office also denied.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was absolutely 100 percent Dr. Cunningham's decision,''
Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   Regent Patrick Oxford said the board never discussed the
possibility of changing chancellors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the way to look at it is from his perspective,''
Oxford said. ``He's got to deal with new sets of regents every
year, the legislative sessions are brutal, more and more so. He had
a good session and this gave him the opportunity to leave on a high
note.''
</P>
<P>
   Oxford and Evans said it was premature to talk about a
successor, and the system's No. 2 official, Vice Chancellor Ed
Sharpe, would not say whether he is interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``No comment,'' Sharpe said. ``The board will make that
decision. ... As for Bill, he has given careful thought to this,
and I understand his decision and respect his reasons. I really
think he has a good sense of timing...and is going out on top.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, known for his optimism and ability to charm
audiences, was upbeat when he announced his decision at a crowded
news conference in the board's spacious meeting room. He said the
decision was a hard one because he loves his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing I like better than a crisis or a problem to
solve,'' he said, adding that he wished he could have done more to
increase college graduation rates _ a major problem in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview later, he said he told his only child, John, a
senior at Texas A&AMP;M University, that it was time for him to try
something different, perhaps a career in electronic commerce or
some other business opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, 'Dad, you deserve it,''' Cunningham said, his eyes
starting to fill up. He said having the support of his son _ whom
he once said he wished he had spent more time with _ ``made me feel
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, a quintessential manager of information, made calls
throughout the day along with his staff to lawmakers and other
state leaders, letting them know of the decision.
</P>
<P>
   As the chief executive of one of the largest and most complex
university systems, Cunningham spoke of his accomplishments _
greatly expanding higher education into South Texas, offering
degree programs on the Internet, instituting a cost-savings
initiative throughout the UT System, raising endowments and helping
to win a record $1.2 billion in new dollars for higher education
from the Legislature this year.
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders credited Cunningham with fostering Austin's
high-tech economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He provided important leadership at a time of a lot of change
in Austin and at UT,'' said Steve Papermaster, director of
Powershift Group and CEO of Agillion Inc., local high-tech
companies.
</P>
<P>
   But Cunningham also had his share of controversies, including
recommending a UT campus building be a named for his friend,
Freeport-McMoRan Chief Executive Jim Bob Moffett, and serving on
Freeport's board while it threatened to sue three UT professors for
slander. He also pursued a major buildup of athletics facilities,
which faculty decried; accepted large pay raises when surveys
showed nonteaching staff were vastly underpaid; and was believed by
many to be a key force behind the 1997 departure of a popular UT
president, Robert Berdahl.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said he was control freak who refused to let go of the
Austin campus and made it difficult for Berdahl to be president.
Berdahl's successor, Larry Faulkner, said his relationship with
Cunningham has been excellent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will feel a keen sense of loss with his departure from the
post,'' Faulkner said. ``I have been continually impressed by his
energy, his resilience and his commitment to the university, to the
system and to the people of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Some faculty, however, are not impressed by Cunningham, who was
educated at Michigan State University and came to UT as an
assistant business professor in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found him to be charming, articulate and clever, but I
haven't always found him to be on the cutting edge of what we
needed academically,'' said Michael Siciliano, past president of a
systemwide Faculty Advisory Council and a professor of cancer
genetics at UT's M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. ``He's a good,
practical person and someone you could trade horses with.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his ability to charm with humor, Cunningham also could
be abrasive.
</P>
<P>
   The state's six university chancellors had approached the
Legislature in January as a coalition, but it almost collapsed
because of bickering and differences.
</P>
<P>
   During a particularly tense time, Cunningham and Texas A&AMP;M
Chancellor Barry Thompson had a loud confrontation in a hallway at
the Capitol that prompted Texas Tech Chancellor John Montford to
intervene.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no intention of doing physical harm, but I was maybe a
little heated,'' Thompson said, adding that he has grown to respect
Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the chancellors got back together and accomplished
parts of their agenda. Cunningham won the Legislature's approval of
a proposed constitutional amendment that will allow the UT and
Texas A&AMP;M Systems to spend more money from the Permanent University
Fund _ provided voters say yes in November.

 &HT;    Regent quits Introgen post after question of conflict
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A University of Texas regent is stepping down as
a director of a potentially lucrative company to which he and other
regents awarded the rights to develop and market a UT invention.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Loeffler of San Antonio said Thursday he was resigning from
the board of Introgen Therapeutics Inc. of Austin after ``a
legitimate question'' was raised a day earlier by the Austin
American-Statesman about his role as a director and shareholder of
the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the questions being raised, I think it is more important
not to go through a discussion about whether one should or should
not be on a board like that,'' he said. ``Because of my
responsibilities and commitments to the UT System, I've made a
decision to resign from the board'' of Introgen.
</P>
<P>
   Loeffler, who is also a lawyer, lobbyist and a fund-raiser for
Gov. George W. Bush's probable presidential bid, voted with eight
other regents in October 1994 to authorize UT to sign a licensing
agreement with Introgen. The company was created specifically to
commercialize a promising cancer-fighting gene therapy discovered
at UT's M.D. Anderson Cancer Center. In March 1997, Loeffler joined
Introgen as a director, with stock options.
</P>
<P>
   If the company sells the stock publicly or is acquired, its
holdings would be substantial and could be worth between $500
million to $1 billion, said William Doty, director of technology
development at M.D. Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   The head of a government watchdog group in Austin said he would
urge Bush to order a review of regents and their business ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're delighted to see Mr. Loeffler has chosen to resign to
reduce any conflicts,'' said Tom ``Smitty'' Smith, Texas state
director of Public Citizen. ``But I think there ought to be a
complete review of whether there are conflicts between board
members of universities and the companies who do business with
universities and sell products that are spun off from university
research.''
</P>
<P>
   Loeffler said Thursday he had no idea when he voted in 1994 that
he would later become affiliated with Introgen. Asked in retrospect
whether it was appropriate for him to join the company, Loeffler
said he did not violate ethics policies and wanted to put the issue
behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a choice of picking between the University of Texas and a
private company, and I chose the University of Texas,'' Loeffler
said.
</P>
<P>
   UT System legal counsel Ray Farabee said that, as far as he
knew, Loeffler's role in the company was not a conflict of
interest. The law says a regent can be a director of a company that
the university does business with as long as the regent does not
own more than 5 percent of the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Loeffler said Thursday he could not recall how many shares of
stock he had an option to purchase. But he said the amount was
``well below'' 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Loeffler, who was appointed to the UT board in 1989, also said
he will not exercise his stock options ``during the time I am part
of the UT System.''
</P>
<P>
   Loeffler disclosed on the financial statement he is required to
file with the Texas Ethics Commission that he had options on
``10,000 or more'' shares of Introgen stock. The company is
privately held, and it could not be determined from public
documents whether the amount of his options are close to or
significantly more than that.
</P>
<P>
   The company had planned to go public in November 1996 by selling
2.5 million shares on the stock market for $11 a share. But because
of market conditions, it withdrew those plans.

NHL SEES FEWER EVILS IN THE FINALS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Should Brian Skrudland of the Dallas Stars have been
suspended for head-butting Vaclav Varada of the Buffalo Sabres?
Colin Campbell, the senior vice president of the National Hockey
League, dismissed the question Thursday as unworthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you suspend a guy for that during the Stanley Cup
finals?'' Campbell asked, in a tone of voice that implied such a
thing was unthinkable to him.
</P>
<P>
   Some people would have said yes, but Campbell said no _ and he
makes these decisions as the league's chief enforcer of discipline.
So Skrudland was again available to the Stars for Game 2 of the
championship round Friday night in Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   During Game 1, a 3-2 Buffalo victory in overtime Tuesday night,
Skrudland, with some force, thrust his helmeted head into Varada's
face late in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said the incident was ``part of the play,'' although it
took place after a whistle had blown. Campbell said neither of the
referees, Terry Gregson and Bill McCreary, thought the incident
merited a penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was something both referees didn't think was callable; they
didn't even see it as it happened,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   This may be true, but players are sometimes suspended for deeds
that are observed later on videotape, though the players have not
been penalized for them on the spot. Skrudland's head butt was
replayed by the Fox network, which televised the game live, and was
shown several times later on ESPN. Campbell said head-butting has
resulted in suspensions at least twice, but added that these
instances took place ``in a fight when a player stops and
head-butts a guy and it does damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell apparently decided that this particular head-butt did
not merit suspension because it did not occur during a fight and
did no damage to Varada. Campbell said that during the regular
season, the league might suspend a player for such a head butt to
prove a point, but that ``there's a lot at stake'' in the finals, a
four-of-seven-game series that will move to Buffalo for Games 3 and
4 on Saturday and Tuesday nights.
</P>
<P>
   Skrudland is a 35-year-old center who played for Campbell
briefly in 1997-98 when Campbell coached the Rangers. Varada is a
23-year-old right wing from the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The Buffalo News, Varada discussed the head
butt. ``That was terrible,'' he said. ``It was a cheap shot. The
referee, McCreary, looked at him, then right in my eyes. He told me
it was nothing. I couldn't believe it. They have a very old team.
When you're older than 35, you can get away with anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabres Coach Lindy Ruff said Varada might have got a more
supportive reaction from the referees if he had fallen to the ice
and acted as if he had been injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it doesn't warrant a suspension at this time of year,''
Ruff said. ``But it is a major penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A Twin Deal?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One regular event during the Stanley Cup finals is the
appearance of the top prospects in the amateur entry draft, which
will be held June 26 in Boston. Scouts consider this year's crop of
18-year-olds to be better than average, and European-born forwards
are among the best of the bunch. Few have attracted as much
interest as the twins Daniel and Henrik Sedin, who play for MoDo of
Sweden and hope to play together in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   Their agent, Mike Barnett, who also represented Wayne Gretzky,
is talking to general managers in the league about placing the
twins on the same team. ``It would be a dream,'' Daniel Sedin said.
``We're working on it.'' Daniel Sedin is a left wing; Henrik is a
center.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel is listed as 6 feet 1 inch and 194 pounds; Henrik is 6-2
and 196. They are the top two players, not including goalies, from
Europe in the Central Scouting ranking.
</P>
<P>
   The top two North American prospects, Patrik Stefan and Pavel
Brendl, are also European-born, from the Czech Republic, but play
for teams on this continent. Stefan plays for Long Beach of the
International Hockey League, a professional circuit. Brendl plays
for Calgary of the Western Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Power-Play Nod to Stars  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Special teams usually make a difference, and Game 1 of the
finals proved no exception. The Stars had 10 power plays but scored
only one goal with manpower advantages over 19 minutes 41 seconds.
The Sabres also scored one power-play goal, but had only four power
plays over 7:09.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time in the second period on the bench, one of the
TV timeouts, where we said, `Enough is enough,''' Coach Lindy Ruff
said, adding that Buffalo's Dixon Ward had just taken a ``totally
undisciplined penalty'' for punching a Dallas player. ``I just
said, `No more, we can't take any more of these,''' Ruff said.
</P>
<P>
   Stars Coach Ken Hitchcock said his team had 21 scoring chances
on its power plays, ``which is a lot for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we didn't score, but it is very difficult to criticize
our power play with the opportunities,'' Hitchcock said. ``We had a
ton of chances. We are a diagonal group. We aren't a group that
just pulls it back to the point and hammers it. We are a group that
really relies on seams, and we found those seams. In the two power
plays that were given in the overtime, we found great seams.''

DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS ACT ON SOCIAL SECURITY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas)   By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans and Democrats took a first, tentative
step Thursday toward negotiating a deal to shore up Social
Security, agreeing that the House Ways and Means Committee would
meet in private sessions to explore whether the two parties can
bridge their differences.
</P>
<P>
   There still appears to be little prospect of an agreement on the
issue, which is among the most politically sensitive and complex
facing Congress and the Clinton administration. Given the deadlock
that has prevailed for nearly a year and a half, the decision to
hold bipartisan talks at least improved the odds and suggested that
neither party wanted to be seen as having given up.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough, such as it was, came when Rep. Bill Archer,
the Texas Republican who is chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee, picked up on a comment made at a hearing on Wednesday by
Rep. Charles B. Rangel of New York, the panel's senior Democrat.
Rangel said any progress would have to be made away from the
microphones.
</P>
<P>
   Opening the second of two days of hearings called to review the
array of proposals for strengthening Social Security to insure it
can weather the retirement of the baby boom generation, Archer
offered Thursday to hold private sessions ``to discuss areas of
common ground and a potential legislative outline.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangel and other Democrats quickly accepted, although Rangel
suggested that he wanted to involve the White House in any
discussions and that the talks could only be meaningful if they
were blessed by the leadership of both parties. Both parties are
suspicious that the other is more interested in laying a political
trap before the 2000 elections than in finding a bipartisan
solution.
</P>
<P>
   Archer did not say when he would hold the closed-door sessions,
at which members of both parties would presumably be more willing
than in public to talk about the politically painful tradeoff that
both sides would have to make to reach a deal. He called on
President Clinton to meet with the committee's Republicans to help
``keep this process moving forward in a bipartisan fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, the White House economic adviser, said that he
did not know the details of Archer's proposal, but that the
administration welcomed ``any good faith, constructive efforts at
bipartisan cooperation.''  &QL;

COMEBACK FROM SCANDAL MAKES NONPROFIT GROUP A CANDIDATE FOR AWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GENE MEYER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Leaders of the Community of the Good Shepherd
say they didn't know what to expect last year when they set a
$45,000 fund-raising goal.
</P>
<P>
   The sum was the largest the nonprofit organization had asked for
since a financial scandal five years ago almost put it out of
business. To the leaders' surprise, the drive hit its goal and then
surpassed it almost fourfold.
</P>
<P>
   The comeback has landed the organization in the running for
national recognition from the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Good Shepherd is one of more than two dozen Kansas City-area
organizations and 3,000 nationally that are nominated for what the
Department of Housing and Urban Development calls its Best
Practices Award.
</P>
<P>
   The awards are given to organizations and programs that HUD
officials consider to be the top 100 in the nation for creative
problem-solving and effective use of resources.
</P>
<P>
   The 100 winners will be named at a national symposium of about
5,000 social service officials that HUD is holding July 20-24 at
Bartle Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Good Shepherd was nominated ``because they have come back from
such a terrible position,'' said Rosanne Smith, the HUD senior
project manager in Kansas City who initially proposed Good Shepherd
for the award.
</P>
<P>
   Good Shepherd's need for the money seemed plain when the fund
drive began.
</P>
<P>
   HUD-financed group homes that Good Shepherd runs in south Kansas
City needed repairs and improvements that couldn't be put off any
longer without compromising the services provided for the
developmentally disabled men living there.
</P>
<P>
   And Kansas Citians are generous. A higher percentage of area
households give regularly to charities than in many other major
cities. The average household gift of $1,319 annually is about 23
percent larger than the national average, according to one
independent study.
</P>
<P>
   But previous donors to Good Shepherd had been burned.
</P>
<P>
   A former executive director went to prison for stealing hundreds
of thousands of dollars in the early 1990s. Leery potential donors
shunned the organization immediately afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our top financial priority for a long time was simply keeping
the homes from closing,'' said Kandice Walker, whom Good Shepherd
hired as development director as part of the reforms after the
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The organization immediately instituted a much tighter system of
financial checks and balances. The homes then managed to scrape by
with funding from federal programs and private grants, usually no
larger than $2,000 or $5,000, during the leanest years after the
scandal, said Sharon Higney, the organization's administrator.
</P>
<P>
   When directors approved the $45,000 fund-raising target, to pay
for repairs, redecoration and replacement of equipment that the
homes' more than 30 residents had been using for almost a decade,
Higney was guardedly optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would take at least a couple of years to reach
our goal,'' Higney said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it took just a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate and civic donors whom fund-raisers approached were
cautious at first. Some asked for formal documents outlining the
new checks and balances. Others asked for copies of independent
audits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we had all our ducks in a row, we provided everything
they asked for,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, some funders visited the home and met the guys. That
helped, too, because they could see we were spending money where we
were supposed to.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, ``no one turned us down because of our past
history,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as heartening, individual contributors responded
generously, too, she said. Of the approximately $170,000 ultimately
raised in the drive, about $30,000 came from individual
contributors, ``often $10 or $20 at a time,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Good Shepherd will use the extra money to increase the care it
provides for its residents, to whom staff members refer informally
as ``the guys,'' in the face of another challenge, Higney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys are getting older,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, many Good Shepherd residents are men in their late
teens to late 60s who need help with basic living activities such
as bathing, dressing or meal preparation, but are otherwise healthy
enough to enjoy jobs, hobbies and other interests outside the
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Good Shepherd officials worry about what will happen to the
residents as time passes and normal changes that are a part of
aging kick in on top of the developmental disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Without additional care provided by successful fund raising,
many of the community's residents presumably will have to turn to
nursing homes or a similar facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might not be what they need, but it may be the only other
choice,'' Higney said.

CHRISTINA FOYLE, LONDON BOOKSELLER, DIES AT 88  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Christina Foyle, London's best known bookseller and the
creator and hostess of Britain's most famous literary luncheon
series, died on Tuesday at her country home, Beeleigh Abbey, near
Maldon in Essex. She was 88.
</P>
<P>
   An autocratic boss who resisted commercial and technological
innovation, paid her staff meager salaries and abhorred labor
unions, she was the owner of Foyle's, the vast bookstore on Charing
Cross Road in the city's West End, which at one time had more than
30 miles of shelves full of books.
</P>
<P>
   Wealthy and eccentric, she boasted that she had never done her
own housework or cooked her own meals, and that she drank only
champagne. Even in her last years, she said that she continued to
read an entire book every day.
</P>
<P>
   The company W.&AMP; G. Foyle Ltd. was begun in 1904 by her father,
William, and her uncle Gilbert after they failed their Civil
Service exams and advertised their preparation books for sale. They
found there was a market for technical texts, and they went into
business at their home in North London.
</P>
<P>
   They moved into the present building at 119 Charing Cross Road,
with its five warehouse-sized floors, in 1929. Miss Foyle, as she
always preferred to be called, went to work there when she was 17
and became the managing director when her father died in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Buttressed by absolute power and her considerable fortune, she
resisted all calls for modernization of the store's fusty sales
practices. Foyle's long refused to take orders by phone and until
this decade banned cash registers and calculators, insisting that
all reckoning be done by hand. Though famed for her determination
and a gaze that could flash with impatience, Miss Foyle spoke in a
high-pitched voice that one listener likened to the sound of
someone who had just inhaled helium.
</P>
<P>
   Finding the book you wanted from the ramshackle stacks in the
dimly lit and chaotic shop was known to be such a trial that a
competitor created bus stop posters saying, ``Foyled Again? Try
Dillon's.'' Volumes were shelved by the names of their publishers
rather than by their authors, and guidance was hard to get from the
poorly paid staff, who often were newly arrived in London and had
limited knowledge of English. A customer who once asked for
``Ulysses'' was told he had gone to lunch.
</P>
<P>
   For decades Miss Foyle maintained a system of purchase that
required obtaining a receipt and getting in line three times before
finally reaching the desk where the book waited. In a much repeated
comment, one survivor said, ``Imagine Kafka had gone into the book
trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, enough people preferred its gothic habits to the
supermarket efficiency of modern bookstores to keep its aisles
filled, and Miss Foyle's personal wealth covered any operating
losses. Its quirky, anachronistic personality also turned it into a
tourist destination, and it attracted as many people as it
infuriated. She turned aside all offers to buy the business or to
take it public, disliking the thought of being accountable to
shareholders as much as that of dealing with trade unions.
</P>
<P>
   She began the literary lunches that continue to this day in
1930. She got the inspiration for them one morning behind the
counter when an older man asked her to suggest a book for a train
trip. She said she had just read ``The Forsyte Saga'' and could
heartily recommend it. The customer bought a copy and left the
shop, returning a little later to hand it back. It was inscribed,
``For the young lady who liked my book _ John Galsworthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Excited by this personal contact with a famous writer, she
dreamed up the idea of the monthly lunch so that outsiders could
mingle with the literary set. Held at the Dorchester and Grosvenor
House hotels, the occasions were derided as events for suburban
ladies in fur hats, but they attracted a notable list of speakers.
Among them were H.G. Wells, Evelyn Waugh, Kingsley Amis, Yehudi
Menuhin, Charles Chaplin, Philip Larkin, D.H. Lawrence, Haile
Selassie, Charles de Gaulle, Margaret Thatcher, Edith Sitwell, J.B.
Priestley, Harold Macmillan and George Bernard Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   She refused to let messages of regret be read out at her fetes,
saying: ``The people who do come are the important ones; I don't
bother about the others.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw complained after his meal that she had forgotten he was a
vegetarian, but when she offered to invite him back with a promise
of nothing but green fare, he declined in a note saying, ``I could
not bear the noise of 2,000 people eating celery.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked who had been the most boring literary lunch guest, she
always told the story of Sir Walter Gilbey, director of the
gin-making company. ``He spoke for one and a half hours,'' she
said. ``A man in front of my father fell asleep so he hit the chap
with the toastmaster's gavel. The man said: `Hit me again. I can
still hear him.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Christina Agnes Lilian Foyle was born in London on Jan. 30,
1911, and went to boarding school in Hertfordshire and a finishing
school at Wilderswil in Switzerland before beginning work in her
father's shop.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938 she married Ronald Batty, a childhood friend and
executive at Foyle's. He died in 1994. The couple had no children,
but at Beeleigh Abbey, their 12th-century home, she kept cats,
dogs, peacocks and tortoises. ``Animals are always loyal and love
you,'' she said, ``whereas with children you never know where you
are''
</P>
<P>
   When the other woman in British life who was often referred to
as the Iron Lady lost her job, Miss Foyle was asked for her
reaction. ``It's a shame about Mrs. Thatcher,'' she said. ``Luckily
they can't chuck me out. I own the place, you see.''

AMERICA WEST TO CLOSE RESERVATIONS CENTER IN KC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ America West Airlines will close its
reservations center near Kansas City International Airport in
September, eliminating about 180 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   America West officials told the Kansas City Aviation Department
recently that the airline would not renew its lease, which expires
in November, said Joe McBride, an Aviation Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   America West opened the Kansas City facility in 1992. But in
recent years, employment at the call center has dropped from 300 to
the current 180 workers.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, the airline was not refilling jobs lost through
attrition as it prepared to open a call center in Reno, Nev. The
Reno facility opened last week. The Phoenix-based airline also has
a reservations center in Tempe, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Patty Nowack, an America West spokeswoman, said Thursday that
trying to recruit workers in Kansas City had become difficult in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many call centers in that market for us to be
competitive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The call center industry employs more than 40,000 people in the
Kansas City area, with some making up to $17 an hour. America West
paid its reservations agents $7.50 to $12.15 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   America West has installed a reservations system that would have
required the Kansas City call center to be upgraded if it remained
open, Nowack said.
</P>
<P>
   Area America West employees are being offered transfers to the
airline's call centers in Tempe or Reno.
</P>
<P>
   The severance package includes a week's pay for each year
worked. In addition, America West employees will be provided a
$1,500 moving allowance if they transfer and a $1,000 bonus to stay
with the company until Sept. 1, Nowack said.
</P>
<P>
   McBride said the city was seeking a new tenant for the
city-owned facility at 10801 N. Amity Road.
</P>
<P>
   Two companies, including one airline, have expressed interest in
the facility, McBride said. He declined to identify the companies.
</P>
<P>
   McBride said the building would be useful for data processing or
other office operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the building is configured, we think it's pretty
marketable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Vanguard Airlines recently looked at the building, the
low-cost carrier decided to stay with its reservations center in
Mission, said Dick Barr of Vanguard.
</P>
<P>
   However, ``If any of the displaced (America West) people want to
stay with an airline, we would be happy to recruit them,'' Barr
said.
</P>
<P>
   Before America West occupied the building, Braniff Inc. operated
a reservations center there. Braniff collapsed in 1989.

AMERICAN CENTURY ACQUIRES STAKE IN ELECTRONIC STOCK TRADING
SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK DAVIS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ American Century Investments has acquired a 5
percent interest in an electronic stock trading system, the Kansas
City-based mutual fund company said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   American Century acquired an ``indirect economic interest'' in
Archipelago Holdings LLC. Archipelago operates an electronic
communications network. Such networks use computers to match buyers
and sellers of stocks without working through traditional stock
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   The mutual fund company acquired its stake through J.P. Morgan &AMP;
Co. Inc., which owns 45 percent of American Century. Morgan
acquired a 20 percent interest in Archipelago, and a fourth of that
holding was funded from American Century, said Harold Bradley, who
manages the American Century Heritage Fund and previously led the
fund family's stock trading operations.
</P>
<P>
   The companies did not disclose terms of the investments in
Archipelago.
</P>
<P>
   Before the transaction, Archipelago was owned by four groups:
ETrade Group Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Virago Enterprises LLC
and Townsend Analytics Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, American Century acquired an 8.6 percent
interest in Tradepoint Financial Networks PLC. Tradepoint is an
electronic stock exchange in London. The transaction involved an
investment consortium among Instinet Corp., which is an electronic
communications network owned by Reuters Group PLC; Archipelago;
American Century; J.P. Morgan; and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   American Century also had acquired less than 5 percent of W.R.
Hambrecht &AMP; Co., which conducts stock offerings over the Internet
at www.openIPO.com.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said other such strategic investments by American
Century were likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we're not done. This is a very exciting and quickly
evolving period,'' he said.

MORGAN STANLEY'S GENERAL COUNSEL RESIGNS IN INFORMANT PAYMENT
SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: CORRECTS spelling to Bernhein in third graf, age of Edwards
in 11th graf) 
(ATTN: Calif., Ill.) (rk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Morgan Stanley Dean Witter's general counsel stepped
down from her job and a senior in-house lawyer resigned in
connection with a $10,000 payment to a police informant, as the
Wall Street giant sought to end what two top executives said in a
statement was ``a difficult time for our firm.''
</P>
<P>
   Christine A. Edwards, the general counsel, stepped aside and
accepted a part-time role as an advisory director, Morgan Stanley
said, calling the decision voluntary and against the wishes of the
firm's management committee.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe R. Sonnenborn, a managing director in the legal
department who had been suspended with pay last month, resigned
under pressure. Carol Bernhein, a third in-house lawyer who
reported to Sonnenborn and had also been suspended with pay last
month, will resume her duties.
</P>
<P>
   The personnel changes were announced together with the results
of an internal investigation into the circumstances surrounding
Morgan Stanley's decision to pay $10,000 to Charles Joseph Luethke,
an informant involved in the arrest last year of former employee
Christian L. Curry.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, conducted by Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &AMP;
Garrison, a Manhattan law firm, found that there was ``no
satisfactory explanation'' for why Morgan Stanley failed to keep
the Manhattan district attorney's office informed about
developments in the Curry case. That failure prompted the district
attorney's office to launch a criminal investigation of Morgan
Stanley's conduct, which is ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard on our organization to see the firm's name look
bad in the public domain day after day,'' said Philip J. Purcell,
Morgan Stanley's chairman and chief executive officer ``That's why
the pressure was on to get this out publicly, get the facts out,
and hope it's the end of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Purcell and John J. Mack, Morgan Stanley's president, said they
were especially dismayed at how their legal department responded to
requests for information about the $10,000 payment from the
district attorney's office. It took six weeks to inform the
district attorney's office about the payment, a Paul, Weiss report
on the matter said.
</P>
<P>
   The internal investigation also found that legal department
officials did not respond quickly even after the district attorney
had issued two grand jury subpoenas to the firm last October.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue is our interaction with the D.A.,'' said Mack.
``Our employees do not understand how this breakdown happened with
the D.A., and we want to lay it out for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards, the general counsel, was not found to be directly
responsible for the mistakes, according the the Paul, Weiss report.
She was informed of the $10,000 payment to Luethke a short time
before it was made, the report said, but was not kept abreast of
troubles with the district attorney's office. Ms. Edwards decided
to step down on her own, and a statement issued by the firm quoted
her as saying that the problem ``happened on my watch.''
</P>
<P>
   The 46-year-old general counsel, who earned $7.5 million in
total compensation last year, had been a close colleague of
Purcell. They served together at Dean Witter before that retail
brokerage firm merger with Morgan Stanley two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, both worked at Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. The families of
Purcell and Ms. Edwards still live in Chicago, and the two
sometimes commute together to Chicago and back to New York, where
Morgan Stanley is based.
</P>
<P>
   Both Purcell and Mack said they were surprised by Ms. Edwards'
decision to step down and said that they had not pressured her to
do so. They said she would continue to handle some legal and public
affairs issues for the firm in her new role.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the blame for the mistakes surrounding the $10,000
payment fell on Sonnenborn, a 15-year veteran of Morgan Stanley.
Sonnenborn was the senior-most official involved directly in
managing the relationship with Luethke, authorizing the $10,000
payment and dealing with the district attorney's office, people
close to the firm said. Sonnenborn did inform Ms. Edwards about the
payment before it was made, but only one day before, and then not
in detail, the internal report concluded.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, the report suggested, Sonnenborn did not
keep Ms. Edwards abreast of brewing troubles with the district
attorney's office. Ms. Edwards did not learn until May of this year
that the district attorney had convened a grand jury to issue
subpoenas to the firm half a year before, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also reiterated that neither Purcell nor Mack knew of
the payment to Luethke, adding that they did not learn of it until
April of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Sonnenborn could not be reached for comment Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's two top executives also sought to clear up confusion
about Morgan Stanley's own descriptions of the payment to Luethke.
It called it a ``mistake in judgment'' in one statement last last
month. Earlier this week, it referred to the payment in court
documents as a ``reward'' for Luethke that its lawyers deemed
``entirely legal.''
</P>
<P>
   The two are not contradictory, Purcell said. He said that the
payment should never have been made. But he said that the payment
itself was not illegal. He said he understood the decision to make
the reward payment to a good Samaritan who helped thwart a crime,
but did not agree with the decision.

   Legal or not, both Morgan Stanley and the district attorney's
office view the payment as a mistake. The reason is that the
payment appeared to reduce the chances of persuading a jury to
convict Curry, who was charged with conspiracy to plant fake e-mail
messages on Morgan Stanley's computers. The payment was seen as
likely taint the credibility of Luethke, who had a role in the
Curry arrest, people close the case said.
</P>
<P>
   That would have been true even if Morgan Stanley had immediately
told prosecutors about the payment and entered it into its books
properly. But the firm did not. To this day, prosecutors are still
piecing together what happened. But several people see the events
as having unfolded in the following way.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley paid Luethke $10,000 late last August, a few days
after Curry's arrest, apparently intending it as a gratuity for the
tip Luethke provided. The firm did not inform the Manhattan
district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of September, the office had learned of the payment _
possibly from Luethke. The office then asked Morgan Stanley about
it. According to people involved, Ms. Bernheim, one of the in-house
lawyers, denied having paid the informant. People close to Morgan
Stanley, however, said that Ms. Bernheim might have answered `no'
to a narrowly phrased question about whether Luethke had
``extorted'' money from the firm rather than deny outright the fact
of the payment.
</P>
<P>
   By early October, Ms. Bernheim and Sonnenborn acknowledged to
prosecutors that they had paid Luethke. But prosecutors weren't
satisfied. Among the concerns was that the firm had paid Luethke by
wire transfer to a numbered account, not by check. Morgan Stanley
also could not produce the kind of documentation that would
normally accompany a payment to an outside vendor.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, when Morgan Stanley produced accounting records, that
only complicated things. The records showed that the payment had
been assigned a billing code that Morgan Stanley used when it paid
millions of dollars in settlements stemming from the Orange County
bond-trading scandal, a completely unrelated event.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley told prosecutors that the error was made in the
firm's accounting department. Sonnenborn and Ms. Bernheim had
intended that payment to be assigned to the real-estate finance
division, where Curry had worked, prosecutors were told.
</P>
<P>
   Some people involved said they believed that Morgan Stanley was
acting in a way that suggested it wanted to disguise ties to
Luethke. Morgan Stanley insisted all along that it had no such
intention. Months passed without a resolution. The fact that the
case was handled by three different assistant district attorney's
during nine months did not help matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one big comedy of errors,'' said one person close to the
case.
</P>
<P>
   It is still possible that Morgan Stanley could face criminal
charges. If prosecutors decided that the firm had sought to falsify
business records to disguise a payment it thought to be criminal,
the firm could be charged with a felony under New York state's
general business laws, people close to the case said.
</P>
<P>
   But several people involved said they considered it more likely
that prosecutors would accept Morgan Stanley's arguments that the
errors were unintentional. The personnel changes at Morgan Stanley
and the bad publicity the firm has suffered have are likely to be
considered punishment enough, these people said.
