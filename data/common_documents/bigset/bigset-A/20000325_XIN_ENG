<HEADLINE> Feature: Russians Look to Putin for National Rejuvenation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 24 (Xinhua) -- "You should not speak to her. Go
home and talk to your own old folks," the middle-aged woman
snapped at a reporter interviewing a 71-year-old pensioner who
begs at Novy Arbat Street not far away from the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
In a sense, the woman's mentality crystallizes the current
Russian mindset: too ashamed of the country's woes and too proud
to show it to an outsider.
</P>
<P>
Many believe that the military campaign against rebels in
Chechnya has contributed to the enormous popularity of acting
President Vladimir Putin, but the runaway favorite in Sunday's
presidential elections also owes much of his support to the hope
that he would bring order, and eventually, revive Russia's dented
national pride.
</P>
<P>
A stroll Friday along Novy Arbat left one little doubt that
Putin will be the victor in Sunday's balloting. Of the 18 people
interviewed, 10 said they would vote for Putin, four said they had
not made up their mind or wanted to keep their choices to
themselves.
</P>
<P>
Putin, who was appointed prime minister last August and
automatically became the acting head of state on New Year's Eve
following the abrupt resignation of Boris Yeltsin, has risen from
relative obscurity to an approval rating of 55 to 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Tikhomirov Alexei, a salesman at the Tian Ke Long shopping
center, plans to vote for Putin because "he is forceful,
courageous and has nothing to do with the corrupt ruling
establishment and the oligarchs."
</P>
<P>
"Putin is young, energetic and pragmatic and gets things done,"
Alexei said.
</P>
<P>
His view was echoed by Nikolai Nikolaivich, a policeman who has
lived through the years of Josef Stalin, Nikita Krushchev and
Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
"I will vote for the president!" He has long since shed "acting
" from Putin's official title. Nostalgic of the Krushchev days,
Nikolaivich believes Putin would institute a strong state as
Krushchev did.
</P>
<P>
"Under Putin, the economy is recovering; social stability has
returned and crime is down."
</P>
<P>
"I don't see any other choice," he said.
</P>
<P>
Alla, another Putin supporter, said she would vote for him
because he "represents the future of Russia."
</P>
<P>
G. E. Gurchrminova, a retired college professor, said she would
vote for Putin, because he is pragmatic and "says less but does
more." And as president, Putin would bring predictability to
Russia, which under Boris Yeltsin's reign saw five prime ministers
in a space of some 18 months.
</P>
<P>
Karameisheva Natalia, who wears two placards promoting a beauty
salon as "a walking advertisement" along Novy Arbat and earns 10
rubles (0.35 U.S. dollar) per hour, will vote for Putin in the
hope that he would improve her life.
</P>
<P>
She and her husband and son have lived in Moscow as temporary
residents for two years, but life is hard and jobs are scarce.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that Putin would bring good fortune to Russia," Natalia
said.
</P>
<P>
Still there are those who are disillusioned by politics and
want to vote against all candidates.
</P>
<P>
A young man who works also as a "walking advertisement"
alongside Natalia but refused to give his name said he would not
even show up in the polling station on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Reirynikov Illya described himself as a government employee. He
said he does not trust any of the candidates and would vote
against them all. As to Putin's mounting approval rating, he
believes anybody in his capacity as prime minister and acting head
of state would be able to reach the kind of popularity Putin
enjoys.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few weeks, Putin toured the regions and made a
surprise visit to Chechnya aboard a Su-27 fighter jet as a co-
pilot. The media gave almost blanket, and mostly positive,
coverage of his activities.
</P>
<P>
That young, energetic image is a far cry from his predecessor
who in Nikolaivich's words, "stayed in and out of hospital and
could not tend to state affairs most of the time."
</P>
<P>
And whom will the 71-year-old pensioner vote for?
</P>
<P>
"Putin," she said. "Because he is the only candidate that I
know," although not far away were two billboards urging Muscovites
to vote for two of the ten other presidential hopefuls -- Umar
Dzhabrailov, a wealthy hotel owner, and Alexei Podberyozkin,
leader of the Spiritual Heritage party.

MOSCOW, March 24 (Xinhua) -- A total of 1,991 Russian
servicemen have been killed and 5,925 others wounded since Moscow

and 2,181 servicemen of the Interior Ministry forces and police

<HEADLINE> India to Get Loans, Investments From U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The United States will provide a credit of 1 billion dollars to
the Export and Import Bank of India and Small Industries
Development Bank of India (SIDBI) under the accords signed during
the on-going visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton which will end
on Saturday, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley signed an agreement on
behalf of the Export -Import Bank of America for extending credit
lines to the Exim Bank of India to the tune of 500 million dollars
and another one with SIDBI on a similar amount for lending to
small and medium-sized industries in the country, PTI said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. and Indian companies signed 12 agreements
involving a total investment of 2 billion dollars in the South
Asian country mainly in the areas of information technology,
biotechnology, medicine, power and environment.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Indian and American companies signed nearly a
dozen agreements worth over 1.4 billion dollars here on various
sectors including information technology, power and environment.
</P>
<P>
Daley said at a meeting organized in Bombay by the Federation
of Industry and Commerce Corporations of India (FICCI) that the
political and economic statements, signed between President
Clinton and Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee earlier in
New Delhi, would go a long way in strengthening bilateral
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He appreciated India's move toward a free market, which he said
had yielded handsome dividends by way of a healthy growth of 6.5
percent on average in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton, who arrived in Bombay late Friday afternoon,
told the FICCI meeting that his five-day visit had helped firm up
business agreements besides opening up the possibility of 1
billion dollars in loan from the U.S. Exim Bank for investment in
India.

<HEADLINE> More Sudanese Refugees Flee to Neighboring Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The number of refugees fleeing
fighting in southern Sudan to neighboring countries has risen in
the past month, the Regional Service Center of the U.N. High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said in the Kenyan capital
Nairobi on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Nairobi-based center noted that the government air attacks
and bandit raids on villages in southern Sudan have forced
thousands of people to cross into Kenya, Uganda and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The center said that its staff recorded an average of over 400
arrivals in Kenya per week in March as against 200 per week in the
previous months.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR field offices have also registered growing Sudanese
refugees influx to Arua and Kitgum areas in Uganda in the past
weeks, including 900 during the first three weeks of March.
</P>
<P>
Over a 10-day span in January this year, Ethiopia received
5,500 refugees who were chased by fighting within the rebel group
in southern Sudan, the center said.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR said that more than 51,000 Sudanese fled their country in
1999.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR statistics show that by the end of 1999, nearly 500,000
Sudanese refugees had been registered with UNHCR offices in 57
countries, with 200, 000 in Uganda, 70,000 in Ethiopia and 64,000
in Kenya.

<HEADLINE> Saudi, Yemeni Leaders Discuss Ties, Arab Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah
Ibn Abdul-Aziz on Saturday received a letter from Yemeni President
Ali Abdullah Saleh, in which bilateral ties and the convening of a
long-awaited Arab summit were discussed.
</P>
<P>
The letter was delivered to Prince Abdullah, who is also Deputy
Prime Minister and Chief of the National Guards, by visiting Yemeni
Information Minister Abdul Rahman Al-Akwa.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed diplomatic sources said that on bilateral ties,
Saleh discussed primarily ways of solving an outstanding border
dispute between Yemen and Saudi Arabia, the Kuwait News Agency
reported from the Saudi capital of Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
But the sources did not go into details.
</P>
<P>
Riyadh and Sanaa were once at odds with whether to renew the
expired 1934 Saudi-Yemeni Taif border accord, which assigned the
provinces of Najran, Jizan and Asir to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Yemen was previously opposed to renewing the treaty expired in
September 1992 since it also claimed the disputed provinces.
</P>
<P>
The two sides signed a memorandum of understanding in February
1995, in which they agreed to negotiate a resolution of the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
Although several joint Saudi-Yemeni committees have made headway
in their many rounds of negotiations over the re-demarcation of the
disputed borders, political observers could not expect an immediate
settlement of the chronic issue.
</P>
<P>
While Saudi Arabia and Yemen still have to agree on sites for
most of the 300 land border posts, blames were sometimes traded by
both sides for dragging on on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Besides dealing with bilateral relations between Saudi Arabia
and Yemen, the sources said the letter also highlighted the efforts
made by the Yemeni President to hold an Arab summit to rebuild Arab
solidarity diminished due to differences over how to react to
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Saleh had recently sent his envoy to several Arab countries,
namely Iraq, Lebanon and Syria, in order to rally enough support
for holding the summit.
</P>
<P>
The Yemeni information minister arrived in Riyadh on Friday on a
Gulf tour, which will also take him to the United Arab Emirates,
Oman, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain and non-Arab Iran.

<HEADLINE> Assad-Clinton Summit Offers Peace Opportunity in Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Political and diplomatic
circles considered the forthcoming Syrian-U.S. summit in Geneva a
precious opportunity for peace in the Middle East, local media
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The talks between President Hafez al-Assad and his U.S
counterpart, Bill Clinton, on Sunday will also help end the half
century-long Arab-Israeli conflict, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Assad arrived in Geneva on Saturday evening to attend the
meeting with Clinton who is expected to arrive in this Swiss
capital early Sunday in a joint effort to put the stalled Syrian-
Israeli peace negotiations back on track.
</P>
<P>
Syrian-Israeli peace talks which was resumed in Washington last
December after a 4-year deadlock, hit a new snag on January 10 due
to Israel's refusal to commit to fully pull out from the disputed
Golan Heights to June 4, 1967 border lines.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources in Damascus said the Assad-Clinton summit
meeting comes after the extensive U.S contacts with Syrian and
Israeli leaders on the key issues including the eastern boundary of
Tiberias Lake, the early warning station in Gabal al-Sheikh and the
normalization of ties between Damascus and Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The sources disclosed that the U.S prepared a working paper that
received positive response from both Syria and Israel and led to an
understanding over several controversial issues and hence paved the
way for the soon Assad-Clinton meeting.
</P>
<P>
Syria is insisting upon the Israeli withdrawal to June 4, 1967
border lines and parallel security arrangements that do not affect
its sovereignty, Syrian diplomatic sources said, adding that it
rejects any Israeli presence on the Syrian territories while it
sticks to the principle of Land for Peace.
</P>
<P>
Damascus also insisted that the Syrian and Lebanese tracks
should go side by side and that normalizing the ties with Tel Aviv
would be the result of a full israeli pullout form the Golan
Heights, they added.
</P>
<P>
Assad and Clinton will also discuss other thorny issues between
Syria and Israel, such as the issues of borders, water, monitoring,
buffer zones, and nationality of buffer forces, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> U.S Delegation Arrives in Tripoli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. delegation led by Mawra Hati,
first assistant secretary of state for consular affairs, arrived in
the Libyan capital of Tripoli Saturday afternoon for a visit to
Libya, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
According to Libyan News Agency, the U.S delegation is expected
to meet with Hassouna al-Shawish, Assistant Secretary of the Libyan
People's Committee for Foreign Communication and International Co-
operation.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the U.S. announced the delegation's visit to
Tripoli is meant to "assess" the situation in Libya before allowing
the U.S nationals to visit the Arab country.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Embassy in Libya has been closed since 1980 and the U.S.
nationals have been instructed not to travel to Tripoli since 1981
except for certain cases while the Belgian embassy was taking
charge of U.S. affairs there.
</P>
<P>
However, a senior U.S official said on Wednesday that
dispatching the mission to Libya does not mean that Washington
seeks better ties with Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
"We have nothing in mind " beyond the visit, said Edward Walker,
U.S Assistant Secretary of State for Middle East Affairs, adding "
it is a mere consular mission."
</P>
<P>
"Washington is not making any sort of move to get Libya out of
the terrorism-fomenting state list ", he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Libya have been on the U.S. list since 1989 but Tripoli
emphasizes that it is "a prey for the U.S terrorism" itself.
</P>
<P>
In April 1986, U.S warplanes raided the quarter in which Libyan
leader Muammer Gadaffi lived in Tripoli, but Gadaffi survived the
attack.
</P>
<P>
In the face of growing detente in Tripoli-European Union ties,
Washington have been under heavy pressure by the U.S oil group to
pursue convergence with Libya over the past months.
</P>
<P>
In April 1999, the United Nations suspended the sanctions it
imposed on Libya since 1992 in reaction to the alleged involvement
of two Libyan nationals in the 1988 Pan Am bombing over Lockerbie.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Russians in the Far East have
started to cast their ballots for a new president on Sunday
morning local time(Saturday night Moscow time), the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Voting has started in Kamchat, Chukotka and Koryak, the news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
Under a new electoral law, polling stations are open between 8
a.m.and 8 p.m. local time. Russia, the largest country in the
world,covers 11 time zones.

succeed former president Boris Yeltsin who resigned on December 31,
1999. Voters also have an option to vote against all candidates.
</P>
<P>
Acting President Vladimir Putin is widely expected to win the
election. Recent opinion polls put him at the runaway first place
with approval ratings at between 50 and 60 percent. At stake,
however, is whether Putin will win an outright victory in the
first round or has to claim victory in a run-off.

Zyuganov was in a distant second place with support of about 20
percent.Liberal economist Grigory Yavlinsky was in the third place,
followed by ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the
Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Under Russia's law, a run-off between the two leading
contestants will be held three weeks later if none of the
contenders wins more than 50 percent of the vote in the first
round.
</P>
<P>
Results are not allowed to be made public until balloting has
been concluded across the country. Preliminary results are
expected to come in Sunday night Moscow time and by 9-10 a.m.
Monday (0500 GMT-0600 GMT), 90 percent of the ballots would have
been counted.
</P>
<P>
The voting day coincides with Russia's transition to summer
time.At 2 a.m. local time, clocks will be set one hour forward.
Moscow time will be four hours later than GMT instead of three
hours.

<HEADLINE> Chile's Congress Passes Reform on Former Presidents Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean Congress approved
Saturday a constitutional amendment that creates the new
institution of the former presidents of the Republic.
</P>
<P>
The 113 affirmative votes that permitted its approval were cast
by the Christian Democracy legislators, with the exception of some
dissenters. There were three abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The 27 negative votes were mainly cast by the socialist
deputies and senators, who acted as a block, and also those of the
Party for Democracy.
</P>
<P>
The new standard establishes that all the former presidents who
serve a full period will be able to have special privileges and a
stipend, as a way of granting a dignified pension and protection
to those who exerted the highest authority in the country.
</P>
<P>
If they are already lifetime senators, they will be permitted
to elect between this new institution and resign to their mandates
in the Parliament, or maintain them.
</P>
<P>
At present the Constitution establishes that this post cannot
be resigned.
</P>
<P>
This position will not be applied to those who exerted the
mandate during the vacancy that could have emerged during the
mandate of the title-holding presidents.
</P>
<P>
Chile currently has lifelong senators: Angust Pinochet and
Eduardo Frei, who were former presidents of the country.

<HEADLINE> Two Drown, 11 Missing in Rafting Tragedy in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Two people have drowned and
11 were still missing on Saturday evening when they went water
rafting down the flooded Storms River in the Eastern Cape, South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Police spokeswoman Captain Yvette Jonker confirmed earlier
reports that the group of 13 people had been one of two groups
who had gone down the river on Saturday morning. The first group
became concerned when the other rafters had not arrived at the
base by 3:00 p.m. local time.
</P>
<P>
By 6:30 p.m., two bodies had been washed down the river.
</P>
<P>
Superintendent John Best of Eastern Cape Disaster Management
said that because many of the rescuers had to come all the way
from Port Elizabeth, the sun was setting by the time they arrived
at the scene.
</P>
<P>
Rescue operations were suspended overnight because a thick
mist had settled over the river and it was raining.
</P>
<P>
Best said some rescuers would be taking rubber ducks up the
river from its mouth on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
Mountain rescuers, ambulance men and police would be
participating in a joint rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Storms River Adventure, the tour organizers,
said the 11 were believed to be trapped in the canyon part of the
river.
</P>
<P>
Best said heavy rains over the past four days had caused the
river to come down in flood.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Increase Oil Production and Export Gradually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 25 (Xinhua) -- There will be a gradual increase
in Iraq's oil production and export, said Iraqi Oil Minister Amir
Muhammad Rashid on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Iraqi News Agency (INA), Rashid said he
will put forward the proposal at the March 27 oil ministerial
meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC).
</P>
<P>
The OPEC meeting will decide whether to raise oil production to
offset an oil supply shortage that now stands at more than 2
million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
Rashid is now in the Jordanian capital of Amman on his way to
attend the OPEC meeting.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has changed its mind and decided to increase oil
production, said Rashid, adding Iraq's oil export will also rise
following its output increase.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi minister had first touched upon his country's possible
oil output increase last Sunday after a meeting with Venezuelan
Minister of Energy and Mines Ali Rodriguez Araque who was on a
visit to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's oil output, now standing at 1.9 million barrels a day,
are monitored by the U.N., not by the OPEC.
</P>
<P>
Rashid said Iraq will closely observe how the U.N. Sanctions
Committee will deal with Iraq's oil contracts.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly accused the U.S. and British delegates at
the U.N. Sanctions Committee of deliberately blocking the contracts
Iraq signed with foreign companies to buy humanitarian supplies for
its people who have been under stringent U.N. sanctions ever since
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. oil-for-food program, Iraq is allowed to sell a
certain amount of crude oil and use part of the revenues to import
humanitarian supplies such as food, medicine and spare parts.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Friday urged the Security
Council to review the holds of Iraq's contract applications by
members of the U.N. Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of the Security Council on the humanitarian
situation in Iraq, Annan said the holds of the contract
applications do have a direct negative impact on the oil-for-food
deal and on the efforts to rehabilitate Iraq's infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief once again recommended an increase of the
allocation of resources that Iraq can use under the program to
purchase spare parts for its oil industry.

<HEADLINE> Syrian President Arrives in Geneva for Talks With Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
arrived in Geneva Saturday evening for talks on the Middle East
with U.S. President Bill Clinton, who is expected to arrive early
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Assad, accompanied by Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara,
will hold talks with Clinton on Sunday in a bid to revive the
Srian-Israeli peace talks suspended since January amid reports
that an Israeli-Syrian deal may be near.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Clinton and Assad is their first direct
encounter since they held talks in Geneva in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The main sticking point between Israel and Syria has been over
the return of the Golan Heights, captured by Israel in 1967. The
issues of where the frontier will be drawn, Israel's security
concerns and the crucial question of water rights have been
central to the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
On his recent visit to the Middle East, Swiss Foreign Minister
Joseph Deiss offered to host a three-way summit between Israel,
Syria and the United States.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Justice Sets New Deadline for Cuban Boy to Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that if
the relatives do not agree to the new deadline, the government
will begin the process of returning Elian to his father in Cuba
next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued late on Friday, U.S. Attorney General
Janet Reno confirmed the Monday deadline.
</P>
<P>
Reno reiterated that the goal is to "reunite Elian with his
father in a fair, prompt and orderly manner."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) Friday
rejected a proposal from the Florida relatives of Elian that an
arbitrator decide whether the boy should stay in the U.S. or
return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the Florida relatives of the boy are proposing
that an arbitration process on the boy's status could begin on
April 3 and be completed within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The proposal came after INS Thursday told the relatives of the
Cuban boy that they should agree to a speedy timetable for their
appeal of a federal court decision against them or the agency
would immediately move to revoke Elian's status in this country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore ruled
that only the U.S. attorney general can grant political asylum to
the boy.
</P>
<P>
Kendall Coffey, an attorney of the boy's relatives, said the
boy's relatives had offered to abide by an arbitrator's decision,
suggesting former Senator Bob Dole or Senator George Mitchell for
the position, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
However, the idea was rejected by INS. The report quoted INS
Commissioner Doris Meissner as saying that an arbitration process
is "not an option that we are prepared to entertain."
</P>
<P>
"Our goal here is to reunite Elian with his father and to do
that as quickly, as promptly and as orderly as possible," Meissner
said.
</P>
<P>
Elian, who is currently under the custody of his great uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez, in Florida, was rescued on November 25 last year
from a shipwreck after his mother and 11 others died when the boat
capsized in the sea off Florida.
</P>
<P>
The INS ruled earlier this year that the boy belongs to his
father and should be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
However, the decision to return him was delayed after the boy's
great uncle Florida filed a political asylum for him.
</P>
<P>
The boy's father in Cuba, supported by the Cuban government,
insisted that his son should be returned to him while the boy's
great uncle, backed by some anti-Cuba politicians in the U.S.,
asked the boy to stay with him.

<HEADLINE> S.Leone Launches Nationwide Polio Vaccinations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone launched a nationwide
polio vaccination campaign on Saturday for the first time in
almost a decade.
</P>
<P>
The campaign areas include the regions controlled by the former
rebels, reports reaching here from the west African country's
capital Freetown quoted health officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Now that peace has been achieved, though with some hiccoughs,
we have been able to deploy our working staff to districts like
Kailahun, Kono, Kabbala and Kambia, which were not accessible
because of the rebel war," Doctor Alhassan Sesay with the
country's Health Ministry said in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that the operation started as planned on Saturday,
which aim to vaccinate 840,000 children nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization and the U.N. Children's Fund
(UNICEF) are working with the health ministry on the project. The
two groups have been working to eradicate polio world-wide by the
end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Children suffered most in the country's nine year civil war,
which ended when the rebels signed a peace deal with the elected
government in mid-1999. Disarmament and demobilization have
dragged but rebel fighters have granted health workers access to
areas still under their control.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Supreme Leader Rejects U.S. Overture for Better Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei on Saturday turned down the recent U.S. overture for
better ties, amid mixed reactions from senior Iranian officials.
</P>
<P>
The issue of talks with Iran put forward by U.S. is "deceitful"
with an aim to set stage for more enmities and to regain its former
interests in Iran, Khamenei said in the northwestern holy city of
Mashhad, Khorasan province.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a gathering on the occasion of "Eid Ghadir" to mark
the appointment of the first Shiite Imam Ali, he said that the
recent U.S. confession of mistakes in its ties with Iran was "
deceitful and belated confessions without apology" and "useless"
for the Iranian nation.
</P>
<P>
The Iran-U.S. relations are far from the mere issue of trust or
lack of confidence between the two countries, he was quoted by the
Islamic Republic News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Iranian nation and officials consider the U.S. as their enemy
because Iran's history is fraught with animosities and treacheries
by the U.S., to some of which U.S. has admitted and would admit to
the rest in future," said Khamenei, who has the final saying on
important issues of the country.
</P>
<P>
In her speech to the American-Iranian Council in Washington on
March 17, the U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright announced
the lift of a ban on U.S. imports of Iranian luxury goods and
invited Tehran to pull down the "Wall of Distrust" between the two
countries for a "new relationship."
</P>
<P>
Albright admitted that the U.S. had been involved in the 1953
coup, supported the former Shah regime and helped Iraq in the 1980-
88 Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials showed a mixed reaction to Albright's
overture, which was described as "positive" by some Iranian
officials, but "another step of U.S. conspiracy" by others.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of the powerful arbitrate and advisory State
Expediency Council Mohsen Rezaei said last week that Washington's
explicit acknowledgment of past mistakes in its policy toward
Tehran and its decision to ease sanctions against Iran signaled a
new era in the U.S. attitude to Iran.
</P>
<P>
Rezaei, former commander of the elite Islamic Revolutionary
Guards Corps, said that the U.S. new strategy could lead to a
resumption of ties between the two countries and the new Iranian
year which started on March 20 would be important for the Tehran-
Washington ties.
</P>
<P>
Washington severed ties with Tehran in 1980 after its embassy in
Tehran was taken over by radical Iranian students at the heydays of
the 1979 Islamic revolution, which toppled the former pro-U.S. shah
regime.
</P>
<P>
Following the election of moderate President Mohammad Khatami in
1997, the two countries exchanged some goodwill signals and U.S.
officials called for "unconditional talks" with Tehran to improve
their ties.
</P>
<P>
In reply, Iranian government officials have urged the U.S. to
take concrete steps to show its sincerity in improving ties with
Iran.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President Calls for Fighting Against Water Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
said Saturday that the pollution of seas and rivers is a problem
for the humanity.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting to celebrate the Water Day of World,
Demirel said, "In the past, human beings never asked themselves
whether the seas and rivers would be dirty one day. But they
polluted the seas and rivers themselves. The issue is an
international one, and a matter of saving the world."
</P>
<P>
The whole world has to take measures first to control population
growth, said Demirel, noting that the resources of the world are
not enough for such a big population today.
</P>
<P>
"The world should use the water in the best way," said Demirel.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the cross-border waters, Demirel indicated it is
unfair to claim that the water problem in the Middle East stems
from the waters of Tigris and Euphrates.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Iraq, the downstream countries of the two rivers,
accuse the upstream Turkey of reducing flow of water to them.
Demirel argued ,"How much of water from the rivers will be used by
Turkey and the other countries respectively?"
</P>
<P>
His remarks showed that Turkey allows enough water flow from the
rivers to its neighboring countries in the Middle East.

<P>
CAIRO, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The preparations for the forthcoming
African-European Union (EU) summit have entered the final stage,
and three sessions will be held to tackle economic, political and
social issues, a senior Egyptian official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The preparatory committee of the summit has finalized the paper
work of the conference, including its final communique and plan of
action, Ali Hassan, assistant foreign minister for African affairs
and secretary general of the summit meeting, said.
</P>
<P>
The first session of the two-day summit will tackle the economic
issues, including African-EU economic cooperation, regional
economic integration and the merging of the African economy into
that of the world, Hassan said.
</P>
<P>
The second is to deal with political questions, such as settling
African disputes through peaceful means, along with the problems of
refugees and terrorism, he said.
</P>
<P>
The third session will be dedicated to debating issues
concerning social development, including the elimination of
poverty, disease and improvement of education in Africa, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hassan disclosed that more than 50 African and EU leaders have
decided to participate in the summit. Reports have said that some
17 others are also expected to take part in the event.
</P>
<P>
Hassan recently took part in the sixth and last preparatory
meeting in Lisbon, Portugal, for the summit, which is to be
inaugurated by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on April 3, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency reported. Portugal is currently holding
EU's rotating presidency for the first half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The summit will be preceded by a meeting on April 1 of African
foreign ministers and another of African and EU foreign ministers
on April 2 to finalize the agenda of the summit.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Political Affiliation for Reformist's Assassins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Intelligence Minister Ali
Yunesi said Saturday that the agents behind assassination attempt
on Saeed Hajjarian, a close ally of President Mohammad Khatami,
have not affiliation to any group or guild or foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Yunesi told local press that the culprits had carried out the
assassination attempt on their own and out of personal feelings and
motivations, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Understanding their motivation is very important for us,
although we can not give full response to this at present, but
preliminary investigations show that personal feelings and
motivations have been the key to the assassination attempt," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Yunesi said that Iranian security authorities have arrested 10
people, five of them are main culprits, including the person who
shot Hajjarian, one aboard a motorbike, two people supporting them
and another who delivered a letter to Hajjarian preparing the
ground for the assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
He said that one of the main culprits was jobless, another one
was a part-time worker in the guardhouse of the Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps and had been in motorbike trade in his
spare time and the rest have been in private business.
</P>
<P>
The level of the group's education shows that they had
perpetrated the killing attempt out of personal extremist feelings,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, deputy chairman of the Tehran Municipal Council and
managing director of reformist daily Sobh-e Emrouz (This Morning),
has been seriously wounded by a bullet lodged in his neck in the
terrorist attack on February 12.
</P>
<P>
The prominent reformist has been in a coma since then, but
doctors said that his conditions have been improving.
</P>
<P>
Also a close adviser to President Khatami, Hajjarian played an
important role in reformers' landslide victory in the parliament
elections last month, a result which humiliated the powerful
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Widespread rumors here believed that the assassination attempt
was a revenge by the conservatives, who still dominate the
country's most sensitive organs.
</P>
<P>
Yunesi said that the gun used in the assassination attempt was
an outdated one of the Makarov kind, which is not in possession of
any Iranian security organizations.
</P>
<P>
He said that the group has also been involved in another
assassination of Ghasem Shafiee, an unidentified personality, who
was killed last month in Shahr-e Rey, south of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Investigation was focused on Shahr-e Rey, after it was known
that both attempts were made by a single group, he added.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: OPEC Ministerial Meeting to Make Difficult Decision on Oil Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Amid differences over whether to
increase oil supplies in the world market, the Organization of Oil
Exporting Countries (OPEC) has to make a difficult decision on the
question at its ministerial meeting in Vienna on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ministerial meeting, which will determine the trend of the
world oil prices, has become a focus of attention in the entire
world, particularly on the part of leading oil producing and
consuming countries.
</P>
<P>
Since OPEC members and non-OPEC producers reached an agreement
last March on slashing the oil output by a total of 2.1 million
barrels per day, prices in the world market jumped to 30 dollars a
barrel, tripling the prices in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, the feverish rise in oil prices has worried the leading
consumers, particularly the U.S and the European countries which
have repeatedly demanded the oil producers to increase supplies to
curb the soaring prices.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. demand is so pressing that Secretary of Energy Bill
Richardson warned in Paris on March 22 that his country might use
its oil reserves unless OPEC takes a move to ease the increasing
oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, oil producers, both inside and outside OPEC, have
been at loggerheads over whether there is a gap between demand and
supply in the global market, whether there is dire and urgent need
to increase oil supplies, when and in what form such an increase in
supplies should begin.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, OPEC members are keen to reach an agreement at Vienna
meeting which can serve the interests of both producers and
consumers and achieve a balance between demand and supply in order
to prevent collapse in the oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Gulf oil analysts say that most OPEC member states support a
reasonable increase in output starting from next month, though
Libya, Iran and Algeria adopt a contrary stand.
</P>
<P>
The analysts added that the differences between the two sides
are reflected in three aspects.
</P>
<P>
The first aspect is over what the real reason is for the rise in
the oil prices. Some say the world economy is witnessing an
encouraging situation, notably reflected in the fact that Asian
countries have managed to get rid of the negative effects of the
damaging financial crisis and their economies are recovering, which
led to the increase in the demand for oil. Others say speculators
and profiteers are to blame for the unusual rise in the oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The second aspect is related to the trend of demand in the world
market. The countries opposing the increase in the output hold
that the rising demand for oil will decline by the end of this
winter, and as a result, oil prices are expected to go down below
25 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
The third aspect is about consequences which may result from
revising the oil supplies in the market. Some countries fear that
the rise of output will eventually lead to a collapse of the
prices, and it might prompt the major industrial countries to
increase their oil reserves, thus preventing the prices to rise
again.
</P>
<P>
Experts expect that despite of different points of view among
OPEC members, they will make every possible effort, taking into
account the organizations unity and their common interests, to
reach a moderate agreement or some kind of compromise on the
increase of oil output by 1.5 million bpd as of next April,
pointing out that this increase might be put into effect on two
phases, and that OPEC will discuss output ceilings again next
September.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Water Minister Leaves for Libya on Huge Water Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Amman, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Minister of Water and
Irrigation Kamel Mahadin left here on Saturday for Libya to seek
help for a massive Jordanian water project with an estimated cost
of 700 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Before departure, Mahadin said his four-day visit is aimed at
completing talks with the Libyan side on the Disi water project,
which is to extract water from an aquifer in the southern Disi
district for the capital Amman, and at learning Libyan expertise on
water projects.
</P>
<P>
Libya has voiced readiness to finance by 70 percent the 320-
kilometer Disi-Amman pipeline system, Mahadin said.
</P>
<P>
"This vital project will provide water for Amman and southern
governates and is expected to help in solving water shortage for
the capital for the coming 30 years by providing 100 million cubic
meters per year," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the water shortage in the desert kingdom is around 220
million cubic meters per year and the number is expected to rise to
250 million cubic meters in 10 years due to the growth of
population, and industrial and agricultural activities.
</P>
<P>
However, the project has been controversial in the kingdom, as
the ancient Disi aquifer is largely non-renewable and has already
been over exploited for agricultural purposes.
</P>
<P>
Currently the water level of the huge aquifer is dropping by 80
to 85 centimeters each year, experts said.

<HEADLINE> Blair: Relations Between London And Berlin  "Excellent" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said Saturday relations with Germany have never been so good,
despite growing anger at BMW's sell-off of Rover.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference in Oxford with German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder, Blair said relations "had never been warmer
than they are today".
</P>
<P>
Blair touched on the continuing row over BMW's action, saying
he did not believe it had harmed the British and German
Governments' bilateral friendship.
</P>
<P>
The British government was furious last week when BMW abruptly
announced it was selling most of Rover to other companies, putting
thousands of British jobs in jeopardy,without telling Britain
anything.
</P>
<P>
A survey released Saturday suggested six out of 10 people in
the UK are now less likely to buy a car from the German firm after
thousands of jobs were put at risk.
</P>
<P>
However, Schroeder praised British-German ties and criticized
BMW for what he described as a lack of transparency in its
dealings with Rover.

<HEADLINE> Angola Closer to Agreement With IMF: Economist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Angolan government is now closer
to an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) since
the country has succeeded in keeping its financial market stable
in recent months, Jose Cerqueira, an economist, said here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the economist, the stability of the exchange rate
on the Angolan financial market and the rise in the crude oil
price on the international market create the necessary environment
for an accord between the government and the IMF.
</P>
<P>
To the economist, an accord might be reached as the exchange
rate is favored by a conjunction of factors like the country's oil
price and exports.
</P>
<P>
"Since the negotiations with the IMF started in 1999, the
Angolan government has never been closer to an agreement than it
is now", said the economist. As an effort for reaching an
agreement with IMF, the Angolan government has taken measures to
stabilize the financial market through certain administrative
interference in late 1999.

<HEADLINE> Terrible Drought Prevailing in Ethiopia: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Citizens of Addis Ababa, the
capital of Ethiopia, like people of many parts of the country,
have been longing for the arrival of the small rainy season since
late October, but their thirst for the rain has time and again
come to nothing.
</P>
<P>
Currently, drought have been prevailing from Tigray, a
northern region bordering with Eritrea, to the Borena region,
bordering with Kenya, Teferi Dejene, an official in charge of
weather forecast and early warning team with the National
Meteorological Bureau, told Xinhua Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"Many places in Ethiopia is highly dependent on rain.
Currently, farmers cannot prepare cultivation while many cattles,
sheep and other livestock are dying because of shortage of
water," Teferi said.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee the minimum requirement for water, Teferi said,
local authorities in Somali and some other regions have been
trying to provide the people in the most affected areas with
drinking water by sending water tankers from water available
areas.
</P>
<P>
Asked how many percent of farmland are affected by drought,
Teferi said it was very difficult to assess the extent of
drought-affected areas at this moment, but one thing is clear,
namely, almost all the farmland depends on the irrigation of
rain.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is nicknamed "the water tower of East Africa" because
of its abundance of rainfall and terrain of highland, but it is
also one of African countries that often suffers from drought
due to lack of necessary flood storage capacity.
</P>
<P>
"Many parts of Ethiopia has been suffering from drought since
mid 1990's, " Teferi said, adding the raging bush fires in the
Borena region has close relations with the sustained drought
situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia normally has three seasons in a year: the first, short
rainy season beginning from February to May; the second, the big
rainy season from July to September, and the third, dry season
from October to next January.
</P>
<P>
Last year is apparently an abnormal year in terms of rainfall,
Teferi said, noting Ethiopia might have worse experience of
drought if there had no plenty of rains between July and late
October of last year.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the current failure of rain across the country,
Teferi said the short rainy season should have come in late March
due to the influence of the Lalina phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
"Actually it is about to begin," he said, noting the rainfall
on late Friday was a proof.
</P>
<P>
However, he also warned that "Even if it starts now, the amount
and distribution of the rainfall will not be normal."

<HEADLINE> S. African TRC Fails to Address Black-on-Black Violence: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The South African Truth and
 Reconciliation Commission (TRC) has completely failed to
address or find the root causes for black-on-black violence which
has claimed more than 30, 000 lives in this country, Home Affairs
Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the African Renaissance Festival in Durban on the
conflict challenge facing Africa, Buthelezi said the TRC had
achieved some success in investigating and portraying
white-on-black violence and black-on-white violence.
</P>
<P>
Only time would tell if they had been successful in
reconciling these two groups, he was quoted by South African Press
Association as saying.
</P>
<P>
"However, in respect of black-on-black violence neither truth
nor reconciliation has been achieved," he said, adding that "the
TRC has not even begun to scratch the surface of black-on-black
violence," Buthelezi said.
</P>
<P>
The TRC has undergone major setbacks in the research and
understanding of the root causes and dynamics of black-on-black
violence, Buthelezi said.
</P>
<P>
Some 30,000 people were killed in black-on-black violence and
hundreds of thousands were displaced during the anti-apartheid
struggle. In contrast only 600 whites were killed.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that we are far from exposing the picture of what
really happened in our country," Buthelezi said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, African National Congress leader in KwaZulu-Natal
Province, S'bu Ndebele, said people of Africa were not in
conflict with the rest of world but "in conflict with people of
Africa".
</P>
<P>
He said violence in KwaZulu-Natal, in which thousands have
died in the past 15 years, could be solved through cooperation by
the political parties -- as was currently being done.

<HEADLINE> Summer-Time to Start Tonight in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The summer-time will start on
Saturday night in Turkey, a country short of energy, the Anatolia
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
At the midnight, the standard time will be advanced by one hour
at 0100 a.m. on March 26 to start the summer-time, which will also
be adopted by the European countries, and last seven months.
</P>
<P>
The summer-time in Turkey will end on October 29, 2000 when the
clocks are wound one hour back.
</P>
<P>
Turkish officials said that a total of 600-625 million kilowatt
hours of energy is expected to be saved from this year's summer-
time application, more than annual production of Gokcekaya
Hydroelectric Power Station in western Turkey in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The medium-sized hydroelectric power station produced 589.6
million kilowatt hours of energy in the year.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is making all efforts to diversify its sources of
importing energy, and save energy by implementing summer-time
starting from the end of annual Spring.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Pakistan, India to Resume Dialogue on  Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Saturday once again urged Pakistan and India to hold a dialogue to
resolve the Kashmir dispute as "there is no military solution" to
it.
</P>
<P>
"India and Pakistan can resolve the Kashmir issue through
dialogue," he said in a televised 15-minute address during his
visit to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Clinton assured America's all-out support to efforts for the
restoration of Lahore process. "That is the right road."
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee went across the
border in February last year to sign, with his then Pakistani
counterpart Nawaz Sharif, the Lahore Declaration which called for
peaceful dialogue on Kashmir and other issues.
</P>
<P>
However, the dialogue process was interrupted by the Kargil
conflicts in the following summer when intense military actions
were taken on the Line of Control in Kashmir by both sides.
</P>
<P>
Clinton expressed the same hope for New Delhi earlier during
his five-day visit there but failed to convince the Indian
government of the imperativeness of resumption of dialogue.
</P>
<P>
"We want to be a force for peace but we cannot force peace," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The regional tensions, the American president said, are holding
back Pakistan in the era of global economy. He expressed the hop
that Pakistan can make its way through the troubles and head
confidently towards a prosperous future.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also asked Islamabad to intensify its efforts to combat
terrorism and to act as a "leader in nuclear non-proliferation".
</P>
<P>
The United States and Pakistan, he said, should resolve their
differences on the nuclear issue.
</P>
<P>
"Today the United States is cutting its nuclear arsenal - let
Pakistan be a leader in nuclear non-proliferation."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan was the last leg of Clinton's three-nation South Asian
tour which had taken him to Bangladesh and India.

<HEADLINE> Algerian Security Forces Kill 5 Terrorists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Algerian security forces killed
five terrorists in a recent operation in Lala Um-Saad mountain
area, 122 kilometers south of the capital, local newspaper Alkhabar
daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that 13 terrorists stopped a truck on Thursday,
forcing the driver to carry them to Akhdarai town. But after their
arrival, the driver reported to the security forces who immediately
launched a search-and-kill operation against the terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Five of the terrorists were shot dead at night while the rest
fled into the jungles, it added.
</P>
<P>
Despite sporadic shootout, the security situation in Algeria has
improved since President Abdel Aziz Bouteflika came to power late
last June, who promised to pardon Islamic militants who surrendered
their arms by January 13 for a national reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
So far, most militants surrendered to the authorities and the
terrorist attacks have decreased.
</P>
<P>
However, some militants still act across the country. Algerian
security forces have killed over 100 Islamic militants since
January 13 when a six-month amnesty to rebels expired. 
</P>
<P>
Algeria has been rocked by Islamic insurgency which had left
more than 100,000 people dead since 1992. It was touched off by the
army's cancellation of the second round of legislative elections
that the Islamic Salvation Front was poised to win.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Government Troops Ready for Guerrilla War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LUANDA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Armed Forces of Angola (FAA)
are currently making efforts to adjust themselves to the guerrilla
war which is expanded by the rebels all around the country,
Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos was quoted here on
Saturday by the official news agency Angop as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We are doing an adjustment of our forces and means to the new
nature of the war that UNITA wants to expand throughout the
national territory", said the president, adding that he was sure
that as soon as the adjustment ends, the guerrilla will gradually
have smaller maneuvering space and the government will control
the battle fronts.
</P>
<P>
After a general offensive launched by the government troops in
last September, which is called by the government as "the Restauro
Operation", the Angolan rebels led by Jonas Savimbi lost 80
percent of their conventional forces and most of their military
and political bases in the central highland including the
political and military headquarters Bailundo and Andulo.
</P>
<P>
Under this circumstance, the rebels scattered into small
groups, hiding in the forest areas and re-conducting the guerrilla
warfare which they had well mastered during the over 25 years of
civil war.
</P>
<P>
"After the Restauro Operation, which was practically finished
in January, we are in a kind of operative pause", said dos Santos,
adding that "there has been a favorable evolution of the
government forces in all regions where there is still some tension
and we think that the perspective for this year are good".

<HEADLINE> Fighting Escalates in Somalia as Peace Talks Deadlocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mogadishu, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Fightings between Somali clans
of the Biyo-Mal and Tunnih clans in the Lower Shabelleh region is
escalating after peace tentative by other clans in the region has
deadlocked Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, the fighting, broke out
last Sunday in Erileh village some 35 Km North of the coastal
district of Brava, has escalated Saturday morning reaching the
former post control of Brava district, which is only five
Kilometers North of the town.
</P>
<P>
Independent sources confirmed that the fighting has destroyed
the village of Robow while fire blaze deliberately set on the
other neighboring village of Erileh has destroyed several houses.
</P>
<P>
There are no exact casualty figures available at this moment,
however independent businessmen in Brava district confirmed that
there were eight people from both sides killed in the clash, while
more than a dozen others were wounded Friday.
</P>
<P>
Commuters who reached Brava district this afternoon said both
sides have been using infantry militiamen equipped with hand
grenades and machine guns.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the negotiators, the Tunnih clan
militiamen have organized themselves outside the Ababay
checkpoint, some 15 Km North of the town Friday night, where the
clashes have started in the morning.
</P>
<P>
The Biyo-Mal militiamen who are better organized and
economically far better than the Tunnih have managed to dislodge
their opponents outside the Robow and Erileh villages.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of families mainly from the Tunnih clan displaced by
the fighting have been stranded in Brava center with no shelter or
anyone to help them.
</P>
<P>
A VHF radio operator told this reporter this afternoon said a
few of those families could afford to buy the cheap fish available
in the town in abundance, while many of the other internally
displaced ones are being left with no other alternative but to
start beginning.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the fighting purely relates to an earlier
dispute over farmlands leased to farmers from the Biyo-Mal
clansmen.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the elders in Brava district,
farmers from the Biyo-Mal have hired land for the past farming
season. But unfortunately, since there had been no rains the
owners of the farmlands have asked more money for rent of the
second season, something the clients have refused.
</P>
<P>
The clients claimed that they did not harvest anything from the
farmland and therefore have the right to cultivate the land
whenever there come some rain.
</P>
<P>
In the beginning of the dispute, two people from both sides
were killed and two houses have been destroyed in the Erileh
village before elders from the same clans have intervened with the
help of other neighboring clan elders.
</P>
<P>
Despite these failed attempts, still the traditional elders
from the two sides are busy trying to curb down the hostility.
</P>
<P>
The fighting is already affecting the economy of Brava district
since the heavy duty trucks belonging to the Tunnih clan have quit
their operations for the insecurity prevailing along the roads
leading outside Brava town.

<HEADLINE> Canada Blamed for 80% of Cyber-Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- An American intelligence agency
has determined that up to 80 percent of foreign attacks on U.S.
computers either originate or pass through Canada, the Ottawa
Citizen newspaper quoted a report as saying Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency estimates that a full 80
percent of the attacks upon U.S. systems originate in or pass
through Canada," states the report, done last year by Canadian
military and intelligence agencies for the Canadian Department of
National Defense.
</P>
<P>
The report quotes the Defense Intelligence Agency, the U.S.
military's counterpart to the CIA, as warning that Canada is seen
as a "Zone of Vulnerability," and will be under increasing
pressure to do more to combat cyberterrorism.
</P>
<P>
"It is the assessment of the (Canadian government's)
Intelligence Policy Group that the United States and our allies
will expect Canada to participate in combating and reducing the
cyber threat," says the report.
</P>
<P>
The idea that Canada is home to numerous computer hackers
targeting the U.S. is likely to further fuel concerns among
American politicians. Some have already voiced concerns about
Canada being a jumping-off point for terrorists trying to sneak
into the U.S., calling Canada a "Club Med" for terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Louis Freeh, director of the FBI (Federal Bureau of
Investigation), has also referred to Canada as a "hacker haven"
and FBI investigators believe one or more Canadian Internet
servers were used in the recent attacks that disabled Yahoo.com,
eBay and other U.S.-based commercial sites, said the Canadian
newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Rebels Said to Be Attacking Soldiers, Polling Stations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Chechen rebels have been shooting
at Russian federal military and police posts in Chechnya and at
local polling stations set up for Sunday's presidential elections,
the Interfax news agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, seven guerrillas attacked an Interior Ministry
forces post in the Chechen capital Grozny, using rifles and
grenade launchers, Interfax quoted military sources as saying.
There were no casualties among the Russians.
</P>
<P>
According to an unconfirmed report, a military post in the
Argun district came under fire on Saturday, Interfax said. "The
clash went on for quite a long time," a military source was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Another unconfirmed report said a Chechen vehicle had tried to
break into Chechnya's second largest city, Gudermes.
</P>
<P>
The governor of the Russian-controlled Nadterechnaya district
said Russian security and police forces carried out a special
operation on Saturday and detained 11 suspects.
</P>
<P>
The governor, Akhmed Zavgayev, told Interfax he could not
confirm a report that a bomb had been found in Znamenskoye, a
district center.
</P>
<P>
Russian federal troops beefed up security in the breakaway
republic in the run-up to Sunday's elections.
</P>
<P>
 A travel ban was imposed from Friday through Monday to ward
off possible rebel threats to stage terrorist attacks and sabotage.
</P>
<P>
The checking regime has been tightened; the protection of
ballot stations strengthened and block stations at the entrances
to villages reinforced, Interfax quoted military headquarters in
the North Caucasus as saying on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Some 460,000 registered voters are expected to cast their
ballots in 340 polling stations in 12 of Chechnya's districts.
</P>
<P>
Moscow launched a massive anti-terrorist military campaign in
Chechnya in August last year after separatists invaded the
neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan and allegedly carried out
a series of apartment blasts in Moscow and two other Russian
cities which claimed over 300 lives.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Papers Hope Clinton Has the Key to Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A Syrian official newspaper on
Saturday expressed hope that U.S. President Bill Clinton would have
good news on Israeli's acceptance of Syrian demands when he meets
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Tishrin carried an article written by its editor-in-chief,
Mohamed Kheir Wadi, saying Syrians hope Clinton would bring
Israel's endorsement to the demarcation along the pre-June 1967
lines and a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
"Without this, it will be difficult to presume that the peace
process on the Syrian-Israeli track can return to its normal
course," said the article.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that Syria will go to Geneva with a open heart and
mind and a sincere desire to make peace in the region, and with
willingness to build constructive cooperation with Clinton to
achieve these goals, "even though the Israeli side is still opposed
to realizing peace."
</P>
<P>
Syrian-Israeli peace talks, which resumed late last year, broke
down in January due to disputes over which issues should be
discussed first. Syria demands a prior Israeli commitment to a full
withdrawal from the Golan it captured in 1967 before the two sides
return to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Arab and world media show special interest in coming Clinton-
Assad summit and hope it will help revive the stalled negotiations
between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy has again indicated
that Israel "will not pull back to the June 4 lines", thus raising
doubts over Israel's intentions to make real peace, the article
said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, another official newspaper, Althawra, said in
its comment that Clinton will prove if he carries with him the key
of peace which represents the minimum degree of the Syrian demands,
notably the full pullout from the occupied Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
It said that all other files related to peace are available for
discussion and the ball now is in the Israeli court for the last
time.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Ugandan Cult Leaders Murder Followers for Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Feng Jian
</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Uganda, a tiny inland African
country, has been in the limelight of the international media
recently for the world's second biggest mass killing of over 530
members of the cult Movement for the Restoration of Ten
Commandments of God last week.
</P>
<P>
As investigations unfold step by step, the general public has
increasingly been convinced that some leaders of the cult murdered
their followers for money.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, a devastating fire killed 530 members of the cult
who were reportedly praying to be brought to heaven in a church
in Kanungu, Rukungiri district, 320 km southwest of the capital
city Kampala. Police authorities described the tragedy as a mere
case of mass suicide although there were some clues pointing to
murder.
</P>
<P>
Police Spokesman Asuman Mugenyi told Xinhua soon after the
incident that the windows and doors to the church were nailed
shut so that nobody inside could escape, leaving open the
questions as to who nailed all the exits and what for.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni condemned the incident in the
 strongest terms and described it as a "horrific, senseless and
tragic event"
</P>
<P>
on Sunday. The next day saw Minister of Internal Affairs Edward
Rugumayo and Inspector General of Police John Kisembo flying to
the scene to assess the situation.
</P>
<P>
However, as more pieces of evidence are being collected by the
police, they tend to label it a case of both suicide and murder.
They argued that if the adult members of the cult were willing to
go to heaven in the church fire, the 78 children, most of them at
school-age, were most probably forced to die in such a brutal
manner.
</P>
<P>
Two days after that, evidence showed that some cult leaders
including its founders Joseph Kibwetere and Celedonia Mwerinde
were not burnt by the fire and they were most probably alive and
on the run.
</P>
<P>
According to police analysis, the two cult leaders took with
big sums of money they had collected from cult members and they
had some connections in foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in State House Thursday, Rugumayo said
that murder elements in the case have been growing rapidly, a big
difference from what the government had said about the nature of
the case.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua reporters witnessed on Friday a total of 153 cult
member bodies were exhumed from three big mass graves discovered
in the former residential places of some of the cult members at
Kashenyi village, Buhunda sub-county in Rukungiri district.
Police officers and forensic experts there said that their cult
members had been strangled to death and had been buried there for
about one up to six months.
</P>
<P>
They firmly believed that the cult leaders, who had asked their
 followers to sell their property and give them the money, were
still alive and it is these cult leaders who murdered these
innocent believers for their money.
</P>
<P>
Police Spokesman Mugenyi was quoted by Radio Uganda as saying
on Friday evening that the police have come to conclusion that the
cult leaders murdered their followers and the case was being
treated as a case of mass murder.
</P>
<P>
The investigations into the depth of the case are still under
way, but the sure thing is that an international manhunt for the
cult leaders would ensue and the cult, founded in 1989, would be
totally uprooted in the African country very soon and that the
surviving cult leaders, if any, would definitely get what they
deserve.

<HEADLINE> Trimble Wins Northern Irish Leadership Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader
David Trimble Saturday narrowly beat off a leadership challenge,
in a result that could have far-reaching effects on the Northern
Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
But Trimble, who was favorite to win the poll, failed to win a
clear endorsement of his handling of the Northern Ireland peace
process.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the UUP's 800-strong ruling council, Trimble
won 457 votes, or 56 percent of the vote, while his challenger
Martin Smyth, a long-standing opponent of the Good Friday
Agreement, won 348 votes, thus keeping alive the British province'
s peace hopes.
</P>
<P>
Smyth launched the challenge because of recent comments by
Trimble that he would be prepared to enter into government again
with Roman Catholic politicians if they just gave a guarantee on
paramilitary disarmament rather than insisting that weapons should
be handed in first.
</P>
<P>
The UUP ruling council will also vote on a motion from the
London-based unionist, David Burnside, asking the party to refuse
to take part in a new devolved government, unless the title of the
Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) is retained.
</P>
<P>
The RUC's name is due to be changed under reforms recommended
by Chris Patten. Trimble said he intended to table an amendment to
the motion.
</P>
<P>
Losing this policy vote could cause Trimble as many problems as
the leadership challenge.
</P>
<P>
The peace process has been stalled since mid-February, when the
British government suspended the fledgling Northern Ireland power-
sharing assembly, over the Irish Republican Army's failure to
decommission its weapons.

<HEADLINE> French Photographers Protest Charges by Volcano "Owners" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Several hundred French
photographers Saturday staged a protest in Clermont-Ferrand,
central France, against the charges imposed on their colleagues by
the "owners" of a volcano in the mountain of Puy du Pariou in
Massif Central, central France, said the organizers of the protest.
</P>
<P>
The owners of the land where the volcano is located have
charged a magazine 120,000 francs (about 18,300 U.S. dollars) and
a photo company 190,000 francs (29,000 U.S. dollars) for
publishing a photo of "their" volcano.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for professional photographers to
mobilize themselves "against the abusive interpretation of the
right of property," said the organizers.

WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S, newspapers Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
--The cartel of major crude oil producers has regained its
clout over world oil markets in the past year by showing
uncharacteristic discipline in adhering to its own production
quotas and by broadening its influence through deals with non-
member exporting nations.
</P>
<P>
-- The United States agreed to double the amount of money Iraq
is allowed to spend requiring its oil industry and lifted "holds"
on more than $100 million in electrical equipment, vehicles, track
batteries and other items destined for Iraq under an exemption to
U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Ugandan police discovered 153 bodies buried in shallow
graves on land belonging to the same doomsday cult involved in
hundreds of deaths late last week. And these people, including at
least 59 children, were found to be killed.
</P>
<P>
-- High anxiety has replaced great expectations in Islamabad,
with people anticipating that President Bill Clinton will arrive
on Saturday not just to say hello, but also to deliver a scolding.

<HEADLINE> Perkins Against Swimming Bodysuits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Australia's dual Olympic
champion Kieren Perkins said on Saturday that the bodysuits gave
swimmers an unfair advantage because they provided extra buoyancy.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they should be part of the sport," Perkins, who
won the 1,500 meters freestyle at the 1992 and 1996 Olympics, told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"They have a very positive effect on the way you swim. They
make you faster, they improve your endurance and they aid buoyancy.
"
</P>
<P>
Perkins's comments came just days after the Australian Olympic
Committee asked the Court of Arbitration for Sport to investigate
the legality of the suits even though swimming's world governing
body FINA has already cleared them.

<HEADLINE> FC Tokyo Stuns Nagoya in J-League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Newly promoted FC Tokyo continued
their surprising run in the J-League on Saturday, defeating
Emperor's Cup holders Nagoya Grampus Eight 2-1 on a golden goal to
stay top of the 16-team first division, according to Kyodo reports.
</P>
<P>
Yukihiko Sato snatched an 81st-minute equalizer before
Brazilian striker Amaral drove home a low shot from a difficult
angle 15 minutes into extra time as Tokyo added two points while
sending the visitors to the bottom of the table still without a
point.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo is level with two-time J-League champions Kashima Antlers,
also winners in extra time Saturday, on eight points from three
games but kept their league lead on goal difference.
</P>
<P>
Kashima, bent on wresting the J-League title back from
archrivals Jubilo Iwata, scraped past Avispa Fukuoka 1-0 away on a
penalty by Brazilian midfielder Bismarck after 105 minutes of play.
</P>
<P>
Iwata rebounded firmly from their shock opening-day loss at
home to Kashiwa Reysol to notch their second successive win with a
comfortable 3-1 victory at Yokohama F Marinos, with Takashi
Fukunishi, Masashi Nakayama and Norihiro Nishi on target.
</P>
<P>
In Ichihara, former Japan striker Hisashi Kurosaki showed his
old form as he scored a hat trick as Vissel Kobe pulled off the
biggest win in club history by hammering JEF United Ichihara 6-1
to go third -- one point behind Tokyo and Kashima.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Shimizu S-Pulse put last week's defeat to Yokohama
behind them as they edge Kashiwa 2-1 at home thanks to a sudden-
death winner from substitute Tsuyoshi Tanikawa.
</P>
<P>
At Cerezo Osaka's Nagai Stadium, Hiroaki Morishima found the
net twice after the interval in a 5-2 defeat of visiting Verdy
Kawasaki, while a last-minute penalty from Australian defender
Tony Popovic gave Sanfrecce Hiroshima a 1-0 win at Kawasaki
Frontale.
</P>
<P>
In Kyoto, Purple Sanga midfielder Makoto Atsuta netted the only
goal in the second half for a 1-0 home win over Gamba Osaka.

<HEADLINE> China Loses to Hungary 2-3 in Top Three Play-off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- China narrowly missed the chance
to win its maiden Pool C championship after a 3-2 loss to Hungary
at the World Ice Hockey Pool C Championships here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hungary jumped to a 2-0 lead in the opening period through
Palkovics Krisztian and Orso Laszlo.
</P>
<P>
China, inspired by a host crowd of about 12,000, made up the
deficit as Zhang Lei scored a power-play goal at 23:46 and Pan
Zhiqiang added another at 31:16.
</P>
<P>
However, Szelig Viktor beat Chinese goalie Liu Xue with a slap
shot 1:25 after Pan's goal to make Hungary lead 3-2 at the end of
the second period.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese tried all out to find an equalizer in the third but
failed to find the net with 15 shots.
</P>
<P>
"We did well in the second and third periods," said Chinese
head coach Wang Jingang. "We've got a chance to win, but we did
not grasp it."
</P>
<P>
China finished its top-three round-robin matches with two
points from a win and a loss. Hungary had two points with a match
left against Croatia, in which they have a big chance to win.
</P>
<P>
In the day's other match, Lithunia downed South Korea 8-3 in a
match to decide the fourth to sixth places and Spain drew with
Yugoslavia 1-1 in a seventh-to-ninth play-off.

<HEADLINE> TV Serial Stresses Yellow River Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Parched land craving for water,
thirsty people waiting for tap water, and polluted river banks
longing for cleaning are highlights of the nine-part TV serial "
Saving the Yellow River".
</P>
<P>
The series, part of which was first shown at a press conference
here today, is aimed at letting Chinese people know what their "
mother river" is now suffering. The drought period along the river
is getting longer every year -- a record 226 days in 1997.
Moreover, 11 power plants on its upper and middle reaches are now
unable to operate efficiently owing to a lack of water.
</P>
<P>
Sociologists and experts in hydraulics point out in the program
that overuse of water for farmland irrigation and industry is a
major cause of the shortage of water in the area. In 1998 a report
by the Chinese Academy of Sciences warned that the drying up of
the Yellow River is becoming more serious, and might even result
in the shifting of the channel on the lower reaches.
</P>
<P>
The river is the "mother river" of the Chinese nation, as it
was on the banks of the river that Chinese civilization first
arose.
</P>
<P>
Publicity activities to raise public awareness and efforts to
increase the green coverage rate along the river by planting trees
and returning farmland to grassland have been carried out
nationwide in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River flows through Qinghai, Sichuan, Gansu and
Shaanxi provinces, and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, which
are all included in the Western China Development Strategy.
</P>
<P>
About 161 million ha of pasture in the river's source area,
Madoi County in Qinghai Province, is now rapidly degenerating,
accounting for 70 percent of the county's total grassland. It
supplies nearly 49 percent of the river's water volume. Moreover,
the 640,000-sq km Loess Highlands is the area with the most
serious water and soil erosion in the world.
</P>
<P>
Improvement of the environmental conditions along the river has
been set by the Central government as one of the key tasks in the
project. Only thus can China achieve sustainable economic and
social development, said Wang Xianjin, a deputy to the National
People's Congress and an expert on environmental protection.

<TEXT>
<P>
Nanning, March 25 (Xinhua) -- More than 30,000 birds have been
saved from dealers in Nanning, capital of south China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region, since the first Birds Week was held here
in 1983.
</P>
<P>
In this year's annual Birds Week (March 20-26), a painting by a
schoolboy of a crying bird being cooked in a pot attracted much
attention.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu Mingchuan, honorary vice-president of the
Nanning Wild Life Protection Association, Guangxi's once-abundant
bird resources have been diminishing due to abuse of ecological
environment.
</P>
<P>
Among the world's 20 endangered bird species, China has 12, and
six of them live in Guangxi. He noted that less than 50 black-
necked reeves pheasants survive.
</P>
<P>
The city has taken effective measures -- including widespread
publicity work -- to stop the illegal hunting, transporting and
trading of wildlife, including birds.

<HEADLINE> India, China Should Build Constructive Partnership:  Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It is the need of the times for China and India to establish a
cooperative and constructive partnership into the 21st century,"
said Zhou at a gathering here hosted by the Delhi-based Friends of
China Society to mark the upcoming 50th anniversary of the
establishment of the Sino-Indian diplomatic relations, which falls
on April 1.
</P>
<P>
The building of such a partnership should be based on the Five
Principles of Peaceful Co-existence, which were jointly initiated
by leaders of both countries in the 1950s and have now become the
universally acknowledged basic norms guiding state-to-state
relations, said the Chinese ambassador.
</P>
<P>
The prerequisite for China and India in developing their
bilateral relations is not to regard each other as a threat, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Zhou suggested that both countries should maintain the momentum
of exchanges of visits by their leaders so as to enhance mutual
understanding.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking forward to the state visit to China by H.E.
President of India in 2000," he said. "This visit will play an
important role in promoting the further development of the
bilateral relations."
</P>
<P>
Both countries should also further expand the mutually-
beneficial cooperation in the fields of trade and economy, science
and technology and maintain and expand friendly exchanges and
cooperation in the fields of culture, education and people-to-
people contact, he said, adding that contacts and exchanges
between the armed forces of both countries should also be
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Both sides also need to take a positive attitude toward the
signing of agreements on investment protection, the opening of
direct flights and other specific steps which will help promote
bilateral exchanges and cooperation, he added.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- American athletics superstar
Michael Johnson is planning more world records after his
spectacular start to the outdoor season with a 300 meters world
best of 30.85 seconds in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"I still haven't broken that (400 meters) record by enough yet,
" double Olympic champion Johnson was quoted as saying by Reuters.
</P>
<P>
"I still think 42 seconds is possible," Johnson, who lowered
Butch Reynolds's 400 meters record to 43.18 seconds at last year's
world championships in Seville, told the Reuters reporter.
</P>
<P>
"And I don't think it's that difficult to do," he added.
</P>
<P>
"I won't be disappointed if I don't break it again," he said,
then reconsidered: "But to a degree, I will be a little
disappointed if I don't."
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who opened his South African tour last week with the
fourth-fastest 200 meters ever of 19.71, also predicted he would
sprint even faster in his run-up to the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
He said times of 19.4 and 19.5 appeared well within his range.
</P>
<P>
As to whether he might even approach his 200 meters world
record of 19.32 seconds again some day, Johnson replied: "I think
I can run faster than 19.32. It's not out of the question, it's
not impossible."

seize the opportunity to disarm immediately.

Kabbah said that the government was not under obligation of the

the new armed forces. But in the interest of national
reconciliation, all of the former rebels who meet the selection
criteria will be considered in the recruitment.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone armed forces disintegrated in a military coup in
May 1997, and most of its soldiers latter joined hands in fighting
the elected government with the United Revolutionary Front rebels
led by Foday Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Kabbah government has been protected by the
Nigeria-led West Africa Peace Keeping Force or ECOMOG in the
absence of a national armed forces. The Lome accord stipulates
that the West African country's armed forces will be formed, after
the conclusion of the disarmament of the former rebels.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Election Campaigns Start Prematurely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Wang Nengbiao
</P>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Environment and Natural
Resources Minister Ben Mwila has once again been criticized
recently for what called premature presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail Saturday quoted Information and Public
Chairman of the ruling Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD),
Vernon Mwaanga, as saying only MMD president Frederick Chiluba can
deal with Mwila over his persistent utterances concerning the 2001
presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
Mwaanga said he has time and again explained MMD's official
position on the campaigns and Mwila's intransigence on the issue
has now reached the stage where it could only be dealt with by
Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
Mwaanga said no one would be prevented from contesting any
position of the National executive Committee (NEC) of the MMD once
the party has, in its infinite wisdom, determined that the time
for campaigns is ripe.
</P>
<P>
Mwaanga said NEC took a decision sometime ago to the effect
that no campaigns should be conducted at this time because early
campaigns will only consume party and government energy.
</P>
<P>
MMD youths in Ndola, in the north of the country, lashed out at
Mwila for allegedly defying Chiluba's directive to stop
campaigning until an official announcement is made.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted Ndola central constituency youth
chairman Katongo Musonda as saying that Mwila is unpatriotic to
his own party and unfaithful.
</P>
<P>
On Friday Mwila said in a statement that Zambian constitution
does not bar people from campaigning for the presidency if they
consider themselves eligible to stand, or when they should start
canvassing for support.
</P>
<P>
Mwila also said that he is not aware of any party decree by NEC
banning presidential aspirants and other members seeking elective
office from campaigning.
</P>
<P>
He said Zambians should be given sufficient time to carry out a
national debate on prospective candidates for the office of
president.
</P>
<P>
Mwila, from Luapula province, also lashed out at eight
parliament members who held a press briefing early this week to
support Chiluba's choice for a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
The parliament member from Luapula province also warned that
anyone campaigning for the presidency before such activities are
officially permitted will be dealt with ruthlessly.
</P>
<P>
On Monday Chiluba warned that those flouting the MMD
constitution by engaging themselves in premature campaigns for the
presidency will be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
Mwila, one of the country's richest men with a business empire
spanning manufacturing, construction, finance and fertilizers,
helped Chiluba defeat former President Kenneth Kaunda in 1991
elections and now is seen as a leading candidate to replace his
nephew in the next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
But Chiluba said in September last year that he would ensure
that his uncle Mwila does not become the country's president.
</P>
<P>
Mwila was transferred from defence ministry to energy ministry
in the first cabinet reshuffle in December of 1997 made after the
short-lived coup on October 28 of the same year. In November 1999
Mwila was transferred from energy ministry to environment
ministry.

<HEADLINE> BMW Feels Backlash As 100 Orders Canceled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- BMW has lost up to 2.5 million
pounds of business in one week as a direct result of British
customers canceling orders in protest over the Rover sell-off.
</P>
<P>
According to a poll, six out of ten British car buyers are now
prepared to boycott BMW. It is estimated that if the boycott
lasted a year it would wipe out nearly 10 percent of the German
car giant's annual 1.5 billion pounds sales to Britain.
</P>
<P>
The Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union, which called
for a boycott and commissioned the survey by ICM, said the
findings were the first evidence of a major public backlash
against BMW.
</P>
<P>
Last year, BMW sold just short of 71,000 cars in Britain - its
third largest market after Germany and the U.S. The company, which
has 155 dealers in Britain, announced that it was selling off loss-
making Rover last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A BMW spokesman was quoted by British media Saturday as saying
"Nationally we have lost about 100 orders directly as a result of
last week's events. In these cases, people have given explicit
reasons why they are canceling their orders."
</P>
<P>
"We will be monitoring the situation closely and carrying out
our own research into customers' attitudes in the wake of events,
to see what we can do to restore confidence where it may be
lacking," he added.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Launches District Teacher Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A two-year pilot scheme to
facilitate experience exchange and establish a mutual assistance
network among teachers was launched Saturday with the aim of
enhancing the quality of teaching and learning in the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
The scheme, entitled District Teacher Network, will disseminate
40 cases of quality teaching among teachers from all secondary and
primary schools and kindergartens in the SAR.
</P>
<P>
The Steering Committee of the scheme, with members drawn from
educational organizations and representatives from the Education
Department, the Quality Education Fund and the school sector, is
responsible for the planning and promotion of the network.
</P>
<P>
It will invite tertiary institutions to conduct research on
cases of quality teaching so as to combine practical experience
with teaching theory to enhance the effectiveness of teaching.
</P>
<P>
Officiating at the launching ceremony, Director of Education
Fanny Law said that the establishment of the network is good news
for both teachers and students.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of district teacher networks would forge the
partnership among schools and enable teachers to share their
experience and work in collaboration with one another," she said.
</P>
<P>
Teachers might also draw on the successful experiences of their
fellow colleagues in designing learning models more suitable for
their students, she added.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Protests to U.N. Over U.S., British Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has strongly protested to the
U.N. over airspace violations by the U.S. and British warplanes
from March 1-7, reported the Iraqi News Agency (INA) on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Iraqi Foreign
Minister Mohammad Said Al-Sahaf said that during the seven days,
the U.S. and British warplanes carried out 274 armed sorties, 34
from Turkey and 240 from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, over the southern
and northern provinces of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sahaf stressed the armed sorties were in pursuance of the
aggressive policy enforced by the U.S. and Britain toward Iraq, and
demanded the U.N. live up to its responsibilities to maintain world
peace and security.
</P>
<P>
It has almost become a daily occurrence for the U.S. and British
planes to patrol the so-called no-fly zones in northern and
southern Iraq, set up after the Gulf War, with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds and the Shiite Muslims from possible attacks
by Iraqi government troops.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has never recognized the legality of the air exclusion
zones, which were not directly covered by any U.N. Security Council
resolution.

<HEADLINE> Manila Moves to Attract More Investments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
lowered to less than 300 million U.S. dollars, from 1 billion
dollars, the minimum investment requirement of firms applying for
a 12-year income tax holiday in a bid to attract more investments,
a senior official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Secretary Manuel Roxas said in a statement
that this is part of the amendments of executive Order No. 26 or
the Omnibus Investments Code (OIC).
</P>
<P>
Also included in the revised set of incentives are the five-
year application of the net operating loss carry-over; deferred
imposition of the minimum corporate income tax; and investment tax
allowance of up to 50 percent of taxable income.
</P>
<P>
Roxas said the revisions to the OIC are aimed at increasing
investments into the country. This is expected to be approved by
the Senate and the House of Representatives before they adjourn
their sessions on April 15.
</P>
<P>
According to Roxas, the Board of Investments approved 16.4
billion pesos (2.9 billion dollars) in investments in 1999, down
by 50 percent from the figure of the previous year while that of
the Philippine Economic Zone Authority rose by 61 percent to 155.8
billion pesos (3.9 billion dollars).

SANAA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh
left here Saturday morning for Ottawa on an official visit to
Canada, the first leg of his three-nation tour that also includes
the U.S and Italy.

<P>
Speaking to reporters before departure, Saleh affirmed that the
visits are aimed at discussing ways of developing bilateral
relations, strengthening cooperation and promoting partnership.

and hoped this visit will help attract more investments from those
countries.
</P>
<P>
Saleh said his talks with the leaders of these countries will

including the peace process in the Middle East and ways of pushing
it to achieve its objectives in bringing about a just and
comprehensive peace in the whole region.
</P>

He said that a permanent peace depends on restoring the
legitimate Arab rights and putting an end to the Israeli occupation
of the Arab territories in Palestine, the Syrian Golan Heights and
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said he will also discuss such issues as the Red Sea security
and developments in the African Horn, particularly the serious
situation in Somalia and the ongoing conflict between Eritrea and

KUALA LUMPUR, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Indonesia
Saturday agreed to widen the scope of their extradition agreement
to allow for frequent exchange of prisoners to enable them to
serve sentence in their own country.
</P>
<P>
Minister in the Prime Minister's Department Rais Yatim said
that officials of both countries would review the agreement signed
in 1976 to pave way for frequent exchange of prisoners, especially
on humanitarian grounds.
</P>

This would, among other things, enable the prisoners to be
visited by their relatives, he told a news conference after
receiving a call from Indonesian Justice and Law Minister Yusril
Ihza Mahendra at the Prime Minister's Department here.
</P>
<P>
He said their meeting also discussed efforts by both countries

<P>
Yusril was accompanied by four officials including Justice and
Law Director-General Romli Atmasasmita and Charge d'affaires
Warmas Hasan Saputra.

<HEADLINE> Obasanjo Charges Confederation Protagonists Treasonable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo has charged protagonists of confederation to resign as
their public position runs counter to their legitimate obligation
to uphold the Nigerian constitution, reported the local newspaper
The Post Express Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on national television Friday night, Obasanjo said
certain persons who had sworn to an oath to uphold the
constitution were those championing the cause of confederation.
"Such persons can resign," said the president, adding their
actions were treasonable.
</P>
<P>
The call for confederation gained strength in Nigeria in the
past few weeks following the religious crisis in several states of
the country, claiming hundreds of lives.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, governors of the south eastern states and some other
public servants turned up to voice their displeasure over the
killings, prompting them to opt for confederation as a way of
giving the various ethnic and geo- political zones their right to
self determination.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo dismissed such campaign for confederation and pledged
to abide by the oath to defend and uphold the federal
constitution.
</P>
<P>
He also dismissed the call for the convocation of a sovereign
national conference by some organizations and ethnic groups,
describing the champions as unrealistic and bordering the cause of
treason.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Osun State Thursday, Obasanjo stressed that
no political arrangement could be better than the present system
and that no region or part of the country could stand alone.

<HEADLINE> African Continent Urged Not to Bypass Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 25 (Xinhua) -- African countries need to
develop effective human resources and technological capacities to
meet the challenges facing the continent in an increasingly
competitive world, a senior regional official has said.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Secretary of the East African Co-operation (EAC)
Francis Muthaura said over the weekend that it was unfortunate
that the major agricultural and industrial revolutions that took
place in the world over the past one hundred years largely
bypassed Africa.
</P>
<P>
Muthaura, quoted by the local newspaper Daily News on Saturday,
said that the new technological revolutions embracing information
technology and biotechnology once again bypassed the continent.
</P>
<P>
"The continent is also featuring in a disadvantaged position in
the globalized economic and financial systems," he said when
opening a human resources training course at the Eastern and
Southern African Management Institute (ESAMI) in Tanzania's
northern town of Arusha.
</P>
<P>
Over 36 participants, mostly senior human resources development
planners from the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
and EAC member states and the West African region, attended the
two-week course sponsored by the Commonwealth Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
"Whether our continent will remain on the periphery or will
swim with the tide of modern technological revolution depend on
the capacities which we develop in technological and scientific
fields," he added.
</P>
<P>
Muthaura urged African countries to rethink their strategies
and put the right emphasis on the knowledge industry including
making adequate budgetary provisions for training activities.
</P>
<P>
He told the participants that as human resource development
planners, they had an important role in defining the objectives in
education and training, allocating the training opportunities to
the right people at the right time, and designing ways and means
for accessing and mobilizing educational and training resources.
</P>
<P>
The opening was also attended by the ESAMI Director General,
Dr. Bonard Mwape, and other officials.

WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (
INS) Friday rejected a proposal from Elian Gonzalez's relatives in
Florida that an arbitrator decide whether the Cuban boy should
stay in the U.S. or return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
An Associated Press report quoted attorneys for the boy's
Florida relatives as proposing that an arbitration process on the
boy's status begin on April 3 and be completed within two weeks.
The proposal came after the INS Thursday told the relatives of the
Cuban boy that they should agree to a speedy timetable for their
appeal of a federal court decision against them or the agency
would immediately move to revoke Elian's status in this country. (

<HEADLINE> Demirel Asserts Turkey's Global Role In New Era </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
has declared that Turkey is determined to become a global player in
the international arena in the future.
</P>
<P>
Demirel made the ambitious assertion Friday when he was
addressing the Foreign Policy Institute's 25th Anniversary
Conference "2000 and Beyond: Visions of Turkish Foreign Policy" in
Ankara.
</P>
<P>
"It is this country that has the strongest economy in a vast
region extending from the Balkans to the Caucasus, the eastern
Mediterranean and Central Asia," he said in his keynote speech.
</P>
<P>
"In all senses of the world, Turkey is now more tightly
interwined with the world than it has ever been," he said. "Today,
Turkey is among the top emerging markets and the 16th largest
economy in the world."
</P>
<P>
Demirel said the European Union accepted Turkey as a candidate
for membership in its last December's summit in Helsinki and Turkey
is certain to become a full member of the EU in the shortest
possible time.
</P>
<P>
In his year-end report "Turkey Towards 2000" released on
December 25, 1999, the president sounded a similar optimistic tone
about the country's future, proclaiming that "Turkey will face a
bright future and assume a place as one of the ten major developed
countries of the world (in the new century)."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Embarks on Visit to Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
arrived here Saturday afternoon to embark on his brief visit to
Pakistan at the end of his six-day South Asian tour.
</P>
<P>
This is the first visit by Clinton to Pakistan, during which he
will hold talks with Pakistan's Chief Executive General Pervez
Musharraf on a host of issues, including the thorny Kashmir
dispute between Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
Islamabad has been urging the U.S. president to play a crucial
role in promoting the final solution of the long-standing dispute
over which it fought two of its three wars with New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
However, Clinton has failed to persuade India to resume
dialogue with Pakistan on the Kashmir issue during his just-ended
five-day visit to India.
</P>
<P>
Combating terrorism will also be high on the agenda of Clinton'
s talks with Musharraf. The U.S. president is expected to ask
Islamabad to exert influence on Afghanistan's ruling Taliban
militia over the issue of the alleged terrorist Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
However, Islamabad has repeatedly said that it cannot help on
the issue because Afghanistan is an independent country.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it is widely believed that General Musharraf would
defend his government against India's accusation of Islamabad's
alleged involvement in terrorist activities in the India-
controlled part of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The killing of 35 Sikhs in India-controlled Kashmir, just hours
prior to Clinton's arrival in New Delhi, has aroused a fresh wave
of Indian attacks on Pakistan and Clinton has expressed his deep
concern over the incident.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear issue will also be one of the focuses of Clinton's
discussion here. He is expected to try to convince Pakistan to
sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty although he has just been
frustrated in this regard in India.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Clinton will urge General Musharraf to return the
power to an elected government, according to messages disclosed by
White House recently.
</P>
<P>
General Musharraf, who is also the army chief of Pakistan,
resumed the post of Chief Executive in a bloodless coup in October
last year which led to the collapse of the former civilian
government led by Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
While Washington has since been pressuring Islamabad to "return
to democracy," General Musharraf once again refused to give a
timetable for a general election on Wednesday when he announced
the plan of local elections.
</P>
<P>
Due to the existence of the military government in the country,
President Clinton had long hesitated on whether to include
Pakistan into his South Asian tour before he finally decided to do
so on March 8.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement of White House, the decision was made
in the consideration of the "traditional friendship" with Pakistan,
which was the most important ally of the United States in the sub-
continent during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, President Clinton will also meet
his Pakistani counterpart Rafiq Tarar and address the nation
through radio and television before his departure later in the
afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Petroleum Group to Provide Oil To Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Independent Petroleum Group
(IPG) of Kuwait and the National Oil Company of Zimbabwe (Noczim)
signed a long-term deal on Friday in Harare to provide fuel
supplies to Zimbabwe to ease the months long oil shortage in the
southern African country.
</P>
<P>
The agreement comes about two weeks after Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe's visit to Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Noczim board member Bobby Kambarami
and IPG Finance Manager R. Kesavan following a directive to
Noczim from President Mugabe on Thursday to have the negotiations
concluded urgently.
</P>
<P>
The long-term deal, whose total value is still being worked
out, includes upgrading of the pipeline to increase its capacity
from the current 1.2 million tons a year, consultant work to see
how Noczim can be reformed and revamped and restoration of the
national strategic reserves.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe consumes 1.8 million tons every year and the balance
of about 600,000 tons has to be brought in by road and rail.
</P>
<P>
Kesavan said with the upgrading of the pipeline and storage
facilities, IPG will be able to increase the capacity to meet the
daily consumption.
</P>
<P>
Kambarami said the signing of the agreement would resolve the
fuel crisis, but people should not expect the situation to
nomalize in a week.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Police Kill 8 Carjackers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Eight armed gangsters who
hijacked a van were shot dead Friday by the Flying Squad in the
Kenyan capital Nairobi, local newspapers reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The carjackers were killed when police returned fire as they
leapt from the stolen Nissan van, firing their guns in a
desperate bid to escape.
</P>
<P>
The gun battle lasted for about 35 minutes as the Flying Squad
chased the van in the city, before blocking its route and
sandwiching it between two squad cars.
</P>
<P>
This is the single largest number of the thugs to be killed by
police in the Kenyan capital. During the incident, over 100
bullets were used and police recovered two revolvers, a pistol
and seven rounds of ammunition, the papers said.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard newspapers reported that on February
28 this year, two plainclothes police on patrol in Nairobi were
gunned down by thugs and their guns stolen.
</P>
<P>
Illegal firearms are running rampant in Kenya as more refugees
from the neighboring conflict-stricken countries crossed the
borders into the country and smuggled the firearms into the
capital.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that there were at least 5,000 guns in the
hands of illegal holders in the capital Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi announced amnesty on March 17
 for those in possession of illegal firearms if they surrender
them to the authorities within a month.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Opens Its Railway to Private Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Zambian government has approved a
recommendation to allow private investment in Zambia Railways
while maintaining government control over the transport firm,
Times of Zambia reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper quoted a statement issued here Friday by
Commerce, Trade and Industrial Minister William Harrington as
saying that the move is aimed at attracting private capital and
management expertise without handing over ownership of the
nationally strategic infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
He said that Zambia Private Agency (ZPA) has been directed to
proceed with the recommended concessioning program which include
the establishment of a government-owned asset holding company.
</P>
<P>
ZPA has also been asked to ensure the orderly winding up of the
existing Zambia Railways and disposing of its other assets and
liabilities, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has chosen the concessioning of the
railway as the best option for the sustainable reorganization of
the firm because of the advantages inherent in the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
The government is determined to ensure that the railway is
brought back to a state where if could contribute positively to
the country's socio- economic development, the minister said in
the statement.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has a total of 2,100 kilometers railway with transport
volume accounting for two-thirds of the country's total transport.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Fails to Persuade India on Nuclear Issue, Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 25 (Xinhua) -- A "Vision Statement", multi-
billion-dollar business deals, pacts on political, economic,
commercial and environmental cooperation and dialogue, U.S.
President Bill Clinton did have a lot to take home when he winded
up his five-day India visit to India Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But all these were overshadowed by his failure in persuading
New Delhi to change stand on non-proliferation and Kashmir, the
two issues the world had been closely watching what Clinton could
do about during the visit, the first by a U.S. president in 22
years.
</P>
<P>
Since India and Pakistan conducted nuclear tests in 1998, the
United States has viewed the two countries' nuclear projects as a
major adverse force to the non-proliferation process, saying a
nuclear arms race in the subcontinent would ultimately turn the
region into a new nuclear flashpoint.
</P>
<P>
During last year's Indo-Pakistani conflict at Kargil, Kashmir,
the United States, foreseeing the danger of a major military
conflict like the 1971 war between the two South Asian nuclear
neighbors, said that "the United States does have an interest" in
trying to avert a larger conflict and reduce the tensions in the
subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
Just before his departure for his South Asia tour, Clinton said
the Line of Control in Kashmir has become the "most dangerous"
place in the world, a remark many believed was made to pave the
way for raising issues like non-proliferation and Kashmir with
Indian leaders during their talks.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president did make some adorable attempts in this
regard, especially during his two-day stay in the Indian capital
of New Delhi. But the Indians, well prepared for U.S pressure on
the nuclear and Kashmir issues, just refused to budge, arguing
that it must maintain a "minimum credible nuclear deterrent" for
its own security and that the CTBT can not be signed without a
national consensus.
</P>
<P>
On the Kashmir dispute, India says it will never accept any
third party advice, mediation or facilitation. Indian Prime
Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee vowed that India would never yield
to any pressure.
</P>
<P>
The situation caught Clinton in a dilemma: Keeping on pressing
New Delhi on the highly sensitive issues will undermine
Washington's efforts in building a "dynamic and lasting
partnership" with India, which is in the long-term strategic
interest of the United States and also means the opening of
India's huge growing market and more jobs and business
opportunities for the Americans, while any retreat from its
current stand will disappoint other countries and make the U.S.
government lose face.
</P>
<P>
As a result, in their joint statement "India-U.S. Relations: A
Vision for the 21st Century", both sides decided to keep their
differences and say what each side wants to say on the nuclear
issue.
</P>
<P>
"India and the United States share a commitment to reducing and
ultimately eliminating nuclear weapons, but we have not always
agreed on how to reach this common goal. The United States
believes India should forgo nuclear weapons. India believes that
it needs to maintain a credible minimum nuclear deterrent in
keeping with its own assessment of its security needs," says the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also indicated he had got no promise from the Indians
to sign the "contentious" CTBT.
</P>
<P>
Following the signing of the Vision Statement, there were
speculations that Clinton is now "most conciliatory" on India's
nuclear ambitions and that the U.S. is "beginning to accept" a
nuclear India, which were denied by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here observed that during the Clinton visit the
Americans made no bigger concessions on the Kashmir issue mainly
due to a clear and strong objection to any U.S. involvement in
Kashmir by India.
</P>
<P>
The Vision Statement said: "We acknowledge that tensions in
South Asia can only be resolved by the nations of South Asia."
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Indian Parliament, Clinton had to note that he
had "certainly not come to South Asia to mediate the dispute over
Kashmir" for any mediation requires acceptance by both parties
involved.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here pointed out that the issues of non-proliferation
and Kashmir, if not resolved in a timely manner, would turn out to
be major thorns in the smooth development of Indo-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
There were already signs: while the Americans failed to make
progress on the nuclear and Kashmir issues, the Indians also found
they might have to wait longer than expected for the sanctions
imposed against their country following the 1998 nuclear tests to
be fully lifted.
</P>
<P>
Asked to what extent the non-proliferation issue would affect
the Indo-U.S. relations, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said bluntly: "Obviously, it's difficult for the
relationship in the long run if we are not able to resolve it."

<HEADLINE> Russian Voters Ponder Choices Ahead of Sunday Balloting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian voters are given a quiet
Saturday to ponder who they will choose as the country's new
president when they go to the polls on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
All campaigning stopped at midnight Friday, the deadline set
under the electoral law.
</P>
<P>
Polling stations will open their doors at 8 a.m. local time
across the country's 11 time zones, but some predict voter
confusion as the Russians will set their clocks one hour forward
at 2 a.m. (2300 GMT Saturday) at the start of the daylight saving
time.
</P>
<P>
Many predicted that acting President Vladimir Putin, the
runaway favorite, would beat the other 10 candidates and win the
race. The only suspense is whether he would win in the first or
second round, or whether turnout will be high enough to make
Sunday's vote valid.
</P>
<P>
The election has been presented as a foregone conclusion in the
media, prompting fears that many voters would stay away from the
polling stations. In view of this fear and a Nyet campaign urging
voters to turn down all the candidates, the Central Election
Commission and Putin have urged the electorate to show up and
exercise their constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
"On the eve of this very important event in the history of the
state I feel obliged to ask you, my fellow countrymen, to fulfill
your constitutional duty, to go to the polls Sunday and name the
president of a new Russia," Putin said Friday in an address
televised to the nation.
</P>
<P>
Putin's approval rating were put at 50-60 percent in recent
opinion polls, leaving the other 10 candidates far behind. The two
other major candidates - both veterans of the 1996 campaign - are
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov and Grigory Yavlinsky, the
leader of the liberal Yabloko party.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov and Yavlinsky have both expressed confidence that they
would prevent Putin from an outright victory in the first round
and confront him in the run-off. A second round will be held
between the top two candidates on April 16 if none of the 11
presidential hopefuls get more than 50 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
Putin, who was appointed prime minister last August and
automatically became the acting head of state on New Year's Eve
following former President Boris Yeltsin's surprise resignation,
is by far the most popular politician in post-Soviet Russia.
</P>
<P>
He has appealed to Russians looking for stability and a tough
can-do leader after years of upheaval following the collapse of
the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
As the acting incumbent, Putin has enjoyed blanket media
coverage of his activities, affording him the luxury to turn down
free advertisement time in the airwaves and stay away from debates
challenged by his rivals.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov on Thursday complained of the lack of a truly state
television and promised to set up one if he is elected president.
</P>
<P>
The Central Election Commission predicted a turnout of over 60
percent in Sunday's vote, although there has been some concern
that turnout will be low because of voter apathy and because some
may see no need to vote believing the outcome is already clear.
</P>
<P>
If the election is invalidated then another is held four months
after the first round or three months after the voting is declared
invalid - which would be July or later.
</P>
<P>
The election also would be invalidated if there are more votes
"against all" candidates than for the front-runner.
</P>
<P>
Polling stations will be open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. local time,
meaning that voting in the furthest regions of the Far East,
Kamchatka and Chukotka will begin Saturday at 11 p.m. Moscow time
(2000 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Russians overseas will also cast their votes Sunday at 380
polling stations set up at the country's embassies and consulates
abroad.
</P>
<P>
In some areas of Russia, like remote villages, far-off polar
stations and war-torn Chechnya, voting began earlier, starting
from March 15.
</P>
<P>
The first preliminary results are expected to be released by
the Central Election Commission at 9 p.m. Moscow daylight time (
1700 GMT) Sunday -- as ballot boxes in the most western
Kaliningrad region close and one hour after Moscow polling
stations shut up shop.
</P>
<P>
By 3 a.m. (2300 GMT Sunday) Monday the commission expects to
release 50 percent of the voting results from across the country's
11 time zones. A full picture should be available by 10 a.m. (0600
GMT) Monday when the commission expects to have 90 percent of the
votes tallied.
</P>
<P>
The Central Election Commission plans to publish official
results April 6.

<HEADLINE> Feeder Planes -- New Bright Spot in China's Aviation Industry (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Feeder planes are expected to
become a new bright spot in the aviation industry of China,
predicted the latest issue of the country's news weekly "Outlook".
</P>
<P>
A new model of feeder passenger plane has made its debut in
this Chinese capital. The "Xinzhou 60" has reached the current
level of the world's advanced feeder passenger planes in terms of
safety, cost, comfort and flight performance, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Capable of seating 56 passengers, the "Xinzhou 60" can fly as
high as 6,000 meters and for a distance of 1,600 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The magazine noted that in the past two decades the development
of the world aviation industry has witnessed the flourishing
growth of feeder planes, which also promise to be the fastest
growing aspect of the industry in the next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the US aviation authorities have predicted that
by 2010, feeder planes in that country will double in number, with
124 million passengers handled by feeder planes at a yearly growth
rate of 16 percent, while the number of those handled by jumbo
jets will increase at a rate of only three percent.
</P>
<P>
With a similar size of territory to the United States, China
boasts a population five times bigger, but it only has about 500
civilian airports, a small fraction of the number in the US.
</P>
<P>
"We should never underestimate the great potential for civil
aviation of our country," the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the country's strategy of developing the vast
western areas provides golden opportunities for feeder line
aviation in China, it said.

<P>
"Further developing feeder planes is significant not only for
the strategy of western development, but also for the
revitalization of our country's civil aviation industry," the
magazine said in a signed article.
</P>
<P>
The magazine noted that Brazil's experience of aviation
development is worthy of notice by China.
</P>
<P>
In light of China's special conditions, efforts must be made,
first of all, to redesign the current models of domestically-made
planes and put them into service in the western regions as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
The magazine stressed that the development of feeder planes
calls for advances not only in the area of technology, but also in
markets.
</P>
<P>
In the development of feeder planes, it is important to
cooperate with foreign partners, and introduce their advanced
technologies and equipment, in order to form a relatively big
feeder plane industry for the country, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
Aviation is a capital- and technology-intensive industry, which
calls for strong support from the government. This has been proved
in both the United States, Western Europe and Brazil, it noted.
</P>
<P>
Finally, only large enterprise groups can hope to succeed in
the fierce competition in the world's feeder plane industry.
Therefore, it is particularly important to pool all the industry's
resources and channel them into a few plane manufacturers with
both technological and management advantages, the magazine said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Clinton Visit Opens New Chapter in Indo-U.S. Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Clinton, who flew to New Delhi on the evening of March 19 and
formally started his India visit on March 21, was the first U.S.
president to visit India in the past 22 years.
</P>
<P>
After two hours of summit talks on Tuesday morning, Clinton and
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee signed a joint
statement titled "India-U.S. Relations: A Vision for the 21st
Century," which said that the two leaders "resolve to create a
closer and qualitatively new relationship" between the two
countries in the new century.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that in the new century, India and the
United States would be partners in peace, with a common interest
in and complementary responsibility for ensuring regional and
international security.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Vajpayee also agreed that a regular, wide-ranging
dialogue is important for achieving the goal of establishing
closer and multifaceted relations between India and the United
States and for the two countries to work jointly for promotion of
peace and prosperity in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
They agreed on a number of steps to intensify and
institutionalize the dialogue between India and the United States,
which include regular bilateral summits between the prime minister
of India and the U.S. president, an Annual Foreign Policy Dialogue
between foreign ministers of both countries, the continuance of
the ongoing Dialogue on Security and Non-proliferation, Foreign
Office Consultations and regular meetings of the existing Joint
Working Group on Counter-terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also decided to institutionalize their bilateral
economic dialogue by setting up a Coordinating Group and an Indo-U.
S. Working Group on Trade, initiating Indo-U.S. Commercial
Dialogue and an Indo-U.S. Financial and Economic Forum. They also
agreed to set up a Joint Consultative Group on Clean Energy and
Environment and an Indo-U.S. Science and Technology Forum.
</P>
<P>
However, the two leaders also acknowledged that major
differences exist between the two countries on some issues,
especially the nuclear non-proliferation issue. Meanwhile, some
political parties and some organizations staged protests in New
Delhi and other parts of the country against the visit.
</P>
<P>
"India and the United States share a commitment to reducing and
ultimately eliminating nuclear weapons, but we have not always
agreed on how to reach this common goal," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"The United States believes India should forgo nuclear weapons.
India believes that it needs to maintain a credible minimum
nuclear deterrent in keeping with its own assessment of its
security needs," the document added.
</P>
<P>
The statement didn't refer to the Kashmir issue directly, only
saying: "We acknowledge that tensions in South Asia can only be
resolved by the nations of South Asia."
</P>
<P>
During the two leaders' meeting with the press after the
signing of the statement, however, Clinton said that he would
convey the same message to India and Pakistan on the issue of
Kashmir: respect the line of control, show restraint, stand
against violence and restore the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
India had insisted Pakistan first abandon its support of "cross-
border terrorism" and anti-India propaganda before any dialogue
can be resumed between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning, Clinton delivered a 35-minute speech to a
joint session of both houses of the Indian Parliament, in which he
described India and the United States as "natural allies" in the
post-Cold War era and claimed that the U.S. wants India to be
strong, secure, united and be a force for a safer, more prosperous
and more democratic world.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made another attempt to persuade India to give up its
nuclear project, asking the latter to draw lesson from America's
Cold War experience, when its nuclear arms race with the former
Soviet Union caused a huge waste of money and resources and
hindered its economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he had not come to south Asia to mediate the
dispute over Kashmir, but once again urged New Delhi to take the
initiative to restore peace talks with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He also hinted that the U.S. remains willing and ready to play
a sort of role in the resolution of the Kashmir issue, just as it
did in the Indo-Pakistani Kargil conflict last year.
</P>
<P>
During Clinton's visit, India and the U.S. signed a series of
pacts concerning sci-tech collaboration and exchange and
environmental protection. According to these pacts, an Indo-U.S.
Science and Technology Forum will be established to facilitate and
promote interaction of government, academia and industry in
science, technology and other related areas, while the U.S.
government will provide 45 million U.S. dollars for clean energy
and water projects in India as part of a 250-million-dollar
environmental assistance package for south Asia.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also announced on Friday that his administration would
give 5 million dollars to India for research on AIDS, tuberculosis
and other infectious diseases and offer another 5 million dollars
to Internet spread in rural India.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, India and U.S. firms signed in New Delhi
agreements worth 2 billion dollars on various sectors including
information technology, power and environment.
</P>
<P>
"India is a growing market and U.S. firms are very eager to
enter into agreements and do business with Indian companies," said
U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley at the signing ceremony. "We
are also willing to provide our experience and expertise to the
Indian companies."
</P>
<P>
With some more agreements signed in Mumbai on Friday, the
United States agreed to provide a one-billion-dollar credit to
Exim Bank of India and the Small Industrial Development Bank of
India for lending to small and medium industries in the country
for their development, while U.S. and Indian companies reached 12
deals involving a total U.S. investment of 2 billion dollars in
India, mainly in the areas of information technology,
biotechnology, pharmaceutics, power and environment.
</P>
<P>
The Indians also raised the issue of lifting sanctions imposed
against the country after the 1998 nuclear tests, and the
Americans responded that while some steps have already been taken,
some others would be taken in the future. But no clear timetable
was given on this issue.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here said that the U.S. president's visit to
India, generally speaking, was a quite successful one, which ended
decades of estrangement in the Indo-U.S. relations. And they
believed that the Indian side felt quite satisfied at the outcome
of the visit.
</P>
<P>
However, they warned, differences between the two countries on
certain issues, if not addressed in a timely and appropriate
manner, would inevitably harm the smooth development of the newly-
forged partnership.

</P>
<P>
During his visit, Clinton held talks with Indian leaders

S. dollars including two promised credit lines of one billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Other agreements are mainly in the areas of information
technology, environment and power biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
However, the two sides did not reached any agreement on key
issues such as India's signing of the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty (CTBT), resumption of the stalled dialogue  between New
Delhi and Islamabad and tariff reduction by India to allow a wider
flow of U.S. products.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Help Thailand Train Trade Personnel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Canada will help Thailand to
train personnel in both public and private sectors to enhance
their trade negotiation skills, Thai Deputy Prime Minister
Supaichai Panitchpakdi said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Supachai, who is also commerce minister, was quoted by Thailand
News Agency as saying that the project will be the first of a
series of agreed cooperation between the two countries, aimed to
equip Thai personnel, particularly those in government agencies,
with professional and discussions in the future.
</P>
<P>
Prompted by the lessons learned from the failure of the Seattle
meeting of the World Trade Organization late last year, Canada and
Thailand agreed that decision making processes at multilateral
trade talks should be made more efficient and transparent to serve
interests of both developed and developing countries alike, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian-Thai cooperation project was, thus, aimed to
promote the consolidation among developing countries and enhance
their bargaining power at world trade stages, Supachai said.
</P>
<P>
The developing countries should be particularly consolidated on
the issues of tariff cuts for agricultural products, elimination
of subsidies for local exporters and farmers and increase of
import quota,noted Supachai.

<HEADLINE> Russian Voters Ponder Choices Ahead of Sunday Balloting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian voters are given a quiet
Saturday to ponder who they will choose as the country's new
president when they go to the polls on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
All campaigning stopped at midnight Thursday, the deadline set
under the electoral law.
</P>
<P>
Polling stations will open their doors at 8 a.m. local time
across the country's 11 time zones, but some predict voter
confusion as the Russians will set their clocks one hour forward
at 2 a.m. (2300 GMT Saturday) at the start of the daylight saving
time.
</P>
<P>
Many predicted that acting President Vladimir Putin, the
runaway favorite, would beat the other 10 candidates and win the
race. The only suspense is whether he would win in the first or
second round, or whether turnout will be high enough to make
Sunday's vote valid.
</P>
<P>
The election has been presented as a foregone conclusion in the
media, prompting fears that many voters would stay away from the
polling stations. In view of this fear and a Nyet campaign urging
voters to turn down all the candidates, the Central Election
Commission and Putin have urged the electorate to show up and
exercise their constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
"On the eve of this very important event in the history of the
state I feel obliged to ask you, my fellow countrymen, to fulfill
your constitutional duty, to go to the polls Sunday and name the
president of a new Russia," Putin said Friday in an address
televised to the nation.
</P>
<P>
Putin's approval rating were put at 50-60 percent in recent
opinion polls, leaving the other 10 candidates far behind. The two
other major candidates - both veterans of the 1996 campaign - are
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov and Grigory Yavlinsky, the
leader of the liberal Yabloko party.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov and Yavlinsky have both expressed confidence that they
would prevent Putin from an outright victory in the first round
and confront him in the run-off. A second round will be held
between the top two candidates on April 16 if none of the 11
presidential hopefuls get more than 50 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
Putin, who was appointed prime minister last August and
automatically became the acting head of state on New Year's Eve
following former President Boris Yeltsin's surprise resignation,
is by far the most popular politician in post-Soviet Russia.
</P>
<P>
He has appealed to Russians looking for stability and a tough
can-do leader after years of upheaval following the collapse of
the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
As the acting incumbent, Putin has enjoyed blanket media
coverage of his activities, affording him the luxury to turn down
free advertisement time in the airwaves and stay away from debates
challenged by his rivals.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov on Thursday complained of the lack of a truly state
television and promised to set up one if he is elected president.
</P>
<P>
The Central Election Commission predicted a turnout of over 60
percent in Sunday's vote, although there has been some concern
that turnout will be low because of voter apathy and because some
may see no need to vote believing the outcome is already clear.
</P>
<P>
If the election is invalidated then another is held four months
after the first round or three months after the voting is declared
invalid - which would be July or later.
</P>
<P>
The election also would be invalidated if there are more votes
"against all" candidates than for the front-runner.
</P>
<P>
Polling stations will be open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. local time,
meaning that voting in the furthest regions of the Far East,
Kamchatka and Chukotka will begin Saturday at 11 p.m. Moscow time
(2000 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Russians overseas will also cast their votes Sunday at 380
polling stations set up at the country's embassies and consulates
abroad.
</P>
<P>
In some areas of Russia, like remote villages, far-off polar
stations and war-torn Chechnya, voting began earlier, starting
from March 15.
</P>
<P>
The first preliminary results are expected to be released by
the Central Election Commission at 9 p.m. Moscow daylight time (
1700 GMT) Sunday -- as ballot boxes in the most western
Kaliningrad region close and one hour after Moscow polling
stations shut up shop.
</P>
<P>
By 3 a.m. (2300 GMT Sunday) Monday the commission expects to
release 50 percent of the voting results from across the country's
11 time zones. A full picture should be available by 10 a.m. (0600
GMT) Monday when the commission expects to have 90 percent of the
votes tallied.
</P>
<P>
The Central Election Commission plans to publish official
results April 6.

<HEADLINE> Globe Environment Conference Ends in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VANCOUVER, Canada, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The three-day Globe
2000 Conference and Trade Fair ended here Friday with the host
country Canada confirming its role in promoting key decisions on
environment protection.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Minister of Environment David Anderson told the last
day of the conference that the biennial event can be a contributor
to the watershed meeting on climate change to be held in the Hague,
Holand, this fall.
</P>
<P>
"We are here today to discuss our international response to
global climate change," Anderson said, hoping the discussions will
help bring into action the Kyoto Protocol adopted in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Several key decisions on how the protocol will work are
expected to be made at the Hague's United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
"Once the Kyoto Protocol enters into force, industrialized
countries will be on a course to reduce overall emissions by five
percent from 1990 levels by 2012," the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua, Chinese Minister of State Environmental Protection
Administration, who attended the conference, said that China has
invested one percent of GDP in green projects, bringing into
control of the once worsening trend of pollution.
</P>
<P>
China is aiming at a higher level of improvements of
environment by 2010 and wishes foreign investors to seize the
opportunity to share an emerging vast green market in China, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Globe 2000 Conference and Trade Fair opened Wednesday under the
sponsorship of the Canadian government's Climate Change Action
Fund.

<HEADLINE> GDP to Grow 5.47 Percent in Bangladesh in 1999-2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's Gross Domestic
Products (GDP) growth rate is estimated at 5.47 percent for the
current fiscal year (1999-2000) with the introduction of new
Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) series, The Financial
Express reported here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the current fiscal, four more sectors are included in the
system of national accounting to estimate the country's GDP for
the first time, but the move pulls down the projected annual
growth rate by a considerable size.
</P>
<P>
The government earlier estimated the GDP growth rate for the
current fiscal at 6.03 percent, based on the old 1984-1985 BBS
series. Growth rates previously calculated for the 1997-1998 and
1998-1999 fiscal years on the basis of the old BBS series also
came down with the introduction of the new accounting system.
</P>
<P>
The government's aid memorandum, prepared earlier this week to
be presented at the next month's Paris meeting, argued that the
new series has been adopted to remove confusion and difference in
statistical data used by the government and the donors.
</P>
<P>
According to the new BBS series, fishing, education, hotel and
restaurant, and health and social services came as new sectors to
be included in the national accounting system, raising the number
of sectors to 15 from the earlier 11.
</P>
<P>
Since this fiscal year, the BBS has divided the original
economic sectors into three broad categories: namely agriculture,
industry and service.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Put More Efforts in Fighting TB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar will put more efforts in
the fight against tuberculosis (TB), hoping to achieve more
success rate in the near future.
</P>
<P>
"If we put more efforts, we will achieve 70 percent case
detection rate and 85 percent cure rate very soon," said Myanmar
Minister of Health Major-General Ket Sein at a ceremony here
Friday marking the World TB Day, 2000, the official New Light of
Myanmar newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Recommended by the World Health Organization, Myanmar has been
implementing the Directly Observed Treatment Short Course (DOTS)
strategy in 223 townships which cover 80 percent of the total
population, achieving case detection rate of 44 percent and cure
rate of 74 percent and success rate of 82 percent.
</P>
<P>
The minister attributed the success to the participation of non-
governmental organizations such as Myanmar Maternal and Child
Welfare Association, Myanmar Red Cross Society and Myanmar Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
He invites new partners to join in the fight since Myanmar has
a plan to cover the DOTS strategy for the whole country by the
year 2003.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that there are 100,000 people estimated to be
developing TB annually in Myanmar, half of them are infectious and
pulmonary cases.
</P>
<P>
TB is still seen as one of the major public health problems in
Myanmar and it constitutes the second priority disease in the
country's national health plan.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that HIV infection among TB cases in the
country is 4.5 percent and 60 to 80 percent of AIDS cases are
suffering from TB, becoming one of the challenges for TB control
program in the future.
</P>
<P>
Population coverage for DOTS is 16 percent globally, 27 percent
in Southeast Asia region and 80 percent in Myanmar, according to
the minister.

<HEADLINE> U.S. INS Rejects Arbitration on Cuban Boy's Status </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS) Friday rejected a proposal from Elian
Gonzalez's relatives in Florida that an arbitrator decide whether
the Cuban boy should stay in the U.S. or return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
An Associated Press report quoted attorneys for the boy's
Florida relatives as proposing that an arbitration process on the
boy's status begin on April 3 and be completed within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The proposal came after the INS Thursday told the relatives of
the Cuban boy that they should agree to a speedy timetable for
their appeal of a federal court decision against them or the
agency would immediately move to revoke Elian's status in this
country.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, U.S. District Judge K. Michael Moore ruled
that only the U.S. attorney general can grant political asylum to
the boy.
</P>
<P>
Kendall Coffey, an attorney for the boy's relatives, said the
boy's relatives had offered to abide by an arbitrator's decision,
suggesting former Senator Bob Dole or Senator George Mitchell for
the position, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
However, the idea was rejected by the INS. The report quoted
INS Commissioner Doris Meissner as saying that an arbitration
process is "not an option that we are prepared to entertain."
</P>
<P>
"Our goal here is to reunite Elian with his father and to do
that as quickly, as promptly and as orderly as possible," Meissner
said.
</P>
<P>
Elian, who is currently under the custody of his great uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez, in Florida, was rescued on November 25 last year
from a shipwreck after his mother and 11 others died when the boat
capsized in the sea off Florida.
</P>
<P>
The INS ruled earlier this year that the boy belongs to his
father and should be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
However, the decision to return him was delayed after the boy's
great uncle Florida filed a political asylum for him.
</P>
<P>
The boy's father, in Cuba, supported by the Cuban government,
insisted that his son should be returned to him while the boy's
great uncle, backed by some anti-Cuba politicians in the U.S.,
asked the boy to stay with him.

OTTAWA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Canada announced Friday that it
will spend 2 million Canadian dollars (1.36 million U.S. dollars)
in helping the reform process in Croatia.
</P>
<P>
Croatia's new political leaders have moved toward greater
democracy since taking office earlier this year, says a statement
released Friday by Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd
Axworthy and Minister for International Co-operation Maria Minna.

"We are very encouraged by the reform orientation of Croatia's
new government, and its willingness to work with the international
community to resolve long-standing issues related to recent
conflicts in Croatia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina," said Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
"Canada will support Croatia's reforms, leading to its deeper
integration into international organizations, which will become
possible as economic and democratic reforms are implemented,"
added Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
Canadian government officials will visit the former Yugoslav
republic in early May to advance Canada's efforts in the
rebuilding process.
</P>
<P>
Croatia separated from federal Yugoslavia in 1991 and was
embroiled in a civil war that erupted soon after.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Backs Greater Naval Stronghold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid said that he supported the Indonesian Military's (TNI) plan
to increase the number of naval bases throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
In his address to about 1,400 participants of the congress of
Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) Sons and Daughters in Makassar, capital of
South Sulawesi, on Friday, the president said a stronger navy
would ensure better protection for the country's territorial
integrity.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Indonesia, at all costs, including the
enlargement of its naval capacity, would maintain its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
However, due to financial constraints, for the short-term, the
government would only be able to build new bases in Sorong (Irian
Jaya province), Sumatra island and Java island.
</P>
<P>
"Ideally, each large province must have its own marine
development center," the president was quoted by the Jakarta Post
Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Now, the Navy has six large bases in Belawan (North Sumatra
province), Tanjung Priok (Jakarta), Teluk Rantai (Lampung province
in Sumatra island), Ujung (Surabaya), Makassar and Jayapura (Irian
Jaya).
</P>
<P>
"I even said during a recent meeting with marines that if the
three bases were still not enough we could expand more, in line
with our budgetary capacity," the president added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the country's archipelagic geographic condition
and its abundant sea resources, the president has vowed to boost
the navy's role since his election as the country's president last
October.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Wants Slight Increase in OPEC Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Government has
reiterated the country's stance to support only a slight increase
in the production quota at the OPEC (Organization of Petroleum
Producing Countries) meeting scheduled for Monday in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
"Our position (that there should only be a slight production
increase) will remain unchanged. If the increase is too high, the
price will automatically go down. I have frequently stated that a
slight increase will be enough to keep the oil price within a
range between 20 and 25 U.S. dollars per barrel," Minister of
Mines and Energy Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono was quoted by the
Jakarta Post Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices have risen to above 30 U.S. dollars per barrel over
the past several months from around 10 U.S. dollars a year ago
after it and other non-OPEC oil producers decided to cut global
output.
</P>
<P>
Susilo said Indonesia would propose just a slight production
increase in order to keep the world oil price stable, hopefully at
more than 20 U.S. dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
He said the approaching ministerial meeting of OPEC could be
very tough as the camps for and against oil output increases were
equally strong in the group.
</P>
<P>
"I've heard that OPEC is divided over the issue of a quota
increase. I think there will be a heated debate during the meeting,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that it was Indonesia's hope that some
compromise could eventually be achieved at the Vienna meeting.
</P>
<P>
Susilo earlier said Indonesia would only accept a one million
bpd (barrels per day) increase in output to keep oil prices
between 22 and 26 U.S. dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government assumes an oil price of 20 U.S.
dollars per barrel in the April-December 2000 state budget.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that leading producers, including Saudi Arabia,
are believed to favor extra OPEC supply of about 1.5 million
barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iran said it was still against a rise in oil
production to bring prices down.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Mexican President Ernesto
Zedillo said Friday that the free trade agreement signed with the
European Union (EU) promises new economic opportunities for the
country.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed Thursday in Lisbon, Portugal, has been
the first between the EU and a Latin American country. Together
with the one signed recently with Israel, it secures Mexico a safe
position in the world economy, Zedillo said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will give EU companies more access to a major
Latin American market and reduce Mexico's dependence on the United
States, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, due to take effect on July 1, will cover all EU-
Mexico trade in the field of industrial products, 99.5 percent of
trade in the fisheries sector and 62 percent of trade in the field
of agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, by 2003 more than half of EU
industrial exports to Mexico will enter duty-free, and the
remaining tariffs, to be reduced from as high as 35 percent to a
maximum of 5 percent, will totally disappear at the latest by 2007.
Mexican exports to the EU will be duty-free as early as in 2003.

<P>
ROME, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Two goals from Ukrainian striker
Andriy Shevchenko gave AC Milan a 2-0 win over Juventus and ended
the Serie A leaders' 22-game unbeaten streak on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Shevchenko, who tops the scorers standings with 21 goals after
the double, put the home team ahead just before the break when he
headed in Thomas Helveg's cross.
</P>
<P>
He added another with six minutes to go on a penalty after he
was brought down by Alessandro Birindelli inside the area.
</P>
<P>
The win put AC Milan on the third place with 49 points.
</P>
<P>
Juventus still hold nine-point lead over second-placed Lazio
with 59 points, but could have the margin cut if Lazio beat AS
Roma in Saturday's derby.
</P>
<P>
While fourth-placed Inter Milan, 48, will face lowly Lecce.

GENEVA, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Celestine Babayaro might not join
Nigeria for their Olympic qualifier against Zimbabwe as FIFA ruled
Friday that Chelsea were not obliged to release the Nigerian.
</P>
<P>
The world soccer's governing body said Nigeria, which will face
Zimbabwe on Saturday, had not asked for Babayaro's release in time.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, third in the group behind Zimbabwe and Angola, need to
win by five clear goals in Lagos to qualify as group winners for
the Sydney Olympics and have called up their high-profile overseas-
based players for the match.
</P>
<P>
But the London club refused to release the wingback because
Babayaro was unfit. He came off after 75 minutes of Chelsea's 2-1
loss to Lazio in the Champions League on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Uruguayan Budget Deficit High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The 1999 Uruguayan budget
deficit amounted to 815 million U.S. dollars, 3.6 percent of its
gross domestic product (GDP), said Saturday the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
The public accounts imbalance surpassed three successive upward
revisions made along the year.
</P>
<P>
The Uruguayan budget deficit was estimated at 2.1 percent of
the GDP in an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
The economic team estimated afterwards that it would go up to 3
percent, and former Economy minister Luis Mosca raised it again to
3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The central government revenue dropped 7.2 percent in 1999
against those of the previous year, reaching 4.056 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, government spending in 1999 rose to 4.85 billion
dollars, against 4.629 billion dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The economic team foresees that the budget deficit will reduce
to 1.8 percent of the GDP this year.
</P>
<P>
The Jorge Batlle government will reduce some 200 million
dollars from public spending and investment, with the goal of
reaching this target.

<HEADLINE> Background: Key Facts About Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian voters go to the polls
Sunday to elect a new president. Following are some key facts
about the largest country in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Federation is a permanent member of the United
Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
- - - -
</P>
<P>
GEORGRAPHY: Covering over 10 percent of the globe's land area,
Russia borders Norway, Finland, Estonia and Latvia in the
northwest,Belarus and Ukraine to the west, Georgia, Azerbaijan and
Kazakhstan to the southwest, and China, Mongolia and the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the southeast.
</P>
<P>
Its shores are bathed by the Black Sea, the Caspian Sea, the
Sea of Japan, the Pacific Ocean and the Arctic Ocean. It comprises
76 percent of the area of the former Soviet Union, covering some
17.1 million square kilometers and 11 time zones.
</P>
<P>
The country can be divided into three broad geographic regions:
European Russia, consisting of the territory west of the Ural
Mountains; Siberia, stretching east from the Urals almost to the
Pacific Ocean; and far eastern Russia, including the extreme
southeast and the Pacific coast.
</P>
<P>
Russia has the longest continuous coastline (37,650 kilometers)
of any country in the world. Most of the coast borders waters that
are frozen for many months of the year. The country has numerous
important rivers and lakes. The Caspian Sea in the south is
actually a salt lake. It has the largest surface area of any lake
in the world,371,000 square kilometers. The second largest body of
water in Russia is Lake Baikal, which is the deepest freshwater
lake in the world,with a maximum depth of 1,637 meters.
</P>
<P>
- - - -
</P>
<P>
CLIMATE: Russia's climate is generally harsh, with long, cold
winters and short, cool summers. The coldest winter temperatures
occur in eastern Siberia; in January, temperatures there average
minus 51 degrees Celsius and have reached minus 68 degrees Celsius.
Most of European Russia has a more temperate climate.
</P>
<P>
- - - -
</P>
<P>
RESOURCES: Russia contains the greatest mineral reserves of any
country in the world. It is especially rich in mineral fuels,
including petroleum and natural gas. Other important resources
include iron ore, nickel, tungsten, cobalt, and molybdenum. The
country also has some of the world's largest gold reserves and
significant deposits of copper, silver, and mercury.
</P>
<P>
- - - -
</P>
<P>
POPULATION: Estimated at 145.5 million on January 1, 2000. The
majority of the people live in European Russia, but sizable
communities exist throughout the country near mining and
industrial centers. People of more than 100 nationalities inhabit
the country; Russians are the predominant nationality, and
minorities include Tatars, Ukrainians, and Chuvash. More than 100
languages are spoken, but Russian is most commonly used in
business, government, and education.
</P>
<P>
Russia's population has witnessed a steady drop in recent years,
by 784,500 in 1999 alone. Experts of the Russian Science and
Health Ministries said last Friday that the population might halve
in 50 to 70 years.

<P>
CAPITAL: Moscow, population 8.5 million.

</P>
<P>
POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS: Russia's 89 administrative divisions
include 21 ethnically based republics, 6 krays (territories), 10
okrugs (national areas), 1 autonomous region, 49 oblasts (
districts),and 2 major cities, Moscow and St. Petersburg. The
republics have a greater degree of autonomy than the other
subjects of the federation,and they have special rights, including
the right to adopt their own limited constitutions, anthems, and
flags.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1993 Constitution, executive power is invested in the
president, who is elected for a maximum of two four-year periods
and who appoints the government, including the prime minister.
Boris Yeltsin, serving as president since 1991, resigned abruptly
on December 31, 1999, and appointed Prime Minister Vladimir Putin
as the acting head of state.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Assembly comprises two chambers directly elected
for four years: a 450-member lower house (the State Duma) and a
178-member upper chamber (the Federation Council) with
representatives from each of the country's territorial units.
</P>

</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: Russia is one of the world's largest producers of coal,
iron ore, steel, petroleum and cement. It also produces gold,
diamonds and cotton.
</P>
<P>
Russia's economy has declined steadily during the 1990s. A
brief upturn in industrial output in the first quarter of 1998 was
rapidly nullified by the financial crisis of August 1998, which
saw a massive withdrawal of foreign investment. Aided by the
devaluation of the ruble and a surge in world oil prices, the
Russian economy registered a growth of 3.2 percent in its gross
domestic product in 1999. Better indicators in the first several
months of the year have also enabled officials to raise their
economic targets.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing still employs more than a quarter of the labor
force,and includes steel, textiles, chemicals and heavy
engineering.

DEFENSE: 1,240,000 armed forces, including 149,000 strategic
nuclear forces, 420,000 in the army, 130,000 in the air force, 220,

<HEADLINE> Cubans March Again for Elian's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several protest demonstrations were held this week in the
island, among them three informative Round Tables that were
broadcast over television, with the participation of President
Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
The Round Tables analysis was centered in the sentence dictated
by U.S. Judge Michael Moore, who dismissed political asylum for
Elian, retained four months ago in Miami, far from his only
surviving parent, his father, who lives in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The Round Tables participants asked the U.S. Government to
take the necessary action to return the minor to Cuba, whose
mother drowned in November of last year when she was illegally
trying to reach the coasts of Florida,the United States.
</P>
<P>
The panelists said that Elian's tragedy is ultimately caused by
the Cuban Adjustment Law of the United States, that grants
automatically residence in the United States to any Cuban who sets
foot on U.S. soil.
</P>
<P>
The authorities of the island say that this law, that offers
exceptional privileges of naturalization to Cuban emigrants, is a
stimulus for illegal emigration.
</P>
<P>
Moore's ruling and Attorney General Janet Reno's most recent
statements revived in the island the hope that the boy will return
to live with his father.
</P>
<P>
The retention of Elian, who was rescued from the sea on
November 25 last year, caused a wave of mass demonstrations in
Cuba that threatened to continue until the end of the Cuban
Adjustment Law.

These resources will be used to consolidate the Mesoamerican
Biological Corridor program that goes from the south of Mexico to
Panama.
</P>
<P>
The Mesoamerica biodiversity suffers an annual devastation of
400,000 hectares, or the loss of 50 hectares of forest every hour.
</P>
<P>
This destruction has a negative effect on the conservation of
the waters, the soils, the fishing resources, and the biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
The project goal is to establish a functional system for the
construction of the planned Mesoamerican Biological Corridor and
to improve the conservation of the biodiversity in Central America
and the south of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The idea of creating a biological corridor was launched in 1992.
Two years later Central American presidents committed themselves
to creating the Central American Biological Corridor.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Peace Hopes Damaged by Trimble Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Ulster Unionist Party leader David
Trimble on Saturday beat off a leadership challenge, that could
have far-reaching effects on the Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
But Trimble failed to win a clear endorsement of his handling
of the Northern Ireland peace process - winning only 457 votes -
or 56.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of the Ulster Unionist's Party's ruling council in
Belfast, his challenger, Reverend Martin Smyth, a long-standing
opponent of the Good Friday Agreement, won 348 votes, or 43.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Unionist Council also voted in favor of making a
retention of the RUC title a pre-condition of the party's
involvement in any future devolved government.
</P>
<P>
The RUC's name is due to be changed under reforms recommended
by Chris Patten.
</P>
<P>
The motion was passed in spite of an attempt by Trimble to
amend it. His amendment was defeated narrowly - 53 percent to 47
percent.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said the result demonstrated "the depths of the concern
and the passionate feeling" about the government's plans to reform
policing in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that he was not "shattered and I do not think
that I am shackled" by the acceptance of the motion.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's office welcomed the re-election of
Trimble as leader.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary of State Peter Mandelson said
Trimble's re-election means the Good Friday Agreement is safe.
</P>
<P>
The peace process has been stalled since mid-February, when the
British government suspended the fledgling Northern Ireland power-
sharing assembly, over the Irish Republican Army's failure to
decommission its weapons.
