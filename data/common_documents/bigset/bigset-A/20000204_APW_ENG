<HEADLINE> No. 3 Duke 90, N.C. 86, OT  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID DROSCHAK AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (AP) -- Last season was one of blowouts for Duke. This
time around the third-ranked Blue Devils are living on the edge.
</P>
<P>
	   Duke won their fourth overtime game this season, beating arch-rival North
Carolina 90-86 Thursday night in one of the classic games in arguably college
basketball's best rivalry.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our guys have done well in overtime, but I don't want them to take me there
anymore," Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said.
</P>
<P>
	   Duke (17-2, 8-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) blew a 19-point second-half lead,
but got 25 points from Shane Battier, 23 from Chris Carrawell and seven from
Carlos Boozer in the overtime to beat the Tar Heels (13-9, 4-4) as it extended
its own record with its 30th straight ACC regular-season victory.
</P>
<P>
	   "The hype really didn't measure up to the performance of all the youngsters
in that ball game," Krzyzewski said. "I thought there was sensational basketball
out on the court by both teams."
</P>
<P>
	   The Blue Devils scored on their first six possessions in the overtime and
never trailed after North Carolina's Joseph Forte sent the game into the extra
period at 73-73 with a 3-pointer with 5.2 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   "We could have easily put our heads down when it went into overtime,"
Carrawell said. "I know I was saying, 'Oh God, not here, not now.' But we stuck
in there and we fought."
</P>
<P>
	   It was Duke's third ACC overtime win this season. Mike Dunleavy iced the
game with two free throws with 6.7 seconds left in overtime with Duke clinging
to a two-point lead.
</P>
<P>
	   "We told our team at halftime that a program as great as North Carolina's
and the kids who play here aren't going to back down, they are going to come out
at us and they did," Krzyzewski said of North Carolina's rally. "I didn't think
we backed down, either."
</P>
<P>
	   The victory was also Duke's 17th straight overall and 16th consecutive ACC
road victory, placing the Blue Devils three games in front of North Carolina
State and Virginia in the race for first place in the ACC.
</P>
<P>
	   "Duke is a great team. I thought so before and I even think more so now,"
North Carolina coach Bill Guthridge said. "We just got ourselves in too big of a
hole.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think they're the best team in the country," added Guthridge. "Mike has
done a tremendous job of molding those freshmen in with Battier and Carrawell
and (Nate) James."
</P>
<P>
	   Battier scored 14 points in the first half as Duke bolted to a 17-point
halftime lead over the turnover-prone Tar Heels, who came into the 205th meeting
of the local rivals unranked for the first time since 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Tar Heels staged a furious second-half rally, scoring on 19 of their
final 22 possessions of regulation to more than throw a scare into the red-hot
Blue Devils.
</P>
<P>
	   Ed Cota led the Tar Heels with 21 points, while Forte had 20.
</P>
<P>
	   Battier was 5-for-6 from the field and 4-for-5 from the foul line in a first
half in which the Blue Devils shot 50 percent and did few things wrong.
</P>
<P>
	   The game heated up early when normally mild-mannered Guthridge picked up the
first technical foul of his three-year head coaching career, arguing that a
charge should have been called on a basket by Dunleavy.
</P>
<P>
	   But even Guthridge's uncharacteristic outburst couldn't fire up his sloppy
Tar Heels, who coughed up the ball 14 times in the opening 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Duke led 17-15 midway through the half before going on a 13-2 run that broke
the game open.
</P>
<P>
	   Jason Williams hit a 3-pointer and made a shot in the lane to start the
spurt, while Battier closed it with a baseline jumper.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tar Heels then turned it over on five of its next six possessions as the
crowd of 22,750 settled back into their seats.
</P>
<P>
	   "The first half was maybe the worst half we've played," Guthridge said.

<HEADLINE> New Trial Asked for in AIDS Case  </HEADLINE>
   By JEFFREY McMURRAY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The attorney for a man serving life in prison for
injecting his son with HIV-tainted blood asked an appeals court for a new trial
Thursday, saying prosecutors made legal errors and witheld evidence.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said Brian Stewart, 33, stuck a syringe with HIV-contaminated
blood into the 11-month-old boy's arm during a visit in 1992. He had access to
the blood from the St. Louis hospital where he worked as a phlebotomist.
</P>
<P>
	   Stewart was convicted of first-degree assault in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy, now 8, has been diagnosed with AIDS. If he dies, Stewart could be
retried for murder.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors alleged Stewart committed the crime to avoid paying child
support, but Stewart's lawyer said that makes no sense.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why would someone do this to avoid child support when you're the person
stuck with the bill if the child is harmed?'' Joseph Murphy said Thursday after
a Missouri Court of Appeals hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Murphy said prosecutors withheld a blood test taken by the victim and health
records of people who testified at trial. Assistant Attorney General Breck
Burgess said the blood test no longer exists and that he couldn't turn over the
health records because of confidentiality laws.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense has argued the boy could have contracted the virus a number of
other ways since he was hospitalized frequently and lived with three admitted
drug users for a three-week period.

<HEADLINE> Lawsuit Filed Over Contaminated Dip  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- A lawsuit was filed Thursday over illnesses linked to
contaminated Mexican-style bean dip that has sickened nearly 50 people.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit alleges negligence by Senor Felix Gourmet Mexican Foods of
Baldwin Park, Calif., and seeks unspecified damages for lost wages, medical
expenses and emotional distress.
</P>
<P>
	   The case was filed on behalf of Larissa and Robert Spafford and their
2-year-old son, Jasper, of Port Townsend, Wash.
</P>
<P>
	   Senor Felix recalled the dip, which was sold nationwide, in January. The
federal Food and Drug Administration has said it may be contaminated with
shigella, a type of bacteria that causes bloody diarrhea, cramps, fever, nausea
and vomiting.
</P>
<P>
	   The contaminated product appears to have poisoned at least 49 people, the
FDA has said. Most of the illnesses have been reported in California, Oregon and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Larissa Spafford and her son became ill with stomach cramps, fever and
diarrhea after they ate some of the dip purchased from a supermarket, the
lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not really concerned about lawsuits. What we're concerned about is
the health of our customers. We're doing everything we can to ensure that this
doesn't happen again,'' Stan Wetch, Senor Felix president, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA last month issued a warning to consumers not to purchase any
five-layer dip sold under the following brand names: Senor Felix's Five-Layere
Party Dip, Delicioso 5-Layer Dip, Trader Joe's Five-Layer Fiesta Dip, or The
Carryout Cafe Mexican Fiesta Party Dip 5 Layer.

<HEADLINE> Hokie Andre Kendrick Out of School  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BLACKSBURG, Va. (AP) -- Andre Kendrick, expected to succeed Shyrone Stith as
Virginia Tech's primary tailback, isn't enrolled in school this semester and
won't take part in spring workouts.
</P>
<P>
	   Kendrick, who couldn't be reached Thursday, failed to maintain a 2.0
grade-point average required by the school to enroll, The Roanoke Times
reported, quoting a source it didn't identify.
</P>
<P>
	   Tech officials told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that Kendrick's absence
didn't stem from disciplinary problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Coach Frank Beamer confirmed that Kendrick isn't enrolled. The semester
began Jan. 17.
</P>
<P>
	   Low grades would bring into question Kendrick's eligibility as a player next
season. He would have to raise his GPA to 2.0 in summer classes to become
eligible.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, Stith decided to give up his senior season to enter the spring
NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
	   Beamer said he was confident that Kendrick will return for practice in
August.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hokies just completed a school-best 11-1 season, ending with a 46-29
loss to Florida State in the Sugar Bowl national title game. Tech ended the
season ranked No. 2.
</P>
<P>
	   Stith and Kendrick formed one of the country's top tailback tandems. Stith
ran for 1,147 yards and 13 touchdowns, Kendrick for 645 and seven TDs.
Kendrick's 6.3 yards per rush was a school record.

<HEADLINE> Sharks 3, Avalanche 3  </HEADLINE>
    By JOHN MOSSMAN AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- San Jose's Mike Ricci and Colorado's Milan Hejduk each scored
two goals as the Sharks and Avalanche skated to a 3-3 tie Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Colorado rallied from a 3-1 deficit with two goals just 45 seconds apart
early in the third period to extend its unbeaten streak at home to 12 (9-0-3).
</P>
<P>
	   San Jose goalie Steve Shields had 27 saves, and Colorado's Patrick Roy had
28. Roy's career victory total remained at 431, three shy of second-place
Jacques Plante on the NHL's career list.
</P>
<P>
	   The Avalanche, playing without star forward Peter Forsberg who is sidelined
with a concussion suffered on Tuesday night, overcame the third-period deficit
on goals by Greg de Vries and Hejduk.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sharks had five shots on goal in the overtime session compared to
Colorado's one. Roy twice stopped Owen Nolan in the extra period, and the Sharks
withstood a 3-on-1 Colorado rush when defenseman Brad Stuart broke up Joe
Sakic's pass intended for Martin Skoula on the left wing.
</P>
<P>
	   With the tie, the Sharks snapped a five-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
	   Ricci, a former Avalanche player acquired by the Sharks on Nov. 20, 1997,
scored twice in the opening period.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sharks ended their scoreless streak at 89 minutes, 55 seconds with a
goal just 23 seconds into the game when Colorado's Sandis Ozolinsh circled
behind the net and attempted to clear a pass that deflected off Ricci into the
goal. The goal also ended San Jose's scoreless streak in Denver at 154 minutes,
57 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Penalties against de Vries and Adam Foote gave San Jose a 5-on-3 advantage
for 1:03, and Ricci scored again, deflecting a shot from the slot by Gary Suter
for a power-play goal, his 15th of the season, at 6:48.
</P>
<P>
	   Hejduk made it 2-1 late in the second period. Hejduk took a pass from Sakic
in the left circle, drew Shields out of the crease and tucked the puck behind
Shields into an open net at 17:34.
</P>
<P>
	   Shields earlier stopped Chris Drury on a breakaway.
</P>
<P>
	   Niklas Sundstrom put San Jose ahead 3-1 early at 1:37 of the third period,
but Colorado countered with two quick goals.
</P>
<P>
	   De Vries scored his first goal in 77 games at 3:44, deflecting Stephane
Yelle's shot out of the air with his stick.
</P>
<P>
	   At 4:29, the suddenly energized Avalanche scored again when Hejduk stole the
puck from Jeff Friesen and beat Shields from the slot for his 24th goal.

<HEADLINE> Content's Editor, Brill, Steps Down  </HEADLINE>
    By SETH SUTEL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Steven Brill, founder of a media watchdog magazine that
bears his name, stepped down as editor in chief a day after announcing a
controversial business venture with several media companies under his scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
	   Brill relinquished the title of editor in chief of Brill's Content Thursday
to David Kuhn, who joined the company last fall to head up the new Internet
business. Brill will keep his titles of chairman and CEO of Brill Media
Holdings, the parent company that holds both the magazine and the online
business.
</P>
<P>
	   The move came a day after Brill announced a partnership with CBS, NBC and
several other media companies to launch Contentville.com, a Web site that would
recommend books, magazine articles and other material for readers to buy.
</P>
<P>
	   The arrangement raised eyebrows because of the role Brill has assumed of
being an arbiter of fairness and honesty in the media industry. Brill had
previously come under fire for his donations to certain Democrats in light of a
lengthy article in the magazine's first issue that was critical of independent
counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
	   Brill declined to comment for this story. But a spokeswoman, Cindy
Rosenthal, said that questions over conflict of interest had nothing to do with
Brill's decision to step down as editor of the magazine.
</P>
<P>
	   "He can't do everything. He's going to focus on the business side and have
someone else focus on the editorial side," Rosenthal said. As of Wednesday,
however, Brill was in charge of both editorial and business operations for the
magazine.
</P>
<P>
	   Rosenthal also said she did not believe Kuhn's position as both top editor
of the watchdog magazine and of the Web site linked with the media companies
posed a conflict of interest.
</P>
<P>
	   In announcing the Contentville.com venture Wednesday, Brill said the site
would provide "informed, disinterested recommendations" to readers for books and
magazines to buy, and that the Web site and magazine would remain separate.
</P>
<P>
	   "In a world where everything is marketed and hyped, we want to create a
place online that is like an old-time magazine stand, bookstore, or library,"
Brill said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to NBC and CBS, other partners in Contentville.com included
Primedia, a major publisher of special-interest and enthusiast magazines; Ingram
Book Group, a leading book distributor; Ebsco, a major provider of magazine
subscription services; and Jim Cramer, an investment manager and founder of the
financial news site TheStreet.com.
</P>
<P>
	   Any of Contentville's business partners could be considered fair game for
scrutiny in the Brill's Content. The magazine has already written about NBC and
ran a cover story last year on CBS and CNN. CBS will have a 35 percent stake in
Contentville.com.
</P>
<P>
	   All told, the cash and promotion being put into the venture was valued at
more than $100 million. The Web site is expected to launch in the fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Brill's Content, which carries the slogan "Skepticism is a Virtue" on its
cover, takes a critical view of the media world, holding the news business and
media companies up for scrutiny on questions of coverage, privacy, and media
ownership.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know what his motive is for resigning, but on its face there's
certainly the appearance of a conflict," said Sig Gissler, a professor at
Columbia University's School of Journalism. "The watchdog should try to keep an
arm's length relationship with the media they're watching, and it sounds to me
like they were getting a little close."
</P>
<P>
	   Brill's Content made a big splash when it started in June 1998, especially
with the article on Starr and information leaks to reporters during the Monica
Lewinsky affair. Since then, however, it has maintained a lower profile.
</P>
<P>
	   Before starting Brill's Content, Brill founded Court TV and American Lawyer
Magazine.

<HEADLINE> Mattel CEO Jill Barad Resigns  </HEADLINE>
    By RACHEL BECK AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Jill Barad, who made Barbie into a selling sensation and
help build Mattel into corporate powerhouse, has stepped down from the helm of
the world's biggest toymaker after failing to revive falling sales and profits.
</P>
<P>
	   Barad resigned Thursday as the El Segundo, Calif.-based company reported a
steep loss for the fourth quarter, disappointing Wall Street analysts for the
third time in the past four quarters.
</P>
<P>
	   Barad, 48, one of the highest ranking women in business, was under intense
pressure from investors and Mattel's board of directors to explain big losses at
the company's newly acquired Learning Company software division and other
troubles at Mattel.
</P>
<P>
	   With her resignation, the board of directors will take charge of the company
to oversee operations and search for a new CEO. The board appointed two of its
own members to leadership roles, picking William Rollnick as acting chairman and
Ronald Loeb as acting CEO.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think they need to look themselves in the eyes, look at what the problems
are with this company and really try to figure them out," said Sean McGowan, a
toy analyst at the investment firm Gerard Klauer Mattison.
</P>
<P>
	   For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Mattel reported a net loss of $18.4 million,
or 4 cents a share, compared with profits of $86.7 million, or 22 cents a share,
in the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected the company
to earn 25 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales for the quarter were $1.77 billion, down from $1.82 billion a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Barad joined Mattel in 1981 as a product manager in the novelty toy unit,
and took the helm in 1997. Her flashy style and an aggressive marketing savvy
lifted her to the top.
</P>
<P>
	   Under her supervision, Barbie was transformed from a tired, $200 million
product line into one of the most recognized brands of all time with $1.9
billion in sales last year.
</P>
<P>
	   She also was able to recognize the changing desires of techno-literate kids
today, who learn to use a computer in pre-school. Mattel's has stepped up its
software and online offerings, and looked to new avenues to capture shoppers.
</P>
<P>
	   "She was passionate about every product that Mattel made and every last
detail. She cared if Barbie's shoes were green or orange," said Chris Byrne, a
New York-based toy industry consultant. "Does that make you a great CEO? Maybe
not, but she still was an unbelievable asset."
</P>
<P>
	   Barad was also considered a pioneer of women in corporate America. She was
only one of four women CEOs heading Fortune 500 companies. The others are Andrea
Jung is CEO of Avon, Carleton S. Fiorina of Hewlett-Packard and Marion D.
Sandler of Golden West Financial.
</P>
<P>
	   But Barad, in the last 14 months, has fallen out of favor with the
investment community. Shareholders and analysts have been calling for some kind
of shakeup at the company, many saying they wanted to Barad out.
</P>
<P>
	   Her troubles began in December 1998 when Mattel announced a $500 million
shortfall for the year after the company ignored an announcement by Toys R Us
that it planned to reduce its inventory during the year, and the prospect that
other retailers would do likewise.
</P>
<P>
	   That came only weeks after Barad assured analysts that Mattel would meet its
projections.
</P>
<P>
	   Her bigger problem, however, has come from Mattel's $3.6 billion purchase of
the Learning Company, a software manufacturer that it bought last May as part of
an effort to tap the growing market for interactive toys. The Learning Company's
software titles include Carmen Sandiego, Riven and Myst.
</P>
<P>
	   That deal was supposed to immediately add $50 million annually to Mattel's
bottom line. Instead the company lost $105 million in the third quarter due to a
number of problems with the software division, including a loss of a key
distribution deal and an unexpected high return of unsold products from
retailers.
</P>
<P>
	   And the problems with the Learning Company haven't stopped. During the
fourth quarter, the division's sales plunged 40 percent to $165 million, mostly
due to slower CD-ROM sales and competitive pricing.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the Learning Company lost $183 million in the quarter and $206
million for the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Also problematic for Mattel was a slump in its business overseas, with sales
abroad falling 8 percent from a year ago. The company has also lost many of its
top executives in recent months, including its president and chief financial
officer, who will retire in March.
</P>
<P>
	   While such problems have plagued Mattel, its core domestic business has
remained somewhat strong. Barbie sales climbed 11 percent in the fourth quarter,
while the Fisher-Price line, which includes the Sesame Street license, rose by
48 percent.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Prevents Execution  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATMORE, Ala. (AP) -- The U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay of execution
Thursday to an Alabama death row inmate who had claimed that death by
electrocution constitutes cruel and unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
	   In his petition, Robert Lee Tarver Jr. challenged Alabama's use of the
electric chair to execute inmates, saying it violates his Eighth Amendment right
against cruel and unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I expect that this will create an opportunity to further discuss whether
Alabama should be one of the few states that continues to execute condemned
prisoners by electrocution,'' said one of Tarver's attorneys, Bryan Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
	   The brief order prevented Tarver, 52, from being executed in the state's
electric chair at Holman Prison at 12:01 a.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Tarver was convicted of the 1984 robbery and slaying of Hugh Sims Kite, 63,
outside his bait shop and grocery in Cottonton, near the Georgia line.
Prosecutors said Tarver shot Kite several times and stole his wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   The high court had agreed to review Florida's use of the electric chair. But
last month the court decided not to act on the issue because Florida changed its
law, making lethal injection the primary method of execution and the electric
chair an alternative method.
</P>
<P>
	   Alabama, Nebraska and Georgia are the only states with the electric chair as
the sole means of execution.
</P>
<P>
	   Alabama officials, in response to Tarver's appeal, said death in the state's
electric chair is almost painless and instantaneous.
</P>
<P>
	   Stevenson argued in clemency requests that blacks were wrongly excluded from
serving on Tarver's jury. A jury of 11 whites and one black convicted the black
defendant of killing Kite, a white man.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Don Siegelman had denied the clemency request Thursday evening before
the high court issued its ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   Kite's daughter and son, who had traveled to Holman to witness the
execution, did not comment after the court's decision.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think they're just going to go home,'' said state Prison Commissioner
Mike Haley.

<HEADLINE> Corning drives deeper into Internet-propelled fiber-optic market  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CORNING, N.Y. (AP) - Driven by rapid technological innovation and
plunging costs, the amount of information fiber-optic systems can handle is
estimated to be doubling every nine months.
<P>
	   "Compare that with Moore's Law, which has microprocessors doubling in
capability every 18 months and ... you begin to get an idea of the scale of the
experience change," said Wendell Weeks, who oversees Corning Inc.'s fiber and
optical equipment businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Fiber optics has been credited above all other technologies with enabling
the phenomenal growth of the Internet, and the company that invented optical
fiber 30 years ago wants to be sure it retains a front-row seat in this
scorching business.
</P>
<P>
	   Corning, already the world's leading supplier of optical fiber and cable,
said Thursday it is investing about $750 million to expand its global
fiber-making capacity by 50 percent within three years.
</P>
<P>
	   The "scientific glass company," famous for entwining glass innovations in
potent technologies from the light bulb to television's cathode-ray tube, also
recently spent more than $3 billion to solidify its presence in optical
communications.
</P>
<P>
	   Corning wants to begin offering its customers "one-stop shopping" by getting
a bigger foothold in the optical equipment field - making the components that
amplify and redirect the laser light pulses carrying information at hyper-speed
through fiber-optic grids.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, Corning acquired a leading laser producer, Oak Industries Inc.,
in a stock deal valued around $2 billion. A month later, it paid around $1.3
billion to buy Siemens AG's fiber-optic systems business and buy out two joint
ventures with the German industrial group. Both deals were formally completed
during the past week.
</P>
<P>
	   By investing in laser and other optical components, Corning is pushing into
terrain reigned over by powerhouses like San Jose, Calif.-based JDS Uniphase
Corp. and Lucent Technologies, of Murray Hill, N.J.
</P>
<P>
	   Corning, based in rural western New York, controls an estimated 40 percent
of the world's optical fiber market, twice as much as its nearest rival, Lucent,
and has fiber-making plants in Europe, Australia and the United States,
including the world's largest, in Wilmington, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts set worldwide demand for fiber at more than 37 million miles in
1999. The market is expected to exceed 60 million miles in 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   Corning will use $550 million to double the capacity of its six-month-old
factory near Concord, N.C., and add 500 jobs to several hundred already there.
Additionally, it is planning a $100 million expansion at the Wilmington plant.
</P>
<P>
	   Optical fiber, cable and optical devices contributed 59 percent of Corning's
revenues of $4.3 billion in 1999, and that segment will likely account for 70
percent of sales this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Corning were up $1.25 to $149.50 in trading on the New York Stock
Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Regulators To Protect Financial Data  </HEADLINE>
   By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal regulators are proposing new rules spelling out
how consumers' personal data will be protected as banks, investment firms and
insurance companies merge to create one-stop financial supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
	   The first sets of rules were put forward Thursday by the Federal Reserve and
a Treasury Department division. They will make it tougher for financial
companies to share even seemingly innocuous information, such as customers'
names, addresses and telephone numbers, with outside marketing firms.
</P>
<P>
	   The regulators take the view that such basic information is ``nonpublic''
information when it is taken from sources such as customer lists -- even if the
names and addresses also are available from a telephone book.
</P>
<P>
	   As ``nonpublic'' information, the names and addresses -- as well as more
personal financial data such as account balances -- cannot be shared with
outside telemarketers if customers expressly ask their banks, brokerages or
insurance companies not to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the onus is on consumers. They must ask, in a letter or standard
form, financial companies with whom they do business not to share or sell their
data.
</P>
<P>
	   Furthermore, under a financial overhaul law enacted in November, banks,
brokerages and insurers that join together under the same corporate roof are
entitled to share customers' personal financial data with each other. In that
case, customers do not have the right to block such sharing.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumer groups and privacy advocates have said the new law's privacy
protections fall short.
</P>
<P>
	   Frank Torres, legislative counsel for Consumers Union, said the new rules
proposed by the regulators ``have a broad definition of what kind of information
... (is) covered by privacy requirements, which is encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``However, we do have some concerns,'' he added. ``It's unfortunate that
these rules are constrained by the financial services law passed last year.''
</P>
<P>
	   Catherine Pulley, a spokeswoman for the American Bankers Association, said
the group will ``look more closely at these regulations.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some bankers privately objected to the new rules, saying they took an overly
broad interpretation of privacy protection.
</P>
<P>
	   Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, who won Senate confirmation Thursday for a
fourth term, expressed approval of the new privacy rules at an open meeting at
which he and the other central bank governors voted to propose them for 60 days
of public comment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``So far, so good,'' Greenspan told the Fed staff attorneys, who had drafted
the rules and negotiated with other federal agencies to make the regulations
consistent for different financial industries and sectors.
</P>
<P>
	   While most people think of the Federal Reserve as regulating the nation's
money supply and controlling interest rates, the central bank also oversees some
categories of banks, including those organized in a holding company structure.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed is among a group of agencies that have been drafting privacy rules
for the industries and sectors they regulate, because of the legislation enacted
in November that swept away Depression-era barriers and allowed banks,
investment firms and insurance companies to get into each other's businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   The other agencies include the Securities and Exchange Commission; the
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Treasury Department division that
regulates national banks; the Office of Thrift Supervision and the National
Credit Union Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Trade Commission is writing the rules for insurance companies
and agents and a panoply of other businesses outside of banks and securities
firms -- including travel agencies, mortgage companies, tax preparation
services, check-cashing outlets, credit bureaus and department stores that issue
credit cards.
</P>
<P>
	   The agencies have been working under a tight deadline. Under the new law,
final regulations must take effect by November.
</P>
<P>
	   The Comptroller's office also published its rules Thursday, and the other
agencies are expected to follow in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a very important advance in privacy protections for consumers,''
Julie Williams, the agency's chief counsel, said in a telephone interview.
``This is a winning situation for consumers and potentially a new competitive
(feature) for banks'' that offer strong privacy protections.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the rules, financial companies will have to disclose their privacy
policies to customers at least once a year.

<HEADLINE> Group says there are holes in NYS prison health care system  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - A prison watchdog group says the state is missing
out on a great opportunity to improve health care for prison inmates and,
ultimately, for society in general in New York.
<P>
	   The Correctional Association of New York says "fundamental problems" remain
in state prison infirmaries and hospitals, despite improvements in the way
inmates with AIDS, HIV and tuberculosis are being treated.
</P>
<P>
	   "People need to consider prison health care as a public health care
concern," Jennifer Wynn, the group's prison visiting project director, said
Thursday. "The system releases 30,000 inmates a year into the community. Given
the high rates of infection among the prison population, the (prison) department
would be wise to be proactive in diagnosing, educating and treating inmates."
</P>
<P>
	   The group based its findings on an 18-month study of the prison health care
system released Thursday. The report entailed visits to 22 state prisons and
interviews with more than 1,300 inmates, prison doctors and former prison
doctors.
</P>
<P>
	   It recommended that an outside agency such as the state Health Department
oversee the inmate care system; levels of care be standardized in all 70
prisons; testing and prevention programs for AIDS and HIV be improved; all
doctors in prisons be board-certified; and prison officials institute a system
for making sure ill inmates released into the community take their medication
and have access to doctors.
</P>
<P>
	   "The first time in their lives that some of them are getting health care is
when they enter prisons," Wynn said. "It really does represent an opportunity to
treat the sickest among us."
</P>
<P>
	   The state Department of Correctional Services dismissed the study and its
spokesman attacked the head of the Correctional Association, Robert Gangi.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's an idiot," prisons spokesman James Flateau said. "Bob Gangi has never
seen anything in a prison system that he's liked."
</P>
<P>
	   Gangi is among the prisoner advocates state prisons officials blame for
fomenting sympathy for a prisoner strike that supposedly was to have begun at or
around New Year's Day. Gangi denied any involvement or special knowledge about
the strike, which never came off after state prison officials transferred scores
of inmates believed to be planning the demonstration at Sing Sing and Green
Haven state prisons.
</P>
<P>
	   Flateau said the Correctional Association undermined its own contentions in
the health care report by noting that AIDS-related deaths among prisoners have
dropped from 258 in 1995 to 39 in 1998 and that the number of inmates with
active tuberculosis cases have dropped by two-thirds between 1994 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   "How in one breath can you say the AIDS rate of death has declined 89
percent in the 1990s and in the next say it's inadequate?" Flateau asked.
"You're an idiot."
</P>
<P>
	   Flateau said it is not unusual to have non-board-certified doctors - those
who have not completed a residency program and their state medical boards -
practicing in communities throughout the state. He also argued it is not the job
of prison administrators to make sure inmates are taking their medication once
they are released from custody.
</P>
<P>
	   Gangi argued that Flateau was "talking schoolyard trash" because state
prison officials do not want to address the substance of the group's report.
</P>
<P>
	   "He should be taking a more measured response acknowledging the positives in
our report and recognizing that the criticisms are valid because they are
undeniable to any knowledgeable observer," Gangi said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wynn's study also recommended improving testing for HIV and Hepatitis C
among inmates and for boosting the pay scale for the prison system's doctors so
it is more competitive with what doctors outside prisons earn.
</P>
<P>
	   "We found that, by in large, the doctors do not to have the leadership
skills, the managerial skills, to run busy prison clinics," she said. "We were
not impressed with the physicians we met."
</P>
<P>
	   But Flateau said the group's advice was worthless. "We're not implementing
any of the recommendations."

<HEADLINE> Mannesmann, Vodafone Set To Merge  </HEADLINE>
    By HANS GREIMEL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The fate of what would be the largest corporate
takeover ever sits with the supervisory board of Mannesmann AG, as the embattled
German telecom giant weighs a compromise offer to merge with British rival
Vodafone AirTouch PLC in a deal valued at $180 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   After hours of negotiating late into Thursday night, Mannesmann chief Klaus
Esser announced he was prepared to recommend the takeover to his company's
supervisory board, which was scheduled to meet today.
</P>
<P>
	   Vodafone chief executive Chris Gent won the breakthrough concession by
flying to Mannesmann's Duesseldorf headquarters and pitching a last ditch,
sweetened offer.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the proposal, Mannesmann shareholders would get 58.96 Vodafone shares,
worth about $350 Thursday, for each of their Mannesmann shares. Perhaps more
importantly, Mannesmann would wind up with 49.5 percent control of the combined
company, which will be the biggest wireless communications concern in the world
with market-leading operations in Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann's demand for an equal stake in the combined company had been a
major stumbling block in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   After announcing the deal, Esser made no apologies for opposing the initial
offer since it was rejected by Mannesmann's management board Nov. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've always felt that the right approach as management of Mannesmann is to
present both sides of the issues in the division of power question to our
shareholders, present both alternatives and argue both alternatives," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann shareholders had faced a Monday deadline to say they would give
up their shares to accept a Vodafone offer worth about $165 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite earlier reports that Esser would step down, the chief executives
said Esser will stay on for five months to help with the transition.
</P>
<P>
	   Vodafone, however, would have a controlling 50.5 percent stake in the new
company, which would be a global powerhouse catering to 42 million customers
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
	   It would have an especially strong presence in Europe -- controlling the No.
1 or No. 2 position in 11 European countries with a total 29 million customers
on the continent.
</P>
<P>
	   Telecommunications analysts were excited about the potential of the merged
telecommunications giant with operations in 25 countries.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's all about ubiquitous coverage," said Harvey Liu, an analyst with CIBC
World Markets in New York. "If you're a combined Mannesmann-Vodafone, you've got
a leg up controlling networks worldwide."
</P>
<P>
	   The value of the record deal is based on Vodafone's closing price Thursday
in London trading, where shares were down 4.41 percent to $5.90.
</P>
<P>
	   If accepted, the deal would easily eclipse both America Online's planned
$135 billion merger with Time Warner and MCI WorldCom's $115 billion deal with
Sprint Corp. as the biggest corporate marriage in history.
</P>
<P>
	   Vodafone became the world's biggest mobile phone business about a year ago
by acquiring AirTouch Communications, a major wireless operator in the western
and midwestern United States. Now, Vodafone is set to link up AirTouch with Bell
Atlantic's wireless unit in a joint venture that will create the biggest U.S.
wireless service.
</P>
<P>
	   The new company's large coverage area would make it easier for mobile phone
users to take their service with them around the globe.
</P>
<P>
	   The combined company also would likely play a dominant role in implementing
the next generation of wireless technology, which will allow high-speed Internet
access from anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Mannesmann had demanded no less than a 50 percent share in the new company,
but Gent ruled such an option out, saying that Vodafone was much larger than
Mannesmann.
</P>
<P>
	   Both companies had argued that they each have a better strategy for success
in the fast-moving telecommunications industry, where deregulation in Europe is
causing a breakneck race to grab bigger market shares. They have each spent
millions in media campaigns trying to woo shareholders.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this week, Vodafone took the upper hand when it announced an
alliance with French conglomerate Vivendi SA in Europe on an Internet gateway
and for mobile and fixed line telecommunications. Mannesmann had earlier been
trying to set up its own deal with Vivendi.
</P>
<P>
	   Vodafone has said no jobs will be cut as a result of any merger.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Pieces of Downed Airline Found  </HEADLINE>
   By JEFF WILSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORT HUENEME, Calif. (AP) -- Searchers found the tail of Alaska Airlines
Flight 261 and recovered the flight data recorder Thursday, two pieces key to
determining why the jetliner plummeted into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
	   The discoveries were made by an underwater robot exploring the ocean floor
where the wreckage came to rest after the MD-83 crashed Monday, killing all 88
aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   A submersible sent up video images of a piece of the fuselage with four
windows, several large pieces up to six feet wide and numerous smaller pieces.
The airline's logo -- the smiling face of an Alaskan Eskimo -- is clearly
visible on the tail, said John Hammerschmidt, a member of the National
Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
	   The robot also captured pictures of the horizontal stabilizer, which has
been the focus of the investigation, he said. NTSB officials said they were not
able to describe the condition of the tail and stabilizer.
</P>
<P>
	   Hammerschmidt declined to say whether searchers had found any bodies, some
of which are believed trapped under the debris.
</P>
<P>
	   Navy crews had earlier salvaged the cockpit voice recorder from about 640
feet of water. The flight data recorder recovered Thursday about 200 feet away
would show the positions of the plane's controls and whether a problem with the
horizontal stabilizer on the tail was merely a symptom of a larger failure that
led to Monday's crash.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That will tell the tale,'' said William Waldock, associate director for
the Center for Aerospace Safety Education at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical
University.
</P>
<P>
	   The discovery came as friends and relatives of the crash victims gathered
along the beach facing the Santa Barbara Channel for a private memorial.
</P>
<P>
	   A few mourners roamed the shore alone, some clustered in small groups and
others waded a few feet into the ocean. The group gathered inside the Point Mugu
Naval Air Weapons Station, and reporters were kept out of the compound.
</P>
<P>
	   From the beginning the investigation has focused on the horizontal
stabilizer because the pilots had reported problems with it.
</P>
<P>
	   Contrary to earlier media reports, there were no signs of mechanical trouble
with the plane on either of its two previous flights -- from Seattle to San
Francisco and from San Francisco to Puerto Vallarta, Hammerschmidt said.
</P>
<P>
	   He also discussed interviews conducted with Alaska mechanics. They described
helping the pilots troubleshoot a ``runaway stabilizer,'' which forced the
plane's nose down.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, the pilots asked if there were any hidden circuit breakers for
the stabilizer's electrical controls. That suggests they already had shut off
one set of circuit breakers -- a standard remedy for a runaway stabilizer, also
known as runaway trim.
</P>
<P>
	   Jammed or out-of-control horizontal stabilizers have led to at least a half
dozen emergency landings but never a crash of a commercial airplane, federal
records show.
</P>
<P>
	   A review of problems involving the device over the last 20 years show
jamming is rare but has never driven a plane totally out of control.
</P>
<P>
	   An Associated Press examination of aviation records found that at least 20
in-flight problems with stabilizers were serious enough to be reported to the
Federal Aviation Administration or the NTSB since 1979.
</P>
<P>
	   In two-thirds of those cases, the flights reached their intended
destination. The rest made emergency landings, including an American Airlines
MD-83, which returned to Phoenix minutes after taking off Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   More than a half dozen involved jets made by McDonnell Douglas, which also
built the MD-83 that crashed off Southern California. Five of those cases
involved planes with stabilizers mounted high on the tail, like the MD-83.
</P>
<P>
	   Trouble similar to what Flight 261 pilots reported never before led to a
crash in the United States, according to experts and aviation reports.
</P>
<P>
	   The stabilizer, a wing on the tail of an aircraft, is designed to adjust --
or trim -- the up-or-down angle of an aircraft's nose.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's like the small corrections you make in the steering wheel going down
the freeway. Unless you're really ham-fisted, people don't feel all those small
corrections,'' said Capt. Steve Roach, a pilot union official who flew MD-83s
for three years.
</P>
<P>
	   If the horizontal stabilizer starts moving on its own -- a state of runaway
trim -- pilots can usually stop it by pulling circuit breakers and using other
controls. In most cases, it will stop before reaching an extreme angle.
</P>
<P>
	   In most aircraft, including the MD-83, a jammed stabilizer can be overridden
by moving elevators attached to its trailing edge and controlled by pulling
forward or backward on the yoke in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
	   If it jammed at an extreme position, the pilots must exert more pressure on
the yoke but still should be able to maintain control.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have flown it in the simulator with the fully runaway trim, and that's
quite a handful to fly,'' Roach said. ``You're handflying it and having to
maintain a considerable amount of pressure on the controls to keep the plane
straight and level.''
</P>
<P>
	   Though stabilizer problems are rare, regulators last May gave airlines 18
months to inspect hinges connecting parts of the tail for signs of corrosion. An
error during manufacture can cause the hinges to rust more easily.
</P>
<P>
	   The Alaska Airlines jet that crashed had not yet undergone the inspection,
but 10 of the MD-80s in the fleet did and showed no unusual corrosion, said
airline spokesman David Marriott. Records on other airlines' fleets were not
immediately available.

<HEADLINE> Stars 2, Coyotes 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PHOENIX (AP) -- Brendan Morrow is making the most of his audition.
</P>
<P>
	   Morrow had a goal and an assist and Ed Belfour made 19 saves for his 48th
career shutout as the Dallas Stars beat the Phoenix Coyotes 2-0 Thursday night,
leaving the teams tied for the Pacific Division lead going into the All-Star
break.
</P>
<P>
	   Morrow is one of several youngsters forced into action because of injuries
to the Stars' top players. Among those who did not play Thursday were Derian
Hatcher, Joe Nieuwendyk, Jere Lehtinen, Jamie Langenbrunner and Richard
Matvichuk.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're getting some ice team and we want to prove that we should be
playing," Morrow said. "When the injured guys come back, we still want the ice
time."
</P>
<P>
	   Not much offense was needed thanks to Belfour, who has won seven of his last
eight starts.
</P>
<P>
	   "The guys really worked tonight and played a tough defensive game," said
Belfour, who has three shutouts this season and is the career leader among
active goaltenders. "It was nice to see with how many guys we have out of the
lineup."
</P>
<P>
	   Belfour's chances were aided when Phoenix's Shane Doan was handed a
five-minute major penalty and game misconduct for checking Richard Jackman into
the boards from behind with three minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   The Coyotes managed only three shots on goal in the third period.
</P>
<P>
	   "We might as well just have given the game before the game even started,"
said Jeremy Roenick, whose seven-game point streak was snapped. "We weren't
prepared. We weren't ready. We made dumb decisions all night and we played bad
and they took advantage of us."
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Modano scored the other goal for Stars, who won for the sixth time in
seven games and snapped the Coyotes' five-game home winning streak. Phoenix had
not lost at home since dropping a 5-4 decision to Edmonton on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the loss, the Coyotes entered the three-day break with a share of
the division lead for the first time in franchise history. Phoenix and Dallas
each have 65 points.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can't say we've let our guard down," said Phoenix coach Bob Francis,
whose Coyotes have five wins and a regulation tie in their last seven games
(5-1-0-1). "You look at our record over the last dozen games or so and we've
taken care of business."
</P>
<P>
	   Morrow did most of the damage single-handedly in the first period.
</P>
<P>
	   Just over a minute into the game, he deflected Teppo Numminen's pass off the
defenseman's stick across the front of the crease. Morrow gained control of the
puck to the right of the net. Bob Essensa stopped the first shot, but Morrow
scored on the rebound to give Dallas a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't get a whole lot on the first one, but it came right back onto my
stick and I had a whole lot of net to miss," Morrow said.
</P>
<P>
	   Morrow also had a hand in the Stars' second goal at 15:51 of the first
period. Morrow grabbed the puck out of the air to the left of the crease,
dropped it onto his stick and shot from close range.
</P>
<P>
	   Essensa again made the initial save, but Modano took the rebound to the left
of the net, circled back to the left faceoff circle and flipped a quick wrist
shot over the Essensa's outstretched glove for his team-leading 22nd goal.
</P>
<P>
	   "We just didn't play well in the first period and it cost us the hockey
game," Dallas Drake said. "They got two goals and shut us down."
</P>
<P>
	   The Coyotes' best scoring chance came midway through the second period when
a Dallas bench minor for too many men and a delay penalty on Belfour gave
Phoenix a two-man advantage for 1:09. But Belfour, who just over a minute
earlier stopped Jyrki Lumme on a two-on-one rush, stopped both shots he faced to
preserve the shutout.

<HEADLINE> No. 2 Stanford 78, UCLA 63  </HEADLINE>
    By BETH HARRIS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Freshman Casey Jacobsen scored 12 of his 17 points over
the final 13 1/2 minutes and No. 2 Stanford beat UCLA 78-63 Thursday night, its
sixth straight victory over the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cardinal (18-1) maintained a share of first place in the Pac-10 with
Arizona at 7-1 and improved to 26-4 on the road over the last three seasons.
</P>
<P>
	   Except for a four-minute stretch in which UCLA whittled a 20-point deficit
to eight points, the Bruins (12-7, 3-5) hardly put up a fight in losing their
third straight to Stanford at Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite 23 turnovers, Stanford shot 55 percent and controlled the boards
37-23, including a 24-12 edge on the defensive end. The Cardinal set a school
record with four blocked shots, giving them 118 for the season, one better than
the record set in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
	   Jarron Collins added 15 points as five Stanford players reached double
figures.
</P>
<P>
	   Freshman Jason Kapono led UCLA with 21 points.
</P>
<P>
	   UCLA coach Steve Lavin earned a technical early in the second half and
moments later the Bruins found themselves trailing by 20 points.
</P>
<P>
	   But they livened up and outscored Stanford 17-5 to trail 49-41 with 13:31
remaining. Kapono had seven points in the spurt during which the Bruins stepped
up their defense and forced turnovers while finally making baskets.
</P>
<P>
	   Stanford wasn't on the ropes for long. Ryan Mendez hit one of its nine
3-pointers to start a game-ending 30-22 run and the Bruins never got within
single digits again.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cardinal controlled the first half, using a 23-10 run, including five
3-pointers, to take a 38-22 halftime lead. The Bruins shot just 35 percent and
missed all seven of their 3-point attempts.

<HEADLINE> Former Knight Ridder Chairman Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Lee Hills, a former chairman of publishing giant Knight Ridder
and a veteran reporter and editor whose aggressive stamp of journalism helped
The Miami Herald win its first Pulitzer Prize, died Thursday. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
	   Hills had been hospitalized at the Miami Heart Institute and Medical Center
in Miami Beach for a digestive disorder. Doctors said the cause of death
appeared to be congestive heart failure.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Janet Reno, whose father was a police reporter who worked
with Hills at the Herald, lamented the loss.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He reported the news fairly and accurately,'' she said. ''(He) never
seemed to lose his faith in people and he treated all people as if they were
special, whether they were a 6-year-old or a 60-year-old attorney general.''
</P>
<P>
	   The two-time Pulitzer winner once ran the Herald and The Detroit Free Press
simultaneously. He took on organized crime and was largely responsible for the
Herald's tradition of investigative journalism.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A newspaper is a very local, a very special business, which is more than a
business,'' Hills once said, ``and we forget this at our peril.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hills helped forge the 1974 merger of Knight Newspapers Inc. and Ridder
Publications Inc. He was the first chairman and chief executive of the fledgling
newspaper group that then had the nation's largest circulation.
</P>
<P>
	   He retired as editorial chairman in 1981.
</P>
<P>
	   An influential philanthropist, Hills also served as a trustee of the
Miami-based John S. and James L. Knight Foundation and was active in the
Inter-American Press Association, serving as its president from 1987-88.
</P>
<P>
	   Born on a farm near Granville, N.D., Hills had his first newspaper job at
14, in Price, Utah, for $6 per week.
</P>
<P>
	   He later spent a year at Brigham Young University, then took graduate
courses at the University of Missouri before earning a law degree from Oklahoma
City University at the age of 29.
</P>
<P>
	   By then, Hills was a reporter for The Oklahoma News. After moves to The
Cleveland Press and The Indianapolis Times, Hills returned to The Oklahoma News
at age 32, the youngest editor of a metropolitan newspaper in the country.
Stints then followed at Scripps-Howard newspapers in Memphis, Tenn., and
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
	   John S. Knight, publisher of The Akron Beacon-Journal, met Hills in 1942 and
offered him the job of city editor with The Miami Herald.
</P>
<P>
	   Knight, who died in 1981, once described Hills this way: ``No newspaperman I
have known has ever possessed the sum of Lee Hills' qualities of judgment,
wisdom, energy, perseverance, and genuine feel of people.''
</P>
<P>
	   A crafty businessman, Hills forged a news-first, advertising-second strategy
during World War II that helped the Herald become the dominant newspaper in
postwar south Florida. He insisted that the paper devote considerable resources
to ensure coverage of Latin America.
</P>
<P>
	   He also pushed for the creation of Miami's cultural arts plaza.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There were so many facets to the man,'' said his wife, Tina. ``He had so
many interests. He was a community leader, an art lover. But he always said that
the best thing was to be a reporter, and a good one. That was his love.''
</P>
<P>
	   He won a Pulitzer Prize in 1956 for local reporting in Detroit during tense
negotiations between automakers and the auto workers union. At the time, he was
serving as executive editor of both the Herald and the Free Press.
</P>
<P>
	   But Hills later said he was ``prouder'' of the Pulitzer awarded to the
Herald in 1951 for meritorious public service. The work stemmed from Hills'
realization that, in his words, ``the big shots of organized crime also moved
here for the winter. It was their safe haven.''
</P>
<P>
	   With that thought in mind, the paper launched its ``Know Your Neighbor''
series about south Florida mobsters, publishing pictures of their mansions,
limousines and yachts.
</P>
<P>
	   The project helped pave the way in 1950 for the Kefauver congressional
hearings on organized crime.
</P>
<P>
	   Hills is survived by his wife and a son, Ronald Lee Hills. A memorial
service was scheduled for Monday at the Church of the Little Flower in Coral
Gables.

	   STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- Bethany Donaphin scored 17 of her 21 points in the
second half and Lauren St. Clair went 5-for-5 from 3-point range as Stanford
pulled away to beat No. 15 UCLA 83-68 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Clair finished with 17 points and Jamie Carey added 16 for the Cardinal
(13-5, 6-2 Pac-10), who pulled into a first-place tie with UCLA (12-6, 6-2) in
the Pac-10. Carey made four 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
	   It was Stanford's fourth victory in five games against ranked teams this
season.
</P>
<P>
	   Michelle Greco had 26 points to lead the Bruins, who lost their second
straight after winning seven in a row. Marie Philman and Nicole Kaczmarski added
14 points apiece.
</P>
<P>
	   UCLA's leading scorer, Maylana Martin, was in foul trouble much of the night
and had just one point in 28 minutes. She came in averaging 16.8 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Up by seven at the break, the Cardinal took control with a 12-5 run to start
the second half. Carolyn Moos, who had 11 points, began the flurry with a layup
and Carey and St. Clair each hit 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
	   Greco made two baskets and LaCresha Flannigan drove for a layup as UCLA
fought to keep it close but Donaphin and Milena Flores, who had nine assists,
got Stanford going again.
</P>
<P>
	   With Stanford leading 52-40, Flores launched a halfcourt pass to Donaphin
underneath the basket for a layup as part of a 10-2 burst that carried the
Cardinal to a 20-point lead with 9:24 left. St. Clair punctuated the flurry with
another 3-pointer and Donaphin added a putback as Stanford maintained a
double-digit lead the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cardinal led 36-29 at halftime, scoring the last six points of the
period after a putback by Janae Hubbard pulled the Bruins to within a point. The
closing burst included two free throws by Carey after the UCLA bench complained
about a walking call and was hit with a technical foul.
</P>
<P>
	   Half of Stanford's points in the opening period came on its six 3-pointers
with Carey and St. Clair each hitting three.

<P>
    CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- Eric Daze scored twice, including the tying goal
with 9.7 seconds left, to give the Chicago Blackhawks a 5-5 tie Thursday night
with the Calgary Flames.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Sullivan, Boris Mironov and Sylvain Cote also scored for Chicago.
Former Calgary center Michael Nylander had four assists.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff Shantz, Bill Lindsay, Phil Housley, Jason Wiemer and Valeri Bure scored
for Calgary, winless in its last five (0-4-1).
</P>
<P>
	   Daze's tying goal came when Boris Mironov picked off a clearing attempt by
Flames defenseman Bobby Dollas. Mironov's shot was stopped by goalie
Jean-Sebastien Giguere, but Daze banged in the rebound for his 21st of the
season.
</P>
<P>
	   Bure had the best chance in overtime, but Jocelyn Thibault stopped him and
then stacked his pads to stop the rebound.
</P>
<P>
	   Housley's goal, his first in 11 games, was the 310th of his career. Housley
is tied with Denis Potvin for third place on the career list for goals by a
defenseman.
</P>
<P>
	   Chicago led 3-0 after the first period, but the Flames took a 5-4 lead early
in the third.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiemer outmuscled Mironov for the puck behind the Blackhawks net and fed
Bure, who had the puck deflect in off his skate to tie the game 4-4 at 1:59 of
the third.
</P>
<P>
	   Less than two minutes later, Wiemer gave the Flames the lead on a breakaway
off a long pass from Dollas.
</P>
<P>
	   Chicago took a 3-0 lead in the first period with the line of Sullivan,
Nylander and Daze accounting for all three goals.
</P>
<P>
	   Giguere replaced Fred Brathwaite to start the second period and stopped 20
of the 22 shots he faced.
</P>
<P>
	   Jocelyn Thibault finished with 39 saves.

<HEADLINE> Blues 5, Canucks 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Dave Ellett scored his first goal in
more than two years and the St. Louis Blues beat the Vancouver Canucks for the
12th straight time, 5-2 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blues won their fifth straight and assured themselves of first place in
the Western Conference going into this weekend's NHL All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
	   All-Star defenseman Al MacInnis returned to the St. Louis lineup after
missing just five games because of a collapsed right lung.
</P>
<P>
	   MacInnis, who is scheduled to make his 11th All-Star appearance in Toronto
this weekend, got a regular shift and did not record a point.
</P>
<P>
	   Ellett, who snapped a 2-2 tie at the 12:02 mark of the second period, had
gone 123 games without a goal, dating back to Dec. 28, 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Eastwood, Lubos Bartecko, Stephane Richer and Marty Reasoner also
scored as the Blues remained unbeaten against Vancouver since Dec. 15, 1996.
Over that stretch, the Blues have defeated the Canucks seven straight times in
Vancouver and, have outscored them 55-16 overall.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blues also continued their domination over Canadian-based franchises
this season, improving to 13-0-2.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter Schaefer and Adrian Aucoin scored for the Canucks, who lost their
third straight and are 1-7-2 in their last 10 games.
</P>
<P>
	   With the Blues trailing 2-1, Richer scored after being set up alone in the
slot by Eastwood's pass 3:19 into the second period.
</P>
<P>
	   Ellett then scored on a bit of a fluke nine minutes later. Just as a
Vancouver penalty came to an end, Ellett slapped a rolling puck at the net from
the left circle. The shot bounced off the post and, while the puck was stopped
in the crease for a moment, was accidentally kicked over the line by Canucks
goalie Garth Snow.
</P>
<P>
	   Eastwood's shorthanded goal 22 seconds into the third period deflated the
Canucks, who are now 2-17-1 when trailing after two periods.

Court Prevents Ala. Execution
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   ATMORE, Ala. (AP) -- The U.S. Supreme Court granted a stay of execution
Thursday to an Alabama death row inmate who had claimed that death by
electrocution constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. In his petition, Robert
Lee Tarver Jr. challenged Alabama's use of the electric chair to execute
inmates, saying it violates his Eighth Amendment right against cruel and unusual
punishment. The brief order prevented Tarver, 52, from being executed in the
state's electric chair at Holman Prison at 12:01 a.m. Friday.

Clinton Asks To Help Preserve Tropics
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saying too many of the world's life forms are threatened
by logging and deforestation, President Clinton is asking Congress for $150
million to help preserve tropical forests in developing nations. The president's
budget plan for fiscal 2001 sets aside $150 million for a Greening the Globe
initiative to help more than 60 countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America
conserve forests that are home to a diverse range of life forms -- and that are
now threatened by logging or other activities. That figure represents an 88
percent increase over funding in the current budget. The White House planned to
announced the initiative Friday.

	   PORT HUENEME, Calif. (AP) -- Searchers found the tail of Alaska Airlines
Flight 261 and recovered the flight data recorder Thursday, two pieces key to
determining why the jetliner plummeted into the ocean. Underwater robots
exploring the ocean floor found where the wreckage came to rest after the MD-83
crashed Monday, killing all 88 aboard. A submersible sent up video images of a
piece of the fuselage with four windows, several large pieces up to six feet
wide and numerous smaller pieces. The airline's logo -- the smiling face of an
Alaskan Eskimo -- is clearly visible on the tail, said John Hammerschmidt, a

officials said the oil came from Iran. The Pentagon said the commercial ship is
to be diverted to a yet-to-be-determined anchorage in international waters and

has applauded aspects of Nazi Germany and who campaigned on an anti-immigrant
platform. The prospect of Haider's Freedom Party in government prompted about
2,000 protesters to take to the streets of Vienna late Thursday for a second

<HEADLINE> More power to the president, a tweaking from Republicans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. (AP) - The most powerful man in the world apparently
needs more power.
<P>
	   Old House Lane in Chappaqua, where President Clinton and Hillary Rodham
Clinton recently bought a $1.7 million home, was all torn up Thursday as Con
Edison upgraded the electric service.
</P>
<P>
	   A 14-inch trench was dug across the entire road and plastic pipe was laid to
carry new electrical cables. A new transformer had been installed at the bottom
of the street. Con Ed vehicles blocked all traffic and a Secret Service agent in
a trench coat stood among the hard-hatted workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Con Ed spokeswoman Joy Faber said the upgrade was not just for the president
and would provide "additional capacity to all the households in the Old House
Lane area."
</P>
<P>
	   The company - which means, eventually, all the company's ratepayers - is
footing the bill "because it's part of an infrastructure improvement," Faber
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ---
</P>
<P>
	   The man who leased his Chappaqua house to the Secret Service so agents could
bunk near the Clintons says the federal watchdogs were sharp negotiators.
</P>
<P>
	   "They actually got a great deal," said Michael Merchant of Manhattan. "They
knew how to negotiate. They're certainly looking after the taxpayers' money."
</P>
<P>
	   Merchant, a stockbroker, and his wife bought the house at 41 Overlook Drive
in October for $857,000. It was just after they settled on the house that
President and Hillary Rodham Clinton began looking at a bigger house nearby.
</P>
<P>
	   Merchant said he's never met the Clintons "and we certainly didn't buy the
house to benefit the Clintons."
</P>
<P>
	   But because they didn't plan to move to Chappaqua until next school year,
"We needed a tenant and my father suggested writing to the Secret Service,"
Merchant said. "They contacted us and turned out to be extremely upstanding
individuals."
</P>
<P>
	   Merchant would not reveal the terms of the lease. Real estate agents have
estimated the market value rent at $5,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
	   ---
</P>
<P>
	   There's an offer of a tax break somewhere in a letter sent to the Clintons
by the chairman of the Westchester County Republican Committee, but they'll have
to read through a lot of GOP rhetoric to find it.
</P>
<P>
	   Chairman Jim Cavanaugh said he wanted to make sure the first family takes
advantage of New York's School Tax Relief (STAR) Program, a property tax cut. In
his letter, which was accompanied by an application, he said they could save
about $1,500 a year. Last year, the property tax bill for the house was
$26,051.04.
</P>
<P>
	   But first Cavanaugh welcomed the Clintons to New York, "a far more
prosperous, safer and exciting place to live than ever in our remarkable
history, thanks in large part to the dynamic leadership of our great governor,
George Pataki, and the best mayor New York City has ever had, Rudolph Giuliani."
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki and Giuliani are Republicans, and Giuliani is expected to be Mrs.
Clinton's opponent for the U.S. Senate. Cavanaugh called the Clinton's move
"transparent" - to fit Hillary Clinton's Senate ambitions. And in an interview
he said of his letter: "This just seemed to be a natural way to stick it to them
a little."
</P>
<P>
	   The property tax bill on the house, by the way, is more than the $22,545
Clintons paid in Arkansas in 1998 for all state and local taxes combined,
including income taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   ---
</P>
<P>
	   Some people managed to move into Chappaqua last month unaccompanied by
television cameras and bomb-sniffing dogs.
</P>
<P>
	   Lisa and Rob Augustinos used the same movers as the Clintons, and their
house is also a white Dutch Colonial. But they're Republicans, their house cost
$1 million less and Rob Augustinos is only joking when he says, "Yes, we also
had to turn some neighbors with welcoming gifts away because of security
concerns."

<HEADLINE> Oklahoma Gov. Apologizes for Remark  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Gov. Frank Keating has apologized for joking that the
best way deal with the state teachers union is ``homicide.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``While my comment was made in jest, it could be misunderstood by those who
were not in attendance. I recognize that my comment could offend and I apologize
to anyone who may have been offended,'' he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, during a speech at Oral Roberts University, the governor was
asked what he considered the best way to deal with the union. He paused and
grinned and said, ``Homicide.''
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the Oklahoma Education Association said the remark was
inappropriate, particularly in light of the shootings that have plagued the
nation's schools, including one at a Fort Gibson school in December.
</P>
<P>
	   At first, the governor, who is known for making brash remarks, refused to
apologize for ``blushes'' he makes in office. A spokesman said it was obvious
the OEA ``doesn't have a sense of humor.''

<HEADLINE> Britain May Suspend Belfast Cabinet  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Their options narrowing and patience
wearing thin, the British and Irish governments are demanding an Irish
Republican Army commitment to disarm within days -- or else Northern Ireland's
Protestant-Catholic administration will be suspended.
</P>
<P>
	   The prime ministers of Britain and Ireland, Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern,
spent two hours in an emergency meeting late Thursday discussing how best to
defend the 1998 Good Friday peace accord and its key institution, the
power-sharing Cabinet formed just nine weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
	   Afterward, side by side, they voiced the same message.
</P>
<P>
	   The question of when, if ever, the IRA will disarm ``has to be confronted
once and for all,'' Ahern said.
</P>
<P>
	   A report Monday by an independent disarmament commission confirmed that its
past two months of secret contacts with IRA negotiators had achieved no concrete
progress.
</P>
<P>
	   The verdict has shaken the foundations of the Cabinet, a four-party
coalition that requires the province's major British Protestant party, the
Ulster Unionists, to work with the IRA-linked Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
	   Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble says his party will withdraw,
collapsing the Cabinet, unless the Cabinet's powers are rescinded pending an IRA
arms move.
</P>
<P>
	   The British government has responded, calculating that a Cabinet rendered
powerless might still be kept intact, whereas a collapsed one might never be
reassembled.
</P>
<P>
	   Announcing his plans to present legislation today to return ``direct rule''
to London, Britain's Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson urged the Ulster
Unionists to wait and see whether the IRA would shift its position.
</P>
<P>
	   He said it would take about a week for the bill to pass through Parliament,
then would be enacted ``unless events between now and then clearly make this
unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
	   In November, after a year of deadlock, American diplomat George Mitchell
persuaded the Ulster Unionists to form the Cabinet in exchange for assurances
that the IRA would gradually give up its weapons stockpiles in response. The
Good Friday accord anticipated the IRA's total disarmament by May.
</P>
<P>
	   Sinn Fein gave the impression this would happen, announcing that disarmament
was now ``essential,'' and the IRA opened talks with the disarmament commission.
The deal specified that the commission should report progress in January.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandelson said it was ``deeply clear ... that if there was no (weapons)
decommissioning in January then the Ulster Unionists would be unable to sustain
their involvement in the Executive (Cabinet). There was no ambiguity about
that.''
</P>
<P>
	   He called the IRA's position ``simply unacceptable, and a betrayal of the
entire community in Northern Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
	   The turn of events put Sinn Fein leaders firmly on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
	   They responded angrily, accusing other major players in the peace process --
the British government, the Ulster Unionists and the major Catholic-supported
party, the pacifist Social Democratic and Labor Party or SDLP -- of all
violating the letter of the Good Friday accord.
</P>
<P>
	   Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams accused Mandelson of being ``prepared to cave
into the demands of the unionists'' and of dealing ``a slap in the face to the
Sinn Fein leadership.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the SDLP's Mark Durkan, finance minister in the Cabinet, said Sinn Fein
and the IRA appeared determined that everybody else should fulfill their
obligations within the accord -- but didn't apply the same standard to
themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We all want the administration to survive. Equally we want the disarmament
commission to be successful in achieving decommissioning,'' Durkan said. ``We're
not going to get one without the other. And everyone should be deeply concerned
that the commission has reported a failure on the IRA's part.''

<HEADLINE> Computer upgrades would cost up to $75 million  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Seven months after Gov. John G. Rowland dropped
his $1.5 billion plan to privatize the state's computer system, he's joining
Comptroller Nancy Wyman's push for a much less expensive upgrade.
<P>
	   During a news conference Thursday, Wyman and Rowland said they could get the
job done for between $60 million and $75 million.
</P>
<P>
	   While outside vendors will be needed to get the new system in place during
the next three years, the new plan is a far cry from privatization.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believe we could do most everything in-house with our state employees,"
Wyman said.
</P>
<P>
	   In June, Rowland scrapped his privatization plan, saying he was not
convinced that better service could be guaranteed if the state turned its
operations over to Texas-based Electronic Data Systems Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Wyman and state workers had opposed the 7-year plan, which they said would
not meet efficiency targets and could cost state jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's no secret that the governor and I had a little disagreement last
summer over how to handle this issue," Wyman said. "But even though we differed
on the solution, the governor and I always agreed on the scope of the problem."
</P>
<P>
	   Under the new proposal, the state plans to upgrade accounting, payroll and
personnel tracking systems. Wyman said the new system will allow the state to
track how tax dollars are spent and make it easier for companies to do business
with the state.
</P>
<P>
	   The upgrade will affect every state agency.
</P>
<P>
	   "We will be replacing the complicated maze we have now with a simple,
integrated system that will deliver services in a more effective and efficient
manner," Wyman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rowland wants to use about $8 million of the state's $240 million surplus to
start the upgrades.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we have more surplus dollars throughout the year, we perhaps could use
more of that this year or next year," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The bulk of the remaining costs - including buying software and hardware,
system setup and training - would be paid for through bonding, Rowland said.
</P>
<P>
	   That spending plan likely will win approval in the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
	   "The price tag is pretty impressively low," said Senate President Pro
Tempore Kevin Sullivan. "It's a perfectly legitimate expenditure out of the
surplus."

<HEADLINE> Judge to rule on motions in Michael Ross case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW LONDON, Conn. (AP) - A Superior Court judge has been asked to decide
whether prosecutors can see the videotaped competency evaluation of serial
killer Michael Ross.
<P>
	   Judge Thomas Miano held a hearing Thursday in an attempt to set final terms
for Ross' new penalty hearing, which is scheduled to begin Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
	   A jury will decide whether Ross should be executed or sentenced to life in
prison for killing four young women in Eastern Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
	   Ross has received life sentences for killing two other young women in
Connecticut and has admitted to killing two others in New York, although he has
not been prosecuted for them.
</P>
<P>
	   Miano granted defense lawyers' request to have the Most Rev. Daniel Hart,
Bishop of Norwich, to testify about his knowledge of Ross' character and
background through their correspondence.
</P>
<P>
	   Miano, however, said Hart's testimony about the church's opinion of the
death penalty and the concept of mercy was irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
	   Ross' lawyer, Karen Goodrow, said the testimony should be allowed because
Ross was baptized Catholic and was confirmed in prison. She said she would like
Hart's testimony to be on the record for appellate purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   Miano said he may reexamine the issue next week.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge also heard a prosecution request to see a videotaped competency
examination of Ross performed in 1995. Assistant State's Attorney Peter McShane
said prosecutors first learned of the tape last week.
</P>
<P>
	   The tape was made by Dr. Michael Norko, the director of the Whiting Forensic
Institute, for education and training purposes. Ross signed a waiver to allow
the tape to be shown to Norko's classes at Yale Medical School and to "officers
of the court", McShane said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know what's on it. I think we're entitled to review it," McShane
said. "The fact is everyone else has seen it but us."
</P>
<P>
	   Defense lawyer Barry Butler objected, saying the tape was made at a time
when Ross was representing himself and did not foresee a penalty hearing. Butler
said the waiver does not allow the tape to be released to anyone other than
people in medical, legal or mental health training.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're fishing," Butler said of prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   Miano did not immediately rule on the request.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge said he would allow testimony from a defense expert about a brain
abnormality in Ross, over the state's arguments that there is no proof Ross
suffered the abnormality when he killed the women.
</P>
<P>
	   The expert, psychiatrist James Merikangas, said tests show Ross' cerebellum
is smaller than average. Other parts of his brain show signs of the loss or
shrinkage of brain tissue, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Miano also agreed to consider arguments about the meaning of Supreme Court
rulings on the death penalty, especially a December ruling in the case of
Sedrick Cobb. The dispute centers on the state's burden to prove the killer's
specific intent.
</P>
<P>
	   On direction of the state Supreme Court in an appeal prosecutors brought in
October, Miano reversed his previous ruling on the rules the prosecution must
follow in presenting evidence at the penalty hearing. The rules now will be the
same for the prosecution and the defense.

<HEADLINE> Plane Has Cabin Pressure Trouble  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A flight from Los Angeles to San Jose had trouble
controlling cabin pressure Thursday, forcing a drop in altitude and the
deployment of passenger oxygen masks, an airport spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   No one was hurt and the passengers were able to breathe on their own. But
some of the 75 passengers were shaken up by the problems with Shuttle by United
flight 2622, spokesman Jim Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
	   The problem occurred about 20 minutes before landing. To cope, pilots
brought the plane down to 10,000 feet from its cruising altitude of about 32,000
feet.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane landed safely in San Jose, where engineers were trying to
determine what caused the problem.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane was a Boeing 737.

<HEADLINE> Salmonella Illness From Eggs Drops  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ATLANTA (AP) -- The rate of salmonella from eating raw or undercooked eggs
dropped by more than one-third between 1996 and 1998, according to government
researchers who credited better safety measures.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said safer egg
production and preparation were behind the drop.
</P>
<P>
	   "We see this as a triumph of a collaborative effort between CDC, state
health departments, industry, commercial food preparers and consumers," said Dr.
David Swerdlow, a CDC epidemiologist.
</P>
<P>
	   For reasons not fully understood, the rate of a type of salmonella illness
associated with raw or undercooked eggs soared in the 1980s and '90s from 0.6
cases per 100,000 people in 1976 to 3.6 in 1996. But the rate dropped to 2.2 per
100,000 from 1996 to 1998, the CDC said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   In the late 1980s, health officials began a push to educate people about the
dangers of raw or undercooked eggs.
</P>
<P>
	   Symptoms of salmonella illness include nausea, diarrhea, fever, abdominal
cramps and chills. The illness can be fatal for infants, the elderly and those
with weakened immune systems.
</P>
<P>
	   The CDC estimates that 600 people die from the illness each year.

<HEADLINE> Convicted Dallas Councilman Quits  </HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN PARROTT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DALLAS (AP) -- A Dallas city councilman convicted on federal bribery and
conspiracy charges is resigning to fight the conviction.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Although I know in my heart that I have never allowed the money and other
gifts I have received from friends and supporters over the years to mar my
judgment in any way, I see now that people simply cannot accept what I know to
be the honest truth,'' Al Lipscomb said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   An Amarillo jury last month convicted the 74-year-old civil rights activist
of 65 counts of conspiracy and bribery. Prosecutors argued that he accepted
monthly payments of $1,000 and other gifts from Yellow Cab Co. owner Floyd
Richards in exchange for voting in the company's favor on taxi-related issues.
</P>
<P>
	   While Lipscomb has maintained his innocence, he admitted during the two-week
trial that he failed to report cash and gifts on campaign finance reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Lipscomb's lawyers had urged him to resign the council position he has held
for all but two of the past 16 years.
</P>
<P>
	   They feared U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall would otherwise put Lipscomb
behind bars pending his April 10 sentencing. A detention hearing is set for
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney Tom Melsheimer said Thursday he will fight to keep Lipscomb out of
prison while he asks the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for a new trial. He
said Lipscomb deserves a new trial because Kendall acted wrongly in moving the
proceedings 300 miles to Amarillo.
</P>
<P>
	   A special election for Lipscomb's seat was planned for May 6. His successor
would serve the rest of Lipscomb's two-year term, which expires in June 2001.

<HEADLINE> Couple in Spy Ring Sentenced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A couple have been sentenced to more than three years in prison
for attempting to infiltrate U.S. military installations for the Cuban
government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I ask forgiveness from this country for all the opportunities it gave me
and for what I've done,'' said Amarylis Silverio Santos, 37, who was given a 3
1/2-year sentence Wednesday. Her husband, 38-year-old Joseph Santos, was
sentenced to four years.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, 14 people were accused of trying to penetrate U.S. military bases,
infiltrate anti-Castro exile groups and manipulate U.S. media and political
organizations. Authorities describe the spy ring as the largest Cuban espionage
operation uncovered in the United States in decades.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said the couple attempted to infiltrate the U.S. Southern
Command, which controls U.S. military activity in Latin America. Although State
Department officials have said their efforts were largely unsuccessful, the
couple filed at least one report.
</P>
<P>
	   They pleaded guilty in October 1998 to one count each of conspiracy to act
as an agent for a foreign government without notifying the U.S. attorney
general. They faced a maximum of five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Three others besides the couple have pleaded guilty; others are scheduled to
go on trial in May.

<HEADLINE> EU Sanctions To Start for Austria  </HEADLINE>
   By PAUL AMES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Union has set unprecedented political
sanctions to isolate one of its own member nations the moment a new government
including a far-right party takes office in Austria.
</P>
<P>
	   The measures against Austria are to kick in automatically today once the
government with its Freedom Party ministers is sworn in, said Portuguese Prime
Minister Antonio Guterres, whose country holds the EU's rotating presidency.
</P>
<P>
	   The EU's unusually strong move reflects deep concern provoked by Freedom
Party leader Joerg Haider, who has in the past expressed sympathy with aspects
of Nazism and has opposed EU enlargement into eastern Europe, saying it could
spark a new wave of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A whole range of values which underpin our civilization are at stake,''
Guterres said in Lisbon on Thursday. ``We will pay maximum attention to the
actions of the Austrian government.''
</P>
<P>
	   Under the sanctions, ministers from the other 14 members will halt all
bilateral contacts with their Austrian counterparts. Austrian ministers will
still be able to take their seats at the Union's regular meetings, but will be
frozen out of backroom negotiations that are often vital for forging consensus
within the European bloc.
</P>
<P>
	   Austrian ambassadors in EU capitals will be shunned for all except
``technical talks'' and no EU nation will support Austrian candidates proposed
for international posts.
</P>
<P>
	   The measures were agreed Monday by the other 14 EU nations in a break with
their traditional stance of non-interference in each other's internal politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Haider on Thursday signed a declaration renouncing Austria's Nazi
past and promised to respect European values, Austria's EU partners remained
unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
	   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said Haider's views didn't have ``any
place in the modern Europe that we are trying to create,'' the British
Broadcasting Corp. reported.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The naked appeal to xenophobia on which Mr. Haider has based his platform
on which he has sought votes and which he continues to peddle is something that
strikes against the basis of the European Union,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
	   The European Parliament cautioned Austria's very participation in the EU
could be suspended if the new government fails to respect democracy and human
rights.
</P>
<P>
	   The warning and a condemnation of Haider was passed 406 to 53 by the EU
assembly just before Austria's President Thomas Klestil reluctantly approved the
government coalition comprising ministers from the Freedom Party and the
conservative Austrian People's Party.
</P>
<P>
	   The EU assembly condemned ``all the insulting, xenophobic and racist
statements issued by (Haider) over many years.''
</P>
<P>
	   If Austria fails to uphold the Union's founding principles, the parliament
urged the other 14 EU nations to ``suspend that state's rights'' under the
Union's founding treaty -- a move that would effectively exclude Austria from
participating in EU decision-making.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the EU treaty, member governments with the backing of the European
Parliament can suspend the voting rights of any nation guilty of ``a serious or
persistent breach'' of ``the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human
rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
	   Such a move would be unprecedented in the EU's 43-year history.
</P>
<P>
	   European governments were already making good their threat to cut ties with
Austria.
</P>
<P>
	   French Defense Minister Alain Richard postponed a meeting with Austria on
European defense, Danish diplomats pulled out of a dinner scheduled today by the
Austrian embassy in Copenhagen, and Portuguese President Jorge Sampaio was
expected to cancel a visit to Austria.

<HEADLINE> Media, Rebels Spar in Colombia  </HEADLINE>
   By JARED KOTLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- The kidnapping of a television news executive,
apparently by leftist rebels, has opened a new battle front in the South
American country's long-running civil conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   A dispute between Colombia's media and its main guerrilla group is
escalating, with journalists complaining the rebels don't respect press freedoms
and rebels countering that the media are biased against them.
</P>
<P>
	   Manuel Marulanda, the reclusive founder and chief of the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia, or FARC, accused the media of defaming his group in a bid to
undermine government-rebel peace talks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We continue to receive poor treatment on your part, including labels like
terrorists, kidnappers, assassins, human rights violators and drug
traffickers,'' Marulanda said in a letter faxed Wednesday to news organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   The missive marked the latest volley in a dispute that began Jan. 22 when
armed men abducted 73-year-old Guillermo ``Scoop'' Cortes from his weekend home
outside Bogota.
</P>
<P>
	   Cortes, a longtime journalist and director of the editorial board of the
``Zero Hour'' news program, is a revered grandfather-figure in Colombian
journalism.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the FARC has not claimed responsibility for the kidnapping,
suspicion fell immediately on the group and the military says it intercepted
rebel radio communication confirm they hold Cortes.
</P>
<P>
	   Five days after Cortes' disappearance, the directors of all of the country's
leading newspapers, news magazines, and television and radio stations wrote the
FARC to denounce the kidnapping as ``an act of violence against freedom of the
press.''
</P>
<P>
	   The 47 executives said they were turning down invitations to attend a peace
ceremony last weekend in the rebel-held south -- although they sent reporters
anyway.
</P>
<P>
	   Mobbed by journalists just prior to Sunday's ceremony, Marulanda -- who is a
year or two younger than Cortes -- lashed out at the media.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They never tell the truth,'' said the chieftan dressed in combat fatigues,
adding cryptically -- and for some ominously -- that the FARC would soon be
``collecting on debts'' owed it by leading media figures.
</P>
<P>
	   Coming from the head of a 15,000-strong armed group, news organizations
interpreted Marulanda's words as a collective threat.
</P>
<P>
	   News stations and newspapers often use terms like ``subversives''
``criminals'' and ``anti-socials'' to describe the rebels, who have turned
increasingly to criminal methods like kidnapping and drug trafficking to finance
their insurgency. The guerrillas insist their fight is still political.
</P>
<P>
	   Colombia ranks second only to Algeria for the number of journalists killed
in the past decade, most by drug traffickers and suspected right-wing
paramilitary militias.
</P>
<P>
	   In his letter, Marulanda said he hadn't meant to issue a threat. But he
didn't soften his diatribe against the press, saying that during his group's
35-year struggle, the media has never done its part to help resolve Colombia's
social problems.
</P>
<P>
	   There's been no word on the fate of Cortes. In the military's radio
intercepts, two suspected rebels discuss Cortes' financial holdings. Most of
Colombia's nearly 3,000 annual kidnappings are for ransom.
</P>
<P>
	   After first claiming no knowledge of the kidnapping, Marulanda says he is
investigating whether a rebel unit may be holding Cortes.
</P>
<P>
	   Cecilia Orozco, news director for television's Channel 7, said the dispute
illustrates the rebels' isolation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They don't understand that for a journalist what's ethical is to publish
both sides' point of view,'' she said. ``They're a bit Stalinist in that
regard.''

<HEADLINE> AmericaOne Takes 4-3 Lead  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- The only pressure skipper Paul Cayard felt was
the kind that filled AmericaOne's sails. Now he needs just one more victory to
reach the America's Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
	Cayard, cool in his remarkable comeback from a 3-1 deficit, solved the fluky
breezes of the Hauraki Gulf, figuring the wind pressure on the right side would
be greater at the start, and led Prada after all six legs Friday.
</P>
<P>
	AmericaOne's 1-minute, 6-second victory was its third straight as it took a 4-3
lead in the best-of-9 challenger finals. The Italians never were in the race
after making the mistake of starting on the left side. Now they must win
Saturday or be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
	Cayard, an aggressive sailor, won't let up.
</P>
<P>
	``Why would we?'' he said. ``Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
	One more victory and Cayard can take aim at the next target, defending champion
New Zealand, in the best-of-9 finals starting Feb. 19 for sailing's top prize.
The Kiwis have been practicing with their two boats while the trials, which
began Oct. 18 with 11 potential challengers, have honed the skills of the crews
aboard AmericaOne and Prada.
</P>
<P>
	The Americans, under Cayard's strong leadership, have gotten better as the
series has progressed. Even when he had dinner with tactician John Kostecki with
AmericaOne trailing 3-1, Cayard remained confident.
</P>
<P>
	``We truly didn't even talk about yacht racing,'' Kostecki said. ``We were just
having some fun, relaxed. We're both winners and we knew we were going to come
back.''
</P>
<P>
	Prada skipper Francesco de Angelis better change something if Italy is to stay
in contention to win its first America's Cup. He kept his boat on the water
after Friday's loss, trying out a different mainsail.
</P>
<P>
	``We started racing in October so for the crews it's been a very long period,''
de Angelis said. ``I don't think anybody's thinking about getting any rest, just
think about the next two races.''
</P>
<P>
	Or one.
</P>
<P>
	AmericaOne has no reason to change after its best race of the series. Its crew
work was sharp. In the last four races, it has lead at 22 of 24 marks.
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to change much,'' Kostecki said. ``Things are going well so
we're just going to keep pushing hard.''
</P>
<P>
	AmericaOne led by a massive 2:31 halfway through the 18 1/2-mile race, then
sailed conservatively the rest of the way as Prada followed far astern.
</P>
<P>
	``A half hour before the start, there was more pressure to the left,'' Cayard
said. ``Once (the wind) filled, we really felt strong the wind would go right
and it went right about 10 degrees.''
</P>
<P>
	``We felt that by going all the way to the right we were playing AmericaOne's
game,'' Prada tactician Torben Grael said. ``You can't guess right all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, New Zealand swept Cayard's Young America 5-0 to win the Cup off San
Diego, only the second team from outside the United States to win the event
since it began in 1851. Its leader, Sir Peter Blake, said his current boats are
much faster than his last one.
</P>
<P>
	So is Cayard's.
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, he skippered Dennis Conner's Stars &AMP; Stripes to win the challenger
finals, then switched to the faster but still slow Young America. In 1992, he
was at the helm of Il Moro di Venezia of Italy, which lost the America's Cup
finals 4-1 to America3.
</P>
<P>
	Cayard also came back from a 3-1 deficit that year against New Zealand in the
challenger finals.
</P>
<P>
	``Like that saying goes, `we've seen this movie before,' and, hopefully, it's
going to play out the same way,'' said Cayard, representing San Francisco's St.
Francis Yacht Club.
</P>
<P>
	It didn't take long for Cayard to pull away on the first leg, a 3 1/4-mile trip
into the wind.
</P>
<P>
	The seventh race was postponed Thursday because of light wind. Prada didn't get
much of a push from Friday's breeze either, although the wind at the start was
16-17 knots from the southwest and ranged from 13 to 18 throughout the race.
</P>
<P>
	Cayard picked the right side and quickly took control as the wind was stronger
there.
</P>
<P>
	AmericaOne led by 1:19 after the first leg, a lead so huge that it maintained
control even though it broke a vang, a piece of equipment that holds down the
boom, early in the second leg, the first of three with the wind blowing from
behind.
</P>
<P>
	Prada gained six seconds on that leg, cutting the lead to 1:13.
</P>
<P>
	The parade continued in front of a flotilla of spectator boats as AmericaOne
again showed its superiority going upwind. It added 1:18 to its lead and reached
the midpoint of the race with a comfortable margin of 2:31.
</P>
<P>
	On the next downwind leg, Prada sliced off 20 seconds, then gained another 40
on the upwind leg. But with a final leg of just 3 1/4 miles left, Cayard still
led by 1:31.
</P>
<P>
	He calmly turned the wheel, his crew kept the sails trimmed and AmericaOne's
lime-green spinnaker billowed across the finish line. Some of its sailors looked
back at De Angelis, who still had a painfully long stretch of water to sail.

an 80-second span. Los Angeles recorded consecutive victories for the first time
since a three-game winning streak from Nov. 11-16.
</P>
<P>
	   Jozef Stumpel and Bryan Smolinski, both of whom had never scored against the
Red Wings, got goals 40 seconds apart during a four-goal second period.
</P>
<P>
	   All five players who scored for Los Angeles each had an assist as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Sergei Fedorov scored the first two goals for Detroit, one on a shorthanded
breakaway. Kirk Maltby also scored for the Red Wings and Larry Murphy had two
assists.
</P>
<P>
	   The Kings tied the score at 2 when Stumpel intercepted defenseman Chris
Chelios' pass and beat Chris Osgood between the pads with a 20-foot wrist shot
at 12:57 of the second, ending his 14-game drought against the Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
	   Smolinski snapped a personal 11-game dry spell against Detroit with a
25-footer from the slot after Murray set him up with a pass from behind the net.
Just 40 seconds later, Palffy set up Robitaille in the slot for his 25th goal of
the season, leaving him two behind Rocket Richard for 18th place on the career
goal list.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the 14th goal in 17 games for Robitaille, whose 14 seasons in the NHL
are the fewest among the league's top 42 career goal scorers. Mikita played 22
years for Chicago and Richard 18 for Montreal.
</P>
<P>
	   The Red Wings nearly scored a shorthanded goal 2 1/2 minutes into the game
during a roughing penalty against Chris Chelios, but Stephane Fiset made
back-to-back stops on Doug Brown and Steve Duchesne from close range.
</P>
<P>
	   Fedorov scored with the Wings a man short, however, beating Fiset to the
glove side on a breakaway at 17:42 of the first period during a high-sticking
penalty against Martin Lapointe.

<HEADLINE> Plane Has Cabin Pressure Trouble  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A flight from Los Angeles to San Jose had trouble
controlling cabin pressure Thursday, forcing a drop in altitude and the
deployment of passenger oxygen masks.
</P>
<P>
	   No one was hurt and the passengers were able to breathe on their own. But
some of the 75 passengers were shaken up by the problems with Shuttle by United
Shuttle Flight 2622, spokesman Jim Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Four reported earaches, United spokesman Kurt Ebenhoch said.
</P>
<P>
	   The problem occurred about 10:10 a.m., 20 minutes before landing and the
plane dropped its altitude to cope, although there are conflicting reports on
how far.
</P>
<P>
	   Peterson said the plane dropped to 10,000 feet from its cruising altitude of
about 32,000 feet. United spokesman Ebenhoch said the plane dropped to 8,000
feet from 25,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boeing 737 landed safely in San Jose, where engineers were trying to
determine what caused the problem.

<HEADLINE> Tractors Move Into the Space-Age  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL PEARSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARBONDALE, Ill. (AP) -- It sits in the corner of the yellow-and-green lab,
a cross between an inside joke and a technological marvel: the Stealth tractor.
</P>
<P>
	   On the surface much like any other lawn tractor, the Stealth is perhaps the
first tractor in the world made entirely of the materials used in military
fighters of the same name.
</P>
<P>
	   It's not that engineering professor Max Yen and his student assistants at
the John Deere Research Laboratory at Southern Illinois University are trying to
make tractors invisible to enemy radar.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the work is designed to evaluate materials that could make
agricultural tractors, lawn and garden equipment and other vehicles faster,
lighter, cheaper and more durable than their steel and aluminum cousins.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nothing runs like a Deere, now only better," Yen says.
</P>
<P>
	   Deere established the relationship with SIU in 1997, after Yen visited the
company's internal research lab at the invitation of a former student. The
school received nearly $200,000 in cash grants and equipment loans to set up the
lab and gets $25,000 annually for its continuing research -- including $10,000
for scholarships.
</P>
<P>
	   Since its inception, the lab has worked to test the suitability of
"composite materials" for use in the agricultural, lawn and construction
equipment made by Deere.
</P>
<P>
	   Composites are plastic-like materials made from differing quantities of
fiber, plastics and glue. For their weight, they are quite strong, Yen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Deere was already looking at composites when SIU joined the picture, Yen
said. In fact, the company designed and built the Stealth tractor as a test.
</P>
<P>
	   "They've done a lot in the last 10 years, and we've helped them," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Yen and his students at the lab -- which is painted in Deere's familiar
bright yellow and green color scheme -- use computers to create the virtual farm
fields used to test the structural properties of computerized tractors. They
also feed the bumps and ruts of real-life fields into a $200,000 machine on
which tractor bodies can be mounted and tested for stress.
</P>
<P>
	   The Stealth tractor, for instance, was tested the equivalent of 40 years of
use in less than one year. It passed its tests resoundingly, Yen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Yen sees a day when tractors, combines, cars and virtually all other ground
vehicles will be made from composites.
</P>
<P>
	   "A typical aluminum tractor might have several hundred parts. The Stealth
tractor, it has six. That's the difference we are talking about," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Deere spokesman Ken Golden said a panel on one of the company's new combines
is constructed from composite material made from soy polymers. That project did
not originate with research done at SIU but does show the company's interest in
polymers, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We know metals very well, but we need to understand polymers better," he
said. "There can be cost benefits. There can be strength benefits."
</P>
<P>
	   But don't look for the agricultural giant to start dropping metal tractors
from its catalogue anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've been making metal products for 168 years," he said. "It will be
awhile before that goes away."

<HEADLINE> White House Presses ATF Powers  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Stepping up pressure on the gun industry, President
Clinton is giving federal agents new powers to crack down on dealers and
pawnbrokers who sell a disproportionate number of the weapons used in crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was to release a report today that finds that a small number of gun
dealers are responsible for putting a large number of guns in the hands of
criminals.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms study shows 1 percent of gun
dealers accounts for 57 percent of guns the ATF can trace from use in a crime
back to the point the gun was sold, Clinton's deputy domestic policy adviser,
Eric Liu, said.
</P>
<P>
	   With that in mind, Liu said the administration will extend the ATF's powers
to check up on possible rogue dealers and trace stolen guns. The new powers,
which do not require congressional approval, include intense inspections of the
dealers most suspected of supplying criminals.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, a smaller number of suspect dealers will be required to provide
information on the sale of used guns in the same way they now compile data for
new guns.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the best thing that can be done, short of new laws ... given the
deadlock in Congress,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., one of the most
persistent voices in Congress for more gun control.
</P>
<P>
	   Schumer released two reports last year that also pointed to a relative
handful of suspected dealers as the source of many criminals' guns.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest study showed that in 1998, 1,020 of the nation's 83,272 licensed
gun dealers and pawnbrokers were each the source of at least 10 guns later
traced to crimes, and 132 dealers were linked to 50 or more such guns. Not all
the guns were sold directly by the suspect dealers -- some apparently were lost
or stolen and some passed through multiple hands before they were used in
crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's push for new gun control measures collapsed in Congress last year,
despite White House attempts to use public concern over the Columbine High
School gun massacre as leverage against the gun lobby.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House has pledged to renew the fight this year for trigger locks
on handguns and for new laws governing the sale of guns at flea market-style gun
shows.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House has also made little headway in its attempt to pressure the
gun industry to negotiate with cities suing over the cost of gun violence.
Representatives of both dealers and manufacturers met separately with White
House officials after the administration threatened in December to help bring a
national lawsuit, but neither side has had much to say since.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've been focused on trying to engage dealers and manufacturers who are
serious about changing the way they do business,'' Liu said. He would not
comment on whether the new ATF powers give the administration greater leverage
in those negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the National Rifle Association said the new rules are
pointless, because the government already has broad power to police dealers and
raid those suspected of criminal conduct.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration has failed to use existing laws to go after a
variety of gun crimes, NRA spokesman Bill Powers said. He called today's
announcements political posturing intended to benefit the presidential campaign
of Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is like the standard political strategy -- when you're not doing
something, have a press conference and make it look like you're doing
something,'' Powers said.
</P>
<P>
	   The ATF regulations will also target dealers who refuse to cooperate when
the agency asks for information on the sale of guns later traced to crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``While the majority of gun dealers are law-abiding businesspeople who
recognize the importance of helping law enforcement identify gun criminals,
today's report shows the need to focus resources on the relatively small number
of dealers and pawnbrokers who are the source of most of the traced crime
guns,'' a White House statement said.

<HEADLINE> Bauer Dropping Out of GOP Race  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gary Bauer, stung by his last-place finish in the New
Hampshire GOP primary and unable to break through the pack of Republicans, is
dropping out of the presidential race, an official close to the conservative
activist said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm a fighter, but I'm not delusional,'' Bauer said Tuesday after getting
just 1 percent of the vote in New Hampshire's critical leadoff presidential
primary.
</P>
<P>
	   His campaign scheduled a news conference for this morning. Spokesman Tim
Goeglein would not give further details.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer, who would be the sixth Republican to drop out, leaves a field of four
still battling for the GOP presidential nomination: Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
Sen. John McCain of Arizona, publisher Steve Forbes and former ambassador Alan
Keyes.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer ran as a social conservative, denouncing abortion and gay rights, but
he was competing with Forbes and Keyes for the votes of Christian conservatives
and was never able to break out. He finished fourth in the Iowa caucuses Jan.
24, just ahead of McCain, who did not campaign there, and Sen. Orrin Hatch of
Utah, who dropped out soon after.
</P>
<P>
	   The son of a janitor, Bauer aimed his appeal at ordinary Americans,
frequently mentioning his humble roots. ``I'm used to having bills last 'til
Friday when the paycheck only lasted until Thursday,'' he said in a debate last
fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer worked for President Reagan, first in the Education Department and
then as domestic policy adviser at the White House, and often invoked the former
president's image in his campaign literature and rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
	   Before running for president, Bauer was head of the Family Research Council,
an influential conservative group based in Washington. Under his leadership the
council came to rival the Christian Coalition as the voice of grass-roots
conservative activism in American politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer campaigned on moral issues. He denounced state court decisions in
support of gay rights, promised to ``end abortion on demand'' as president, and
railed against Clinton administration policy with China -- urging that it revoke
normal trade status for China and adopt a foreign policy that ``embraces our
most basic human values.''
</P>
<P>
	   He had some success raising money, taking in about $7 million, primarily
through a large network of small donors built during his work as an activist in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   But his bank account fell far short of Bush's record $68.7 million take and
McCain's $13.6 million -- not to mention Forbes' estimated $400 million personal
fortune, which he willingly has dipped into to finance his longshot campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush leads the remaining Republicans in national polls, but is battling a
strong challenge from McCain, who handily won the New Hampshire primary. Forbes
needs a primary win soon to maintain viability. Keyes performed well in Iowa and
New Hampshire, but is not likely to pose a challenge for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Other Republicans who dropped out of the race are Hatch, Lamar Alexander,
Elizabeth Dole, John Kasich and former Vice President Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley are the
two major Democratic presidential candidates.

<HEADLINE> Bradley, Gore Sharpen Differences  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- With the primary electorate now broadened, Democratic
rivals Al Gore and Bill Bradley are sharpening their differences in what they
describe as ``a fresh start'' in the fight for the presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Both were campaigning in California and were crisscrossing the country,
trying to make up lost ground in the giant round of state voting March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   In San Francisco, Bradley ripped into Vice President Gore on abortion,
health care and campaign finance issues, sharpening differences before an
electorate that's different than in states that started the ball rolling with
key early contests.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You'll certainly see more of that, there's a lot at stake here,'' Bradley
said.
</P>
<P>
	   He dismissed suggestions that he was attacking Gore in a negative manner.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not saying anything that's untrue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, who went to Olympia, Wash., after an earlier stop in California, took
credit for the strong economy and attempted to link Bradley and the GOP
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore said the country's deepest recession since 1930s happened while
Republicans were in charge and that their candidates want to return to the
Reagan-Bush approach ``that failed so miserably in the past.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Senator Bradley supported the slashing budget cuts that President Reagan
proposed in 1981. I think that was a mistake,'' Gore continued. ``I think that
hurt the state of Washington and I think it was wrong to do it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, at a digital effects firm in southern California, Gore tried to
illustrate his argument that Bradley was shortchanging the education issue.
Digital Domain, producer of special effects in the movie, ``Titanic,'' is having
a hard time finding specialized workers. Gore said education -- and his
education proposals -- can solve that.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Bradley has no comprehensive education plan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is not a priority in his campaign or in his platform. It is the No. 1
priority for me,'' said Gore, who pitched his 10-year, $115 billion investment
in school modernization, college tuition aid and teacher training.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley has worked proposals for new teachers, after-school programs and
early childhood education -- $90 billion in new spending over 10 years -- into
anti-poverty and working-family aid packages.
</P>
<P>
	   Back in San Francisco, Bradley highlighted his proposal for near universal
health care, saying Gore merely ``nibbles around the edges'' on the issue. He
also repeated his claim that Gore misrepresents his record in saying he has
always supported abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore had anti-abortion views as a Tennessee congressman, but insists he is
now staunchly pro-choice.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That is just factually incorrect, and I think that raises a credibility
issue,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   In hammering on the abortion issue, Bradley also courts women voters who are
important in states like California. Bradley said he would raise the issue
repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
	   While the charges have been made before, the exchange is significant because
it's now reaching important big states that could determine the nomination
fight.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the ways to gain attention in those states, where voters have largely
not been paying attention, is to sharpen the differences.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think to a certain extent that's true,'' said Bradley, who held a midday
rally to push his health care plan, but spent much of the rest of the day doing
satellite television interviews in important early states.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can't do town meetings with people in all these states, you have to
communicate through the media,'' Bradley told reporters Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   He headed east Thursday night, where aides said they were continuing to
evaluate debate negotiations with Gore's camp. Bradley has offered to debate
Gore weekly, but Gore also wants both campaigns to stop running televised
commercials.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley has rejected that suggestion, but aides left the door open.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've made a formal decision to say no,'' said a Bradley aide, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``Never say never.''
</P>
<P>
	   The debate series could start as early as Sunday. Bradley is to appear on
``Meet the Press'' and has invited Gore to join him. The two staffs were mulling
their positions.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Bradley supporter Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, said he had asked
-- and that Bradley had agreed -- to quit insisting publicly that Gore apologize
for volunteers who insulted Kerrey during a weekend rally in New Hampshire.
Gore's campaign distributed a statement from Kerrey to traveling reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley press secretary Eric Hauser said Bradley and Kerrey had spoken, but
declined to discuss specifics. He said that, for Bradley, the issue was more
about Gore's role in setting a tone for his campaign than about what was said
about Kerrey.
</P>
<P>
	   Making the round of television interviews Thursday, Bradley said he sensed
weariness from voters to the repeated scandals of the Clinton administration,
though he didn't refer to it by name. He said people tell him ``we need a fresh
start.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm the best alternative to beat the Republicans this fall,'' Bradley
said.

<HEADLINE> Lieutenant says cops were stunned by Diallo's slaying  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - It was one year ago today. The smell of gunpowder
hung in the air. So did the misery.
<P>
	   Officer Kenneth Boss, pale and dazed, paced around in the middle of a Bronx
street outside Amadou Diallo's apartment building. Inside the cramped vestibule,
Officer Sean Carroll knelt in a trance over Diallo's bullet-ridden corpse.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo wore a red Yankees knit cap, a dark jacket with white stripes, long
underwear, black jeans and black sneakers. A pager with a bullet hole through it
and a wallet with $169 sat near his body.
</P>
<P>
	   "I said, 'Sean ... Sean ... Sean' - each time louder," recalled Lt. Kevin
Cantwell. "He didn't respond at all."
</P>
<P>
	   Cantwell helped set the scene while testifying Thursday in the trial of four
officers accused of murdering Diallo, an unarmed African immigrant, shortly
after midnight on Feb. 4, 1999. The victim was stuck by 19 of the 41 bullets
police fired.
</P>
<P>
	   Boss, 28; Carroll, 36; Edward McMellon, 27; and Richard Murphy, 27 - all
members of the plainclothes Street Crime Unit - have pleaded innocent to the
second-degree murder charges. If convicted, they face a maximum sentence of 25
years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting of an unarmed black man by four white officers sparked a wave
of pretrial publicity and protests resulting in hundred of arrests for civil
disobedience. Civil rights activists complained the Street Crime Unit regularly
stopped and frisked young black men in poor neighborhoods without cause.
</P>
<P>
	   The outcry prompted an appeals court to move the case to Albany, where it is
being televised. A jury comprised of four black women, two white women and six
white men heard two days of testimony this week before the trial was adjourned
until Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Debbie Rivera, a former neighbor of Diallo, testified she heard
no voices before a sudden burst of gunfire, broken by a brief pause, on the
morning Diallo was killed.
</P>
<P>
	   After the shooting stopped, Rivera said she peered out the window to see a
distraught man wearing a baseball cap and a badge.
</P>
<P>
	   The man "took his hat and threw it in the street," then cursed, the
prosecution witness said. The officer was not identified.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecution appeared to use Rivera's testimony to try to show the
officers fired without warning and suggest they had an opportunity to realize
Diallo was not a threat. The officers allegedly continued pulling their triggers
even after the victim dropped to the floor of his apartment building vestibule.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense contends the gunfire from the officer's rapid-fire weapons was
continuous and lasted less than 10 seconds. It also alleges the street vendor
set off a tragic "chain reaction" by lurking around his front door, ignoring
orders to halt for questioning and pulling a black object out of his pocket; the
object turned out to be a wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, the jury heard testimony sympathetic to both the officers and
the victim.
</P>
<P>
	   Cantwell testified he rushed to Diallo's block after hearing Boss call for
"a boss and a bus" - police parlance for a supervisor and an ambulance - over a
police radio. At the prompting of the defense, he said the officers were too
upset and dazed to speak about what had happened.
</P>
<P>
	   "When I first asked Officer Murphy if he was OK, he opened his mouth and
nothing came out," Cantwell said. The supervisor ordered all the officers to the
hospital to be treated for trauma.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo's former roommate, Momodou Kujabi, 33, testified the victim spent the
final moments of his life lying on their couch and watching television. The two
talked about paying their utility bill before Kujabi went to bed.
</P>
<P>
	   About an hour later, police woke up Kujabi and had him identify the body
splayed in the vestibule. He dropped his head and gasped when a prosecutor
flashed Diallo's photo up on a video screen.
</P>
<P>
	   Sitting in the audience, Diallo's mother, Kadiatou appeared to weep.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Seek U.S. Mediation  </HEADLINE>
   By MARK LAVIE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Palestinians appealed to the United States to rescue
negotiations with Israel, after a summit meeting broke up in a crisis ahead of a
Feb. 13 goal for a framework peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   The main disagreement at the summit Thursday between Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat and Prime Minister Ehud Barak was over territory Israel is slated
to hand over as part of an interim peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak told leaders of his One Israel party: ``I am convinced that this
barrier will be overcome. There is a deep interest by both sides.''
</P>
<P>
	   But officials said it was unlikely the Feb. 13 target date for the broader
peace treaty framework would be met, though Israel denied asking for a delay.
</P>
<P>
	   Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said it was ``a date that must be
respected.''
</P>
<P>
	   Following the summit and the Palestinian appeal for help, American mediator
Dennis Ross met with Erekat. He had been in Jerusalem to monitor progress on the
Feb. 13 framework treaty, and had not intended to deal with the interim accord,
signed last September in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
	   It was assumed that the Barak-Arafat summit would focus on the peace-treaty
issues, and not the interim-treaty issues.

<P>
	   However, the Palestinians rejected a remote West Bank territory Israel
planned to hand over in the coming days, and instead demanded they be given
certain villages bordering Jerusalem. The Israelis said the agreement allowed
them to make that decision themselves, but the Palestinians insisted they must
be consulted.
</P>
<P>
	   Erekat said Arafat told Barak: ``How about if we go together -- two of your
side, two of my side will go to Dennis Ross today, to the Americans, and let's
arbitrate there.''
</P>
<P>
	   Israel rejected the idea. After a joint Barak-Arafat news conference was
canceled, a sign of Palestinian anger, Foreign Minister David Levy said the two
sides must solve their differences by themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   The September interim accord was designed to complete the step-by-step,
confidence-building approach, begun in 1993, as Israel turned over pieces of
West Bank territory to Palestinian civilian control in stages. Instead, each
phase has triggered its own crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   In the last withdrawal in early January, Israel promised to take into
account Palestinian requests for the territory in this latest pullback -- though
Israeli officials insisted they did not promise to follow the requests.
</P>
<P>
	   Charging that the Israelis are trying to dictate terms, Erekat declared,
``This must stop. The integrity, honesty and credibility of the peace process is
being eaten up by such practices.''
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Minister Yossi Beilin, an architect of previous Israel-Palestinian
accords, said the gaps over the peace treaty framework were too wide to allow
for American mediation now. The peace-treaty issues include the future of
Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlements in the West Bank and a
border between Israel and a future Palestinian entity.
</P>
<P>
	   Beilin said there would be another week to ten days of low-level talks about
a framework. ``After that, it will be possible to try to outline the overall
agreement, where the Americans can fulfill a role,'' he told Israel television.

<HEADLINE> Oklahoma Gov. Apologizes for Remark  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Gov. Frank Keating has apologized for joking that the
best way to deal with the state teachers union is ``homicide.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``While my comment was made in jest, it could be misunderstood by those who
were not in attendance. I recognize that my comment could offend and I apologize
to anyone who may have been offended,'' he said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, during a speech at Oral Roberts University, the governor was
asked what he considered the best way to deal with the union. He paused and
grinned and said, ``Homicide.''
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the Oklahoma Education Association said the remark was
inappropriate, particularly in light of the shootings that have plagued the
nation's schools, including one at a Fort Gibson school in December.
</P>
<P>
	   At first, the governor, who is known for making brash remarks, refused to
apologize for ``blushes'' he makes in office. A spokesman said it was obvious
the OEA ``doesn't have a sense of humor.''

<HEADLINE> E. Timor Needs Money To Curb Unrest  </HEADLINE>
   By EDITH M. LEDERER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- East Timor urgently needs some of the more than $520
million pledged for its reconstruction to curb rising violent crime and avoid
social unrest, the U.N. administrator says.
</P>
<P>
	   In a briefing to the U.N. Security Council on Thursday, Sergio Vieira de
Mello spoke of the immense challenge facing the United Nations as it tries to
rebuild a ravaged territory with 80 percent unemployment and prepare its 800,000
people for independence.
</P>
<P>
	   Cross-border incursions by pro-Indonesian militias continue to pose a
threat. The rate of return of refugees from West Timor has slowed. Electricity
is reaching just 25 percent of the country and about 50 percent of the
population. A civil service must be established and the territory must move end
its dependence on humanitarian relief, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Vieira de Mello said his main concern is that projects to restore East
Timor's ravaged infrastructure and develop its economy won't be started for
several months -- which may result in the perception among East Timorese that
``little is being done.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``What I need is money now to provide the East Timorese people with the
visible, the tangible proofs of international concern,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The territory was devastated by pro-Indonesia militiamen, who went on a
rampage of looting, burning and killing after the East Timorese voted
overwhelmingly to break ties with Jakarta and become independent on Aug. 30.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, more than 50 nations and international groups pledged $522
million to help rebuild East Timor. Part of that money is earmarked for a World
Bank Trust Fund.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, the United Nations and the World Bank produced an initial
six-month reconstruction plan and submitted it to a donors meeting in
Washington. But getting those projects started will take months.
</P>
<P>
	   Vieira de Mello urged the World Bank to release some of the trust fund's
money for immediate labor-intensive projects to rebuild East Timor, an appeal
backed by U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. administrator said immediate distribution of contributions from
governments will ``be essential to prevent social unrest.''
</P>
<P>
	   Many Security Council members expressed concern at the increase in criminal
activity, which Vieira de Mello blamed mainly on widespread unemployment and
young people with no schools or jobs to occupy their time.
</P>
<P>
	   Only 480 U.N. police are in East Timor, far below the force's authorized
strength of 1,610, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, pro-Indonesian militias still pose a threat in border areas and the
isolated enclave of Oecussi, where militias made eight incursions in past weeks,
Vieira de Mello said.
</P>
<P>
	   He told the council he received word Thursday morning that Indonesian and
U.N. police had agreed to jointly interrogate and fingerprint militia leader
``Moko'' Soares based on evidence the East Timorese authorities had gathered
against him. Vieira de Mello said he didn't know whether Soares had been taken
into custody.

<HEADLINE> Republicans say Clinton shouldn't use SUNY hall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The Hillary Clinton campaign says it's perfectly legal
for her to formally kick off her U.S. Senate candidacy at a state university
campus.
<P>
	   Campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson said Thursday the campaign is paying
$8,000 to $10,000 to rent a hall at the State University at Purchase. Clinton
will officially announce her candidacy Sunday, accompanied by President Clinton,
daughter Chelsea and her mother Dorothy.
</P>
<P>
	   But a pair of Republican lawmakers complained Thursday that a partisan
political event shouldn't be held at a taxpayer-funded institution.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Clintons come to New York and the first thing they do is they use
publicly supported institutions for campaign announcements and fund raisers,"
said state Assemblyman John Faso, R-Kinderhook, who was accompanied by
Assemblyman John Ravitz, R-Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   SUNY guidelines state that "partisan political organizations may be
permitted the use of facilities" under certain conditions, including that the
proposed meeting "gives promise of contributing to the educational purposes of
the institution."
</P>
<P>
	   Wolfson said the event conforms to those guidelines.
</P>
<P>
	   In past years, other SUNY campuses have been used for campaign rallies. In
1996, Vice President Al Gore held a pro-Clinton rally at SUNY Albany and Bob
Dole and Jack Kemp held a similar event at SUNY Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, Purchase officials said the Clinton event "is consistent
with the college's public service mission. ... Purchase College welcomes
political candidates on its campus, so that students will have the opportunity
to be more aware of the political process and the views of candidates for public
office. Purchase College does not endorse political candidates, nor does it take
a position on issues presented on its campus in a public forum."
</P>
<P>
	   The Purchase campus in Westchester is near the Clintons' suburban home in
Chappaqua.
</P>
<P>
	   Also present for Faso's news conference outside Clinton's campaign
headquarters in Manhattan were Kathleen McCreary, a trustee of the local SUNY
campus, who said Purchase officials had been "tricked and trapped" into letting
Clinton use the hall, and Candace de Russy, a statewide trustee of SUNY who
called for the resignation two years ago of the president of SUNY-New Paltz
because he approved a conference there on sexually explicit topics.
</P>
<P>
	   SUNY Purchase has issued an invitation for Hillary Clinton and her likely
Republican opponent, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, to hold a debate on
the campus in the future.
</P>
<P>
	   Last Sunday, Giuliani - who has not scheduled any formal announcement of his
own candidacy - dismissed the Purchase kickoff as a staged event. "It's a
Hollywood type of thing," he said.

negotiations with Israel, after a summit meeting broke up in a crisis ahead of a

exploring the ocean floor found where the wreckage came to rest after the MD-83
crashed Monday, killing all 88 aboard. A submersible sent up video images of a

<HEADLINE> Fight Over Mandatory Drug Tests  </HEADLINE>
   By PAM EASTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOCKNEY, Texas (AP) -- Larry Tannahill has spent his life working the land
in west Texas, where livestock and agriculture dominate the economy. His roots
are deep and so are his convictions.
</P>
<P>
	   Tannahill is refusing to allow his 12-year-old son, Brady, to be tested for
drugs by the Lockney Independent School District. Mandatory testing for the
district's teachers and 400 students in grades 6 through 12 was completed
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Brady, the only holdout, now faces the same punishment as someone who tested
positive: a 21-day suspension from extracurricular activities, at least three
days' in-school suspension and three sessions of substance abuse counseling.
</P>
<P>
	   The sixth-grader also could be required to take a drug test every month for
a year. Each time he refuses, he will be considered a repeat offender, and the
punishment gets more strict.
</P>
<P>
	   Tannahill planned to appeal his son's suspension.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My son is an A and B student,'' he said, standing outside the rural
Lutheran church he attends, amid miles of farm land. ``He's never been in
trouble and right now they are saying he's guilty.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I know everybody is wanting the best for their children and I want the
best for mine. But I also feel like we are being violated and dictated to. I've
had a gut full of it and I'm going to make a stand.''
</P>
<P>
	   Superintendent Raymond Lusk said the community supports the policy, which
had been discussed since 1997, when 13 people in the town of 2,243 were indicted
for distributing and using cocaine and marijuana.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the school determines this is what we think we need to do to provide an
optimum education then that is what we need to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the school board decided, after a series of community meetings, to
require tests of everyone because it seemed unfair to single out students
enrolled in extracurricular activities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it's an excellent policy,'' said Bobby Hall, a business professor
at Wayland Baptist University who has a daughter in the Lockney district. ``I,
for one, would like to know if my children were involved in drugs because it
gives you a chance for intervention.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``And if you do it across the board it's fair for everybody,'' added his
wife, Laurie.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockney High School senior Adam Pachiano, who took the urine drug test
Tuesday, said his parents were upset but gave their consent to keep him from
facing penalties.
</P>
<P>
	   ``School is not an extracurricular activity. You have to go,'' the
18-year-old said. ``A lot of parents didn't want it to happen, but they didn't
want to fight it. They just did it to keep us out of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lockney, about an hour's drive northeast of Lubbock, is the second school in
the area to implement mandatory testing. School officials in Sundown, about 75
miles away, say their policy is effective and supported in the community.
</P>
<P>
	   Graham Boyd, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union's national
drug policy project, said he is unaware of any other school district in the
country that requires across-the board testing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I find it very hard to believe people are doing this,'' Boyd said. ``This
is literally the first school I have ever heard of doing this and I really
wonder why they think this is OK.''
</P>
<P>
	   Boyd said cases challenging school drug testing for students in
extracurricular activities have been filed in Indiana, Oklahoma, Arkansas and in
Texas, where state Education Agency spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson said state
officials have no jurisdiction over local drug testing policies.
</P>
<P>
	   Rodrick Schoen, a retired constitutional law and public education law
professor from Texas Tech University in Lubbock, said he is appalled by
Lockney's policy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I admire Mr. Tannahill for resisting this on principle,'' Schoen said.
``The Supreme Court has never held that just because a child is enrolled in a
public school that they are to be subjected to these unconstitutional seizures
of their urine.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lusk said the mandatory tests, followed up with random testing of 10 percent
of the students and faculty each month, give students a reason to decline peer
pressure to use drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If it's the right thing to do, you don't let the threat of someone suing
you stop you,'' Lusk said.
</P>
<P>
	   Tannahill said he's worried about the consequences his son faces simply for
standing up for his rights.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I just wonder where all the children's rights are and the parents' rights
are,'' Tannahill said. ``Right now in Lockney ISD, the parents and the children
don't have any on this issue.''

<HEADLINE> Jury selected for second Louima case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A racially mixed jury was chosen for the trial of three
police officers accused of conspiring to obstruct justice in the Abner Louima
police-torture case, and testimony is set to begin on Monday.
<P>
	   The jury of six blacks, five whites and one Hispanic was chosen from an
original pool of 500, winnowed down to 75. Six alternates were added later.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, women dominated the panel eight to four. The alternates were five
whites and one Hispanic, and were split evenly by gender.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense lawyers declined to comment on the jury's makeup Thursday. "Twelve
people, tried and true, U.S. citizens. We're ready to go," said Ron Fischetti,
the attorney for ex-officer Charles Schwarz. "It looks like a jury that can be
fair. That's all both sides want."
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz's wife, Andra, said she would have preferred more male jurors.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wish it was a lot more even, between women and men," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial, the second in the case, stems from the 1997 incident in which
Louima was brutalized by officers at a Brooklyn precinct house after his arrest
on a minor charge.
</P>
<P>
	   The four officers were white, while Louima, a Haitian immigrant, is black.
</P>
<P>
	   Defendant Schwarz already faces a possible life sentence after conviction
last year for violating Louima's civil rights. The key witness is expected to be
former officer Justin Volpe, who is serving 30 years after pleading guilty on
the civil rights charge. He now claims Schwarz did not take part in the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Andra Schwarz said the case was "never about race in the first place," but
was triggered by Volpe's anger.
</P>
<P>
	   "People can see clearly that it was an act of rage and not race," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Eugene Nickerson earlier questioned would-be jurors
closely on their knowledge of the highly publicized case, their experiences with
racism and their views toward the so-called "blue wall of silence" by which cops
supposedly shield each other from allegations of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury is to remain anonymous and be escorted to and from the courthouse
by federal marshals. But the jury will not be sequestered in a hotel, as is the
case in some high tension trials.
</P>
<P>
	   The officers face five years in prison on the conspiracy charge.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz, 35, Thomas Wiese, 37, and Thomas Bruder, 34, are accused of
conspiring to obstruct justice by concealing Schwarz's purported role in the
assault on Louima, who was beaten and sodomized with a broom handle by Volpe.
</P>
<P>
	   Schwarz was convicted last year of holding Louima down during the attack.
Volpe has said since that Wiese, not Schwarz, was in the bathroom in Brooklyn's
70th Precinct.
</P>
<P>
	   Stuart London and Joseph Tacopina, attorneys for Bruder and Wiese,
respectively, say their clients contend that Schwarz was never in the bathroom.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- John McCain grinned as he pondered the latest turn
of the Republican presidential campaign -- George W. Bush discussing veterans'
affairs, questioning McCain's qualifications to be president, even producing a
veterans' group leader who criticized the Arizona senator's record on military
matters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Please don't throw me in that briar patch,'' quipped the former Navy pilot
and Vietnam POW, whose bus full of increasingly optimistic campaign staffers was
cruising the coastal highways of South Carolina. ``Why don't we have a real good
debate on national security and foreign policy anytime, anywhere?''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has the money to wage a national campaign, the backing of many of South
Carolina's Republican establishment and an upcoming primary in that state Feb.
19 that has turned back insurgent candidates in past presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was heading toward tobacco country today, with a stop in Florence, a
tobacco-rich community in northeastern South Carolina. McCain's unsuccessful
attempt to raise tobacco taxes has been controversial in tobacco regions, but
campaign aides say they don't expect that to hurt him in the upcoming primary.
</P>
<P>
	   But he was on a roll Thursday, learning of a poll that had him with an edge
just two days after his big 18-point win in New Hampshire, getting $1 million in
Internet contributions since his primary victory and winning the battle to
compete in New York's primary.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said he knows the rolling political gabfest on his bus the Straight
Talk Express may or may not survive much past March 7, the cluster of primaries
including New York, California, a handful of New England states, Georgia and
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   But no matter what happens down the road, this week has been McCain's
moment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's something magic going on,'' McCain said as he held court in the
back of his campaign bus. ``I can't put my finger on it. But we're having a
wonderful time.''
</P>
<P>
	   He told enthusiastic crowds up and down the South Carolina coast that he's
``exhilarated and exuberant'' by the recent progress of his campaign. His pitch
for votes noted his experience with military matters, his approach to offer a
smaller tax cut and funnel two-thirds of the surplus toward Social Security, and
his promise to always tell Americans the truth.
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Montague, a retiree and veteran from Seabrook Island, said presidents
can always find good domestic advisers, so he looks to the president for
leadership on foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``McCain is better qualified to do that,'' he said while attending a McCain
rally.
</P>
<P>
	   Reps. Lindsey Graham and Mark Sanford have been traveling with McCain,
helping dispel the image that Bush has South Carolina, and all of its
Republicans, wrapped up. South Carolina has been delivered for establishment
candidates in past years, serving as a firewall after unpredictable New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   But McCain argued Thursday night that South Carolina is fast changing, with
many new residents, a growing middle class and overseas investment that may make
it a different electorate in 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The old Republican machine is fragmented,'' he said. ``There's a new
generation of Republican leaders, and they have a lean and hungry look.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, always talkative on his campaign bus, was almost giddy with
excitement as he traveled from one enthusiastic rally to the next. On the bus,
he mocked Bush's political strategies and chortled at editorial cartoons
lampooning Bush's description of his loss in New Hampshire as ``a bump in the
road.''
</P>
<P>
	   Across the state in Newberry, Republican candidate Alan Keyes questioned
McCain's opposition to abortion, but McCain and Graham both responded that
McCain's voting record speaks for itself.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has been answering McCain's momentum with sharpened attacks on his
stands, and new endorsements.
</P>
<P>
	   In his arguments that he is more qualified than McCain, Bush has pointed out
that 33 of McCain's Republican Senate colleagues -- including local favorite
Strom Thurmond -- have endorsed Bush. The same is true of most of the nation's
Republican governors.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Jim Gibbons, a staunch Nevada conservative and veteran of two wars who
wavered between McCain and Bush, endorsed Bush Thursday as the GOP's best bet
for winning back the White House. But Gibbons may have been responding to
McCain's opposition to Nevada betting on college sports.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain on Thursday allowed himself the luxury of pondering a general
election run as the good news came rolling in. But when a reporter asked whether
he would consider a female running mate, he seemed to snap out of his blissful
reverie.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Hey,'' he chided the reporter, ``I've won one state.''

<HEADLINE> McCain, Bush Debate Leadership  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- John McCain grinned as he pondered the latest turn
of the Republican presidential campaign -- George W. Bush discussing veterans'
affairs, questioning McCain's qualifications to be president, even producing a
veterans' group leader who criticized the Arizona senator's record on military
matters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Please don't throw me in that briar patch,'' quipped the former Navy pilot
and Vietnam POW, whose bus full of increasingly optimistic campaign staffers was
cruising the coastal highways of South Carolina. ``Why don't we have a real good
debate on national security and foreign policy anytime, anywhere?''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has the money to wage a national campaign, the backing of many of South
Carolina's Republican establishment and an upcoming primary in that state Feb.
19 that has turned back insurgent candidates in past presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was heading toward tobacco country today, with a stop in Florence, a
tobacco-rich community in northeastern South Carolina. McCain's unsuccessful
attempt to raise tobacco taxes has been controversial in tobacco regions, but
campaign aides say they don't expect that to hurt him in the upcoming primary.
</P>
<P>
	   But he was on a roll Thursday, learning of a poll that had him with an edge
just two days after his big 18-point win in New Hampshire, getting $1 million in
Internet contributions since his primary victory and winning the battle to
compete in New York's primary.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said he knows the rolling political gabfest on his bus the Straight
Talk Express may or may not survive much past March 7, the cluster of primaries
including New York, California, a handful of New England states, Georgia and
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   But no matter what happens down the road, this week has been McCain's
moment.
</P>

<HEADLINE> N.Y. GOP Leaders Give in To McCain  </HEADLINE>
   By MARC HUMBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Bowing to widespread criticism, as well as pressure
from George W. Bush, Gov. George Pataki says John McCain will be on New York's
presidential primary ballot throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's most powerful New York backer had supported an effort led by state
Republican Chairman William Powers to knock McCain off the ballot in much of New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   But Pataki said Thursday, ``John McCain should be on the ballot. This should
be a campaign about ideas and issues, not technicalities. I'm confident that
George Bush will win that campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush praised any move to allow his chief rival to compete statewide for the
March 7 primary, although it would give the Arizona senator another shot at
competing head to head with the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's the right decision. I welcome it,'' Bush told reporters in Delaware.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who had held a news conference in front of the Russian Embassy to
denounce the ``Stalinist politics'' of the New York Republican Party, joked of
Pataki: ``I'll never call him comrade again.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was campaigning in South Carolina, where he's angling to beat Bush in
that state's Feb. 19 GOP primary in order to maintain his momentum after his
stunning victory over Bush on Tuesday in New Hampshire's Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Powers refused comment, but he and Pataki are close political allies and the
chairman was expected to go along with the governor's wishes.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki's move came after a day of growing signs that the New York GOP
hierarchy backing Bush's candidacy was ready to buckle. McCain sent letters to
Pataki and Powers earlier in the day urging them to ``do the right thing for New
York Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, who was stung by McCain's win in New Hampshire and unhappy about
handing him an issue for his ``outsider'' campaign, had sent a message Wednesday
to his New York supporters that their fight to keep McCain off primary ballots
in more than one-third of the state's 31 congressional districts had gone far
enough.
</P>
<P>
	   His message was clear: If McCain wins his federal court lawsuit to open up
the New York ballot, as expected, do not appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge in that case said a ruling was unlikely before Monday, at the
earliest.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki spokeswoman Zenia Mucha said that even if the judge ruled against
McCain, Pataki was ready to ``take the appropriate steps to ensure that (McCain)
is on the ballot.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's New York campaign director, Staten Island Borough President Guy
Molinari, said he was pleased with Pataki's move, but called it ``too little,
too late.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Mucha said, ``We believe McCain is hiding behind the issue of ballot
access ... When ballot access is off the table, it's clear he has nothing to
talk about in New York.''
</P>
<P>
	   There also was talk that the McCain camp and the state GOP were in
discussions that might lead to a settlement of the case.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain had repeatedly criticized Bush for not stopping the effort to block
his access to the New York ballot for lack of the required petition signatures.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki, who has been mentioned as a possible Bush running mate, had also
come under widespread criticism.
</P>
<P>
	   The controversy took another twist Wednesday when a state judge knocked
Bush's delegate slate off the ballot in one district because of fraudulent
signatures on his petitions. The petitions had been challenged by lawyers for
millionaire publisher Steve Forbes, who also is on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   New York's rules require presidential candidates to gather signatures from
party members in each of the 31 congressional districts to get their delegate
slates on the ballot. McCain is battling in federal court to get back on the
ballot in 12 districts. He has qualified in the others.

<HEADLINE> Bush, Forbes Push for Delaware Win  </HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER THORNE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TALLEYVILLE, Del. (AP) -- Saying New Hampshire sent ``tremors'' through the
Republican Party, Steve Forbes pumped hands in a Delaware fire hall as he sought
a repeat of his 1996 primary victory here.
</P>
<P>
	   Further downstate, a high school marching band greeted Texas Gov. George W.
Bush's plane when it touched down Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Starting a four-day bus campaign in Delaware, Forbes sprinkled his usual
stump speech with references to Bush's second-place finish in New Hampshire,
behind Sen. John McCain of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's nothing inevitable now,'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who is skipping Tuesday's Delaware primary as he did the Iowa
caucuses last month, was the target of a Bush jab.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If somebody runs for president of the United States they need to run in
all the states,'' Bush said. ``I don't think they ought to be picking and
choosing what state to run in.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain spokesman Howard Opinsky, who was with McCain in South Carolina,
scoffed at the idea.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When we win the nomination, we'll be president of all 50 of the United
States,'' Opinsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   However, McCain's decision to skip Delaware drew criticism from some
Delaware Republicans. McCain's tactics amount to a ``cafeteria-style'' approach
to the White House, said Basil Battaglia, chairman of Delaware's Republican
committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Delaware's 12 delegates to the Republican convention are at stake.
</P>
<P>
	   Encouraged by McCain's big margin over Bush in New Hampshire, Forbes said
the race is ``wide open,'' and that a Bush victory is no sure thing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In this election year, there is going to be no coronation,'' Forbes said.
``There is going to be no pre-appointment of presidential nominees.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, who finished third in New Hampshire, is counting on a win in
Delaware to gain momentum and credibility. He said he would continue in the race
if he lost Delaware.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking to about 200 members of the Wilmington Rotary Club having lunch in
the Hotel du Pont's posh Gold Ballroom, Forbes said he has at least one thing in
common with McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One thing I do share with Senator McCain is that the Republican
establishment is not very fond of us,'' Forbes said. ``I am an independent
outsider. Washington has no hooks in me.''
</P>
<P>
	   Later, in the Talleyville Fire Hall, about 150 people -- a mix of retirees
and parents balancing toddlers on their laps -- sat on stackable chairs to hear
Forbes sound familiar conservative themes: a flat tax, a stronger military and
school choice.
</P>
<P>
	   An abortion opponent, Forbes said he would seek stricter federal regulation
of abortion clinics. He said many clinics are just as dangerous as before the
U.S. Supreme Court's landmark Roe vs. Wade decision legalizing abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Hodges, a Republican who traveled through a heavy snowfall to hear
Forbes, said he liked the conservative message. But he wouldn't say whether
Forbes had his vote.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's not like a politician. He comes across with common sense,'' Hodges
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the national GOP front-runner, was making his third campaign
appearance when he landed at the Kent County Airport in Dover. About 50
supporters greeted him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm coming to your state and I'm going to come back to your state because
I want your vote,'' he said. ``You didn't see me skipping anything. You know
why? Because the people in this state, they're part of America. They ought to
have a voice in the process.''

<HEADLINE> Pieces of Downed Airline Found  </HEADLINE>
   By JEFF WILSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORT HUENEME, Calif. (AP) -- Searchers found the tail of Alaska Airlines
Flight 261 and recovered the flight data recorder Thursday, two pieces key to
determining why the jetliner plummeted into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
	   The discoveries were made by an underwater robot exploring the ocean floor
where the wreckage came to rest after the MD-83 crashed Monday, killing all 88
aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   A submersible sent up video images of a piece of the fuselage with four
windows, several large pieces up to six feet wide and numerous smaller pieces.
The airline's logo -- the smiling face of an Alaskan Eskimo -- is clearly
visible on the tail, said John Hammerschmidt, a member of the National
Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
	   The robot also captured pictures of the horizontal stabilizer, which has
been the focus of the investigation, he said. NTSB officials said they were not
able to describe the condition of the tail and stabilizer.
</P>
<P>
	   Hammerschmidt declined to say whether searchers had found any bodies, some
of which are believed trapped under the debris.
</P>
<P>
	   Navy crews had earlier salvaged the cockpit voice recorder from about 640
feet of water. The flight data recorder recovered Thursday about 200 feet away
would show the positions of the plane's controls and whether a problem with the
horizontal stabilizer on the tail was merely a symptom of a larger failure that
led to Monday's crash.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That will tell the tale,'' said William Waldock, associate director for
the Center for Aerospace Safety Education at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical
University.
</P>
<P>
	   The discovery came as friends and relatives of the crash victims gathered
along the beach facing the Santa Barbara Channel for a private memorial.
</P>
<P>
	   A few mourners roamed the shore alone, some clustered in small groups and
others waded a few feet into the ocean. The group gathered inside the Point Mugu
Naval Air Weapons Station, and reporters were kept out of the compound.
</P>
<P>
	   From the beginning the investigation has focused on the horizontal
stabilizer because the pilots had reported problems with it.
</P>
<P>
	   Contrary to earlier media reports, there were no signs of mechanical trouble
with the plane on either of its two previous flights -- from Seattle to San
Francisco and from San Francisco to Puerto Vallarta, Hammerschmidt said.
</P>
<P>
	   He also discussed interviews conducted with Alaska mechanics. They described
helping the pilots troubleshoot a ``runaway stabilizer,'' which forced the
plane's nose down.
</P>
<P>
	   At one point, the pilots asked if there were any hidden circuit breakers for
the stabilizer's electrical controls. That suggests they already had shut off
one set of circuit breakers -- a standard remedy for a runaway stabilizer, also
known as runaway trim.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators are looking into the possibility that the pilots could put the
plane into its fatal dive by following the proper procedures for correcting a
stabilizer problem, the Los Angeles Times reported Friday, citing unidentified
NTSB sources.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd be hard-pressed to suggest that these people did something wrong, but
the procedures are a very important aspect,'' the NTSB official told the Times.
</P>
<P>
	   Jammed or out-of-control horizontal stabilizers have led to at least a half
dozen emergency landings but never a crash of a commercial airplane, federal
records show.
</P>
<P>
	   A review of problems involving the device over the last 20 years show
jamming is rare but has never driven a plane totally out of control.
</P>
<P>
	   An Associated Press examination of aviation records found that at least 20
in-flight problems with stabilizers were serious enough to be reported to the
Federal Aviation Administration or the NTSB since 1979.
</P>
<P>
	   In two-thirds of those cases, the flights reached their intended
destination. The rest made emergency landings, including an American Airlines
MD-83, which returned to Phoenix minutes after taking off Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   More than a half dozen involved jets made by McDonnell Douglas, which also
built the MD-83 that crashed off Southern California. Five of those cases
involved planes with stabilizers mounted high on the tail, like the MD-83.
</P>
<P>
	   Trouble similar to what Flight 261 pilots reported never before led to a
crash in the United States, according to experts and aviation reports.
</P>
<P>
	   The stabilizer, a wing on the tail of an aircraft, is designed to adjust --
or trim -- the up-or-down angle of an aircraft's nose.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's like the small corrections you make in the steering wheel going down
the freeway. Unless you're really ham-fisted, people don't feel all those small
corrections,'' said Capt. Steve Roach, a pilot union official who flew MD-83s
for three years.
</P>
<P>
	   If the horizontal stabilizer starts moving on its own -- a state of runaway
trim -- pilots can usually stop it by pulling circuit breakers and using other
controls. In most cases, it will stop before reaching an extreme angle.
</P>
<P>
	   In most aircraft, including the MD-83, a jammed stabilizer can be overridden
by moving elevators attached to its trailing edge and controlled by pulling
forward or backward on the yoke in the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
	   If it jammed at an extreme position, the pilots must exert more pressure on
the yoke but still should be able to maintain control.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have flown it in the simulator with the fully runaway trim, and that's
quite a handful to fly,'' Roach said. ``You're handflying it and having to
maintain a considerable amount of pressure on the controls to keep the plane
straight and level.''
</P>
<P>
	   Though stabilizer problems are rare, regulators last May gave airlines 18
months to inspect hinges connecting parts of the tail for signs of corrosion. An
error during manufacture can cause the hinges to rust more easily.
</P>
<P>
	   The Alaska Airlines jet that crashed had not yet undergone the inspection,
but 10 of the MD-80s in the fleet did and showed no unusual corrosion, said
airline spokesman David Marriott. Records on other airlines' fleets were not
immediately available.

<HEADLINE> Public: Campaign Stories Irrelevant  </HEADLINE>
   By G. STEPHEN BIERMAN Jr. Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Campaign strategy -- so what?
</P>
<P>
	   A study of major media outlets over two weeks leading up to the Iowa
caucuses and the New Hampshire primaries has concluded that a large part of the
news produced was of little relevance to potential voters.
</P>
<P>
	   The Project for Excellence in Journalism, a journalist-run media watchdog
group, deemed the presidential campaign coverage to be heavy on political
tactics and light on policy and the candidates' backgrounds in a study released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Less than 1 percent, or just two of 430 stories published in five major
newspapers or broadcast by nine network and cable news programs explored the
candidates' past records in more than a passing reference, the study said. It
also found that more than half of the stories, or 54 percent, concerned
political topics, such as fund-raising or tactics, compared to 24 percent that
related to public policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Only 13 percent of the stories were about subjects that actually would
affect the public if any of the candidates were elected president -- such as
their ideas, their honesty or how their constituents have fared in the past, the
study said.
</P>
<P>
	   It stopped short of concluding that media outlets would rather predict the
winners of these contests than provide the information their audiences need to
make informed voting decisions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's research out there but it's common sense,'' said Tom Rosensteil,
director of the project, explaining why voters wish to know more than just who
might win. ``What were they like in their old jobs? Who are these guys?''
</P>
<P>
	   The project's study noted research this year by the Pew Research Center for
the People &AMP; the Press suggesting that people would rather read and hear about
the candidates' character, rather than internal campaign strategies.
</P>
<P>
	   In some cases, the media sources studied had attempted a policy discussion
only to find the conversation turning to political tactics. For example:
</P>
<P>
	   ``Consider how, on December 14th's Good Morning America, George
Stephanopoulos frames John McCain's opposition to federal subsidies for the
alternative fuel called ethanol. 'It's what a friend of mine called a 'candor
pander,' and what he's doing here is hoping that this straight talk, even though
it would end up sacrificing the state of Iowa, will appeal to the rest of the
country where it fits in with his point that special interests have too much
influence in Washington,''' the study said.
</P>
<P>
	   The study conceded that the background reporting found to be missing might
have been covered before the study was conducted. However, it said if that were
the case, evidence showed that the public was not yet paying attention.
</P>
<P>
	   The study examined stories produced during the week ending Jan. 20 and the
week ending Dec. 15. The newspapers studied were the Cleveland Plain Dealer, the
Orlando Sentinel, the New York Times, the Washington Post and USA Today. In
broadcast, the study reviewed the morning and evening programs on ABC, CBS and
NBC, CNN's ``The World,'' the ``News Hour'' on PBS, and CNN's ``Larry King
Live.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Project for Excellence in Journalism is funded by the Pew Charitable
Trusts.

<HEADLINE> CBS To Air 'Big Brother' Series  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A house full of strangers will be under the unblinking CBS
eye this summer.
</P>
<P>
	   Five nights a week, the network will make voyeurs out of viewers with a new
show starring a group of volunteers who live for three months in a home equipped
with two dozen cameras and 59 microphones.
</P>
<P>
	   CBS won a bidding war to adapt a Dutch series, "Big Brother," for American
television. The house will start with nine or 10 people who will be whittled
down, week by week, in a vote by viewers. At the series' end, viewers decide
which character they like best, and the winner gets a cash prize.
</P>
<P>
	   It's something like MTV's long-running "Real World" series, only much more
intense: Participants cannot go anywhere within the house without being seen or
heard, and will be permitted no contact with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
	   Although they will be on television constantly, they won't be allowed to
watch TV.
</P>
<P>
	   When the series is not on the air, fans will be able to follow the
housemates any time, day or night, through a Web site.
</P>
<P>
	   "Big Brother" was a sensation when it aired in the Netherlands last fall,
particularly among young people. Roughly one in 15 Dutch citizens tuned in
regularly to watch the housemates brush their teeth, take out the trash or just
hang out.
</P>
<P>
	   "This type of show appeals to a certain sense of voyeurism in all of us,
like listening in on a nearby conversation or walking past a house and glancing
in the window," said Paul Romer, executive producer of the Dutch show. "There is
something magical about being able to listen to and watch other people."
</P>
<P>
	   CBS will conduct a nationwide search for participants and put them through
physical and psychological screening. Volunteers can leave whenever they want,
but will be immediately replaced and forfeit their chance for a prize. The
home's location has not been decided.
</P>
<P>
	   Romer, who admitted "Big Brother" is "a little cruel," said participants in
the Netherlands were instructed to be themselves. They must work together to
survive the experience, but all know there is ultimately only one winner.
</P>
<P>
	   The Netherlands Institute of Psychologists called the show "irresponsible
and unethical."
</P>
<P>
	   Some Dutch critics just found it a little dull.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, CBS paid a reported $20 million to the Dutch production company
Endemol Entertainment for rights to the series, outbidding Fox, ABC and the USA
cable network.
</P>
<P>
	   By airing "Big Brother" so often, CBS hopes to duplicate ABC's success at
adapting the British game show, "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire." ABC put
"Millionaire" on over several nights last August and now has the hit of the TV
season.
</P>
<P>
	   Also this summer, CBS is airing a similar reality-based show, "Survivor," in
which 16 contestants are thrown together on a deserted island off Borneo. The
winner of the endurance test gets $1 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Both are bold moves for CBS, which usually doesn't risk shocking an audience
whose average age is over 50. CBS Television President Leslie Moonves said the
summer rerun season is the perfect time to be a little daring.
</P>
<P>
	   "Viewers are looking for new forms of programming and this is an attempt to
be ahead of the curve in finding the next form," spokesman Chris Ender said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fox is planning its own real-life soap opera this summer, "High School,"
created by a documentary filmmaker who is following a high school class from
suburban Chicago throughout the school year.

<HEADLINE> Breakthroughs in Insulin Delivery  </HEADLINE>
    By PAUL RECER AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers have engineered cells that can store insulin
until a pill triggers the hormone's release, a technique that may one day offer
a needle-free treatment for diabetics.
</P>
<P>
	   In a study appearing today in the journal Science, researchers say that
experiments with mice show the technique can correct high levels of sugar in the
blood, the primary symptom of a common form of diabetes.
</P>
<P>
	   Tim Clackson, senior author of the study and a researcher at Ariad
Pharmaceuticals in Cambridge, Mass., said the technique is now being tested on
larger animals and could be ready for human testing within two years.
</P>
<P>
	   Clackson said the technique causes insulin to clump inside a cell with
another protein, forming a molecule that is too large to leave the cell. A drug,
given as a pill, breaks up the clump, allowing the insulin to flow into the
blood stream in a way that mimics the spurt of hormone normally secreted by the
pancreas.
</P>
<P>
	   "The amount of protein (such as insulin) that gets released is directly
related to the amount of drug that is given," said Clackson. "The more drug you
give, the more protein gets released into circulation."
</P>
<P>
	   In diabetes, the technique theoretically would allow a patient to precisely
control insulin levels in the blood by a pill. Many diabetics now must control
insulin levels by injection.
</P>
<P>
	   A common type of diabetes is caused by the failure of the pancreas to
produce an appropriate amount of insulin to metabolize glucose, or sugar, levels
in the blood stream. Normally, the pancreas releases insulin in response to the
detected level of glucose.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Richard Furlanetto, scientific director of the Juvenile Diabetes
Foundation, said the experimental technique "is very clever science" but might
fall short.
</P>
<P>
	   "To be truly useful, it would have to be coupled to a system that would
release the hormone in direct response to the levels of glucose in the blood,"
said Furlanetto.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Furlanetto said the technique could be very useful in treating
conditions that require periodic secretion, or pulsed release, of some needed
protein, such as growth hormone.
</P>
<P>
	   In the experiment, Clackson and his colleagues inserted into laboratory
cells genes that produce insulin and a protein that naturally clumps, or
aggregates, with insulin. Once inside the cells, the genes produce the two
proteins. They form clusters that are too large to pass through pores in the
walls of the cell compartments.
</P>
<P>
	   The engineered cells were then injected into the muscles of mice that are
diabetic and normally develop high levels of glucose in the blood.
</P>
<P>
	   When these mice were fed a drug that caused the protein clusters to split
apart, insulin was released into the bloodstream and glucose levels dropped to
normal.
</P>
<P>
	   In control mice, which had the engineered cells but were not given the oral
drug, insulin did not appear in the bloodstream and glucose levels stayed high.
</P>
<P>
	   "The insulin stays in the compartments of the cell and has no toxicity or
adverse effects. It just sits there," said Clackson. "Only when the animal
receives the drug do the aggregates break apart and then flow into the
circulation."
</P>
<P>
	   Clackson said the experiment was only a "proof of concept" for the
technique. The next step is to transfer genes directly into body muscle cells, a
common gene therapy technique. To do this, the target genes will be put into a
virus that would be injected and deliver the genes into muscle cells, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the initial target of the research is diabetes, Clackson said the
protein clustering technique could also be used to deliver any protein that the
body needs in spurts. For instance, the technique could be used to administer
growth hormone, or proteins that would provide pain relief, appetite control or
correct brain chemistry, he said.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Dad Wants Boy To Be Moved  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's father is pressing U.S. Attorney General
Janet Reno to return the boy to him in Cuba, and says that in the meantime his
son should be moved to the home of another relation in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am deeply concerned and anguished over the present condition of my
6-year-old son, Elian Gonzalez, unfairly and cruelly separated from our family
for over two months,'' Juan Miguel Gonzalez wrote in a letter sent to foreign
news agencies early today by the government's International Press Center.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter was dated Thursday and addressed to Reno and U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service commissioner, Doris Meissner. The INS ruled Jan. 5 that
only the father has the right to speak for the boy and said Elian should be
returned to him in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Reno and President Clinton backed that decision, but Elian's
repatriation has been blocked by legal maneuvers of the child's Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been at the center of an international custody battle since
shortly after being rescued from an inner tube off the Florida coast on Nov. 25.
The boy's mother and 10 other people died when the boat carrying them from Cuba
to the United States sank.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian is staying with his paternal great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez, who is
fighting to keep the boy with him in the United States. The boy's father wants
Elian to stay with Lazaro's brother Manolo, who has said he supports the child's
return to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Elian has been under constant harassment and pressure from politicians,
journalists, lawyers, publicity agents and others unrelated to his family,''
Gonzalez wrote in the letter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The boy has been forced to pose for TV cameras day and night with people
he does not know and who are unscrupulously manipulating him,'' he wrote. ``That
rude invasion of his privacy and disrespect for his childhood innocence should
cease immediately and you should guarantee that such things do not happen
again.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gonzalez made his requests, ``as a father whose full and exclusive parental
rights you have recognized.''
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to returning the boy and moving him to Manolo Gonzalez's home
until such repatriation takes place, Juan Miguel Gonzalez also demanded ``that
an end be immediately put to harassment, manipulation, psychological pressures
and the violation of my son Elian's privacy.''
</P>
<P>
	   He also asked for the names and backgrounds of any and all psychologists who
are reportedly caring for the boy, as well as any treatment and medications
prescribed.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's mental health has been an insistent theme in Cuba, where a group of
mental health experts gathered for a program on state television Thursday night
to express their concerns that his intellectual development had been blocked by
an unstable home and school life in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   The Miami relatives have fought to block the earlier U.S. government ruling
in favor of the father, and the U.S. immigration agency has agreed to let the
final decision be made later this month by a federal judge in Miami.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani attacks first lady's air travel as reports detail money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Rudolph Giuliani blasted Hillary Rodham Clinton for
failing to reimburse taxpayers adequately for her campaign travel on Air Force
jets.
<P>
	   Newly released campaign finance reports reveal that the Clinton camp paid
the federal government $34,000 for dozens of trips to New York in recent months
related to her U.S. Senate campaign. Giuliani's campaign said that is well below
the actual costs of travel. Estimates place the cost of Air Force C-20's, like
the one Clinton uses to travel to New York, at about $20,000 a trip.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'd like that deal," the Republican mayor said in Brooklyn on Thursday. "If
you can get that deal for you and your family, take it, because Disneyland, here
I come!"
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's campaign is required by law to reimburse the government at the
rate of first-class commercial travel, spokesman Howard Wolfson has said. The
Secret Service advised the first lady to continue to travel on government jets
for security reasons, Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Given the fact that he's running his campaign out of City Hall at taxpayer
expense it's hard to take his latest tantrum seriously," Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
	   The voluminous campaign reports, which run thousands of pages and together
measure more than a foot high, also showed that both candidates spent large sums
of money on direct-mail fund-raising efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani, whose mailers have taken shots at the first lady by calling her
"leader of the ultra-left wing," spent about $1.3 million on six Virginia-based
companies for direct-mail services. More than $800,000 went to American Target
Advertising, a Manassas, Va.-based firm operated by Richard Viguerie, who is
renowned for his fund raising on behalf of conservatives such as Sen. Jesse
Helms of North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton spent more $500,000 on direct mailing of her own and close to $1
million on political and fund-raising consultants.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, Clinton raised $8 million over six months and has $4.7 million cash
on hand. She spent $3.3 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani took in $8.8 million in the last six months, which combined with
the money he had already raised brought him to $11.5 million. He has $7.4
million cash on hand and he spent $4.3 million last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Individual donors to each candidate read like a who's who list. In a sign of
the clear national interest in the race, contributions poured in from across the
country.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton drew heavily from Hollywood types - Tom Cruise, Sean "Puffy" Combs,
Barbara Streisand and Tom Hanks were among her contributors. Also donating the
maximum $2,000 to Clinton's campaign was Walter Kaye, a Whitewater grand jury
witness who recommended Monica Lewinsky for her job as a White House intern.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani's donor list was a bit less star-studded but contained business
heavyweights such as General Electric Chairman Jack Welch and Revlon billionaire
Ronald Perelman.
</P>
<P>
	   Both campaigns benefitted from political action committees, which can accept
contributions of up to $10,000. Giuliani received $245,311 and Clinton $219,925.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani received lots of checks from the financial services industry which
call New York City home, including Arthur Anderson, Chase Manhattan, Keycorp and
PriceWaterhouseCoopers. He also took in a hefty amount of cash from the
pharmaceutical industry. Pfizer, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Glaxo Wellcome all
contributed thousands of dollars. Log Cabin Republicans, a group supporting gays
in the GOP, gave Giuliani the maximum $10,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor, who had supported an unsuccessful attempt to have gambling on
Governor's Island, also drew large contributions from the gambling industry on a
fund-raising jaunt to Las Vegas. Mirage Resorts donated $9,870 and Harrah's
chipped in $2,500.
</P>
<P>
	   Through leadership committees, Republican lawmakers also padded Giuliani's
bank accounts. Former New York Sen. Alfonse D'Amato gave the mayor $2,000.
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott gave him $1,000 and Republican National
Senatorial Committee Chairman Mitch McConnell chipped in $5,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The bulk of Clinton's PAC money came from a laundry list of unions. Giving
the maximum $10,000 were the Amalgamated Transit Union, the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and the Communication Workers of America. Also
contributing were the American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees; the AFL-CIO and the National Association of Letter Carriers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Association of Trial Lawyers also gave Clinton the maximum $10,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the Democratic lawmakers donating to Clinton's campaign were
Connecticut Sen. Christopher Dodd, who gave $1,000 and New York Reps. Gary
Ackerman and Carolyn Maloney, who each donated $1,000. Clinton has held fund
raisers for both New York lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Both the Giuliani and Clinton campaigns got money from General Electric and
Ernst and Young. GE gave $4,225 to Giuliani and $2,500 to Clinton. Ernst and
Young gave $10,000 to each.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton is set to formally enter the Senate race Sunday and kick off her
campaign with a tour around the state. It is unclear when Giuliani will
officially enter the race.

<HEADLINE> Revised Dietary Guidelines for U.S.  </HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP BRASHER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is trying a more upbeat approach to
getting Americans to eat right and watch their weight. Proposed new dietary
guidelines call eating ``one of life's greatest pleasures'' and urge consumers
to ``be flexible and adventurous'' in picking foods.
</P>
<P>
	   The guidelines, which were developed by a panel of 11 nutrition experts,
don't make any major changes in recommendations from the existing version but
include special sections for the first time on whole grains and food safety and
expanded advice on weight control.
</P>
<P>
	   They also provide more specific choices of foods and ways to prepare them,
while advising consumers not to ``overdo on fat (especially saturated fat),
sugars, salt and alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
	   The guidelines were first published in 1980 and are revised every five years
to reflect the latest developments in scientific research. Federally funded
nutrition programs are required to adhere to the recommendations, and they are
also widely used by professionals and dietitians in advising clients.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They've done a really nice job of developing guidelines that are really
user-friendly and correspond with what we know from the current literature,''
said Cyndi Thompson, a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association.
</P>
<P>
	   The departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services are to take
public comment on the revised version before making it final later this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The new guidelines include some subtle changes in wording meant to make it
easier for consumers to adhere to the maximum recommended fat intake while
emphasizing that consumers should cut down on the saturated fats found in meat
and dairy products.
</P>
<P>
	   The current guidelines on fat recommend that people follow a diet that is
low in total fat. The new recommendation is for a diet that is ``moderate in
total fat,'' but low in saturated fat and cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
	   Research by the food industry indicates consumers are put off by the term
low-fat and see a moderate-fat diet as easier to follow, even if the fat content
is the same. The recommended maximum fat intake is still 30 percent of total
calories, or 65 grams a day in a 2,000 calorie diet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What they're trying to do is come up with wording that is positive and has
some degree of hope,'' said Thompson, a nutrition expert at the University of
Arizona. ``They're trying to say: Be moderate, be sensible, that all foods can
fit into a healthy diet, you just can't overconsume.''
</P>
<P>
	   The meat industry doesn't like the change in wording, fearing that it will
put a stigma on beef and pork.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We believe it's a real unfair implication,'' said Al Tank, chief executive
officer of the National Pork Producers Council. ``The implication is that you
should avoid all foods of animal origin.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Food choices should not be just about the amount of fat consumed,'' said
Mary K. Young, executive director, nutrition, at the National Cattlemen's Beef
Association. ``Food choices should take into account the important nutrients in
foods that are needed for healthy diets.'' She said beef is a good source of
iron, zinc, protein and B vitamins.
</P>
<P>
	   Groups representing vegetarians and racial minorities say the advisory
committee that wrote the revision is biased toward the meat and dairy industries
and filed suit to block the government from using the guidelines. A judge
refused last week to block the committee's work from being released.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: Moscow May Exploit Dispute  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- Russia and China, the staunchest opponents of
American efforts to develop a nationwide defense against missile attacks, are
likely to use European doubts about the project as a way of dividing Washington
from its NATO allies, Defense Secretary William Cohen predicted.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen made the statement Thursday in an interview en route to Munich where
he will attend a weekend conference on European security that is expected to
focus in part on the contentious missile defense issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen acknowledged the NATO allies' misgivings. He said some fear the
project could lead to a dismantling of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, a
cornerstone of Cold War-era arms control. He predicted Russia and China will use
that issue to drive a wedge between Washington and its allies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would anticipate that the Russians and Chinese will try to dissuade our
European allies from endorsing or embracing the project, to try to find
weaknesses and differences of opinion and try to exploit those,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said he nonetheless remained hopeful of winning Russian agreement to
amend the ABM treaty to permit deployment of a limited national missile defense.
If the Russians did not agree to such changes the Clinton administration would
be faced with the choice of withdrawing from the treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton is scheduled to decide this summer whether to commit the
United States to deploying a missile defense at an expected cost of $12.7
billion. The earliest it could be operating would be 2005.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said he thinks the Europeans' concerns will subside the more they
learn about the details of the missile defense plan. He said the Munich
conference could help get the U.S. message across.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a fear that somehow, if we have a limited system, that might
`decouple' our relationship with Europe,'' he said, referring to the
longstanding binds between U.S. and European security.
</P>
<P>
	   Among other expected topics at the Munich conference is lessons learned from
NATO's war over Kosovo, especially U.S. calls for the European nations to do
more to modernize their military forces.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen is scheduled to deliver a speech to the conference on Saturday and
hold separate meetings with his Italian and German counterparts. He said he
intended to raise with the Europeans the problem of a time and money lag in
building up police and other civilian institutions in Kosovo. The slow pace of
civilian reconstruction is putting an undue strain on the U.S. peacekeeping
troops there, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The message is coming in very loud and clear from the (U.S. Congress) that
European members must make their contributions'' as originally promised, Cohen
said. ``Otherwise we're going to have a successful military campaign and then
have the mission ultimately fail for lack of civilian implementation.''

<HEADLINE> President Asks To Preserve Tropics  </HEADLINE>
   By SONYA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Saying too many of the world's life forms are threatened
by logging and deforestation, President Clinton is asking Congress for $150
million to help preserve tropical forests in developing nations.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's budget plan for fiscal 2001 sets aside $150 million for a
``greening the globe'' initiative to help more than 60 countries in Africa, Asia
and Latin America conserve forests that are home to a diverse range of life
forms -- and that are now threatened by logging or other activities. That figure
represents an 88 percent increase over funding in the current budget.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House was announcing the initiative today.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal could help countries like Indonesia, the leading exporter of
tropical timber and home to about 10 percent of the world's primate species, or
Bolivia, where deforestation is a threat to the biological diversity of the
Amazon.
</P>
<P>
	   Tropical forests support more than half of the planet's life forms. But they
are disappearing at a rate of more than 50 acres a minute due to activity such
as illegal logging or deliberate land clearing for agriculture. That means about
100 different species are lost each day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Tropical forests continue to be destroyed at a disturbing rate,'' said
George Frampton, acting chairman of the White House Council on Environmental
Quality. ``The president feels strongly that the United States should do more to
stem this loss and to help developing countries strengthen their economies by
preserving their forests.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's plan was cheered by conservationists who say it would encourage
other nations and private entities to take up the cause.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the government states that this is a priority and invests more in it,
it sends a strong message to private donors, that they're doing the right thing,
and it catalyzes further investment,'' said Russ Mittermeier, president of
Conservation International.
</P>
<P>
	   Under Clinton's plan, $100 million would go to U.S. Agency for International
Development forest conservation programs. Another $37 million would be used to
reduce the debt of developing nations that commit to investing local currency in
forest conservation.
</P>
<P>
	   Another $10 million dollars would go into Forest Service research into
forest fire prevention and $3 million would be used to fund Fish and Wildlife
Service efforts to protect endangered elephants, tigers and rhinos in Asia and
Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also is proposing a new venture by USAID and National
Aeronautics and Space Administration to compile satellite maps of tropical
forests and monitor changes in them from outer space.

<HEADLINE> Progressive Caucus: Things Not Good  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN HUGHES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Happy times are here, right? The stock market keeps
climbing, unemployment is low, home ownership is high and inflation is low.
</P>
<P>
	   But on the day President Clinton proclaimed the state of the union ``is the
strongest it has ever been,'' a cadre of lawmakers who gathered in Room 2253 of
the Rayburn House Office Building insisted an awful lot is getting worse.
</P>
<P>
	   More people live in poverty than a decade ago, roughly 44 million lack
health insurance and people work longer for less pay, they said.
</P>
<P>
	   And that was just the beginning.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The United States has the largest-ever trade deficit ... meaning hundreds
of thousands of lost jobs,'' said Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore.
</P>
<P>
	   Millions of children are hungry. ``There is no excuse for that,'' said Rep.
Bernard Sanders, an independent from Vermont.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The least we can do is raise the minimum wage,'' pleaded Rep. David
Bonior, D-Mich., the House minority whip.
</P>
<P>
	   Welcome to the Progressive Caucus, a group of 53 mainly dyed-in-the-wool
liberals who fight for the downtrodden, defeated and dejected, focusing on
Depression-era issues during a high-tech economic boom.
</P>
<P>
	   They acknowledge the strong economy has boosted the standard of living for
many Americans, but say millions -- the homeless, impoverished and low-wage
earners -- have been left out.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The economy is booming because corporate America does a lousy job --
paying too many persons low wages,'' said Rep. Earl Hilliard, D-Ala.
</P>
<P>
	   The caucus was formed in 1991 to push universal health care, better
unemployment benefits, increased social spending and cuts in what the group
considers wasteful defense spending. There have been victories along the way,
such as two increases in the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
	   But many of the group's pet issues have languished for years, most notably
universal health care. Last year, progressives lost nearly three-fourths of the
121 House votes floor votes they considered crucial.
</P>
<P>
	   It's easy to see why. Clinton has moved to the political center in proposing
tax cuts and welfare reforms and the Republicans who control Congress are far
more conservative than any of the progressives.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Even our most moderate members would not have much if anything in common
with what's called the Progressive Caucus,'' said Rep. John Shadegg, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
	   But caucus members -- all House members except for Sen. Paul Wellstone,
D-Minn., who asked to join the group -- believe the tide will turn.
</P>
<P>
	   One caucus member, Rep. Jim McDermott, D-Wash., said the GOP-controlled
Congress is similar to the one that existed in the pre-Franklin Roosevelt years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In my view we're in about 1926. We're ripping up the safety net and doing
all these things that ultimately we'll have to deal with,'' he said. ``Things
always change. Things go up, things go down.''
</P>
<P>
	   A slim GOP majority in the House made all the more tenuous by nearly two
dozen pending retirements gives progressives hope that 2000 will be the year
Democrats re-take the chamber and give a boost to their initiatives. DeFazio,
the caucus chairman, said progressives would be one of the largest caucuses and
a formidable voting bloc in a Democratic House majority.
</P>
<P>
	   DeFazio is laying the groundwork for increased progressive clout -- creating
caucus rules and bylaws for the typically loose-knit group, lobbying Democratic
House leaders on key progressive issues and dedicating an area of his office Web
site to the progressive cause.
</P>
<P>
	   DeFazio is one of the original five who formed the group, along with
Sanders; Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif.; Rep. Lane Evans, D-Ill.; and then-Rep.
Ron Dellums, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats ran Congress at the time, but the members felt low voter turnout
and polls showing people felt alienated from the political process indicated a
need for the group and its issues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It seems to us that a key reason that the American people are giving up
... is that the Congress appears to be unable to confront the major problems
facing our nation,'' the members said in an organizing letter.
</P>
<P>
	   Nine years later, the message remains largely the same. And caucus members
believe voters are listening.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Tammy Baldwin, a first-term Democrat from Wisconsin and caucus member,
said a consultant warned her it was ``political suicide'' to campaign on
universal health care in 1998. She did anyway, and won.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is now time to put health care for all on top of our national agenda,''
Baldwin said.

<HEADLINE> Army Launches Recruitment Programs  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BRISCOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army is looking for high school dropouts to boost
recruitment, but it still plans to keep standards high by helping them get
diplomas and assisting those with high school degrees to go through a two-year
college course before they serve.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the Navy announced Thursday a $5,000 signing bonus for all new
recruits who can head for basic training by May 31. Larger bonuses are available
for applicants who qualify for certain jobs. Both services already offer other
plans to help pay for college.
</P>
<P>
	   One Army program, GED Plus, offers select non-graduates help in getting a
General Equivalency Diploma, which is considered equal to a high school degree,
before they go on active duty. Only 6,000 recruits will be offered the program.
</P>
<P>
	   The other new program, College Plus, provides recruits $150 a month or
reserve training pay, depending on where they enlist, to complete a two-year
college degree before serving. As part of the test, reserve service will be
mandatory at some enlistment centers. The program has no limit, but officials
expect it to attract about 5,000 college students.
</P>
<P>
	   In a reverse of the GI bill, which rewards service with help in education,
the college plan offers education upfront as an incentive for enlistment --
something previously available primarily to officer candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   There's a catch to both programs: Since they are tests, they are being
offered in limited areas of the country. Nothing, however, will prevent
applicants from crossing state lines to enlist. The two plans are expected to
boost Army recruitment by about 6,000, equal to last year's shortfall.
</P>
<P>
	   The equivalency degree program would cost only about $100 per recruit, since
it would take advantage of state programs that offer assistance to young people
who are too old to go back to high school but need a GED to be eligible for
military service. Overall, the two programs would cost about $6 million,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Many are ``minority and low-income youth who need a second chance, and who
have the desire and the ability to serve well and faithfully as soldiers in our
Army,'' said Army Secretary Louis Caldera.
</P>
<P>
	   He said recruitment at centers in such cities as San Antonio and Los
Angeles, where the GED Plus program will be available, will use
Spanish-languages ads.
</P>
<P>
	   But Hispanics won't be the only target.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are many young people in African-American, Native American, white
communities that fail to complete high school and also deserve to have that
second chance opportunity,'' Caldera said.
</P>
<P>
	   The new incentives can bring ``motivated young men and women back into the
world of learning and the world of success,'' said Education Secretary Richard
Riley, who endorsed both programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The Army has had difficulty selling the graduate equivalency program to the
Pentagon because other services are reluctant to use any incentive that might
decrease the quality of recruits.
</P>
<P>
	   But Caldera and retired Gen. Colin Powell, who also endorsed the plans,
insisted that won't happen, because recruits will still have to qualify through
strict screening and will go on active duty only when they have the equivalent
of a degree.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We should have no fear that in any way are we going to lower the standards
of the U.S. Army,'' Powell said at a Pentagon news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   To be eligible for help in obtaining the GED, recruits must score in the top
50 percent on a uniform military eligibility exam, score well in a motivational
test, have no waiver for drug or alcohol abuse and must have voluntarily left
high school and be too old to return.

<HEADLINE> FCC Chief Pushes Wireless Internet  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Faced with an unprecedented wave of industry mergers that
could forever alter how Americans get their phone, cable TV and Internet
services, the nation's top communications regulator says he has to resist being
bulldozed by those who want the deals approved quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a lot of pressure on our agency to just rubber stamp them all,''
Federal Communications Commission Chairman William Kennard said in an interview
with The Associated Press. ``We can't do that because these mergers are
fundamentally restructuring the telecommunications industry.''
</P>
<P>
	   In some cases, the FCC chief gives companies who are considering combining a
more concise warning: ``Don't even think about it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kennard, in a wide-ranging discussion with the AP on Thursday, also said he
has asked his staff to examine a rule that forbids companies from owning two or
more networks in certain combinations. If the FCC decides to relax that limit,
it could ease the way for the proposed merger between media titans CBS and
Viacom -- which also owns a half-interest in the UPN network.
</P>
<P>
	   The FCC chief said it's important to look at whether such restrictions are
relevant in today's market, where broadcasters are competing with services such
as the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   Broadcasters ``feel that they're being assaulted by all these new
technologies,'' Kennard said. ``The business has been so carefully protected by
government. Now, some of the bets are off and everyone's nervous.''
</P>
<P>
	   The FCC also is currently looking at combinations between two leading
long-distance companies, MCI and Sprint; cable companies AT&AMP;T and MediaOne; and
local phone companies Bell Atlantic and GTE, among others.
</P>
<P>
	   Laying out a vision for the future, Kennard said he wants to spread wireless
technology across the country quickly to revolutionize Americans' daily life,
from the Internet and movies to cars and kitchen appliances. Internet delivery
by means of wireless devices such as cellular phones or hand-held computers
opens new doors for consumers, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's going to further democratize the Internet. It's going to make it
available to people who can't afford a $5,000 PC in their home,'' Kennard said.
</P>
<P>
	   To promote that goal, the FCC has set a spring date to auction valuable
portions of the airwaves that many companies see as ``prime real estate'' for
delivering wireless Internet service to people on the road and in their homes.
</P>
<P>
	   Kennard also predicted a sea change in the way Americans watch television, a
revolution that will be pushed along as the industry makes its transition from
analog to digital. Digital TV allows broadcasters to squeeze more video and data
into existing channel space. They could use it to provide sharper pictures or
offer additional TV channels for sports or movies, or stock quotes and other
data transmitted to home computers.
</P>
<P>
	   But so far, the road to digital TV has been rocky, because of wrangling over
standards to make the new digital systems compatible with cable TV. That's
important because most Americans get their TV via cable. Kennard has set an
April 1 deadline for the industry to arrive at a solution or the FCC will
intervene.
</P>
<P>
	   Next Thursday, Kennard said, he is going to ask the other commissioners to
consider digital compatibility rules that have been drafted to ensure that there
will be a standard in place by April.
</P>
<P>
	   Kennard predicted consumers will increasingly use devices such as personal
video recorders that enable them to sort and arrange TV programs to their
liking.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today, television is sort of a passive exercise,'' Kennard said. ``That's
going to be seen as very much of an anachronism in the future.''
</P>
<P>
	   In turn, the current structure of time slots and scheduled programming will
crumble, as people can watch their selected shows on demand.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The whole economic model of the network is going to change pretty
dramatically,'' Kennard said, ``because it's not going to be a world in which
networks compete to get a certain audience level at a certain period of time.
It's going to be about delivering a certain quality of demographics 24 hours a
day.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kennard, the agency's first black chairman, also added his to the voices of
minority leaders who have complained about the lack of diversity in network TV
programming.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You turn on prime-time television, and it's like you're living in another
country,'' said Kennard. ``It just doesn't reflect who we are. That's a
problem.''

<HEADLINE> Haider Coalition To Be Sworn In  </HEADLINE>
   By ROLAND PRINZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- With Europe's biggest far-right party about to enter
office in Austria, its controversial leader Joerg Haider went on the offensive
against the country's president, who has shown distaste at having to swear in
the new government.
</P>
<P>
	   President Thomas Klestil has made it clear that he displeased with a
government including Haider's Freedom Party, which has raised an international
storm over its strident anti-foreigner platform and Haider's past praise for
some Nazi policies.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Klestil is to swear in today the coalition of the Freedom Party and
conservative Austrian People's Party.
</P>
<P>
	   Reaction to Austria's lurch to the right has been swift. Immediately once
the coalition is sworn in, the European Union will impose sanctions to isolate
Austria, one of its own members. Israel has recalled its ambassador and banned
Haider from visiting.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 2,000 protesters against Haider took to the streets of Vienna late
Thursday for a second straight night. A group of them pushed their way into the
city's historic Burgtheater and stormed the stage in the middle of a
performance, calling on the audience to join a protest rally today before
fleeing the building.
</P>
<P>
	   President Klestil, approving the coalition Thursday, said the results of the
Oct. 3 parliamentary elections give him little choice but to swear it in.
</P>
<P>
	   But he has done what he can to make the bitter pill more palatable.
</P>
<P>
	   He rejected two Cabinet nominees from Haider's Freedom Party. One of them,
Hilmar Kabas of the party's Vienna chapter, had authorized distribution of
campaign posters in the capital warning of ``over-foreignization,'' a term which
harkened back to the Nazi era.
</P>
<P>
	   He also forced Haider and People's Party leader Wolfgang Schuessel to sign a
statement renouncing the nation's Nazi past and promising to respect European
values.
</P>
<P>
	   In the document, Haider and Schuessel pledged to work for an Austria where
``xenophobia, anti-Semitism and racism have no place'' and to oppose ``every way
of thinking which seeks to denigrate human beings.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Austria accepts her responsibility arising out of the tragic history of
the 20th century and the horrendous crimes of the National Socialist regime,''
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   In response, Haider went on the offensive Thursday, calling the removal of
Kabas from the Cabinet unjust and denouncing the president for forcing him to
sign the document.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is an affront for the (Austrian) public that such matters of course
have to be signed time and again,'' Haider told the German TV station ZDF.
</P>
<P>
	   He insisted his party was committed to defending the rights of ``ethnic and
religious minorities.'' He said his opponents must realize ``we are a very
democratic party which stands on the foundation of the constitution.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have no intention to wander about in the world and apologize for all
kinds of things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider won international notoriety -- and later apologized -- for statements
praising Adolf Hitler's ``orderly employment'' policies and lauding veterans of
the Waffen SS as ``decent people of good character.'' He has also opposed EU
expansion and urged a near halt to immigration.
</P>
<P>
	   In the new coalition, Schuessel will become chancellor and Susanne
Riess-Passer of the Freedom Party will be vice chancellor.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Haider will remain governor of Carinthia state and hold no Cabinet
post, he has a strong grip on the Freedom Party. Critics doubt Schuessel, whose
hold on his own party is less firm, can control the mercurial Haider.
</P>
<P>
	   German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping said during a visit to Israel that
the declaration ``sounds like lip service'' and that Austria is making ``a
historic mistake.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Representative Council of Jewish Institutions in France called the
Austrian developments a ``political shame without precedent in Europe since the
end of the second World War.''
</P>
<P>
	   Israel did not post an ambassador to Austria from 1986 to 1992, during the
presidency of Kurt Waldheim, who was dogged by allegations of involvement in
Nazi persecution in the Balkans during World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider's party won 52 seats in the 183 member parliament, as did the
center-right People's Party. The Social Democrats, the main party in the
outgoing coalition, took 65 seats -- too few to govern alone.

White House Presses ATF Powers
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton plans to release a report Friday
backing up the White House claim that a small number of gun dealers are
responsible for putting a large number of guns in the hands of criminals. The
Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms study shows 1 percent of gun dealers
account for 57 percent of guns the ATF can trace from use in a crime back to the
point the gun was sold, said deputy domestic policy adviser Eric Liu. With that
in mind, Liu said the administration will extend the ATF's powers to check up on
possible rogue dealers and trace stolen guns.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Navy Detains Russian Tanker  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Iraq has been able to supplement a U.N.-approved oil
sales program with a contraband scheme that averages 100,000 barrels a day,
according to the State Department.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokesman James Foley discussed the operation Thursday after the Navy
detained a Russian oil tanker in the Persian Gulf on suspicion that it was
smuggling Iraqi oil in violation of U.N. Security Council economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq is banned from most international commerce but is allowed to export up
to $5.2 billion in oil every six months in order to buy food, medicine and other
essentials for its people, and spare parts for its oil industry.
</P>
<P>
	   Foley said the Clinton administration has been in contact with Russian
officials for almost a month about the smuggling of Iraqi oil.
</P>
<P>
	   The seizure of the tanker called attention to the recent mushrooming of
illicit oil sales by Iraq. Such exports average 100,000 barrels a day, compared
with 50,000 barrels in 1998, when oil prices were much lower, Foley said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Navy said it planned to divert and retain control of the merchant vessel
Volga-Neft-147, pending a decision on whether to seize the oil.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russians said the oil came from Iran, not Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. and allied ships are tightening enforcement of the U.N. embargo to
counteract a surge in Iraqi oil smuggling, Defense Secretary William Cohen said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   While Russian vessels increasingly have been involved, there is no immediate
indication of a direct connection to the Russian government, Cohen said in an
interview en route to Munich, Germany, where he will attend a weekend conference
on European security issues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Overall there has been an increase on the part of Iraq to intensify its
smuggling operations, and we're going to have to simply intensify our own
intervention to prevent that,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he thinks Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein, ``will do whatever he
can to try to circumvent the sanctions. If he can get away with it, if there's a
laxity on the enforcement part, then he will seek to exploit it.''
</P>
<P>
	   The vessel was commandeered off the coast of the United Arab Emirates on
Wednesday by the guided missile cruiser USS Monterey. The Pentagon said
cooperation from the ship's master and crew was excellent.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. ship was part of a multinational maritime interception force that
enforces the 9-year-old U.N. embargo against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1990, Foley said, the MIF has queried via radio more than 28,000
vessels and has boarded more than 12,000. About 700 have been diverted for
violating U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In 1999, there were 2,422 queries, 700 boardings and 19 diversions to
various ports of call,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The last time a Russian-flagged vessel was boarded was Aug. 31, 1998, he
said, adding that the last actual diversion of such a ship occurred eight months
earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Rear Adm. Craig Quigley told Pentagon reporters the Volga-Neft-147 carried
gas oil, a refined petroleum product. He said a sample could provide clues to
the oil's source.
</P>
<P>
	   Foley said the talks with Russian officials focused on the MIF's suspicions
regarding activities of vessels belonging to certain Russian companies.

<HEADLINE> Kids Write Stories for Canadian TV  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM COHEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   REGINA, Saskatchewan (AP) -- Kids writing for kids -- that simple idea,
hatched over beers after a movie seven years ago, has become an award-winning
Canadian television show broadcast in more than a dozen countries.
</P>
<P>
	   The Incredible Story Studio makes 10-minute television shorts of stories
written by teen-agers. Each half-hour episode comprises two stories, plus a
brief profile of the authors, all hosted by a teen-age ``studio boss.''
</P>
<P>
	   With titles such as Intergalactic Geeks and Game Show Paradise, the stories
combine the imagination of children with realities of daily life, such as
sibling rivalry and peer pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia Thompson, who created the show with her husband, Robert de Lint,
said its deeper goal was to inspire kids to write stories. Those who participate
also get a 68-page writing manual, which explains classic storytelling through
elements, such as protagonist and epiphany, while prodding the development of
ideas.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you allow kids to express themselves and give them creative freedom,
you're going to get something that's really unique,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
	   In one show, Game Show Paradise, a big brother gets thrust into the world of
his little sister's favorite computer game, where he is forced to see life from
her point-of-view.
</P>
<P>
	   The show's author, Ivan Macdonald, 14, said the story had been inspired by
his bickering over computer time with his sister, Averi, 9. In the end of the
story, the brother realizing he's been a jerk.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Originally I didn't want the epiphany,'' Macdonald said, the word sounding
like part of his everyday vocabulary. ``I thought they should hate each other in
the end. But characters have to change.''
</P>
<P>
	   Launched in 1998 in the prairie capital of Regina, Incredible Story Studio
is now shown throughout Canada, as well as on the Discovery Kids network in the
United States, on Disney Channels in Europe, and on Nickelodeon in Australia and
New Zealand. Other national and regional broadcasters air the programs in
Israel, parts of Latin America, and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   All the stories in the first three seasons were written by Canadian kids.
Thompson hopes to have four stories from Britain and four from France among the
26 planned for the fourth season -- to be produced later this year at a cost of
$3.4 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The Disney Channel has purchased the right to broadcast the show in Britain,
France and Germany, and is spending a ``significant'' amount of money to market
the concept in Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   Already, more than 4,000 teachers in Britain have requested free copies of
the Incredible Story Studio writing workshop manual, modified to the British
creative-writing curriculum, Bredin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Thompson and de Lint first came up with the idea of having kids write their
own shows after they saw the movie ``Sleepless in Seattle'' in 1993. Sipping
beers afterward, they talked about the powerful role of the film's child
character, who brings the two adults together, Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
	   The conversation evolved into an idea for a new kind of television show that
would nurture the creativity of children, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're teaching kids to write and be creative all over the world, and that
is the coolest thing,'' said Thompson, a veteran of the award-winning Degrassi
television series in Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   That idea has since been awarded the Children's Choice Award at the 1999
Alliance for Children and Television Awards of Excellence and the Silver Screen
Award at the U.S. International Film and Video Festival.
</P>
<P>
	   More telling are the e-mails from kids around the world asking how they can
write stories for the show, said Wendy Anderson, who oversees the Web site
www.storystudio.com.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It speaks for kids, to kids,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Study: Kids Suffer When Off Welfare  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID HO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Moving off welfare and into the work force can be
traumatic for single mothers, but their children can also suffer by receiving
poor child care that provides little stimulation or direction from adults,
researchers say.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The welfare rolls are shrinking, but the number of toddlers placed in poor
child care is expanding,'' said Bruce Fuller, co-author of a study examining the
impact of welfare reform on nearly a thousand single mothers and their children.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of those receiving poor care spent hours watching television with
little exposure to reading or educational materials, according to the study
released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Beginning in 1994, strict new rules and a vibrant economy caused welfare
rolls to shrink. The number of welfare families, mostly single mothers and their
children, fell from more than 5 million in 1994 to half as many last year.
</P>
<P>
	   During the second half of 1998, researchers from Yale University and the
University of California, Berkeley, randomly selected single mothers who had
recently enrolled in welfare programs. About a third went to work during the
six-month study.
</P>
<P>
	   The families lived in or near one of five cities: San Francisco or San Jose,
Calif.; Manchester or New Haven, Conn.; and Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers interviewed the mothers, visited their child care providers
and studied the children's early language and social skills.
</P>
<P>
	   While centers receiving federal or state funding cared for a third of the
children, most of the children were cared for in homes by family, friends or
baby sitters.
</P>
<P>
	   Fuller said that in the centers, 65 percent of the teachers or caregivers
had some training beyond high school, while in the homes only 39 percent had
higher education.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The education of the adult the child spends his or her day with is one of
the strongest predictors of child development,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The home care environments were also more likely to be disorganized, unclean
and lacking educational materials.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal government gives about $3 billion to the states each year for
child care subsidies, which can be used for professional providers or even
family members who take care of the children. But many families don't take
advantage of the aid because they simply don't know they're eligible and the
program is often confusing, Fuller said.
</P>
<P>
	   In California and Florida, the researchers found that only half of all
eligible women studied drew child care subsidies, including slots in centers and
vouchers. In Connecticut, where nearly four out of five children were cared for
in homes, only 13 percent of eligible mothers received aid.
</P>
<P>
	   Other studies also have found low participation among former welfare
recipients in child care programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Ellen Schwentke, 41, a San Francisco mother who participated in the study
and was on welfare for three years, said it took more than six months to find
child care.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a catch-22. You can't work if you don't have child care and you
can't get child care if you're not working,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the study, Ellen has married and gotten a job as programmer, and her
daughter Nicole has had steady care in a center.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have a really great life,'' she said. ``But I had to fight for every
bit of it and I don't feel like I got a lot of help.''
</P>
<P>
	   The study also found:
</P>
<P>
	   --The proportion of mothers in the study experiencing depression was about
three times higher than the national average.
</P>
<P>
	   --The researchers said they detected delays in the language development of
participating toddlers and preschoolers in California and Florida, but these
problems could not be directly linked to welfare reform.
</P>
<P>
	   --One in five of the mothers said their household includes one member with
an alcohol or drug abuse problem.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These deeper problems facing poor women and their preschoolers are not
solely attributable to welfare reform,'' Yale researcher Sharon Lynn Kagan said.
``But the fact is that single mothers, now under pressure to leave home and find
a job, are finding only mediocre child care at best.''

<HEADLINE> Strike Shuts Down Israeli Airport  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's international airport was closed for four hours
until early Friday when striking workers stopped planes from taking off and
refused to unload planes that landed during the walkout.
</P>
<P>
	   Outgoing flights were delayed until the morning, and incoming passengers had
to return to the airport for their luggage. El Al Israel Airlines canceled its
Thursday night flight to Bangkok, since its planes do not fly on the Jewish
Sabbath, and the flight would not have arrived before sundown Friday, Israel
radio reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Workers were upset with plans by airport authorities to reward management
with bonus payments for efficiency steps. They claimed the steps came at their
expense. Hanna Oxenberg, a union leader, said 50 workers have been fired so far.
</P>
<P>
	   Pini Shiff, deputy director of the Airport Authority, denounced the
strikers. He said there was no intention to give bonuses to management. He said
the strike ended with an agreement to rehire 15 workers.

<HEADLINE> Weather the Winner at Pebble Beach  </HEADLINE>
    By ROB GLOSTER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- Lee Janzen had stayed away since 1996, when the
tournament was canceled after 36 soggy holes.
</P>
<P>
	   After two sunny days of practice earlier this week, he wondered why it had
taken him so long to return.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, in the first round of the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach Pro-Am, he
remembered why.
</P>
<P>
	   Heavy rain and wind strong enough to snap tree branches washed out the first
day of this year's tournament after a few holes, forcing organizers to extend
the tournament to Monday and continuing the event's tradition of weather woes.
</P>
<P>
	   "This morning I woke up and heard the wind whistling through my window at
the hotel room, so I knew we would be in for a fun day," said Janzen, who got
through only five holes Thursday. "It's tough to really look at it as a
legitimate golf tournament when the conditions are like this."
</P>
<P>
	   Balls were blown around the greens by wind up to 40 mph as players prepared
to putt. Puddles formed on the course. No player got in more than 12 holes, and
tournament officials once again were forced to scramble.
</P>
<P>
	   "This doesn't really do anything to convince me to keep coming back," Janzen
said. "If anything, it solidifies why I haven't come back, just because the rain
makes it so tough -- you can't get any rounds in, you can't get a tournament
in."
</P>
<P>
	   Lousy weather has cut short or wiped out this tournament three times in the
past four years. Officials planned to complete the first round today and then
hoped to get in the full 72 holes by playing through Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   But more rain was in the forecast.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a large storm out there," acknowledged PGA Tour tournament director
Mark Russell, "but they've missed on forecasts before."
</P>
<P>
	   The storm stopped Tiger Woods, who is seeking his sixth straight PGA Tour
victory, after 10 holes on Poppy Hills on Thursday. Woods was even par through
10 holes and four strokes off the lead when the weather prevailed.
</P>
<P>
	   He is trying to become the first player since Ben Hogan in 1948 to win six
in a row.
</P>
<P>
	   David Duval was the leader at 4-under, and Vijay Singh was 3-under through
just five holes at Poppy Hills. Jack Nicklaus, playing for the last time in the
tournament he was won three times, got through only one hole with a foursome
that included two of his sons.
</P>
<P>
	   "We reached a point where everybody had problems keeping the ball on the
green," Russell said. "You had problems standing up, let alone playing golf. You
just can't play golf like that, it's not golf."
</P>
<P>
	   For Nicklaus, this weekend's tournament is a sentimental journey and a
family affair. But he's also here to compete and to work on his game, looking
ahead to the U.S. Open to be held at Pebble Beach in mid-June. Nicklaus won the
1972 U.S. Open at Pebble Beach.
</P>
<P>
	   Nicklaus is fully recovered from hip-replacement surgery that sidelined him
for much of 1999. But he has the nagging aches and pains of most people his age.
</P>
<P>
	   After playing just one hole Thursday, Nicklaus moaned softly and stretched
out on a wood bench alongside the 11th tee. His lower back was aching, and other
parts of his 60-year-old body were feeling pretty sore as well.
</P>
<P>
	   "You're not going to get back up, Jack," chided a white-haired spectator.
</P>
<P>
	   "Maybe I'll just take a nap," Nicklaus shot back.

<HEADLINE> Governor to propose cut in gasoline tax  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Gov. John G. Rowland will propose a cut of up to
7 cents in the state's gasoline tax during his budget address next week,
administration officials said.
<P>
	   The tax is currently the highest in the nation at 32 cents per gallon.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the new fiscal year does not begin until July 1, Rowland will push
for a cut sooner because of the recent spike in gasoline prices, officials said.
The state's growing budget surplus, which was most recently projected at $240
million, would provide the extra money to cover the cut in the current fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
	   "The governor thinks he has found a way to substantially reduce the gas
tax," said Dean Pagani, Rowland's spokesman. "He thinks any gas-tax cut has to
be bigger than 2 or 3 cents to have any impact on the driving public."
</P>
<P>
	   The governor's plan would move programs currently paid for by the gasoline
tax, including a large portion of the Department of Motor Vehicles budget, to
the general fund which currently has a surplus, WTNH-TV reported, citing sources
it did not identify.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan would have to be approved by the Legislature, and Democrats who
control both houses have already said they oppose cutting the tax this year.
</P>
<P>
	   "We spend the money we get from the gas tax on the infrastructure of
highways and roads around the state," House Majority Leader Dave Pudlin,
D-Hartford, said last month. "To deprive us of that money I'm not sure is such a
good idea."
</P>
<P>
	   If a 7-cent cut is enacted, Connecticut's tax would be 25 cents per gallon,
compared with 29.8 cents in New York, 29 cents in Rhode Island, 21.5 cents in
Massachusetts, and 14.5 cents in New Jersey, based on the latest statistics.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael J. Fox, the president of the Connecticut gasoline retailers
organization, is not optimistic that the plan will pass.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't see the political will to do a 7-cent cut, although it would be
appreciated," said Fox, a Mobil retailer in Stamford. "I don't think the
legislature would go for it."

<HEADLINE> Uranium Co. Cutting 850 Workers  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHERINE RIZZO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Energy Secretary Bill Richardson says he'll try to find
work for the hundreds of workers scheduled to lose their jobs at the nation's
uranium enrichment plants.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Enrichment Corp. announced Thursday that it plans to cut 850 jobs,
22 percent of the workforce, from its plants in Ohio and Kentucky where uranium
is prepared for nuclear power plants.
</P>
<P>
	   Buyouts moved 250 people off the payroll at each plant last year, but USEC
said more cutbacks were needed because its costs were too high and a deal to
handle uranium salvaged from Soviet-era warheads was turning out to be less
profitable than expected.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is well known that increased global oversupply of enrichment and strong
competition have resulted in increasing pressure on us to further reduce our
labor costs,'' said Jim Miller, a USEC executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   The company expects to save $39 million with the latest round of cuts, which
are to begin in July.
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson said in a statement that he thought many workers at the
Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Ohio and the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion
Plant in Kentucky could move into other jobs at the same work sites, cleaning up
radioactive and chemical contamination.
</P>
<P>
	   Both facilities are highly polluted because environmental concerns took a
back seat to production during the Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
	   USEC said it would seek volunteers before imposing involuntary layoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   About 2,100 people work at the Ohio plant, making it one of southern Ohio's
largest employers. About 1,700 work at the Kentucky facility.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said it intended to reduce costs at the company's headquarters
in Bethesda, Md., but no layoffs were announced among the 160 people who work
there.
</P>
<P>
	   This was the latest in a series of retrenchments for USEC, which used to be
part of the government before it was spun off in 1998 in a $1.9 billion stock
sale.
</P>
<P>
	   USEC's stock, initially $14.25 per share, has fallen steadily and closed
unchanged Thursday at $5.87 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   USEC said the quarterly dividend its pays investors will be cut in half from
27.5 cents. It also will announced plans to buy back 20 million more shares of
stock, increasing the total buyback to 30 million shares by June 2001.

<HEADLINE> Lewis' Lawyer Contests Warrant  </HEADLINE>
    By CHAD ROEDEMEIER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- Ray Lewis' lawyer contests an arrest warrant that says the
Pro Bowl linebacker "repeatedly stabbed" two victims who were killed in a brawl
at a Super Bowl party.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis was unaware two men had been killed in a brawl when he and others left
the party in a limousine, defense attorney Ed Garland said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Garland blames overaggressive police work for the arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have confidence that the police and the prosecution, when presented with
evidence they did not have, will realize that Ray had nothing to do with causing
the unfortunate deaths that occurred in this case," Garland said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis, 24, is charged with the slayings early Monday following a post-Super
Bowl party at a club in Atlanta's Buckhead entertainment district. He is being
held in jail until a bond hearing, which is scheduled for Feb. 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Garland said Lewis did not know about the stabbing of the two Decatur men --
Richard Lollar, 24, and Jacinth "Shorty" Baker, 21 -- until he heard news
reports hours later.
</P>
<P>
	   "When he left that scene, he did not know a stabbing had taken place," said
Garland, who joined Lewis' defense team Wednesday. "He did not have a knife, he
did not use a knife, he did not engage in a fight, he did not promote in any way
a fight," Garland said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said they were looking for two men they believe were riding in Lewis'
rented limousine, which reportedly was seen speeding away from the scene of the
stabbings.
</P>
<P>
	   A.J. Johnson and Kwame King are wanted for questioning, but are not
necessarily suspects, Atlanta police spokesman John Quigley said Thursday.
Johnson is a former University of Maryland player who had a tryout with the
Miami Dolphins, and King grew up in Lewis' hometown of Lakeland, Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   "We believe they were present in the limousine, and we're interested in
anybody that was with the limousine at that time," Quigley said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Johnson told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that, despite a police
statement Thursday, he was not in Lewis' limousine after the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson told the newspaper he knew Lewis through another friend on the
Ravens, but watched the game on television with his girlfriend and three other
friends at his Maryland apartment. He said he had not heard from Atlanta police
as of Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if Lewis knows who killed the men, Garland said: "His vision, his
location, what he saw, I will go into at a future time. But he does have some
limited knowledge."
</P>
<P>
	   Garland said he will interview all of the people who were with Lewis when he
got into the limousine rented in Maryland. He said there were at least eight
people who joined Lewis' party, but declined to identify any of them.
</P>
<P>
	   He said four or five shots were fired at the limousine as it drove away, but
he was unaware of any shots fired from inside the car, as witnesses had
reported. Lewis knows of no one inside the limousine who had a gun, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Quigley said a judge signed an arrest warrant only after he determined there
was sufficient probable cause that Lewis was involved in the crime.
</P>
<P>
	   In the motion for bond, Garland told the court that Lewis had no prior
record for any violent offenses and had never been convicted of a felony.
</P>
<P>
	   The Miami Herald reported Thursday that Lewis has been investigated twice,
but never charged, on allegations that he beat up two pregnant girlfriends while
he was at the University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first case in 1994, Lewis was accused of assaulting Tatyana McCall
while she was pregnant, but she refused to press charges. In the second case in
1995, the state's attorney in Dade County dropped the charges for insufficient
proof of a crime.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis also faces second-degree assault charges in connection with a Nov. 30
incident at a Baltimore-area bar in which he allegedly hit a woman. But Howard
Merker, deputy state's attorney for Baltimore County, said the case will not go
to trial if the charge cannot be substantiated.
</P>
<P>
	   Even if Lewis didn't wield a knife he can be tried for murder if he helped
the killer or if he was involved in the fight that preceded the slayings. But
Garland said his client had nothing to do with the crime or the altercation.
</P>
<P>
	   "Mere presence where a crime takes place is not a crime under American law,
nor in the state of Georgia," he said.

<HEADLINE> WWF Unveils New Pro Football League  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE-
Associated Press Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Peyton Manning. Marshall Faulk. Stone Cold Steve Austin?
</P>
<P>
	Yes, says World Wrestling Federation mastermind Vince McMahon, who unveiled
plans Thursday for his latest (and most unlikely) creation -- the XFL, a new pro
football league set to open in February 2001.
</P>
<P>
	No scripts. No sideshows.
</P>
<P>
	No, really.
</P>
<P>
	Expect the usual WWF marketing blitz to accompany the league's launching. But
don't expect the same outrageous, rehearsed antics that have propelled McMahon's
WWF to the top of the cable television ratings.
</P>
<P>
	``The WWF is 100 percent entertainment,'' McMahon said. ``But the XFL is 100
percent sports.''
</P>
<P>
	So the outcomes will not be scripted?
</P>
<P>
	``Nooo,'' said McMahon, his eyes rolling skyward in the WWF's midtown Manhattan
restaurant. ``Nooo.''
</P>
<P>
	The league will run from February-April, commencing right after the Super Bowl.
Though they won't compete head to head, McMahon still lobbed several verbal
grenades at the old guard of the NFL.
</P>
<P>
	``Why football?'' asked McMahon, echoing a question no doubt pondered from
coast to coast. ``Some have suggested the NFL is the `No Fun League.' The XFL
will be the extremely fun league. This will be a blast.''
</P>
<P>
	Why football? McMahon offered another answer: ``I personally think that figure
skating sucks.''
</P>
<P>
	It's a new world for McMahon, the ``sports entertainment'' impresario who
converted professional wrestling from a low-brow, oft-mocked pursuit into a
low-brow, oft-mocked multi-million dollar business.
</P>
<P>
	But that was done with script writers, and bigger-than-life characters such as
Hulk Hogan and Mankind, and phony feuds and bogus friendships.
</P>
<P>
	Here's the reality of the XFL: McMahon said the start-up costs for the
eight-team league will run him ``somewhere south of $100 million.'' There will
be teams in New York, Miami, Orlando, Washington, Los Angeles and San Francisco,
with two more teams to be announced.
</P>
<P>
	Ex-Dallas Cowboys star Drew Pearson is on the league's football advisory
committee, and 15-time Emmy-winning broadcast executive Michael Weisman is
working on its television team.
</P>
<P>
	There's no immediate word on a television contract, although negotiations are
continuing, league executives said. McMahon boldly predicted the league could
turn a profit within three years.
</P>
<P>
	History doesn't support that view. Investors in the USFL, and the WFL, and
assorted other 'FLs have long since taken their balls and gone home.
</P>
<P>
	McMahon said his league will succeed by attracting the young viewers already
tuned into the WWF, along with the football fans suffering post-Super Bowl
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
	He also promised innovative television coverage, from helmet cameras to
sideline and locker room access.
</P>
<P>
	But don't expect to see wrestlers like Triple H and the Undertaker in pads and
cleats: ``Their interest in the XFL will be as fans,'' McMahon promised.
</P>
<P>
	A reverse cross-over, with football players climbing into the ring, could
happen, McMahon said. That's old hat for McMahon, who paid Hall of Fame
linebacker Lawrence Taylor a reported $500,000 to appear at Wrestlemania XI -- a
spectacle unseen since Wrestlemania X.
</P>
<P>
	McMahon said his league would feature smashmouth football: ``This will not be a
league for pantywaists or sissies.'' Toward that goal, players on winning teams
will receive bigger paychecks than the losers.
</P>
<P>
	``That's really the American way,'' said McMahon, sounding dangerously like Don
King.
</P>
<P>
	Despite McMahon's confidence, there are many XFL skeptics, from Wall Street
experts who questioned its affect on WWF stock to people in the marketing
business.
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pretty much calling it a joke,'' said Ryan Schinman, president of the
entertainment and marketing firm CNB Entertainment. ``I look at Vince McMahon as
an innovator, a pioneer, a marketing genius. That's what baffles me.
</P>
<P>
	``Why do this?''

<HEADLINE> Haslett Named Head Coach of Saints  </HEADLINE>
    By MARY FOSTER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Just three years after hiring high-profile coach Mike
Ditka, who took over with talk of winning the Super Bowl, the New Orleans Saints
hired a low-key assistant who promised nothing more than hard work and
hard-nosed play.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are some things that need to be done, obviously," Jim Haslett said
Thursday after taking over as Saints head coach. "We'll try to get those things
done, try to keep getting better. And we'll have a club that's well run,
organized and plays hard. That's all I can promise at this point."
</P>
<P>
	   New Orleans finished 3-13 last year, the third straight losing record under
Ditka and eighth straight non-winning year. The Saints have not had a 1,000-yard
rusher since 1989. Even trading eight draft picks for Heisman Trophy-winning
running back Ricky Williams didn't produce one.
</P>
<P>
	   Haslett, 44, the defensive coordinator for the Pittsburgh Steelers for the
past two seasons, was with the Saints during a dismal two-year stretch that saw
the team go 10-22 and coach Jim Mora quit in midseason.
</P>
<P>
	   "The team wasn't winning, but look at what he did with the defense," Saints
general manager Randy Mueller said. "The defense was 25th when he started and
13th the year he was defensive coordinator. He's built everywhere he's been."
</P>
<P>
	   Haslett was picked over Denver Broncos offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak.
Despite rumors that Haslett had the job on Wednesday, Muller said the deal was
not finalized until Thursday morning, saying he had not ruled Kubiak out until
that time.
</P>
<P>
	   Kubiak couldn't be reached for comment on Thursday. He wasn't at the
Broncos' facility and a team spokesman said his telephone had been disconnected.
</P>
<P>
	   Haslett received a three-year contract. Financial terms weren't disclosed
but it was believed to be less than $1 million per year but more than $600,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Owner Tom Benson is still paying off former coach Mike Ditka, who had a
contract that ran through 2002 at $2 million a year; general manager Bill
Kuharich, whose contract ran through 2003 at about $500,000 a year, and other
staff members. Ditka and the others were fired Jan. 5.
</P>
<P>
	   Benson was originally opposed to hiring Haslett, unhappy over Haslett's
disregard of some organization rules when he was an assistant.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'll tell you the thing that impressed me about him so much when I talked
to him, that he was ready," Benson said. "He was just so organized, so ready,
that when he came in here, I think he's already going forward. Of all the
coaches we interviewed, this man was so ready to take this football club and run
with it. It was like night and day."
</P>
<P>
	   Although Muller and Haslett have been friends for years, Muller said that
had nothing to do with the decision to hire him.
</P>
<P>
	   "You're talking about an energetic, tireless worker who has a passion for
the game," Mueller said. "I want to try to create the atmosphere around here of
passion, people that will not accept losing."
</P>
<P>
	   The Saints are without a first- and third-round pick in this year's draft.
Those choices, as well as all last year's picks, were traded to acquire
Williams.
</P>
<P>
	   Mueller and Haslett admitted the lack of picks hurt their rebuilding efforts
but said they are working on deals to acquire more choices as well as looking at
free agents.
</P>
<P>
	   "The way this business is nowadays with free agency and young guys coming in
that have to play, you're just not going to get the perfect team anymore,"
Haslett said. "But if you can stay injury free -- which this team had a hard
time with the last couple of years -- if you can do some things to turn it
around, you always have a chance."
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, Haslett interviewed with Philadelphia, Chicago and Baltimore.

<HEADLINE> Anesthesiologist for prominent fertility doctor admits past drug  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A former anesthesiologist for a prominent fertility
doctor on trial for insurance fraud testified that he was high on drugs during
the first two years he worked for the doctor.
<P>
	   "In retrospect, I was pretty stoned a lot of the time I was giving
anesthesia," said Dr. Neil Warren Ratner, an anesthesiologist and a key
government witness.
</P>
<P>
	   Ratner, 50, of Manhattan was called by prosecutors Thursday as a witness to
buttress their case against Dr. Niels Lauersen.
</P>
<P>
	   Lauersen, 63, a Park Avenue obstetrician and gynecologist, and Dr. Magda
Binion, an anesthesiologist, are charged with conspiracy, health care fraud and
mail fraud.
</P>
<P>
	   For a decade, they allegedly falsely billed fertility surgeries that were
not covered by insurance as gynecological surgeries which were.
</P>
<P>
	   Ratner told the jury in U.S. District Court in Manhattan that he began
working for Lauersen in 1987. He said Lauersen instructed him to leave out any
reference to fertility procedures when insurance companies were billed for them.
</P>
<P>
	   He said his work for Lauersen began while he still had a drug problem which
began in his junior year of high school.
</P>
<P>
	   He testified Thursday that he has not taken drugs since a moment in May 1989
when he had a near-death experience he described as "God's way of telling me,
'This is your last chance."'
</P>
<P>
	   But before then, he said he regularly used drugs.
</P>
<P>
	   During college, Ratner sold drugs to make enough money to pay for the drugs
he abused, he recalled.
</P>
<P>
	   Afterwards, he avoided the Vietnam War by faking psychological problems with
the help of a psychiatrist who believed everyone has a psychological abnormality
"which ultimately you could then blow up to a neurosis or psychosis," Ratner
said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said after college he worked as a road manager for the Edgar Winters
White Trash band and later worked with other music acts, including Humble Pie,
J. Gyles and Peter Frampton.
</P>
<P>
	   After five years in music, a kidney stone attack pointed him toward the
medical profession and he enrolled in medical school, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Following a two-year residency at Beth Israel Medical Center, he began
working as an anesthesiologist for several doctors, including Lauersen.
</P>
<P>
	   He said his drug habit by then was limited mostly to drugs such as codeine,
Demorol or morphine, some of which he stole from the offices of doctors other
than Lauersen.
</P>
<P>
	   The drug use culminated in 1989 when he almost died in the operating room of
another doctor for whom he worked, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was injecting myself with drugs by this point every few hours or so and I
mistakenly picked up a syringe of what I thought was a narcotic, injecting
myself with it," he said. "It turned out to be a paralyzing agent.
</P>
<P>
	   "I ended up on the floor, paralyzed, unable to speak and just barely able to
breathe," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the doctors and nurses around him were horrified. After a few
minutes, the effect of the drug subsided and he began to recover as he was
replaced by another anesthesiologist, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ratner testified in exchange for leniency after he pleaded guilty in May
1998 to conspiracy to commit mail fraud, health care fraud and to making a false
statement regarding health care matters. He has not been sentenced.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- While Derek Jeter doubled his salary to $10
million and put off a multiyear deal, Ariel Prieto lost in his
attempt to double his salary despite not pitching in the majors
since April 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm paying a lot of tax now,'' Jeter joked Thursday after he
agreed to a one-year contract with the New York Yankees. ``It's
kind of overwhelming, the way I've been compensated the last few
years. It's not really something I sit around and think about too
much.''
</P>
<P>
	   The shortstop made $130,000 when he was American League Rookie
of the Year in 1996, $550,000 in 1997, $750,000 in 1998 and $5
million after winning in arbitration last year.
</P>
<P>
	   He hit .349 last season with 219 hits, 24 homers and 102 RBIs,
all career highs. And already he's thinking about the possibility
of a third straight World Series title, which would be his fourth
in five seasons.
</P>
<P>
	   New York and Jeter's agent, Casey Close, have been talking about
a $118.5 million, seven-year deal. Knowing that the price only goes
up, Yankees officials have been trying to convince George
Steinbrenner to give his go-ahead, but the owner hasn't made a
decision.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I said it before: I'd like to sign a long-term deal, but it's
not up to me, it's up the team to make that decision,'' Jeter said
from Tampa, Fla. ``I don't think the team owes me a long-term deal.
That's not how it works. I have two more years. Then you can start
negotiating. Then you can make decisions on your own.''
</P>
<P>
	   Prieto, a 30-year-old right-hander, dropped players to 1-1 in
salary arbitration when he was awarded a raise from $210,000 to
$300,000 instead of his request for $500,000. The decision was made
by arbitrators Stephen Goldberg, James Gross and Ted High, who
heard the case Wednesday in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
	   Prieto is recovering from reconstructive elbow and shoulder
surgery and hasn't pitched in the major leagues since April 19,
1998. He was Oakland's opening day starter in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Houston right-hander Chris Holt, who had been scheduled for a
hearing Thursday, instead agreed to a one-year contract worth
$1,025,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Holt missed the 1998 season following shoulder surgery and went
5-13 with a 4.66 ERA. He also had one save in six relief
appearances.
</P>
<P>
	   After earning $279,000 last season, Holt had asked for
$1,275,000 and had been offered $800,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty-eight players remain in arbitration, which runs through
Feb. 18.
</P>
<P>
	   Among free agents, Ed Sprague agreed to a minor league contract
with San Diego and outfielders Shawon Dunston and Brian McRae,
first baseman Eduardo Perez and catcher Rick Wilkins agreed to
minor league deals with the St. Louis Cardinals.

<HEADLINE> Dragila Keeps Going Higher  </HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL-
AP Track Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- As a youngster, Stacy Dragila considered herself ``a
daredevil.''
</P>
<P>
	She raised steers on her father's farm in Auburn, Calif. She participated in
rodeos, competing in goat tying, breakaway roping and team roping events, and
she swam, played volleyball, skied, did gymnastics and was in track and field,
doing the grueling heptathlon
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I was invincible,'' Dragila said.
</P>
<P>
	Dragila still is doing her daredevil act, and proving to be nearly invincible
competition-wise.
</P>
<P>
	She is the co-world outdoor record-holder and the American indoor record-holder
in the women's pole vault.
</P>
<P>
	Dragila, who set the indoor mark of 14 feet, 9 1/2 inches, last Saturday at
Pocatello, Idaho, will take another shot at improving that height tonight in the
Millrose Games at Madison Square Garden. She won the inaugural Millrose women's
pole vault in 1998, but missed last year's meet after undergoing foot surgery.
</P>
<P>
	The 93rd Millrose Games has its usual glamour fields, including 1996 Olympic
gold medalists Allen Johnson in the men's hurdles and Charles Austin in the
men's high jump; Maurice Greene, the world indoor and outdoor sprint
record-holder; and Ato Boldon, the 1997 world 200 champion.
</P>
<P>
	Inger Miller, the world champion in the 200 meters and ranked No. 2 in the
world in the 100 and 200 meters, was a late withdrawal because of a hamstring
sustained last Saturday at Fairfax, Va.
</P>
<P>
	Dragila did not begin vaulting until 1993 when she was at Idaho State under the
guidance of track coach Dave Nelson.
</P>
<P>
	At first, the fearless Dragila was scared.
</P>
<P>
	``I had no clue where I was going with the pole vault,'' Dragila said,
recalling her days as a novice.
</P>
<P>
	``My coach thought I could do it. I struggled at first. I was fearful of it. I
didn't know to land properly or turn over.''
</P>
<P>
	The event had been tried by women during the 1970s, but nothing serious ever
came of those early attempts. The vault didn't seem like it would flourish
either in the early '90s. Nelson was intrigued with the event, but when Idaho
State hosted a meet, its athletes were the only ones vaulting.
</P>
<P>
	In Dragila's first attempts at the vault, she cleared the ridiculously low
height of 6 feet. In 1994, she broke two poles while vaulting, but was fortunate
in not getting seriously injured, landing in the pit each time.
</P>
<P>
	Nelson used an analogy to keep her from getting discouraged.
</P>
<P>
	``Coach said it was like falling off a horse,'' she said. ``You've got to get
back on.''
</P>
<P>
	Dragila, never one to duck a challenge, then cleared 10 feet in 1994, and was
surprised to learn that was an American record.
</P>
<P>
	She kept going higher and higher, and last year she earned $100,000 for
becoming the first American to clear 15 feet, reaching that height at a
competition on a beach at Santa Barbara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	There was some dispute over whether that should be accepted as an American
record, but Dragila dispelled doubt about the mark when she won the world
championship at 15-1, matching the world record of Australia's Emma George.
</P>
<P>
	The victory gave Dragila the distinction of having won the first women's pole
vault at the World Indoor Championships and the first women's pole vault at the
World Outdoor Championships.
</P>
<P>
	Dragila said she has cleared 15-3 in practice, something she didn't think was
possible in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	``Last year I couldn't believe we could go 15 feet or 15-6,'' she said. ``Now I
take the bar to that height and I'm not scared of it.
</P>
<P>
	``I hope to clear 16 feet by the end of this year.''
</P>
<P>
	She also hopes to win the first women's pole vault at the Olympics this year.
</P>
<P>
	``My coach never pushed it on me to be an Olympic champion and to go to higher
heights,'' Dragila said. ``I put the pressure on myself.''
</P>
<P>
	In its short life span, the women's pole vault has become one of track and
field's most popular events.
</P>
<P>
	``It's taking hold,'' said Dragila, who receives lots of e-mails from
prospective vaulters seeking advice. ``Everyone wants to do it.''
</P>
<P>
	The vault has taken hold so rapidly and Dragila has become so prominent that
she currently has four major endorsements -- from Reebok, Oakley, Visa and
General Motors.
</P>
<P>
	Should she add the Olympic gold medal to her growing showcase, more offers are
likely to be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
	That's something she never thought possible when she began vaulting.

<HEADLINE> Cayard Ready To Finish Off Prada  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUCKLAND, New Zealand (AP) -- Prada's sailors glided back into the harbor to
the sympathetic bellow of horns from luxury yachts and a cold-blooded message
from the skipper determined to ruin their summer in Auckland.
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to be going for the kill,'' Paul Cayard said. ``That's what we
came here for.''
</P>
<P>
	That's what he can accomplish Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	A triumph that seemed so unlikely less than a week ago can become a reality if
Cayard's AmericaOne completes an amazing comeback from a 3-1 deficit to a 5-3
victory in the best-of-9 challenger finals for the America's Cup.
</P>
<P>
	If he succeeds, he'll have two weeks to prepare for the final test against
defending champion New Zealand in the best-of-9 round starting Feb. 19. And if
he succeeds at that, the Cup will return to America where it has resided for all
but nine years of its 150-year existence.
</P>
<P>
	First, Cayard must follow up on today's dominating 1-minute, 6-second win over
his Italian adversary. If Prada wins Saturday, the winner-take-all race would be
held Sunday, ending the challenger elimination series that began Oct. 18 with 11
boats representing seven countries.
</P>
<P>
	``We're all pretty tired,'' Cayard said. ``It's just some more of the
adrenaline that keeps you going every day and I'm sure both teams will be
looking forward to a little rest after this round's over.''
</P>
<P>
	For one team, it will be a very long rest.
</P>
<P>
	``We started racing in October so, for the crews, it's been a very long
period,'' Prada skipper Francesco de Angelis said. ``At this stage, I don't
think anybody's thinking about getting any rest, just think about the next two
races.''
</P>
<P>
	That's wishful thinking for a skipper who has trailed at 22 of the 24 marks
over the last four races and has been outsailed by Cayard, whose only routine
loss came in the opening race by 24 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	AmericaOne won the second race by 1:33, then withdrew with less than a third of
the next race left because of equipment problems. It lost the fourth race when
Cayard had to make a penalty turn for blocking Prada's progress even though
AmericaOne crossed the finish line first.
</P>
<P>
	With his crew sharpening its performance, Cayard won the next two races by 34
seconds and 9 seconds before today's tiebreaking win.
</P>
<P>
	And he has no intention of letting up.
</P>
<P>
	``Why would we?'' he said. ``Absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
	There was an obvious reason for today's victory -- Prada started the race on
the left side of the course, AmericaOne began on the right and the wind was
stronger on the right.
</P>
<P>
	By the end of the first leg, into the wind, of the six-leg, 18 1/2-mile Hauraki
Gulf course, AmericaOne led by 1:19. By the end of the third leg, it led by
2:31. Cayard sailed conservatively the rest of the way, staying between Prada
and the marks and avoiding serious equipment damage.
</P>
<P>
	``Right before the race, we got a nice right-hand shift,'' AmericaOne tactician
John Kostecki said. ``We saw a little bit more (wind) pressure out there. I
didn't think it was going to be that big of a gainer. The end result was
great.''
</P>
<P>
	As the boats proceeded up the first leg, they were on opposite sides of the
course, more than a mile between them.
</P>
<P>
	``We felt that by going all the way to the right we were playing AmericaOne's
game,'' Prada tactician Torben Grael said, explaining his ill-conceived decision
to go left. ``You can't guess right all the time.''
</P>
<P>
	Guessing, though, isn't the best way to beat Cayard, known for his
aggressiveness and ability to rally from adversity.
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, he was on Italy's side as helmsman for Il Moro di Venezia, which
trailed New Zealand in the challenger finals 3-1. He ended up winning that 5-3
before losing to America3 in the finals.
</P>
<P>
	``Like that saying goes, `we've seen this movie before,' and, hopefully, it's
going to play out the same way,'' Cayard said.

<HEADLINE> Fox Reaches Agreement on Ethnicity  </HEADLINE>
    By LYNN ELBER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- All four major broadcast networks have committed to a
more ethnically diverse fall season, months after the NAACP threatened lawsuits
and boycotts if more minorities weren't included in programming.
</P>
<P>
	   "We feel it's enormously important, it's very good for business, and most of
all, it's the right thing to do," said Fox Entertainment President Doug Herzog
on Thursday after his network and CBS both announced the upcoming moves.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Fox and CBS will add executives in charge of diversity who will
implement and monitor network efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not only putting it in writing, we're putting our money where our
mouth is," said Leslie Moonves, president of CBS Television. He cited such CBS
programs as the upcoming Latino Grammy Awards and the drama series "City of
Angels," with many black writers and a largely black cast.
</P>
<P>
	   The network's agreements, similar to those signed by NBC and ABC last month,
focus on changes in minority representation throughout the companies -- both
on-screen and off. Minority recruitment will be considered in executive job
evaluations.
</P>
<P>
	   "This has been a long, arduous process," said Kweisi Mfume, president of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The agreements, he
said, will bring "real, meaningful, lasting change."
</P>
<P>
	   CBS promised to increase the number of development deals with minority
writers, producers and "other talent for the 2000 fall season and beyond."
</P>
<P>
	   Like the Fox agreement, the CBS pact was virtually devoid of numbers that
might provide measurements of success. But the network executives said they were
committed to the effort -- and Mfume said biannual evaluations were planned.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not a matter of having come a long, long way, but of still having a
long way to go," Mfume said.
</P>
<P>
	   The end result, he said, should be creation of television that consumers can
feel good about and new opportunities in the entertainment industry for men and
women of color.
</P>
<P>
	   Although most criticism was directed at the four major networks, Mfume said
he hoped cable channels and other broadcasters would use the agreements as a
basis for self-examination and change.
</P>
<P>
	   The networks opened negotiations with civil rights groups after the NAACP
last summer floated the threat of a TV boycott or legal action because of the
lack of minority actors on the fall 1999 schedule of new shows.
</P>
<P>
	   In spring, Mfume said, the coalition intends to expand its focus to include
the motion picture industry. He expects conversations with studio heads to be
held after coalition members evaluate their goals.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Navy Detains Russian Tanker  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Iraq has been able to supplement a U.N.-approved oil
sales program with a contraband scheme that averages 100,000 barrels a day,
according to the State Department.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokesman James Foley discussed the operation Thursday after the Navy
detained a Russian oil tanker in the Persian Gulf on suspicion that it was
smuggling Iraqi oil in violation of U.N. Security Council economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq is banned from most international commerce but is allowed to export up
to $5.2 billion in oil every six months in order to buy food, medicine and other
essentials for its people, and spare parts for its oil industry.
</P>
<P>
	   Foley said the Clinton administration has been in contact with Russian
officials for almost a month about the smuggling of Iraqi oil.
</P>
<P>
	   The seizure of the tanker called attention to the recent mushrooming of
illicit oil sales by Iraq. Such exports average 100,000 barrels a day, compared
with 50,000 barrels in 1998, when oil prices were much lower, Foley said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Navy said it planned to divert and retain control of the merchant vessel
Volga-Neft-147, pending a decision on whether to seize the oil.
</P>
<P>
	   A Pentagon spokesman, Army Col. Vince Ogilvie, said today two officials from
the Russian consulate in the United Arab Emirates boarded the ship, which is in
international waters off the coast of Oman, as did two American defense attache
officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Ogilvie, who was traveling with Defense Secretary William Cohen in Germany,
said he had no other details, but the boardings by Russian and American
officials suggested an intensifying negotiation over how to settle the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russians said the oil came from Iran, not Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. and allied ships are tightening enforcement of the U.N. embargo to
counteract a surge in Iraqi oil smuggling, Cohen said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   While Russian vessels increasingly have been involved, there is no immediate
indication of a direct connection to the Russian government, Cohen said in an
interview en route to Munich, Germany, where he will attend a weekend conference
on European security issues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Overall there has been an increase on the part of Iraq to intensify its
smuggling operations, and we're going to have to simply intensify our own
intervention to prevent that,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he thinks Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein, ``will do whatever he
can to try to circumvent the sanctions. If he can get away with it, if there's a
laxity on the enforcement part, then he will seek to exploit it.''
</P>
<P>
	   The vessel was commandeered off the coast of the United Arab Emirates on
Wednesday by the guided missile cruiser USS Monterey. The Pentagon said
cooperation from the ship's master and crew was excellent.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. ship was part of a multinational maritime interception force that
enforces the 9-year-old U.N. embargo against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1990, Foley said, the MIF has queried via radio more than 28,000
vessels and has boarded more than 12,000. About 700 have been diverted for
violating U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In 1999, there were 2,422 queries, 700 boardings and 19 diversions to
various ports of call,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The last time a Russian-flagged vessel was boarded was Aug. 31, 1998, he
said, adding that the last actual diversion of such a ship occurred eight months
earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Rear Adm. Craig Quigley told Pentagon reporters the Volga-Neft-147 carried
gas oil, a refined petroleum product. He said a sample could provide clues to
the oil's source.
</P>
<P>
	   Foley said the talks with Russian officials focused on the MIF's suspicions
regarding activities of vessels belonging to certain Russian companies.

<HEADLINE> NASA: We'll Launch if Russia Fails  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The head of the space agency hopes the Russians will
launch a service module to the International Space Station this year, but if
they fail he says the United States will put up its own.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian part of the space station initially fell behind schedule because
the government didn't provide the money to meet the commitment. The effort was
further delayed recently by two failures of Proton rockets, the launcher the
Russians will use to put the modules in orbit.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russians have also diverted some equipment that was supposed to go to
the space station to their aged Mir space station.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview Thursday with reporters, NASA administrator Daniel Goldin
said he hopes the Russians, who are more than a year behind schedule, will
complete and launch a service module by July.
</P>
<P>
	   Goldin said he's waiting to see if the Russians are serious about fixing the
Proton and then launching the module before the United States puts the final
touches on an American service module. He said the Russians will have a launch
readiness review later this month.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to see if they have a fire in the belly about getting the service
module up,'' said the space agency administrator.
</P>
<P>
	   Goldin said that if Russia has not launched the service module by July, then
NASA will do the final work on its own service module and launch it by the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want the Russians to be there, but we felt we had to be responsible
custodians to keep the program on track,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. service module will cost about $200 million when it is finished and
in place on the space station.
</P>
<P>
	   Goldin said that even if the Russians do launch their service module, the
U.S. module will still be useful. He said it would be sent to the space station
next year. Using both service modules ``makes the station much more robust.''
</P>
<P>
	   The multibillion-dollar International Space Station is a joint effort by 16
nations, with the United States taking the lead role.

<HEADLINE> White House Presses ATF Powers  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is doing on a small scale what
it has not yet convinced Congress or the gun industry to do on a large one --
crack down on gun dealers who sell a disproportionate number of the weapons used
in crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton plans to release a report Friday backing up the White
House claim that a small number of gun dealers are responsible for putting a
large number of guns in the hands of criminals.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms study shows 1 percent of gun
dealers account for 57 percent of guns the ATF can trace from use in a crime
back to the point the gun was sold, said deputy domestic policy adviser Eric
Liu.
</P>
<P>
	   With that in mind, Liu said the administration will extend the ATF's powers
to check up on possible rogue dealers and trace stolen guns. The new powers,
which do not require congressional approval, include intense inspections of the
dealers most suspected of supplying criminals.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, a smaller number of suspect dealers will be required to provide
information on the sale of used guns in the same way they now compile data for
new guns.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the best thing that can be done, short of new laws ... given the
deadlock in Congress,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and one of the most
persistent voices in Congress for more gun control.
</P>
<P>
	   Schumer released two reports last year that also pointed to a relative
handful of rogue or suspect dealers as the source of many criminals' guns.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest study showed that in 1998, 1,020 of the nation's 83,272 licensed
gun dealers and pawnbrokers were each the source of at least 10 guns later
traced to crimes, and 132 dealers were linked to 50 or more such guns. Not all
the guns were sold directly by the suspect dealers -- some were apparently lost
or stolen and some passed through multiple hands before they were used in
crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's push for new gun control measures collapsed in Congress last year,
despite what White House attempts to use public outrage over the Columbine
shooting as leverage against the gun lobby.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House has pledged to renew the fight this year for trigger locks
on handguns and for new laws governing the sale of guns at flea market-style gun
shows.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House has also made little headway in its attempt to pressure the
gun industry to negotiate with cities suing over the cost of gun violence.
Representatives of both dealers and manufacturers met separately with White
House officials after the administration threatened in December to help bring a
national lawsuit, but neither side has had much to say since.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've been focused on trying to engage dealers and manufacturers who are
serious about changing the way they do business,'' Liu said. He would not
comment on whether the new ATF powers give the administration greater leverage
in those negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the National Rifle Association, Bill Powers, said the new
rules are pointless, because the government already has broad power to police
dealers and raid those suspected of criminal conduct.

<HEADLINE> NASA: We'll Launch if Russia Fails  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The head of the space agency hopes the Russians will
launch a service module to the International Space Station this year, but if
they fail, he says, the United States will put up its own.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russian part of the space station initially fell behind schedule because
the government didn't provide the money to meet the commitment. The effort was
further delayed recently by two failures of Proton rockets, the launcher the
Russians will use to put the modules in orbit.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russians have also diverted some equipment that was supposed to go to
the space station to their aged Mir space station.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview Thursday with reporters, NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin
said he hopes the Russians, who are more than a year behind schedule, will
complete and launch a service module by July.
</P>
<P>
	   Goldin said he's waiting to see if the Russians are serious about fixing the
Proton and then launching the module before the United States puts the final
touches on an American service module. He said the Russians will have a launch
readiness review later this month.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to see if they have a fire in the belly about getting the service
module up,'' said the space agency administrator.
</P>
<P>
	   Goldin said that if Russia has not launched the service module by July, then
NASA will do the final work on its own service module and launch it by the end
of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want the Russians to be there, but we felt we had to be responsible
custodians to keep the program on track,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Konstantin Kreidenko, a Russian Space Agency spokesman, said he had not seen
the NASA statement and would not comment on it. He said the service module is
ready but its launch was postponed because of the Proton crashes. Launched is
planned for the end of July or early August.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. service module will cost about $200 million when it is finished and
in place on the space station.
</P>
<P>
	   Goldin said that even if the Russians do launch their service module, the
U.S. module will still be useful. He said it would be sent to the space station
next year. Using both service modules ``makes the station much more robust.''
</P>
<P>
	   The multibillion-dollar International Space Station is a joint effort by 16
nations, with the United States taking the lead role.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Wants Ex-CIA Chief To Testify  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate Intelligence Committee chairman said today
former CIA Director John Deutch ought to appear before his panel to explain
about the classified material found on his home computer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've asked him to, we hope he will,'' committee Chairman Richard Shelby,
R-Ala., said on the ``Early Show'' on CBS. ``I hope he will appear before the
committee, he should.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is strange behavior, very suspicious,'' said Shelby, whose committee
is scheduled to meet Tuesday. ``It's unprecedented to my knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
	   When Deutch left his post in December 1996, CIA investigators discovered he
had put large quantities of classified material on a CIA-supplied but unsecured
computer in his home.
</P>
<P>
	   The same computer was used by Deutch and other members of his household to
send and receive e-mail and to access Internet sites, according to congressional
and intelligence-community officials familiar with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch has not been prosecuted, but current CIA Director George Tenet
stripped him of his security clearances last August -- nearly three years after
Deutch left the CIA job.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I asked the director of the CIA (Tenet) the other day why, why did they
not notify the Justice Department and the FBI immediately,'' Shelby said. ``He
said 'well,' he said, 'We just didn't.' That's not good enough.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if he believed Deutch was in violation of the law, Shelby said, ``I
can't say he was yet. The inspector general might have a say in that or maybe
the Justice Department, but he obviously broke the rules if not the law.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Tenet testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee and
disputed a parallel between Deutch and Wen Ho Lee, the former Los Alamos
scientist now jailed on charges of mishandling U.S. nuclear secrets, including
transferring top-secret files to an unsecured computer.
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet said Deutch was merely working from his home, not transferring
classified material from a secured computer to an unsecured one, as Lee is
alleged to have done.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Claims Iraqis Smuggling Oil  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Iraq has been able to supplement a U.N.-approved oil
sales program with a contraband scheme that averages 100,000 barrels a day,
according to the State Department.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokesman James Foley discussed the operation Thursday after the Navy
detained a Russian oil tanker in the Persian Gulf on suspicion that it was
smuggling Iraqi oil in violation of U.N. Security Council economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq is banned from most international commerce but is allowed to export up
to $5.2 billion in oil every six months in order to buy food, medicine and other
essentials for its people, and spare parts for its oil industry.
</P>
<P>
	   Foley said the Clinton administration has been in contact with Russian
officials for almost a month about the smuggling of Iraqi oil.
</P>
<P>
	   The seizure of the tanker called attention to the recent mushrooming of
illicit oil sales by Iraq. Such exports average 100,000 barrels a day, compared
with 50,000 barrels in 1998, when oil prices were much lower, Foley said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Navy said it planned to divert and retain control of the merchant vessel
Volga-Neft-147, pending a decision on whether to seize the oil.
</P>
<P>
	   A Pentagon spokesman, Army Col. Vince Ogilvie, said today two officials from
the Russian consulate in the United Arab Emirates boarded the ship, which is in
international waters off the coast of Oman, as did two American defense attache
officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Ogilvie, who was traveling with Defense Secretary William Cohen in Germany,
said he had no other details, but the boardings by Russian and American
officials suggested an intensifying negotiation over how to settle the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russians said the oil came from Iran, not Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We imperatively demand the immediate release of the Russian tanker,''
Deputy Foreign Minister Vasily Sredin told the Tass news agency today ``We shall
get it back and save both the ship and crew.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. and allied ships are tightening enforcement of the U.N. embargo to
counteract a surge in Iraqi oil smuggling, Cohen said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   While Russian vessels increasingly have been involved, there is no immediate
indication of a direct connection to the Russian government, Cohen said in an
interview en route to Munich, Germany, where he will attend a weekend conference
on European security issues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Overall there has been an increase on the part of Iraq to intensify its
smuggling operations, and we're going to have to simply intensify our own
intervention to prevent that,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he thinks Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein, ``will do whatever he
can to try to circumvent the sanctions. If he can get away with it, if there's a
laxity on the enforcement part, then he will seek to exploit it.''
</P>
<P>
	   The vessel was commandeered off the coast of the United Arab Emirates on
Wednesday by the guided missile cruiser USS Monterey. The Pentagon said
cooperation from the ship's master and crew was excellent.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. ship was part of a multinational maritime interception force that
enforces the 9-year-old U.N. embargo against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1990, Foley said, the MIF has queried via radio more than 28,000
vessels and has boarded more than 12,000. About 700 have been diverted for
violating U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In 1999, there were 2,422 queries, 700 boardings and 19 diversions to
various ports of call,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The last time a Russian-flagged vessel was boarded was Aug. 31, 1998, he
said, adding that the last actual diversion of such a ship occurred eight months
earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Rear Adm. Craig Quigley told Pentagon reporters the Volga-Neft-147 carried
gas oil, a refined petroleum product. He said a sample could provide clues to
the oil's source.
</P>
<P>
	   Foley said the talks with Russian officials focused on the MIF's suspicions
regarding activities of vessels belonging to certain Russian companies.

<P>

Clinton today gave federal agents new powers to crack down on dealers and
pawnbrokers who sell a disproportionate number of the weapons used in crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're beginning the most aggressive effort ever undertaken to insure
responsible behavior by gun dealers,'' the president said. ``Dealers whose guns
most frequently wind up in criminals' hands will now be subject to intense
scrutiny by ATF'' -- the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
	   On another front, the White House said Clinton will ask Congress for a new,
25-cent-a-pack federal excise tax on cigarettes. In addition, he proposed that
the tobacco industry be charged $3,000 for every smoker under 18 as part of a
campaign to reduce sales to minors and eliminate advertising that could
encourage children to smoke.
</P>
<P>
	   Gun control and anti-tobacco initiatives are familiar elements of Clinton's
agenda but also are the source of some of his biggest failures in Congress. Last
year, for instance, Congress refused his requests for a 55-cent-a-pack tax on
cigarettes and tougher restrictions on handgun purchases. Republicans are likely
to view Clinton's latest tobacco proposal as yet another tax increase.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton released a report documenting that a small number of gun dealers is
responsible for putting a large number of guns in the hands of criminals.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms study shows 1 percent of gun
dealers accounts for 57 percent of guns the ATF can trace from use in a crime
back to the point the gun was sold, Clinton's deputy domestic policy adviser,
Eric Liu, said.
</P>
<P>
	   With that in mind, Liu said the administration will extend the ATF's powers
to check up on possible rogue dealers and trace stolen guns. The new powers,
which do not require congressional approval, include intense inspections of the
dealers most suspected of supplying criminals.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, a smaller number of suspect dealers will be required to provide
information on the sale of used guns in the same way they now compile data for
new guns.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the best thing that can be done, short of new laws ... given the
deadlock in Congress,'' said Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., one of the most
persistent voices in Congress for more gun control.
</P>
<P>
	   Schumer released two reports last year that also pointed to a relative
handful of suspected dealers as the source of many criminals' guns.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest study showed that in 1998, 1,020 of the nation's 83,272 licensed
gun dealers and pawnbrokers were each the source of at least 10 guns later
traced to crimes, and 132 dealers were linked to 50 or more such guns. Not all
the guns were sold directly by the suspect dealers -- some apparently were lost
or stolen and some passed through multiple hands before they were used in
crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's push for new gun control measures collapsed in Congress last year,
despite White House attempts to use public concern over the Columbine High
School gun massacre as leverage against the gun lobby.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House has pledged to renew the fight this year for trigger locks
on handguns and for new laws governing the sale of guns at flea market-style gun
shows.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House has also made little headway in its attempt to pressure the
gun industry to negotiate with cities suing over the cost of gun violence.
Representatives of both dealers and manufacturers met separately with White
House officials after the administration threatened in December to help bring a
national lawsuit, but neither side has had much to say since.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've been focused on trying to engage dealers and manufacturers who are
serious about changing the way they do business,'' Liu said. He would not
comment on whether the new ATF powers give the administration greater leverage
in those negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the National Rifle Association said the new rules are
pointless, because the government already has broad power to police dealers and
raid those suspected of criminal conduct.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration has failed to use existing laws to go after a
variety of gun crimes, NRA spokesman Bill Powers said. He called today's
announcements political posturing intended to benefit the presidential campaign
of Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is like the standard political strategy -- when you're not doing
something, have a press conference and make it look like you're doing
something,'' Powers said.
</P>
<P>
	   The ATF regulations will also target dealers who refuse to cooperate when
the agency asks for information on the sale of guns later traced to crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``While the majority of gun dealers are law-abiding businesspeople who
recognize the importance of helping law enforcement identify gun criminals,
today's report shows the need to focus resources on the relatively small number
of dealers and pawnbrokers who are the source of most of the traced crime
guns,'' a White House statement said.

<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened higher today after a government report showed
the U.S. economy surged into the new year pushing unemployment to a 30-year low.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 61.43 to 11,074.87.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were also higher.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index was up 62.53 to 4,273.51. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 8.98 to 1,433.95.
</P>
<P>
	   The Labor Department said today that employers added 387,000 jobs in
January, pushing the unemployment rate down to 4 percent, its lowest level since
1970.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures, rose
a slightly higher-than-expected 0.4 percent to $13.50 in January, the fastest
pace since September.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the rise in wages, investors apparently have faith that the Federal
Reserve is in control of inflation. The central bank on Wednesday increased
rates for the fourth time since June, and indicated more increases may be on the
way.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks continued to lead the rally as investors move toward the
stocks that performed best in 1999. Since the Fed began raising rates, the
blue-chip Dow has risen just 4 percent, while the Nasdaq has soared 57 percent.

<HEADLINE> Russia Demands Release of Tanker  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Russia today demanded the release of a Russian tanker
detained by a U.S. Navy ship in the Persian Gulf on suspicion that it was
carrying Iraqi oil in violation of a U.N. embargo.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We imperatively demand the immediate release of the Russian tanker,''
Deputy Foreign Minister Vasily Sredin told the Tass news agency. ``We shall get
it back and save both the ship and crew.''
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq is banned from most international commerce but is allowed to export up
to $5.2 billion in oil every six months in order to buy food, medicine and other
essentials for its people, and spare parts for its oil industry.
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James Foley said Thursday the Clinton
administration has been in contact with Russian officials for almost a month
about the smuggling of Iraqi oil.
</P>
<P>
	   The seizure of the tanker Wednesday called attention to the recent
mushrooming of illicit oil sales by Iraq. Such exports average 100,000 barrels a
day, compared with 50,000 barrels in 1998, when oil prices were much lower,
Foley said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Navy said it planned to divert and retain control of the merchant vessel
Volga-Neft-147, pending a decision on whether to seize the oil.
</P>
<P>
	   A Pentagon spokesman, Army Col. Vince Ogilvie, said today two officials from
the Russian consulate in the United Arab Emirates boarded the ship, which is in
international waters off the coast of Oman, as did two American defense attache
officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Ogilvie, who was traveling with Defense Secretary William Cohen in Germany,
said he had no other details, but the boardings by Russian and American
officials suggested an intensifying negotiation over how to settle the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russians said the oil came from Iran, not Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq's government-run Al-Thawra newspaper said in an editorial that the
American claim that Iraq benefits from illegal trade is ``a sheer lie.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Americans are making up stories, some backed up with false figures,
about vessels loaded with Iraqi oil and other Iraqi byproducts,'' the newspaper
said in a clear reference to the Russian tanker.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraqi officials long have denied any smuggling of crude oil or byproducts
takes place on the Gulf. Iraq maintains the United States scrutinizes Gulf ships
traveling to and from Iraq, but does nothing to stop brisk illicit oil smuggling
over land from northern Iraq -- a Kurdish area outside the Baghdad government's
control -- into neighboring Turkey, a U.S. ally.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. and allied ships are tightening enforcement of the U.N. embargo against
Iraq to counteract a surge in Iraqi oil smuggling, Cohen said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   While Russian vessels increasingly have been involved, there is no immediate
indication of a direct connection to the Russian government, Cohen said in an
interview en route to Munich, Germany, where he will attend a weekend conference
on European security issues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Overall there has been an increase on the part of Iraq to intensify its
smuggling operations, and we're going to have to simply intensify our own
intervention to prevent that,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he thinks Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein, ``will do whatever he
can to try to circumvent the sanctions. If he can get away with it, if there's a
laxity on the enforcement part, then he will seek to exploit it.''
</P>
<P>
	   The vessel was commandeered off the coast of the United Arab Emirates on
Wednesday by the guided missile cruiser USS Monterey. The Pentagon said
cooperation from the ship's master and crew was excellent.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. ship was part of a multinational maritime interception force that
enforces the 9-year-old U.N. embargo against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1990, Foley said, the force has queried via radio more than 28,000
vessels and has boarded more than 12,000. About 700 have been diverted for
violating U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In 1999, there were 2,422 queries, 700 boardings and 19 diversions to
various ports of call,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The last time a Russian-flagged vessel was boarded was Aug. 31, 1998, he
said, adding that the last actual diversion of such a ship occurred eight months
earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Rear Adm. Craig Quigley told Pentagon reporters the Volga-Neft-147 carried
gas oil, a refined petroleum product. He said a sample could provide clues to
the oil's source.
</P>
<P>
	   Foley said the talks with Russian officials focused on the interception
force's suspicions regarding activities of vessels belonging to certain Russian
companies.

<P>
    MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- Shares in ice cream company Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade
Inc. rose 7 percent today after the company confirmed it may be receiving a
buyout offer from a "socially conscious" group.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, Ben &AMP; Jerry's, which mixes socially responsible ideals with
its ice cream, said it "may be receiving an offer to acquire the company
including 'socially conscious business people.' "
</P>
<P>
	   The company said, however, the offer had not yet been received and declined
to comment further.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors pushed shares up $1.62 1/2 to $24.12 1/2 in midday trading on the
Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   The statement was issued in response to an article in today's Wall Street
Journal, which said the Vermont company was being pursued by two rival
companies: Unilever NV, the Anglo-Dutch food conglomerate, and Dreyer's Grand
Ice Cream Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   The Journal also identified a third suitor: the Social Venture Network, a
San Francisco "socially responsible" investment group.
</P>
<P>
	   "Quirky brands don't usually do well as part of large conglomerates," Ben &AMP;
Jerry's co-founder Ben Cohen told the Journal. "I'm delighted there's an
investor group trying to find a way to keep the company independent."
</P>
<P>
	   Ben &AMP; Jerry's disclosed in December that it had received unsolicited
interest in taking over the company and that the board was considering a
response.
</P>
<P>
	   The company has never disclosed who made the bids, but its executives have
made clear from the beginning they were most interested in keeping the company
independent because they believe it can better stick to its ideals that way.

<HEADLINE> FDIC Looks for Bank Fraud Red Flags  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., hit by its biggest
losses from bank failures since the early 1990s, is telling its examiners to
keep a sharp eye out for warning signs of possible fraud at the banks they
inspect.
</P>
<P>
	   In a memo Thursday, James L. Sexton, director of the FDIC's Division of
Supervision, said examiners must be aware of the warning signs.
</P>
<P>
	   "When 'red flags' or other information lead to suspicions that fraudulent
activity may be present, investigation should be accorded the highest priority
and resources should be allocated accordingly," Sexton wrote in the memo to
regional supervision directors, to be distributed to the agency's 1,800
examiners.
</P>
<P>
	   The memo sought to remind examiners of the importance of quickly making a
thorough investigation when suspicious signs appear.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the warning signs at banks that failed recently, the memo said, were
bank managers and officials who were uncooperative with or hostile toward
examiners, large proportions of risky loans, suspicious transactions by bank
insiders, lack of internal controls and incomplete record-keeping.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, the FDIC proposed a doubling of the capital requirements for
banks that specialize in risky loans to people with inferior credit histories.
</P>
<P>
	   Regulators have warned that the higher-interest loans, called subprime
loans, can increase the risk of defaults for the deposit insurance fund. They
played a role in some of the eight U.S. bank failures last year. The eight
failures and another one in late 1998 cost the FDIC about $1 billion last year
-- its biggest annual hit since the regional banking crises of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   The failures, coming amid a booming economy, have worried regulators and
lawmakers. Compounding the concern, the FDIC is predicting that as many as 20
banks could go under this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The biggest bank failure last year was that of First National Bank of
Keystone, a large institution based in Keystone, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
	   The estimated $750 million loss to the FDIC insurance fund caused by
Keystone's collapse could make it one of the 10 most expensive ever in this
country. Federal regulators, who closed the bank in September, said they found
evidence of apparent fraud that resulted in the depletion of its capital.

<HEADLINE> 'Malcolm in the Middle' Star Lauded  </HEADLINE>
    By FRAZIER MOORE AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- This kid can hold his own with TV mobsters, millionaires,
even The Rock!
</P>
<P>
	   In a season otherwise distinguished by HBO's "The Sopranos," ABC's "Who
Wants to be a Millionaire," and pro wrestling everywhere you look, Frankie Muniz
is in the thick of it as "Malcolm in the Middle."
</P>
<P>
	   With the premiere of this loopy, hilarious Fox series a month ago, viewers
flocked and critics swooned. Suddenly, a woebegone network had a new hit!
Suddenly, the moribund genre of half-hour comedy was brought back to life!
</P>
<P>
	   "'Malcolm' to the Rescue," a Newsweek headline trumpeted. "May Rewrite
Rules," bannered Variety. "May Spawn Host of Imitators," predicted The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
	   And it couldn't have happened without Frankie.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, it's hard to believe he even had to try out for the role of
Malcolm, a grade-school wiseguy who discovers, much to his dismay, that he's a
genius.
</P>
<P>
	   "I finally got to read the script right before the audition," Frankie
recalls. "It was so funny -- me and my mom were sitting in the lobby, cracking
up."
</P>
<P>
	   As a big chunk of TV households already know, "Malcolm in the Middle"
(airing Sunday at 8:30 p.m. EST) pulls humor from the crucible of childhood,
where, for Malcolm, the heat is on.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides the newly inflicted stigma of braininess (a test pegged his I.Q. at
165), Malcolm has other problems. Considering his non-genius parents and three
non-genius brothers, you don't have to be a genius to see that he feels a little
out of place. Then factor in the family's wiggy, catch-as-catch-can domestic
style. Clearly, Malcolm has his hands full.
</P>
<P>
	   "But his family isn't dysfunctional," Frankie insists. "It's just ...
different. There are real families like that."
</P>
<P>
	   He's right. One reason "Malcolm" was an instant smash is that it's as
truthful as it is screwball. As Frankie says, "Not every family is like 'The
Walkens,' or whatever their name was."
</P>
<P>
	   Now 14, he looks four or five years younger, perfect for his character's
age. But if he's smallish in stature, he has a larger than life personality.
Legs dangling from an office chair at his publicist's office, he is in Manhattan
during a return home to Wood-Ridge, N.J., from Los Angeles, where shooting has
wrapped on the first batch of "Malcolms."
</P>
<P>
	   "It's been awesome," Frankie says, flashing his snaggletoothed grin.
"Working every day for three months -- I wanted to keep going!"
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, even on holiday, he has just come from a nearby recording studio,
where he "looped" several lines of dialogue to be shipped West and dubbed into
an episode's finished soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked what he had to say, Frankie delivers the disembodied lines with all of
Malcolm's gusto:
</P>
<P>
	   "Oh, no! My teacher!"
</P>
<P>
	   "If you add the individual digits, you get 74 and 66."
</P>
<P>
	   And: "What do YOU care?"
</P>
<P>
	   Now being Frankie again, he thinks back to a year ago, when he filmed the
"Malcolm" pilot. Right away he liked his character. And he liked his
castmates/"family": little brother Dewey (Erik Per Sullivan); big brother Reese
(Justin Berfield); biggest brother Francis (Christopher Kennedy Masterson); plus
Dad (Bryan Cranston) and Mom (Jane Kaczmarek).
</P>
<P>
	   The only hitch was shooting his first scene. He was supposed to address the
camera and ask the audience, "Wanna know what the best thing about childhood is?
At some point, it stops."
</P>
<P>
	   Frankie laughs. "I don't know if it was something in the air, because my
eyes kept tearing. I was so mad -- it took forever."
</P>
<P>
	   After that, "Malcolm" was a breeze. But he confesses that he didn't expect
it would be picked up as a series. "When I got the news, I was jumping all over
the place."
</P>
<P>
	   Frankie readily draws parallels between himself and Malcolm. For instance,
the way Malcolm roughhouses with his brothers -- "like me and my sister,"
15-year-old Cristina, he says slyly.
</P>
<P>
	   But there are big differences. "He's a kid who's not normal and wants to be
normal. I think I AM normal.
</P>
<P>
	   "Of course, some people think I'm different. But I do all the things YOU do.
I just get to do something else that's special."
</P>
<P>
	   Frankie began his acting career as another plucky lad, Tiny Tim, in a
regional theater production of "A Christmas Carol" in Raleigh, N.C., where he
and his family then lived. He was 8. He had aced his first audition.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, he has been in TV films including "What the Deaf Man Heard," and
had guest shots on "Spin City" and "Sabrina, the Teenage Witch." Currently he's
starring as a shy 9-year-old in the feature "My Dog Skip."
</P>
<P>
	   Acting, says Frankie, "is just so fun. You get to do all sorts of things a
'normal' kid (he hangs air quotes around normal) wouldn't get to do."
</P>
<P>
	   At least, not with adult encouragement, as when, filming a future episode,
he got to make a huge mess with a foam-spewing floor cleaner.
</P>
<P>
	   A great scene for an actor? Frankie cracks up. "One of the best!"

<HEADLINE> Gene Wilder Is Battling Cancer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Comic actor Gene Wilder, devastated by the death of wife
Gilda Radner from cancer in 1989, is battling the disease himself.
</P>
<P>
	   The frizzy-haired star of the 1970s comedies "Blazing Saddles" and "Young
Frankenstein" is being treated at Manhattan Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center to
prevent a recurrence of lymphoma, the hospital said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilder, 64, was diagnosed with the disease last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The hospital gave no further details. Calls to Wilder's Los Angeles-based
representatives were not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
	   There are various kinds of lymphoma. Some are among the most treatable forms
of cancer. Others are much more difficult.
</P>
<P>
	   Radner, Wilder's third wife and one of the original "Saturday Night Live"
stars, died of ovarian cancer in 1989. Wilder has since remarried.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1993, he opened Gilda's Club -- a support center in New York City for
cancer patients and their families -- in her memory.

<HEADLINE> Passengers Gripe More About Airlines  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   The din of complaints about airline service is becoming deafening.
</P>
<P>
	   Deana Pollard says she was barred from using the bathroom while her airplane
sat on a Seattle runway, and ordered off the plane for protesting.
</P>
<P>
	   Slavia Moylan says an airline lost track of her 10-year-old daughter when
the girl's international flight was postponed, leaving the youngster wandering
Chicago's O'Hare airport for hours.
</P>
<P>
	   Legions of other passengers are ticked off about delays, bumpings, rude
treatment and assorted grievances.
</P>
<P>
	   From gripes aired on Web sites to the passenger rights' movement to
complaints sent to the government, fliers appear more irritated than ever.
</P>
<P>
	   Passenger complaints filed with the U.S. Department of Transportation more
than doubled last year, to 20,945, after surging 26 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   One reason for the rise: the Internet, which makes it easier to complain.
</P>
<P>
	   But there's good reason for passengers and airline workers to be cranky.
With people flying in record numbers, planes are more crowded than ever.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. airlines carried 640 million passengers in 1999, up from 453 million in
1991, according to the Air Transport Association. The load factor, or percentage
of seats filled, rose to a record 71.3 in 1999, based on preliminary figures.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's like putting more mice in a cage -- the more mice you put in, the more
edgy they will become," says Mike Taylor of the marketing information firm J.D.
Power and Associates. "It's just the sheer reality of serving 450 people."
</P>
<P>
	   But the reasons for the latest rise in passenger dissatisfaction go deeper:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Flight delays have increased by about 35 percent in the past year,
according to the Aviation Consumer Action Project.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Bumpings have grown as planes fill.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Airlines have imposed rules that have drawn passengers' ire, including
limiting carry-on bags, eliminating advance boarding passes, increasing the time
passengers must be at the airport for boarding and raising fees for changing
itineraries.
</P>
<P>
	   -- The distance between economy-class rows, or pitch, has shrunk from an
average 34 inches in the early 1980s to as little as 31 inches today; most seats
have less padding too.
</P>
<P>
	   Airlines are trying to address some complaints through Congress-inspired
customer service initiatives launched in December. On Thursday, American
Airlines announced it will increase the space between rows to 34 inches in
coach; United Airlineshas been adding 5 extra inches between seats to the first
10 rows in coach.
</P>
<P>
	   But the airlines have a long way to go to calm passengers.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are so many things that are adding up," says Dean Headley of Wichita
State University in Kansas, co-publisher of an annual airline quality rating. "I
think it's just gotten to a point where consumers are saying 'I've had it. I'm
going to blow a gasket on somebody."'
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Pollard was recovering from the flu in June 1998 when her Southwest Airlines
flight was at a standstill on a Seattle runway.
</P>
<P>
	   "The 'fasten seat belt' sign was on. But I really, really had to go," she
says.
</P>
<P>
	   She headed for the bathroom, but a flight attendant ordered her to return to
her seat. When Pollard questioned the delay, the stewardess warned she would
have the plane turned around if she didn't sit down.
</P>
<P>
	   Pollard sat. But when the attendant approached to scold her again, the
35-year-old Los Angeles lawyer threatened to sue. That prompted the attendant to
get the captain to return to the gate, and Pollard was removed.
</P>
<P>
	   She kept her promise of suing; a trial is scheduled to start in Los Angeles
in March. Airline spokesman Ed Stewart said the airline will defend itself
"vigorously."
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Passenger complaints escalated dramatically with the blizzard of Jan. 2,
1999, when thousands were stranded in planes on runways at Detroit's airport for
as long as eight hours, with little food or water.
</P>
<P>
	   The government assailed Northwest Airlines for being poorly prepared and for
continuing to send planes to the city with the storm unfolding.
</P>
<P>
	   The uproar spawned lawsuits and energized support for passenger rights
legislation, proposals Congress shelved after the airline industry pledged
customer service improvements.
</P>
<P>
	   The airlines contend that passengers' No. 1 peeve, delays, is the fault of
the nation's outdated and chaotic air traffic control system -- although
industry watchdogs accuse them of booking too many flights.
</P>
<P>
	   Graham Atkinson, senior vice president for United Airlines, says he's been
"shocked by this cacophony of complaints about bad service."
</P>
<P>
	   But he concedes that airlines haven't treated passengers as well as they
could have and need to communicate better.
</P>
<P>
	   "When we look at (customer) surveys, the one thing that irritates the hell
out of people is when they lose control over things because they're not told
what's going on," Atkinson says.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're trying to be more candid ... and keep people more informed."
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   After delivering their daughter to O'Hare for an American Airlines flight to
Mexico City last July, Mike Moylan of Tinley Park, Ill., stayed at the gate
until the plane taxied away. But it came back later due to mechanical problems,
and the flight was canceled.
</P>
<P>
	   According to his wife, Slavia, the employee charged with looking after the
girl lost her, and the terrified youngster was on her own for over four hours
before figuring out how to get on the rescheduled flight.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Moylan says she got "terribly rude" treatment from the airline when she
called about the incident.
</P>
<P>
	   "They actually lost my child ... and they were so incredibly casual about
it," she says. "It's unbelievable."
</P>
<P>
	   American spokesman Mark Kienzle said he wasn't familiar with the Moylan
incident but that the airline takes its responsibilities with unaccompanied
minors very seriously.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Passengers are venting their frustrations in numerous ways.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Moylan complained directly to the Transportation Department on the
recommendation of PassengerRights.com, a consumer rights Web site. Gripes can
also be aired with The Ticked-Off-Tourist at www.ticked.com, with ltravel.com
and others.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the Air Transport Association says the rising tide of
dissatisfaction must be viewed in the context of the dramatic increase in
passengers, most of whom don't file complaints.
</P>
<P>
	   Crowded planes and longer airport lines result from the greater traffic,
says David Fuscus of the industry association.
</P>
<P>
	   But suggestions that such problems are inevitable draw the wrath of
passenger rights advocates. They contend airlines need to hire more people and
stop scheduling more flights.
</P>
<P>
	   "You go to the airport expecting a bad experience these days, and you
usually get one," says Brent Bowen, director of the Aviation Institute at the
University of Nebraska-Omaha.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Passenger rights advocates suggest several ways people can help reduce the
likelihood of annoyances on flights:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Call the airline before leaving for the airport to check the status of
your flight.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Arrive at the gate 45 minutes to an hour before departure to avoid being
bumped from an overbooked flight, and to be among those asked to volunteer to be
bumped, entitling you to free tickets.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Avoid booking flights that have connections late in the day, when you're
more likely to become stranded if a flight it canceled.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Opt for electronic ticketing to avoid hassles at counters.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Book a window or aisle seat in order to be less cramped
</P>
<P>
	   -- Ask for seats in rows with extra leg room -- usually the rows behind
doors in wide-bodied jets and exit rows in narrower planes.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Ease the stress on yourself and the airports by traveling at off-peak
times, or even traveling a day before or after a big holiday crunch when
possible.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Make sure your reservations allow you at least 50 minutes to get to your
next flight when you have a connection. Don't accept 30 or 40 minutes as a
connecting time between your flights, even though the airlines schedule these as
"legal".

<HEADLINE> Carnival, Star Solidify Control  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    OSLO, Norway (AP) -- The Carnival and Star cruise lines solidified their
control over the Norwegian Cruise Lines Friday, increasing their stake to
two-thirds of the concern after a surprise joint takeover bid earlier in the
week.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami-based Carnival Corp. and Malaysia's Star Cruises had engaged in a
two-month bidding war over NCL Holdings ASA, which owns the line, before teaming
up for a surprise joint $1.1 billion bid on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, the companies informed the Oslo Stock Exchange that its stake in
NCL Holdings had increased to 66.5 percent of the concern's shares, giving them
full control of the world's fourth-largest cruise line.
</P>
<P>
	   Carnival, the industry leader, had begun the bidding war in December with an
offer of 30 kroner ($3.65) per share for NCL holding. Star Cruises, which is
Asia's largest cruise line, made a counter offer of 35 kroner ($4.27) per share
and launched its own takeover bid.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Carnival offered 40 kroner ($4.87) per share, but then withdrew
the bid and instead teamed up with Star for a joint takeover of the concern.
</P>
<P>
	   Under that deal, Carnival is taking a 40 percent interest in Arrasas Ltd., a
Star subsidiary set up to take over NCL.
</P>
<P>
	   NCL, which had sought to fight off the takeover, gave up on Thursday, and
its board recommended that shareholders accept the Carnival-Star bid.
</P>
<P>
	   As majority shareholders, Star and Carnival installed their own board of
directors for NCL at an shareholders meeting on Friday, with Norwegian attorney
and former chairman of the Oslo Stock Exchange Ole Lund taking over as board
chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   NCL controls about 9 percent of the cruise market. Carnival is the industry
leader at 36 percent through its Carnival, Holland America, Cunard and Seabourn
lines.

<HEADLINE> Academics Warn of Japanese Debt  </HEADLINE>
    By SCOTT STODDARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's ballooning public debt, made worse by wasteful public
works spending, is a time bomb that could wreck the world economy, two Japanese
academics said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are looking at a danger signal blinking near and bright," said Akio
Ogawa, a lecturer in the Graduate School of Public Policy at Tokyo's Chuo
University.
</P>
<P>
	   Ogawa and Takayoshi Igarashi, a professor of law at Tokyo's Hosei
University, spoke at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan about the need to
slash both public works spending and the debt if Japan is to regain its economic
might.
</P>
<P>
	   Attempting to jump-start the economy, the government has lavished funds on
bridges to sparsely populated islands, concrete linings for rivers and roads to
nowhere, they said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rather than helping the economy or the people, the spending mostly benefits
an "iron triangle" of powerful politicians, bureaucrats, and businesses, Ogawa
and Igarashi said.
</P>
<P>
	   The second-richest country in the world is also the world's most indebted
nation. Its public debt exceeds 600 trillion yen ($5.5 trillion), or 130 percent
of gross national product, Ogawa said. GNP is the value of all goods and
services produced by the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Worse, the government may be hiding another 100 trillion yen ($926 billion)
in debt from a special coffer that the Ministry of Finance uses to make loans to
public corporations for infrastructure projects, Ogawa said.
</P>
<P>
	   A Finance Ministry official declined to comment on the figure. He did say
that none of the loan recipients is in danger of defaulting. The official spoke
on customary condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan racked up debt mostly over the past decade as the government, urged on
by the United States, tried to spend its way out of its longest economic slump
since World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, Japan spent more than $402 billion on roads, bridges, ports and
other public works projects -- more than the United States, Canada, Germany,
France, Italy and Britain combined, Ogawa said.
</P>
<P>
	   Anger over excessive spending on public works boiled over last month when 90
percent of voters in Tokushima, western Japan, rejected a government plan to
spend $954 million to dam a river.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents say it will destroy the ecosystem. Construction Ministry officials
say it's necessary to stop possible flooding. The government says it will go
ahead with the project despite the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Taxpayers will continue footing such bills unless Japan breaks up the league
of bureaucrats, executives and politicians who benefit from such largess, Ogawa
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Now we face a dire choice between huge tax increases or hyperinflation to
help reduce, if not wipe out, the debt that has already got out of control," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   But the last time the government raised taxes, in April 1997, the economy
sank into recession and dragged down the rest of Asia.
</P>
<P>
	   The alternative, printing more money, would reduce the value of savings and
force up prices, hurting consumer demand and ultimately the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   Either way, Japanese purchases of everything from Italian suits to
American-made computers and Asian commodities would suffer.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's an accident waiting to happen," said Matthew Poggi, an economist at
Lehman Brothers (Japan) Ltd.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Wants Ex-CIA Chief To Testify  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate Intelligence Committee chairman said today
former CIA Director John Deutch ought to appear before his panel to explain
about the classified material found on his home computer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've asked him to, we hope he will,'' committee Chairman Richard Shelby,
R-Ala., said on the ``Early Show'' on CBS. ``I hope he will appear before the
committee, he should.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is strange behavior, very suspicious,'' said Shelby, whose committee
is scheduled to meet Tuesday. ``It's unprecedented to my knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
	   When Deutch left his post in December 1996, CIA investigators discovered he
had put large quantities of classified material on a CIA-supplied but unsecured
computer in his home.
</P>
<P>
	   The same computer was used by Deutch and other members of his household to
send and receive e-mail and to access Internet sites, according to congressional
and intelligence-community officials familiar with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Deutch has not been prosecuted, but current CIA Director George Tenet
stripped him of his security clearances last August -- nearly three years after
Deutch left the CIA job.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I asked the director of the CIA (Tenet) the other day why, why did they
not notify the Justice Department and the FBI immediately,'' Shelby said. ``He
said 'well,' he said, 'We just didn't.' That's not good enough.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if he believed Deutch was in violation of the law, Shelby said, ``I
can't say he was yet. The inspector general might have a say in that or maybe
the Justice Department, but he obviously broke the rules if not the law.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Tenet testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee and
disputed a parallel between Deutch and Wen Ho Lee, the former Los Alamos
scientist now jailed on charges of mishandling U.S. nuclear secrets, including
transferring top-secret files to an unsecured computer.
</P>
<P>
	   Tenet said Deutch was merely working from his home, not transferring
classified material from a secured computer to an unsecured one, as Lee is
alleged to have done.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department's criminal division investigated Deutch's computer
use and declined last spring to prosecute, referring the case back to the CIA
inspector general for administrative discipline, according to Justice officials
who spoke on condition of anonymity. The division found the lapses were careless
rather than nefarious.
</P>
<P>
	   A Justice official said Thursday that department lawyers will review a CIA
inspector general's report on the Deutch investigation, but based on information
now available, there are no plans to reopen it.

<HEADLINE> Theatergoer's Yawn Ticks Off Actors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- An audience member's ennui annoyed an off-Broadway cast so
much the actors refused to take their curtain calls.
</P>
<P>
	   The cast of "Dinner With Friends" wouldn't take a bow following Tuesday's
performance after a man sitting in the front row of the theater interrupted the
final scene by letting out a loud yawn.
</P>
<P>
	   Producer Mitchell Maxwell described the yawn as "hippopotamus-like," and
said it drew titters from the rest of the audience.
</P>
<P>
	   Actors Matthew Arkin and Lisa Emery finished the scene without breaking
character. But Emery was shaken by the incident and, out of sympathy, the cast
didn't take curtain calls.
</P>
<P>
	   Maxwell said it is "inappropriate" for actors to refuse curtain calls, but
"there are times when the inappropriateness of an audience member overrides
that."
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, ringing cellular phones at New York performances of "Death of a
Salesman" and "The Lion in Winter" prompted actors Brian Dennehy and Lawrence

<HEADLINE> Ben &AMP; Jerry's Eyes Alternate Bid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- Shares in ice cream company Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade
Inc. rose nearly 9 today after the company confirmed it may be receiving a
buyout offer from a "socially conscious" group.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, Ben &AMP; Jerry's, which mixes socially responsible ideals with
its ice cream, said it "may be receiving an offer to acquire the company
including 'socially conscious business people.' "
</P>
<P>
	   The company said, however, the offer had not yet been received and declined
to comment further.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors pushed shares up $2 to $24.50 in early afternoon trading on the
Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   The statement was issued in response to an article in today's Wall Street
Journal, which said the Vermont company was being pursued by two rival
companies: Unilever NV, the Anglo-Dutch food conglomerate, and Dreyer's Grand
Ice Cream Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   The Journal also identified a third suitor: members of the Social Venture
Network, a San Francisco "socially responsible" investment group.
</P>
<P>
	   "Quirky brands don't usually do well as part of large conglomerates," Ben &AMP;
Jerry's co-founder Ben Cohen told the Journal. "I'm delighted there's an
investor group trying to find a way to keep the company independent."
</P>
<P>
	   Ben &AMP; Jerry's disclosed in December that it had received unsolicited
interest in taking over the company and that the board was considering a
response.
</P>
<P>
	   The company has never disclosed who made the bids, but its executives have
made clear from the beginning they were most interested in keeping the company
independent because they believe it can better stick to its ideals that way.

<HEADLINE> Capital Stages Give Politic Drama  </HEADLINE>
    By CARL HARTMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In this season of presidential primaries and caucuses,
Washington's impresarios are telling audiences about the politics of ancient
Rome.
</P>
<P>
	   On Saturday, artistic director Placido Domingo presents George Frideric
Handel's "Julius Caesar in Egypt" as the Washington Opera's first presentation
of the century. He won't sing himself: He's a tenor, and Handel wrote the lead
for soprano as was the custom in Italian opera of the 1700s.
</P>
<P>
	   Caesar will be played by mezzo-soprano Vivica Genaux. She has appeared both
in Washington and at New York's Metropolitan Opera as Rosina in Gioacchino
Rossini's "The Barber of Seville."
</P>
<P>
	   Cleopatra, played by soprano Hei-Kyung Hong, sums up the politics of the
opera in song:
</P>
<P>
	   "A charming woman can do everything,
</P>
<P>
	   "If lovingly
</P>
<P>
	   "She opens her lips or turns her glance ..."
</P>
<P>
	   The opera's Caesar follows last month's opening of "Coriolanus," a Roman
story 400 years older than Caesar's, at the Shakespeare Theatre.
</P>
<P>
	   Both heroes were murdered, Caesar by fellow Romans, Coriolanus by the
enemies for whom he betrayed Rome.
</P>
<P>
	   Shakespeare's tragedy tells of a soldier enmeshed in politics, which he
hated. Caesar won Egypt for Rome and Cleopatra for himself, and it was only
after the opera ends that he fell victim to his lust for power. The book was
written by Nicola Haym, himself a musician.
</P>
<P>
	   This version doesn't tell the famous story of Cleopatra introducing herself
to Caesar by having herself wrapped in a rug and delivered to him. Handel may
have thought that tempting bit of drama wouldn't be dignified enough for what
was then called "serious opera." This production is done more or less in the
style of his time.
</P>
<P>
	   In Handel's version, Cleopatra meets Caesar, and wins his love, disguised as
one of her own waiting women.
</P>
<P>
	   "My job is to keep to the libretto and try to enhance the emotions it
expresses," said John Pascoe, production designer.
</P>
<P>
	   Historians don't think too highly of either text: Coriolanus goes so far
back in history that some say he may have existed not as a human hero but as a
local god. In the opera, Caesar is helped by a character who seems not to have
even been in Egypt at the time: Sextus, son of his murdered enemy Pompey.
</P>
<P>
	   But both are rousing stories with plenty of swordplay, which took the place
of primaries in Roman times.

<P>
    OSLO, Norway (AP) -- The Carnival and Star cruise lines solidified their
control over the Norwegian Cruise Lines Friday, increasing their stake to
two-thirds of the concern after a surprise joint takeover bid earlier in the
week.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami-based Carnival Corp. and Malaysia's Star Cruises had engaged in a
two-month bidding war over NCL Holdings ASA, which owns the line, before teaming
up for a surprise joint $1.1 billion bid on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, the companies informed the Oslo Stock Exchange that their stake
in NCL Holdings had increased to 66.5 percent of the concern's shares, giving
them full control of the world's fourth-largest cruise line.
</P>
<P>
	   Carnival, the industry leader, had begun the bidding war in December with an
offer of 30 kroner ($3.65) per share for NCL holding. Star Cruises, which is

    LONDON (AP) -- Share prices fell Friday on the London Stock Exchange as
investment funds sold blue-chip shares to buy telecommunications stocks after
Vodafone AirTouch reached an agreement to acquire Germany's Mannesmann.
</P>
<P>
	   The Financial Times Stock Exchange 100-share index closed down 139.3 points,
or 2.2 percent, at 6,185.0.
</P>

<P>
	   Jeremy Batstone of Natwest Stockbrokers said fund managers were trying to
build up their holdings of telecommunications shares. British Telecommunications
closed up 5.6 percent, while Energis shares rose 7.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares in Vodafone, however, ended the session down 6 percent. Traders said
although British funds were buying, Vodafone was pulled lower by declining
Mannesmann shares. German fund managers, who can't hold shares in a U.K.-listed
company, were selling Mannesmann on the merger news.

    WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- The Warsaw Stock Exchange hit an all-time high
Friday, led by surging prices of shares in high-technology and
telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
	   The WIG exchange index rose by 5.1 percent, or 1,020.5 points, to finish at
21,224.6.

volume rose to 397.2 million zlotys ($94.5 million) from Thursday's 273.1
million zlotys ($65 million).
</P>
<P>
	   Leading the wave were telecommunications and computer companies that have

<P>
	   "Right now we are seeing euphoria driven by Internet-related companies,"
said broker Piotr Marczewski of Amerbrokers in Warsaw.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Mulls Execution Moratorium  </HEADLINE>
   By SONYA ROSS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will consider a request that he suspend
federal executions, the White House said Friday. A spokesman said Clinton is
``certainly concerned'' about Illinois' decision to halt executions and evaluate
how that state handles the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   The suspension request, made in a letter from Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis., is
being reviewed by White House counsel, spokesman Joe Lockhart said. But he said
that does not guarantee that Clinton would act on the matter soon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president was certainly concerned by the issues raised by the governor
of Illinois,'' Lockhart said. ``If there are legitimate concerns that are
brought to us, we will look at the concerns. But I can't predict anything beyond
that until we've had a chance to study the issue.''
</P>
<P>
	   Feingold based his request on Gov. George Ryan's halt of executions in
Illinois until authorities determine whether the death penalty is administered
fairly. Since 1976, Illinois has executed 12 prisoners. But 13 death row inmates
have been exonerated since 1987 through appeals, DNA evidence or, in a few
cases, persistent investigation by college journalism students.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter dated Wednesday, Feingold asked that Clinton suspend federal
executions and have Attorney General Janet Reno thoroughly review how the
federal death penalty has been used, ``in light of the serious questions raised
in Illinois and elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Before the federal government executes anyone, the Justice Department
should be absolutely certain that innocents have not been condemned to death,''
Feingold wrote. ``It must ensure that the federal death penalty is applied in a
fair and just manner.''
</P>
<P>
	   According to Feingold, sponsor of a bill to abolish the federal death
penalty, federal courts have sentenced 21 people to die, three-quarters of whom
are minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the condemned is Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh.
</P>
<P>
	   Another, Juan Raul Garza, has exhausted his appeals and could become the
first federally executed prisoner since 1963. Garza, head of a
marijuana-trafficking ring in Brownsville, Texas, was sentenced to die for the
murders of three men he suspected of being police informants.
</P>
<P>
	   Nationally, 85 people have been freed from death row since 1973, according
to the Death Penalty Information Center.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq in Record Area; Dow Down 3.95  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks pushed back into record territory today
after a government report showed the U.S. economy surged into the new year,
driving unemployment to a 30-year low.
</P>
<P>
	   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index was up 57.31
to 4,268.29, above its previous record of 4,235.40, set Jan. 21.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average was down 3.95 to 11,009.49 and the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 4.50 to 1,429.47.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks rose in spite of the latest sign that the economy is growing quickly
enough to convince the Federal Reserve to continue raising interest rates in its
effort to keep inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
	   The Labor Department said today that employers added 387,000 jobs in
January, pushing the unemployment rate down to 4 percent, its lowest level since
1970. Still, some economists had expected the jobless rate to tumble below 4
percent, and investors drew some confidence when it did not, traders said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures, rose
a slightly higher-than-expected 0.4 percent to $13.50 in January, the fastest
pace since September.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the rise in wages, investors apparently have faith that the Federal
Reserve is in control of inflation. The central bank on Wednesday increased
rates for the fourth time since June, and indicated more increases may be on the
way.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the steady hand by the Fed is helping fuel the rally," said Barry

<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Julia Roberts, Jerry Seinfeld, Bruce Willis, Bill Cosby and
Steve Martin will relive their favorite "Late Show" moments next week as David
Letterman continues recuperating from heart bypass surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   The celebrities will roll tapes and reminisce about their appearances with
Letterman over the years. They will be interviewed by either Regis Philbin,
Charles Grodin or Paul Shaffer.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman could return as early as Feb. 14. Or maybe not.
</P>
<P>
	   "There certainly is not a schedule for Dave to come back on the 14th, but
it's not out of the question," executive producer Rob Burnettt said Friday. "I
just don't think we know at this time."

	   If Letterman's absence stretches beyond next week, the "Late Show" may try
guest hosts for the first time, Burnett said. Letterman may also appear only
once or twice a week when he first comes back.

<TEXT>
<P>
    MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- Shares in ice cream company Ben &AMP; Jerry's Homemade
Inc. rose nearly 9 percent today after the company confirmed it may be receiving
a buyout offer from a "socially conscious" group.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, Ben &AMP; Jerry's, which mixes socially responsible ideals with
its ice cream, said it "may be receiving an offer to acquire the company
including 'socially conscious business people.' "
</P>
<P>
	   The company said, however, the offer had not yet been received and declined
to comment further.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors pushed shares up $2 to $24.50 in early afternoon trading on the
Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   The statement was issued in response to an article in today's Wall Street
Journal, which said the Vermont company was being pursued by two rival
companies: Unilever NV, the Anglo-Dutch food conglomerate, and Dreyer's Grand
Ice Cream Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   The Journal also identified a third suitor: members of the Social Venture
Network, a San Francisco "socially responsible" investment group.
</P>
<P>
	   "Quirky brands don't usually do well as part of large conglomerates," Ben &AMP;
Jerry's co-founder Ben Cohen told the Journal. "I'm delighted there's an
investor group trying to find a way to keep the company independent."
</P>
<P>
	   Ben &AMP; Jerry's disclosed in December that it had received unsolicited
interest in taking over the company and that the board was considering a
response.
</P>
<P>
	   The company has never disclosed who made the bids, but its executives have
made clear from the beginning they were most interested in keeping the company
independent because they believe it can better stick to its ideals that way.

<HEADLINE> IMF Tells Russia To Cover Deficit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's large trade surplus should allow it to cover its
budget deficit without foreign loans, a visiting International Monetary Fund
delegation told the Russian government, according to a news report Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The IMF has frozen disbursements of its $4.5 billion loan program for
Russia, saying that Russia's reform moves were insufficient. No quick resumption
of lending is expected.
</P>
<P>
	   After spending two weeks in Moscow, an IMF team has told Russian officials
that the country's $30 billion trade surplus and nine-year highs for Russian oil
exports should enable the government to meet its budget and debt payment
obligations without outside help, the daily newspaper Vedomosti reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian officials have said the country may be able to cover about $3
billion in foreign debt falling due in the first quarter of the year without
foreign loans and without dipping into Central Bank currency reserves.
</P>
<P>
	   But Russia insists that it cannot meet the $8.6 billion in planned debt
service in 2000 without the $6 billion in loans it is expecting from foreign
lenders.
</P>
<P>
	   The war in rebel Chechnya has also become an additional burden on Russia's
economy. The government has spent some $178.5 million on the on the war so far,
exceeding planned spending by about $53.5 million, First Deputy Prime Minister
Mikhail Kasyanov said recently.
</P>
<P>
	   The IMF says its decision on whether to resume lending to Russia will be
based on economic considerations. But the World Bank -- the other major lender
to Moscow -- said this week it will consider the ``human implication'' of
Russia's fierce offensive before deciding on whether to resume loans.

<HEADLINE> Nursing Home Chain Must Sell Homes  </HEADLINE>
    By ALICE ANN LOVE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's largest nursing home chain must sell 10
homes in a fraud settlement designed to punish the company but allow residents
to stay where they are and be cared for by the new owners.
</P>
<P>
	   Health and Human Services Department Inspector General June Gibbs Brown
called the settlement "an innovative way of holding the company accountable for
its criminal actions while safeguarding the residents."
</P>
<P>
	   "Our foremost goal in crafting the agreement was to prevent disruptions to
patient care," Brown said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Beverly Enterprises Inc. agreed Thursday to plead guilty to criminal charges
of inflating the number of hours nurses spent caring for Medicare patients. As
part of the settlement, the company will pay $175 million in fines and sell
homes in California, Georgia, Kansas, South Carolina and Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Charges against the Arkansas-based company were not related to the quality
of patient care. Government officials said residents of the 10 homes that will
be sold can continue to live there, get the same care and receive government
benefits to cover their expenses.
</P>
<P>
	   Beverly will have up to four months to find a new owner for each home.
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, "We intend to work diligently in all of the communities to
continue to take care of our residents," said Beverly spokesman Dan Springer.
</P>
<P>
	   Springer added that nursing homes commonly change ownership with minimal
disruption to patients. And, in this case, the government will oversee the
process and must approve the new owners.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the Beverly settlement is the biggest ever in a federal nursing
home fraud case, the government faced some special concerns in negotiations with
the company. The law requires health care providers with criminal convictions to
be barred from participation in all federal health insurance programs.
</P>
<P>
	   That always causes inconvenience for some patients who used those providers.
But in the case of nursing homes, where the vast majority of patients rely on
federal dollars to pay their bills, cutting off multiple facilities from
Medicare and Medicaid was particularly undesirable.
</P>
<P>
	   The 10 homes that will instead be sold are:
</P>
<P>
	   --In California, two homes, both using the name "Beverly Manor," in
Escondido and San Francisco; College Oak Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in
Sacramento; Hy-Long Convalescent Center in Sunnyvale and Torreno Gardens in Los
Gatos.
</P>
<P>
	   --In Kansas, Hearthstone Nursing Center in St. John and Countryside Estates
in Iola.
</P>
<P>
	   --Also, Hospitality of Macon, in Macon, Ga.; Beverly Health and
Rehabilitation Center in Aiken, S.C., and Pinewood Terrace in Colville, Wash.
</P>
<P>
	   In total, Beverly operates about 561 skilled nursing facilities and 34
assisted living centers nationwide, with about 53,000 patients.

<HEADLINE> Jan. Jobless Rate Down to 4 Percent  </HEADLINE>
    By JEANNINE AVERSA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's historic economic expansion propelled the
unemployment rate to a 30-year low of 4 percent in January, giving many workers
the best labor market they have seen since taking their first job.
</P>
<P>
	   Trying to keep pace with the roaring economy, employers added a whopping
387,000 jobs to their payrolls last month, the largest leap since September
1997, the Labor Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Usually January isn't a big month for hiring, but the better-than-normal
weather early in the month gave a big boost to employment, particularly in
construction and other fields that tend to flourish when the weather is good,
economists said.
</P>
<P>
	   The dip in January's unemployment rate -- down from December's 4.1 percent
-- was the lowest jobless rate since January 1970 when it stood at 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a very positive labor market for U.S. workers, particularly those
left behind by previous expansions," said Jared Bernstein, an economist with the
Economic Policy Institute, a group funded in part by labor. "It's delivering
broad-based gains throughout the work force. ... It's lifting the rowboats, not
just the yachts."
</P>
<P>
	   The unemployment rate for Hispanics fell to an all-time monthly low of 5.6
percent in January, while the rate for blacks rose to 8.2 percent, up from 7.9
percent the month before.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, the economy entered 107 months of uninterrupted economic growth,
the longest expansion in U.S. history, beating the old mark of 106 months set
during the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
	   "Today's strong employment numbers confirm once and for all that this is the
longest economic expansion in our history," President Clinton told reporters at
the White House. "The milestone is a credit to the American people, to their
hard work."
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve boosted interest rates Wednesday by a quarter of a
percentage point -- the fourth increase since June -- to help ensure the
expansion stays on track. The Fed raised rates to slow the red-hot economy and
keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
	   Many analysts, citing continuing strong economic growth, expect additional
rate increases this year and said Friday's report justifies such a move at the
Fed's next meeting in March.
</P>
<P>
	   "The economy still has plenty of momentum and more Fed tightening is coming
down the pike," said Merrill Lynch's chief economist, Bruce Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
	   Wall Street, which has been volatile in recent sessions, offered a mixed
reaction to the report. The Dow Jones was down about 6 points in midafternoon
trading and the Nasdaq was up over 55 points. Bond prices slid as the yield on
the bellwether 30-year Treasury rose to 6.21 percent from 6.13 percent late
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   January's big burst in hiring was helped by a huge and usual 116,000 new
construction jobs -- the biggest gain in nearly 16 years -- aided by mild
weather. Heavy construction, concrete, masonry and roofing trades posted the
largest increases.
</P>
<P>
	   Given that, some economists didn't believe the bigger-than-expected 387,000
total new jobs created in January was a worrisome sign that the economy may be
on the brink of overheating. They expect the next report to show jobs growth
moderating.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures, rose
0.4 percent to $13.50 in January, the fastest pace since September. But some
economists didn't find the uptick troubling. In December, wages grew by 0.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "The 0.4 percent increase is not excessive," said Gary Thayer, chief
economist for A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. "Workers are seeing wage gains above
inflation which stretches their income. But wage gains are not so high as to
force companies to raise their prices."
</P>
<P>
	   While strong wage and job growth are good for workers, economists are always
looking for signs that the combination could trigger inflation, fearing that
employers trying to attract scarce workers will lure them with higher wages and
benefits -- increased costs that could drive up consumer prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Jobs gains were so widespread that even manufacturing, which lost 248,000
jobs last year, added 13,000 jobs in January. The largest increases came from
electrical equipment and auto production. Manufacturers are recovering from the
effects of a global financial crisis that struck in 1997, depressing overseas'
demand for U.S. goods.
</P>
<P>
	   The service sector, the driving force of job creation in the United States,
added 256,000 jobs in January with landscaping firms, clothing stores and car
dealerships all showing gains.
</P>
<P>
	   Business services added 152,000 jobs, while 35,000 government jobs were
added, reflecting in part the hiring of 11,000 federal census workers.

<HEADLINE> Falun Gong Members Arrested  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN LEICESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIJING (AP) -- As fireworks thundered from Beijing's outskirts, police on
Tiananmen Square beat, kicked and detained at least 50 Falun Gong members, who
welcomed the Year of the Dragon with one of their biggest protests since the
sect was outlawed.
</P>
<P>
	   Practitioners ranging from young children to old couples converged on the
vast square from underground pedestrian tunnels just before midnight Friday.
Many pulled red banners from beneath their clothing and waved them aloft. At
least two dozen people sat down cross-legged in unison.
</P>
<P>
	   Police pounced on the protesters almost immediately, running toward them
from all corners of the square. Most were herded into police vans.
</P>
<P>
	   At least two men were felled by police who took running kicks and knocked
their legs out from under them.
</P>
<P>
	   The square was decorated for the holiday, which is traditionally celebrated
with family reunions and feasts of steamed dumplings. Trees were strung with
tiny multicolored lights, and the Tiananmen Gate was decked with big red
lanterns.
</P>
<P>
	   Wang Xiaoping, a Falun Gong member from Beijing in her mid-20s, said she
felt it was more important to express her dissatisfaction with the government's
ban of the sect than spend the most important holiday of the year with her
family.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They won't let us practice, they are trying to crush us,'' she said. ``But
we're not against the government, we just want the government to have peaceful
talks with our master, Li Hongzhi.''
</P>
<P>
	   She then walked straight for the police, pulling a red banner from her
anorak, and was flung to the ground within seconds. As she tried to get up, she
was knocked back to the ground and kicked several times. Wang and her two
companions, a man in his early 50s and a woman in her 40s, were hit and cursed
at by at least six policemen before being restrained and put into a van.
</P>
<P>
	   A man, strolling with a woman and a young girl, quietly pulled out his
banner. Police set upon him, punching him in the face and torso, while the girl
screamed, ``Don't hit, don't fight!''
</P>
<P>
	   At least three tourists were detained for taking pictures, and one had the
film removed from her camera.
</P>
<P>
	   After about 25 minutes, columns of police ran into the square and closed it.
Officers were positioned every 20 yards to keep anyone from entering, and police
vans patrolled the edges.
</P>
<P>
	   Beijing banned Falun Gong in July as a threat to Communist Party control.
The blend of meditation, slow-motion exercises and ideas drawn from Buddhism,
Taoism and the group's founder, Li, had attracted millions of followers around
the country. China has issued a warrant for Li's arrest, and he now lives in New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   The streets of Beijing had been eerily quiet earlier Friday as people headed
home to welcome the Year of the Dragon, which is considered one of the luckiest
times in the 12-year zodiac.
</P>
<P>
	   Many people left work early to gather with family at home to feast and watch
a gala of song, dance and comedy on New Year's television specials. Prisons sent
well-behaved inmates home to join with loved ones. Villages prepared fireworks
shows, staged to scare off evil spirits.
</P>
<P>
	   This year is particularly special for Chinese, many of whom identify
themselves with the dragon, calling themselves the ``dragon's descendants.'' In
ancient times, emperors regarded themselves as reincarnations of dragons, and
children born during the year are considered blessed.

<HEADLINE> Suddenly, homeowner is a tenant  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SPRING VALLEY, N.Y. (AP) - Nobody knows where the bill went. Nobody
knows who was supposed to handle it. But because $58.67 in taxes didn't get
paid, Mireille Leroy's house was sold out from under her without her knowledge.
<P>
	   "It doesn't sink into my head," she says. "It's a nightmare that I want to
wake up from."
</P>
<P>
	   Leroy, 38, says the first clue she had about the foreclosure was an eviction
notice she received Jan. 20 from the man who had bought her house at auction
three months earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   The buyer, Carlo Jean Pierre of Wesley Hills, backed off the eviction demand
when he heard her story. His lawyer is negotiating with public officials and
mortgage companies toward a settlement that would get Leroy her house back. But
that apparently will take more than the $60,000 he paid, because Pierre "wants
to realize some portion of the potential profit on the home," his lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
	   So for now, Leroy is a tenant in the house she thought she owned.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nothing's in writing, so that means nothing is settled," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Leroy, a registered nurse with a 14-year-old daughter, emigrated from Haiti
17 years ago and bought the townhouse on Sharon Drive in Spring Valley in 1996
for $114,000.
</P>
<P>
	   As is standard procedure, her mortgage company paid the taxes from an escrow
account she funded. She never missed a payment and the company that now has the
mortgage says it knows of no missed taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   But in 1997, a bill for $58.67 was sent out by the Town of Ramapo. It
represented what she owed because she received a few months' worth of a
veterans' tax exemption that applied to the previous owner but not to her.
</P>
<P>
	   It's not clear if the bill went to Leroy or to one of the three or four
companies that have sold the mortgage to each other since 1996. But it wasn't
paid. Despite the low amount - even with penalties, it grew to only $270 - the
county Legislature approved the foreclosure last year and the county went ahead
with the auction.
</P>
<P>
	   Town and county officials say at least four notices were sent to Leroy by
first-class mail, but she says she didn't receive them, didn't know she was
behind in taxes, assumed all taxes were being paid by the mortgage company and
had no idea her house could be sold.
</P>
<P>
	   But it was, in October. Pierre took title Jan. 11.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is bureaucracy at its worst," county Legislator Ryan Karben said
Friday. "Nobody bothers to check whether the lady generally paid her taxes in
full. Nobody bothered to check the circumstances surrounding the underpayment.
Nobody bothered to check anything, and that's when you run into problems, when
government forgets to use a little bit of common sense."
</P>
<P>
	   The Legislature voted Tuesday to direct County Attorney Patricia Zugibe to
nullify the sale because of improper notice, but Zugibe said proper notice was
given. She also said the county cannot buy back the home without legal grounds
because that would be an illegal gift of real property.
</P>
<P>
	   Undeterred, Karben said, "At the end of this process, Ms. Leroy will get her
home back and Rockland County will implement new systems in terms of how it
deals with foreclosure."
</P>
<P>
	   Leroy says she does not resent the new owner.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a nightmare, but I don't blame him," she said. "He got an opportunity.
He took it."

	   Jobless Rate Drops to 4.0 Percent
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. unemployment rate hit a 30-year low
of 4 percent in January, down from 4.1 percent in December, the
Labor Department reported today. Employers added 387,000 jobs to
their payrolls, primarily in the service sector, construction and
business services, but also including factory work, which had
lagged behind. At the same time, average hourly earnings, a key
gauge of inflation pressures, rose 0.4 percent to $13.50 in
January, the fastest pace since September. That increase was
slightly higher than the moderate 0.3 percent rise some analysts
expected. In December, wages grew by 0.3 percent.

	   Nasdaq in Record Area; Dow Up 20.48
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks pushed back into record
territory today after a government report showed the U.S. economy
surged into the new year, driving unemployment to a 30-year low.
Just before 3 p.m. EST, the Nasdaq composite index was up 83.86 at
4,294.84, well above its previous record of 4,235.40, set Jan. 21.
The Dow Jones industrial average was up 20.48 at 11,033.92. Stocks
rose despite the latest sign that the economy is growing quickly
enough to arouse worries of another interest rate hike. However,
the fall of the jobless rate to a 30-year low was not quite as big
as some economists expected, and investors drew some confidence
from that, traders said.

	   Justice Probes eBay for Antitrust
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department has launched an
antitrust investigation of eBay Inc., the world's largest online
auction site. The government has interviewed top executives of two
smaller Internet companies involved in disputes with eBay. The
probe is focused on eBay's attempts -- including a federal lawsuit
against one competitor and threats to sue another -- to prevent
smaller Web companies from listing on their own sites items being
auctioned by eBay's customers. One of eBay's top lawyers, Jay
Monahan, said today that company officials ``have had some
discussions with staff at the Justice Department regarding eBay and
the online trading business generally.'' He said eBay welcomed the
opportunity ``to talk about our business and to express our serious
concerns regarding the practices of some of the aggregators.''

cream, also said, however, that it had not yet received the offer.
It declined to comment further. The statement was issued in

the Vermont company was being pursued by two rival companies:
Unilever NV, the Anglo-Dutch food conglomerate, and Dreyer's Grand

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., hit by
its biggest losses from bank failures since the early 1990s, is
telling its examiners to keep a sharp eye out for warning signs of
possible fraud at the banks they inspect. In a memo yesterday,
James L. Sexton, director of the FDIC's Division of Supervision,
said examiners must be aware of the warning signs. The signs at
banks that have failed include a hostile attitude toward or lack of
cooperation with examiners, large proportions of risky loans and
suspicious transactions by bank insiders.

	   Passengers Gripe More About Airlines

<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Airline passenger complaints filed with the U.S.
Department of Transportation more than doubled last year, to
20,945, after surging 26 percent in 1998. One reason for the rise:
the Internet, which makes it easier to complain. But there's good
reason for passengers and airline workers to be cranky. With people
flying in record numbers, planes are more crowded than ever. Flight
delays have increased by about 35 percent in the past year,
according to the Aviation Consumer Action Project. Bumpings have
grown as planes fill. Airlines have been trying to address some of
the complaints through service initiatives such as allowing more
space between seats in coach class. But some observers say the
carriers still have far to go.

Graduate School of Public Policy at Tokyo' Chuo University and
Takayoshi Igarashi of Hosei University in Tokyo addressed the
Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan, calling for cuts in public
works spending and the debt. Rather than helping the economy or the
people, the spending mostly benefits an ``iron triangle'' of
powerful politicians, bureaucrats, and businesses, Ogawa and
Igarashi said.

<HEADLINE> New Belfast Cabinet May Lose Power  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Britain announced Friday that it will
strip authority from Northern Ireland's power-sharing Cabinet in just seven days
if the Irish Republican Army doesn't confirm it will disarm.
</P>
<P>
	   The timing, revealed for the first time by Northern Ireland Secretary Peter
Mandelson, means the Cabinet would be rendered powerless the day before Northern
Ireland's major Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, plans to vote on whether
to remain in the four-party administration.
</P>
<P>
	   The British government considers Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble's
survival as party and Cabinet leader essential. He has previously faced down
Protestant opposition at critical moments of compromise, but agreed to share
power with the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party only on condition that IRA disarmament
followed.
</P>
<P>
	   This week's long-awaited report by the province's independent disarmament
commission said IRA representatives had offered no commitments.
</P>
<P>
	   In a detailed speech Friday justifying his high-risk strategy, Mandelson
said 1988's Belfast peace accord had challenged every interest group in Northern
Ireland to make painful breaks with its past.
</P>
<P>
	   That means the province's British Protestant majority had been required to
accept both early paroles for IRA prisoners and Sinn Fein as Cabinet colleagues,
Mandelson said.
</P>
<P>
	   It also means disarmament must ``underwrite with actions the paramilitaries'
stated commitment to peace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams angrily accused Mandelson of undermining
his efforts to win a shift in the IRA's position.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At the time when we were actually talking to the IRA, what does Peter
Mandelson do? He accuses them of betraying the process,'' Adams said, referring
to comments the British minister made Thursday in announcing a bill to suspend
the Cabinet's powers.
</P>
<P>
	   Adams insisted the outlawed group was ``an undefeated army'' and as such
shouldn't be obliged to scrap its network of hidden arms dumps, a process the
peace accord envisaged should conclude by May.
</P>
<P>
	   The question of when, if ever, disarmament would commence has overshadowed
peacemaking efforts here for several years. But the British and Irish
governments appear united in forcing the IRA to make its position clear in the
coming crucial days.
</P>
<P>
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, who held an emergency summit Thursday
night with his British counterpart Tony Blair, defended the plan to suspend
powers in Belfast in seven days.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Decommissioning is an issue that will not go away. It is part of the
agreement and has to apply,'' Ahern said. He added that he could not be
confident that the IRA would offer ``the clarity we all require.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, President Clinton said he and his National Security Council
team were ``working intensely'' in consultation with the British and Irish
governments and Sinn Fein to avert a Belfast breakdown.
</P>
<P>
	   In his address Friday to the Institute of Irish Studies at the University of
Liverpool, Mandelson drew comparisons between the current crisis and failed
efforts a generation ago to run a power-sharing Cabinet in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
	   That Cabinet collapsed in 1974 after five months under the combined weight
of a Protestant general strike and IRA attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Is history repeating itself? Are we about to squander yet another golden
chance to end forever the conflict in Northern Ireland?'' Mandelson asked.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the answer would depend on whether the IRA ``at this late, late
hour'' could ``demonstrate clearly that they are dedicated to this process, to
prove to us that the bill to pause the institutions is not necessary.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Limits Austria Govt. Contacts  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration today distanced itself from
Austria to protest inclusion of far-right Freedom Party members in a new
government.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, announcing there would be limited
contacts with Vienna, said there should be no place in a European government for
a political party that ``doesn't distance itself clearly from the atrocities of
the Nazi era and the politics of hate.''
</P>
<P>
	   Albright said Ambassador Kathryn Hall would register the United States' deep
concern about inclusion of six members of the Freedom Party in the new coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. defense attache in Vienna was ordered not to participate in
ceremonies for Austria's new defense minister, Albright said, and Hall will
return to Washington to report and then go back to Austria to keep tabs on
political developments there.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States will ``react forcefully to any deviations'' from
democratic European principles, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Freedom Party is headed by Joerg Haider, who praised Adolf Hitler's
``orderly employment'' policies and lauded veterans of the Waffen SS as ``decent
people of good character.'' He later apologized.
</P>
<P>
	   The European Union took stronger steps than those announced by Albright at a
joint news conference with Abel Matutes, the foreign minister of Spain, and
Finland suspended relations with Vienna.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States is not a member of the European Union, and Albright said
further judgments would be made based on Austria's ``deeds, not words.''
</P>
<P>
	   For his part, Matutes said Spain has taken a strong position against Austria
and proposed suspension of far-right politicians in European groups.
</P>
<P>
	   In Vienna, Austria's new foreign minister, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, said the
pressure from Europe had only offended the public.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Because of the ostracism, the Freedom Party is growing ever stronger,''
Ferrero-Waldner, a member of the People's Party, told Germany's Deutsche Welle
radio today.

<HEADLINE> Falun Gong Members Arrested  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN LEICESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIJING (AP) -- As fireworks thundered from Beijing's outskirts, police on
Tiananmen Square beat, kicked and detained at least 50 Falun Gong members who
welcomed the Year of the Dragon with one of their biggest and most dramatic
protests of recent months.
</P>
<P>
	   Practitioners, ranging in age and some with children, began converging on
the vast square minutes before the new year began. Many pulled red banners from
beneath their clothing and waved them aloft. At least two dozen people emerged
from a pedestrian tunnel that opens onto the square and sat down cross-legged in
unison, a pose typical of the sect that the government banned in July.
</P>
<P>
	   Police pounced on the protesters immediately, running toward them from all
corners of the square. They kicked, punched and dragged protesters to their
feet, herded them into vans and drove them away.
</P>
<P>
	   Other protesters who came to the square alone or in smaller groups of two or
three were likewise quickly and violently tackled. At least two men were felled
by police who took running kicks and knocked their legs out from under them.
Some officers shouted obscenities at practitioners as they beat them into
submission.
</P>
<P>
	   The buildings around the square were decorated for the holiday, which is
traditionally celebrated with family reunions and feasts of steamed dumplings.
Trees were strung with multicolored lights, and Tiananmen gate, which overlooks
the square, was decorated with big red lanterns.
</P>
<P>
	   Wang Xiaoping, a Falun Gong member from Beijing in her 20s, said she felt it
was more important to express her dissatisfaction with the government ban on the
group than spend the most important holiday of the year with her family.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They won't let us practice, they are trying to crush us,'' she said.
``We're not against the government, we just want the government to have peaceful
talks with our master, Li Hongzhi.''
</P>
<P>
	   She then walked straight for the police, pulling a red banner from her
anorak, and was flung to the ground within seconds. As she tried to get up, she
was knocked back to the ground and kicked several times. Wang and her two
companions, a man in his 50s and a woman in her 40s, were also hit and shouted
at by at least six policemen before being taken away.
</P>
<P>
	   A man, strolling with a woman and a young girl, also was set upon. Police
punched him in the face, while the girl screamed, ``Don't hit, don't hit!''
</P>
<P>
	   Three tourists were detained, apparently because one took pictures. The film
was removed from the camera.
</P>
<P>
	   After about 25 minutes, columns of police ran into the square and closed it,
ushering bystanders away. Officers were positioned every twenty yards to keep
anyone from entering, and police vans patrolled the edges.
</P>
<P>
	   Beijing banned Falun Gong in July as a threat to Communist Party control.
The blend of meditation, slow-motion exercises and ideas drawn from Buddhism,
Taoism and the group's founder, Li, had attracted millions of followers around
the country. China has issued a warrant for Li's arrest, and he now lives in New
York.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Jurors hear another appraiser on land claim's worth  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - An appraiser for New York state said he considered
the 64,015-acre Cayuga Indian Nation land claim as one single tract as he began
Friday to explain how he determined the tribe's ancestral lands to be worth $46
million.
<P>
	   An appraiser for the federal government, Arvel Hale, testified last week
that the land had a present-day market value of $264.7 million and a rental
worth of $70.4 million. The state spent three days trying to show that Hale's
methods were flawed and that the sum was grossly inflated.
</P>
<P>
	   In his first day on the witness stand, Dorchester explained the steps he
took in doing his appraisal, in which he put the land's present-day market value
between $25 million and $40 million and its rental worth at no more than $6.5
million.
</P>
<P>
	   "It would be virtually impossible to value separate parcels of land over 204
years," John D. Dorchester Jr. told a nine-member U.S. District Court jury.
Dorchester is the state's key witness in the two-week-long damages trial.
</P>
<P>
	   "I looked at the property as a single tract, with single ownership ... and
with no private improvements," Dorchester said.
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout his testimony, Dorchester returned to a theme that has become the
state's refrain as it seeks to undermine the testimony from Hale, who was the
only witness for the federal government and Cayugas, who are joint plaintiffs in
the case. The state has contended that Hale reached his values by adding
individual parcels instead of considering the claim area as a whole.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury is being asked to decide how much New York state should pay the
Cayugas for illegally acquiring the land in Cayuga and Seneca counties two
centuries ago. U.S. District Judge Neal McCurn has said the Cayugas should be
compensated for the land's present-day market value, as well as compensation for
its use and occupancy since 1795.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of his testimony, Hale said he looked at 5,700 parcels and used a
"highest and best use" approach to derive a per-acre average price in
determining the claim area's worth.
</P>
<P>
	   "To try to value them as individual parcels ... would be difficult to
impossible. There are major problems in doing it that way," said Dorchester, who
will return to the witness stand Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time New York acquired the Cayuga land in 1795, that part of upstate
New York was considered frontier. New York divided the land into 600-acre
parcels and auctioned them off in 1796 to help promote settlement. They have
undergone repeated subdivision since that time.
</P>
<P>
	   Records from the earliest years are scarce and both appraisers said they
supplemented sales records with other information to calculate rental value.
Hale based his value on 6 percent of an acre's worth as farm land. Dorchester
said Friday he used a 2 percent figure.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Friday, Dorchester went over his credentials from nearly 50 years in
the profession, including his work appraising Alaskan lands damaged by the Exxon
Valdez spill.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant Attorney General John Pickett made sure the jury heard that
Dorchester had earned recognition as a Member of the Appraisal Institute, a
professional organization that sets industry standards, by completing a series
of tests and completing other requirements, and that he had help author the
industry's standards.
</P>
<P>
	   Hale told the jury under cross-examination that he had started but not
completed MAI requirements.
</P>
<P>
	   About two dozen members of Upstate Citizens for Equality, a grassroots
citizen's group opposed to the land claim, attended Friday's session.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 14.58; Nasdaq in Record Area  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks pushed back into record territory today
after a government report showed the U.S. economy surged into the new year,
driving unemployment to a 30-year low.
</P>
<P>
	   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Nasdaq composite index was up 79.35
to 4,290.33, above its previous record of 4,235.40, set Jan. 21.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 14.58 to 11,028.02 and the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 8.35 to 1,433.32.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks rose in spite of the latest sign that the economy is growing quickly
enough to convince the Federal Reserve to continue raising interest rates in its
effort to keep inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
	   The Labor Department said today that employers added 387,000 jobs in
January, pushing the unemployment rate down to 4 percent, its lowest level since
1970. Still, some economists had expected the jobless rate to tumble below 4
percent, and investors drew some confidence when it did not, traders said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures, rose
a slightly higher-than-expected 0.4 percent to $13.50 in January, the fastest
pace since September.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the rise in wages, investors apparently have faith that the Federal
Reserve is in control of inflation. The central bank on Wednesday increased
rates for the fourth time since June, and indicated more increases may be on the
way.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the steady hand by the Fed is helping fuel the rally," said Barry
Berman, head trader for Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks continued to lead the way as investors move toward the
stocks that performed best in 1999. Since the Fed began raising rates last June,
the blue-chip Dow has risen just 4 percent, while the Nasdaq has soared 57
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Leading the Dow higher today was Intel, up 3 3/32 to 107 9/32, and General
Electric, up 3 3/4 to 143.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Nasdaq, Apple Computer rose 6 1/16 to 109 3/8 and Cisco Systems rose
4 1/16 to 121 7/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain's Vodafone Airtouch PLC was an exception to the rally in technology
shares, falling 3 1/16 to 58 7/16 after the company sweetened its bid for German
wireless company Mannesmann AG. Mannesmann shareholders will vote by Feb. 17 on
whether to accept Vodafone's offer, now valued at $180 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Mattel shares fell 1 3/8 to 10 9/16 on the New York Stock Exchange a day
after chief executive Jill Barad resigned. The toymaker reported a steep loss
for the fourth quarter, disappointing Wall Street analysts for the third time in
the past four quarters.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on the NYSE,
where volume came to 834.09 million shares, down from Thursday's pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 5.29 to 526.92.

<HEADLINE> Judge Suggests Mitsubishi Appeal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- A judge has suggested Mitsubishi Motor Manufacturing of
America appeal his decision that a racial discrimination lawsuit against it can
proceed.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Michael Mihm's ruling on Thursday came despite a
lawyer's failure to meet several court-imposed deadlines.
</P>
<P>
	   But Mihm invited higher court review of his ruling. He said established law
fails to address the issue directly.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am not going to feel comfortable about this ruling," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitsubishi declined to comment Friday on the case or a possible appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   At issue is whether Mitsubishi or the United Auto Workers union, also named
as a defendant, were properly served with the lawsuit within the required 120
days of filing.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney Michael Riley, who filed the lawsuit in March, contends he mailed
copies of it. But Mitsubishi and the UAW deny getting the complaint until
October, more than six months later, prompting a federal magistrate to recommend
dismissal.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit alleges supervisors at Mitsubishi's plant in Normal denied black
workers promotions and transfers and allowed other acts of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
	   Riley no longer represents the 21 workers who filed the lawsuit. Most of
them are now represented by lawyers who filed a separate class-action lawsuit on
behalf of all of the Normal plant's minority workers. Those attorneys say they
hope to consolidate the two lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   Failure to serve legal documents to the other side is usually enough reason
to dismiss a lawsuit, but Mihm made an exception. He said that Riley, through
inaction, ceased to act as his clients' advocate only weeks after the lawsuit
was filed.

<HEADLINE> Suddenly, homeowner is a tenant  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SPRING VALLEY, N.Y. (AP) - Nobody knows where the bill went. Nobody
knows who was supposed to handle it. But because $58.67 in taxes didn't get
paid, Mireille Leroy's house was sold out from under her without her knowledge.
<P>
	   "It doesn't sink into my head," she says. "It's a nightmare that I want to
wake up from."
</P>
<P>
	   Leroy, 38, says the first clue she had about the foreclosure was an eviction
notice she received Jan. 20 from the man who had bought her house at auction
three months earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   The buyer, Carlo Jean Pierre of Wesley Hills, backed off the eviction demand
when he heard her story. His lawyer is negotiating with public officials and
mortgage companies toward a settlement that would get Leroy her house back. But
that apparently will take more than the $60,000 he paid, because Pierre "wants
to realize some portion of the potential profit on the home," his lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
	   So for now, Leroy is a tenant in the house she thought she owned.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nothing's in writing, so that means nothing is settled," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Leroy, a registered nurse with a 14-year-old daughter, emigrated from Haiti
17 years ago and bought the townhouse on Sharon Drive in Spring Valley in 1996
for $114,000.
</P>
<P>
	   As is standard procedure, her mortgage company paid the taxes from an escrow
account she funded. She never missed a payment and the company that now has the
mortgage says it knows of no missed taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   But in 1997, a bill for $58.67 was sent out by the Town of Ramapo. It
represented what she owed because she received a few months' worth of a
veterans' tax exemption that applied to the previous owner but not to her.
</P>
<P>
	   It's not clear if the bill went to Leroy or to one of the three or four
companies that have sold the mortgage to each other since 1996. But it wasn't
paid. Despite the low amount - even with penalties, it grew to only $270 - the
county Legislature approved the foreclosure last year and the county went ahead
with the auction.
</P>
<P>
	   Town and county officials say at least four notices were sent to Leroy by
first-class mail, but she says she didn't receive them, didn't know she was
behind in taxes, assumed all taxes were being paid by the mortgage company and
had no idea her house could be sold.
</P>
<P>
	   But it was, in October. Pierre took title Jan. 11.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is bureaucracy at its worst," county Legislator Ryan Karben said
Friday. "Nobody bothers to check whether the lady generally paid her taxes in
full. Nobody bothered to check the circumstances surrounding the underpayment.
Nobody bothered to check anything, and that's when you run into problems, when
government forgets to use a little bit of common sense."
</P>
<P>
	   The Legislature voted Tuesday to direct County Attorney Patricia Zugibe to
nullify the sale because of improper notice, but Zugibe said proper notice was
given. She also said the county cannot buy back the home without legal grounds
because that would be an illegal gift of real property.
</P>
<P>
	   Undeterred, Karben said, "At the end of this process, Ms. Leroy will get her
home back and Rockland County will implement new systems in terms of how it
deals with foreclosure."
</P>
<P>
	   Leroy says she does not resent the new owner.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a nightmare, but I don't blame him," she said. "He got an opportunity.
He took it."

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Up After Declines  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean prices shrugged off early
declines Friday to finish up strongly on the Chicago Board of
Trade.
</P>
<P>
	   Soybeans surged in a late rally after falling below $5 a bushel
to a two-week low on continuing rains in once-dry growing regions
of South America.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat also rebounded in what was called technically inspired
buying after prices declined early on suggestions Pakistan might
postpone any wheat tenders for several months.
</P>
<P>
	   Corn found support from the rally in other farm commodities as
well as from changing weather forecasts for South America.
Meteorologists now say the weekend looks largely dry in key crop
areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat for March delivery rose 3 1/4 cents to $2.57 a bushel; March
corn rose 1 3/4 cent to $2.19 3/4 a bushel; March oats rose  1/2 cent to
$1.10 1/2 a bushel; March soybeans rose 4 1/2 cents to $5.05 1/2 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
	   Beef and pork futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   April live cattle were unchanged at 72.42 cents a pound; March
feeder cattle fell .37 cent to 84.85 cents a pound; April lean hogs

<HEADLINE> 8 Swedish Teens Held in Sex Assault  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- A district court ordered eight teen-age boys held
in connection with the sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl in a Stockholm
suburb over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   Four of the boys face possible rape charges and the others are suspected of
complicity and sexual exploitation, prosecutor Anders Sundholm said. Such
crimes, especially involving teen-agers, are extremely rare in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
	   The boys, ages 15 to 16, will be tried as adults. The court on Friday
ordered them held and said the prosecutor must file formal charges by Feb. 18.
It is common in Sweden to hold suspects in a serious crime for weeks at a time
before filing formal charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Two of the boys appealed the detention, and the others are expected to do
the same Monday, the Swedish news agency TT reported.
</P>
<P>
	   A ninth boy who was under 15 was released into the custody of social
workers. Authorities did not identify the suspects.
</P>
<P>
	   The 14-year-old girl and her friend, neither of whom were identified, were
on their way home Saturday night in the northern suburb of Rissne when they were
harassed by a gang of boys. The girl said she was dragged into an outdoor
parking lot a few hundred yards from her home and sexually assaulted. Her
friend, who witnessed the attack, alerted the police.

<HEADLINE> Testimony concluded in church arson case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Defense lawyers decided against calling any
witnesses and instead will let a federal court jury decide who was responsible
for a 1997 Utica church fire, based on the testimony of the prosecution's
witnesses.
<P>
	   Jurors were expected to begin deliberations Monday in the case against
Joseph Brown, 22, and Jimmy Jackson, 31, both of Utica.
</P>
<P>
	   While Jackson and Brown are the men on trial, prosecutors say it was a rival
clergyman who ordered the burning of Believers Miracle Deliverance Church in an
attempt to drive out the competition.
</P>
<P>
	   During the trial's final day of testimony on Thursday, Roger Perkins
testified that Bishop Calvin Ashley Jr., head of St. Mark's Healing and
Deliverance Tabernacle in Utica, repeatedly said not to implicate him the fire.
</P>
<P>
	   "He told me not to worry about it, and he'd take care of everything," said
Perkins, who pleaded guilty Wednesday in federal court to a noncriminal charge
that he was allowed to enter because he was 17 at the time of the fire.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Assistant U.S. Attorney Debra Carr, the evidence showed that
Jackson, Brown, Henry Savage and Perkins were involved in setting the fire at
Ashley's request.
</P>
<P>
	   Ashley, 65, is listed in a grand jury indictment as an unindicted
coconspirator. Prosecutors have given no explanation why Ashley has not been
charged.
</P>
<P>
	   According to testimony, Perkins had dinner with Ashley the evening before
the fire. Ashley talked about his anger with Willie Jewel Steele for starting
the rival church. Steele was assistant pastor at St. Mark's for 13 years until
she left in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Later that same night, after attending a service at Ashley's church, Perkins
met with Savage, Brown and Jackson. Jackson was the musical director at St.
Mark's.
</P>
<P>
	   With Jackson working as the lookout just after midnight, Perkins testified
that he forced open the church door and that Savage poured gasoline on the floor
and doors leading to the church sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
	   During cross-examination, defense lawyers Frank Policelli and Scott
DeTraglia made note of the deal Perkins struck with authorities, which leaves
him without a criminal record. They also contended that Perkins should not be
believed. He gave as many as nine different stories to police, DeTraglia said.

<HEADLINE> Empire State Building lit in gold and red for Year of the Dragon  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - In a sneak preview of this weekend's lunar new year
celebration, a swirling 50-foot long, red and yellow dragon snaked its way
around the top of the Empire State Building on Friday to the ooh's and aah's of
tourists and children alike.
<P>
	   In a tribute to New York's increasing diversity, the Asian American Business
Development Center announced that the Empire State Building will be emblazoned
in red and gold lights to join in the welcoming of the Year of the Dragon.
</P>
<P>
	   "We hope the lunar new year will become a citywide event and not just one
celebrated by the Asian community," said John Wang, center president.
</P>
<P>
	   State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, who represents Chinatown, said during
a ceremony at the 80th floor observatory that celebrating diversity has almost
become de rigueur in this modern city. "We in New York have grown very
accustomed to celebrating the diversity of all the cultures that live in our
city," Silver said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Year of the Dragon repeats itself every 12 years, according to the
Chinese lunar calendar system. It is considered to be particularly auspicious
year, as the dragon is a symbol of authority, courage and good fortune in
ancient Chinese society, said James Yu of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   Children born during the Year of the Dragon are believed to attract wealth
and good fortune to their families, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
	   Peggy Huang, 17, of Manhattan, was part of a youth contingent that watched
the dancing dragon curl around the observatory. She said she was excited because
"it's the time of year when all the kids get a lot of red envelopes." As part of
the holiday tradition, relatives exchange red envelopes filled with money.
</P>
<P>
	   The new year, which officially begins on Saturday, is year 4698. A parade
will make its way through Manhattan's Chinatown starting around 11 a.m.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Party Reaches Impasse in Probe  </HEADLINE>
   By TONY CZUCZKA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) -- Germany's scandal-plagued Christian Democrats said
Friday they had reached an impasse in identifying the sources of millions in
covert campaign donations, even while tracing more money solicited by Helmut
Kohl than the ex-chancellor had acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
	   Party leaders said after a meeting in Bonn that interviews with key players
who set up a network of secret accounts failed to establish who gave Kohl $1
million he said he received between 1993 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   And while Kohl admitted for the first time that he also received funds
between 1989 and 1992, he said they were relatively small amounts and he could
not remember the donors, party officials told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Party general secretary Angela Merkel said ``the cartel of silence'' by
former Kohl aides had been broken. But because the aides repeatedly contradicted
each other and Kohl refused to cooperate, she added: ``We have gotten as far as
we could.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Of course you can't regain credibility with one stroke with these
revelations,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Chairman Wolfgang Schaeuble said he would leave further investigation to
Bonn prosecutors pursuing a criminal probe against Kohl and a parliament
committee examining whether political donations bought decisions during Kohl's
16 years in power.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of Kohl's steadfast silence -- or memory gaps -- on the money
sources, the party's report fell short of expectations that it would unravel
crucial elements of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, while clearing up some aspects, it added more unresolved questions
and exposed the inner workings of a slush fund under Kohl that involved discreet
cash handovers, Swiss accounts and campaign funds kept off the books.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have a whole list of new, and painful, findings,'' Schaeuble said.
</P>
<P>
	   They included confirmation that the secret party accounts dated from 1971 --
earlier than previously acknowledged -- included accounts abroad, and that Kohl
had directly accepted more money than he has so far admitted.
</P>
<P>
	   Party manager Willi Hausmann said a top party official, Uwe Luethje,
recalled that Kohl turned over $1 million to $1.5 million in cash donations from
1989 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl conceded that he had received funds during that period, but said the
amount was ``significantly lower'' than Luethje's recollection, Hausmann said.
</P>
<P>
	   Former party tax adviser Horst Weyrauch revealed the federal party had
diverted money to a Swiss account, Hausmann said. Previously, only the Hesse
state party branch had been linked to accounts held abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   Weyrauch also told investigators that Hans Terlinden, the former money
handler at the party's national headquarters, once told him he believed one
source of money was German television mogul Leo Kirch, Hausmann said.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Terlinden said he could not recall ever saying that, Hausmann said,
and Kirch has denied making any anonymous donations.

<HEADLINE> New Belfast Cabinet May Lose Power  </HEADLINE>
   By SHAWN POGATCHNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Britain announced Friday that it will
strip authority from Northern Ireland's power-sharing Cabinet in just seven days
if the Irish Republican Army doesn't confirm it will disarm.
</P>
<P>
	   The timing, revealed for the first time by Northern Ireland Secretary Peter
Mandelson, means the Cabinet would be rendered powerless the day before Northern
Ireland's major Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, plans to vote on whether
to remain in the four-party administration.
</P>
<P>
	   The British government considers Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble's
survival as party and Cabinet leader essential. He has previously faced down
Protestant opposition at critical moments of compromise, but agreed to share
power with the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party only on condition that IRA disarmament
followed.
</P>
<P>
	   This week's long-awaited report by the province's independent disarmament
commission said IRA representatives had offered no commitments.
</P>
<P>
	   In a detailed speech Friday justifying his high-risk strategy, Mandelson
said 1998's Belfast peace accord had challenged every interest group in Northern
Ireland to make painful breaks with its past.
</P>
<P>
	   That means the province's British Protestant majority had been required to
accept both early paroles for IRA prisoners and Sinn Fein as Cabinet colleagues,
Mandelson said.
</P>
<P>
	   It also means disarmament must ``underwrite with actions the paramilitaries'
stated commitment to peace,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams angrily accused Mandelson of undermining
his efforts to win a shift in the IRA's position.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At the time when we were actually talking to the IRA, what does Peter
Mandelson do? He accuses them of betraying the process,'' Adams said, referring
to comments the British minister made Thursday in announcing a bill to suspend
the Cabinet's powers.
</P>
<P>
	   Adams insisted the outlawed group was ``an undefeated army'' and as such
shouldn't be obliged to scrap its network of hidden arms dumps, a process the
peace accord envisaged should conclude by May.
</P>
<P>
	   The question of when, if ever, disarmament would commence has overshadowed
peacemaking efforts here for several years. But the British and Irish
governments appear united in forcing the IRA to make its position clear in the
coming crucial days.
</P>
<P>
	   Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern, who held an emergency summit Thursday
night with his British counterpart Tony Blair, defended the plan to suspend
powers in Belfast in seven days.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Decommissioning is an issue that will not go away. It is part of the
agreement and has to apply,'' Ahern said. He added that he could not be
confident that the IRA would offer ``the clarity we all require.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, President Clinton said he and his National Security Council
team were ``working intensely'' in consultation with the British and Irish
governments and Sinn Fein to avert a Belfast breakdown.
</P>
<P>
	   In his address Friday to the Institute of Irish Studies at the University of
Liverpool, Mandelson drew comparisons between the current crisis and failed
efforts a generation ago to run a power-sharing Cabinet in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
	   That Cabinet collapsed in 1974 after five months under the combined weight
of a Protestant general strike and IRA attacks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Is history repeating itself? Are we about to squander yet another golden
chance to end forever the conflict in Northern Ireland?'' Mandelson asked.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the answer would depend on whether the IRA ``at this late, late
hour'' could ``demonstrate clearly that they are dedicated to this process, to
prove to us that the bill to pause the institutions is not necessary.''

<HEADLINE> Burundi To Close Regroupment Camps  </HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHE NKURUNZIZA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUJUMBURA, Burundi (AP) -- The government on Friday said it will close 11 of
50 camps it has set up to house Hutu peasants it says must be protected from
Tutsi-led military operations against rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   Foreign Minister Severin Ntahomvukiye said he told a news conference that
the operation would begin Monday at Maramvya camp northeast of Bujumbura.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations, the United States and European nations have criticized
the so-called ``regroupment camps,'' into which more than 300,000 people have
been herded for what authorities said was their own protection as the
Tutsi-dominated army fought Hutu rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   Ntahomvukiye said in the first phase, some 50,000 people from 11 camps would
be returned to their homes, and that this would be followed in a second phase by
another 65,000 people from 11 more camps, depending on the security situation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a matter of not throwing them into the lion's den. We have to work
things out so that they don't return to dangerous areas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The minister said the government would be asking the United Nations and aid
agencies for help in carrying out the operation.
</P>
<P>
	   On Jan. 29, the defense ministers of Burundi and neighboring Tanzania said
security had improved along their common border and urged a speedy end to
Burundi's six-year civil war in which more than 200,000 people, mainly
civilians, have been killed.
</P>
<P>
	   On Feb. 21, former South African President Nelson Mandela is to open the
latest round of peace talks in Arusha, Tanzania, aimed at ending the conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   Mandela took over the role of mediator of the stalemated talks after the
death in October of former Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere and has criticized
all 18 parties to the talks for failing to come to an agreement.

<HEADLINE> Iran Clerics Back Minister's Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QOM, Iran (AP) -- Iranian clerics lashed out Friday at President Mohammad
Khatami's moderate policies and demanded the culture minister be executed in a
scathing response to a political cartoon.
</P>
<P>
	   The clerics said a caricature portraying hard-liner Ayatollah Mohammad Taqi
Mesbah Yazdi as a crocodile -- a symbol of treachery and deception -- was
encouraged by Culture Minister Ataollah Mohajerani and the Khatami
administration's relaxed stance toward the media.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Death to Mohajerani,'' about 4,000 clerics chanted during their protest in
the holy city of Qom, 80 miles south of Tehran. The minister, they shouted
``must be executed.''
</P>
<P>
	   The caricature, published Sunday in the reformist Azad daily newspaper, also
was criticized by about 100 protesters in the capital, Tehran, where Friday
prayer leader Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati accused the paper of aiding Iran's
opponents.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Blasphemous material and insults against clerics in newspapers are a
service to enemies. I cannot believe that foreign hands are not involved in this
issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Moderates denounced Yazdi after he alleged that a former CIA chief handed
over hundreds of millions of dollars to some Iranian newspapers. He did not name
them or say what the money was for.
</P>
<P>
	   Many newspapers have recently called for Yazdi's prosecution for making the
claims, veiled references targeting the credibility of reformist journalists.
Mohajerani angered hard-line clerics by asking Intelligence Minister Ali Yunesi
and the Revolutionary Court to verify Yazdi's accusations.
</P>
<P>
	   The clerics in Qom later joined 600 clerics who have been staging a sit-in
at a mosque to protest the caricature. The clerics vowed to continue their
protest until Mohajerani is dismissed.
</P>
<P>
	   The managing editor of Azad, Mohammad Reza Yazdanpanah, issued an apology
Thursday, saying the caricature was ``not an insult aimed at a particular
individual or group, but even if there is an appearance of an insult, I
sincerely apologize for it.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Ayatollah Javadi Amoli, leading the Friday prayers in Qom, said the
``apology was not enough'' and urged a change in government policies toward the
media.
</P>
<P>
	   The moderate Mohajerani has come under increasing attack from hard-liners in
the run-up to Feb. 18 legislative elections.
</P>
<P>
	   The elections are shaping up as a battle between reformists allied with
Khatami and hard-line clerics, who have lost ground since the Iranian president
took office in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Alarmed at the growing popularity of the reformists and their own waning
support among Iranians, hard-liners have taken a number of moderates to court,
arrested journalists and closed down several reformist publications over the
past two years.

<HEADLINE> Actor Gene Wilder undergoing cancer treatment at Sloan-Kettering  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Frizzy-haired actor Gene Wilder, devastated by the death
of wife Gilda Radner from cancer in 1989, is in a noted Manhattan cancer center
battling the disease himself, the hospital said Friday.
<P>
	   The star of 1970s comedy film classics "Blazing Saddles" and "Young
Frankenstein" is undergoing treatment at Memorial Sloan-Kettering to prevent a
recurrence of lymphoma, the hospital said in a brief statement.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not known what type of lymphoma Wilder has. A statement released by
the hospital said he was diagnosed last year and successfully treated for the
disease, which is in remission. A hospital spokeswoman declined to answer any
questions and said no further information would be given.
</P>
<P>
	   Wilder's Los Angeles based manager, Steven Paul, said he would have no
comment.
</P>
<P>
	   It is a sad twist that Wilder, who was emotionally devastated by Radner's
death from ovarian cancer and could not publicly speak of her battle without
breaking into tears, is battling cancer himself.
</P>
<P>
	   There are 10 different kinds of lymphomas and some, like Hodgkin's, are
among the most treatable cancers. But non-Hodgkin types, mainly found in those
over 50, are more difficult to cure.
</P>
<P>
	   Lymphomas are the third most rapidly increasing form of cancer in the United
States, affecting about 17 out of 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
	   The 64-year-old actor, whose comedic gift is the ability to transform his
characters from deadpanned to frenetic in a nanosecond, put his acting career on
hold during Radner's 2 1/2-year fight with the disease.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1993, he helped organize the not-for-profit Gilda's Clubs, which offer
cancer patients and their families a place to gather and find emotional support.
The first opened in Manhattan in 1995 and was based on a similar club in
California where Radner went during her illness.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, there are eight Gilda's Clubs around the country and 16 others being
developed, including ones in London and Montreal. Each is an independently run
and responsible for its own funding.
</P>
<P>
	   Joel Sesser, executive director of Gilda's Center in Manhattan, refused to
comment on Wilder's condition but said, "Gilda's Clubs everywhere are grateful
to Gene Wilder for everything he's done on our behalf and our warmest thoughts
are with him and his family."
</P>
<P>
	   Wilder, whose real name is Jerome Silberman, remarried in 1991. He is not
involved in running the clubs.
</P>
<P>
	   Though he began his career on Broadway, Wilder made his mark in the movies,
delighting moviegoers with his portrayal of an alcoholic gunslinger in "Blazing
Saddles" and California brain surgeon Dr. Frankenstein in "Young Frankenstein."
</P>
<P>
	   He last appeared in the 1991 Leonard Nimoy comedy "Funny About Love," about
a couple's difficulties trying to conceive a child.

<HEADLINE> Source: Seagram Keeping Universal  </HEADLINE>
    By NOELLE KNOX AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- If movies require a suspension of disbelief, that may
explain why investors are buying rumors that Seagram Co. Ltd. has put its
struggling Universal Studios on the block.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not true," said a person with knowledge of Seagram's plans.
</P>
<P>
	   If that's the final line, many investors may feel let down. Seagram's shares
have soared 45 percent this year on speculation that the company might be a
takeover target following the AOL-Time Warner deal, or that Seagram would
jettison its money-losing movie studio.
</P>
<P>
	   Wall Street analysts have hoped that Seagram would sell the studio, which is
awash in red ink. "It's a lousy business," said Laura Martin, an analyst with
Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   However, it's far from certain the Seagram has given up trying to turn the
studio around. The person close to Seagram, who asked to remain anonymous, said
a sale was not in the works, and this week media mogul Barry Diller denied
rumors that he was interested. A company spokeswoman declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Universal lost money on recent flicks "End of Days," "Man on the Moon," and
"For the Love of the Game," according to Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Simon. He
now expects Universal to lose up to $75 million this fiscal year, which ends
June 30, compared with a $200 million loss the year before.
</P>
<P>
	   Universal Studios is the weak link in the Montreal-based company's otherwise
strong chain of businesses. Universal Music Group is the world's largest, with
artists including Boyz II Men, Nine Inch Nails and Luciano Pavarotti. Seagram
also owns a profitable beverage business whose products include Chivas Regal
scotch and several theme parks.
</P>
<P>
	   The spotlight fell on Seagram last month after America Online announced that
it was paying a large premium for Time Warner, which owns major movie and music
studios. The move led investors to reassess the value of major providers of
entertainment "content" such as movies and music.
</P>
<P>
	   Suddenly, Seagram looked more attractive.
</P>
<P>
	   Its stock has had a sharp upturn this year, but the movement has been
volatile. Coming off a 52-week low of $36.63 in October, Seagram shares went up
to $64.31 1/4 Thursday, but were off $4.18 3/4 Friday at $60.12 1/2 on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   On Thursday, Diller tried to squelch talk that he was interested in
Universal Studios. Seagram already has a close relationship with Diller and owns
a large stake in Diller's USA Networks.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't think for our purposes that we need a theatrical or picture"
library, Diller said, adding that there were "no conversations" to buy a motion
picture company, despite news reports saying so.
</P>
<P>
	   The source familiar with Seagram's plans said Universal Studios is important
to the success of the company's theme parks, where rides are often based on
movies, as well as its Internet strategy.
</P>
<P>
	   But even this may not be enough to dispel speculation about a deal. Martin,
the Credit Suisse analyst, said she would expect any company to deny rumors of a
sale. "If you say you're not selling a business that you love, you get a better
price," she said.

<HEADLINE> Empire State Building lit in gold and red for Year of the Dragon  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - In a sneak preview of this weekend's lunar new year
celebration, a swirling 50-foot long, red and yellow dragon snaked its way
around the top of the Empire State Building on Friday to the ooh's and aah's of
tourists and children alike.
<P>
	   In a tribute to New York's increasing diversity, the Asian American Business
Development Center announced that the Empire State Building will be emblazoned
in red and gold lights to join in the welcoming of the Year of the Dragon.
</P>
<P>
	   "We hope the lunar new year will become a citywide event and not just one
celebrated by the Asian community," said John Wang, center president.
</P>
<P>
	   State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, who represents Chinatown, said during
a ceremony at the 80th floor observatory that celebrating diversity has almost
become de rigueur in this modern city. "We in New York have grown very
accustomed to celebrating the diversity of all the cultures that live in our
city," Silver said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Year of the Dragon repeats itself every 12 years, according to the
Chinese lunar calendar system. It is considered to be particularly auspicious
year, as the dragon is a symbol of authority, courage and good fortune in
ancient Chinese society, said James Yu of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   Children born during the Year of the Dragon are believed to attract wealth
and good fortune to their families, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
	   Peggy Huang, 17, of Manhattan, was part of a youth contingent that watched
the dancing dragon curl around the observatory. She said she was excited because
"it's the time of year when all the kids get a lot of red envelopes." As part of
the holiday tradition, relatives exchange red envelopes filled with money.
</P>
<P>
	   The new year, which officially begins on Saturday, is year 4698. A parade
will make its way through Manhattan's Chinatown starting around 11 a.m.

<HEADLINE> Ex-pool builder admits role in multi-million dollar swindle  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A former swimming pool contractor suspected of
cheating dozens of investors around the nation admitted Friday that he swindled
the inventor of the Big Bertha golf club out of $2.5 million.
<P>
	   William H. Koop has also agreed to cooperate with authorities here and in
South Carolina investigating bogus "prime bank note" investments he promoted
with two men in Britain and two men in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Koop, 73, told U.S. District Judge Katharine S. Hayden that he did not know
at the beginning of the scam that his actions were illegal. He acknowledged,
however, that after learning of the fraud he continued to assure at least one
victim, club inventor Glenn Schmidt, he would get his money back, along with the
promised $16 million profit.
</P>
<P>
	   Schmidt, of Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., had been told in early 1998 by Koop
that the windfall would take just 45 banking days, court papers said.
</P>
<P>
	   Schmidt is among investors around the nation who have sued Koop, and they
are not buying his story this time.
</P>
<P>
	   "Basically, he's just a flat-out liar," said Linda K. Baessler, a
businesswoman in Sterling, Colo., who claims Koop took her for about $100,000,
including $60,000 in unreimbursed credit card charges.
</P>
<P>
	   She met him in August 1997, and introduced him to over 100 others, in
California, Florida, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas, who invested about
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
	   "He seemed to be a very knowledgeable person. He seemed like he had
credentials that were very upstanding: on the board of AT&AMP;T, was a former
football player, raced speedboats," Baessler said. "In the long run, he turned
out to be a rat, a scam artist."
</P>
<P>
	   Koop, of Franklin Lakes in Bergen County, never served on the AT&AMP;T board,
played in the NFL or raced speedboats, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   His lawyer, Stephen A. Geffner, maintained Koop is also a victim of the
investment scheme.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was duped himself and also suffered substantial losses," Geffner said
outside court. "The bottom line is he doesn't have a dime. I had to give him
money last week to eat."
</P>
<P>
	   Koop began cooperating with authorities when federal agents approached him
about six months ago, Geffner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Koop faces up to 5 years in prison and a fine of up to twice his proceeds,
as well as an order of restitution. His sentencing, scheduled for April 28, is
likely to be postponed because of the continuing investigation. He remains free
on $50,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
	   Under his plea agreement with federal prosecutors in New Jersey and South
Carolina, Koop could get a reduced sentence if authorities certify he provided
"substantial cooperation."
</P>
<P>
	   Yet questions about his honesty remain: The deal can be scrapped if South
Carolina U.S. Attorney J. Rene Josey is dissatisfied with the results of a
lie-detector examination he may decide to impose to determine Koop's assets.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuits against Koop include one from six South Carolina investors who
claim Koop and the Rev. Johnny William "Bill" Cabe of HisWay Ministries in South
Carolina, cheated them of at least $390,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Cabe, who helps operate HisWay from his home in York, S.C., filed an
anti-racketeering lawsuit against federal officials last year after they seized
$1.7 million from five ministry accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   Cabe has not been charged, but Koop's lawyer said his client will testify
about Cabe.
</P>
<P>
	   A message left Friday for Cabe was not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Koop named as coconspirators two men in Britain, Winston Allen and Terrence
Wingrove, and two in the United States, Glenn Cruzen and Richard Olit.
</P>
<P>
	   He said they dealt in "prime bank notes," and promised huge returns in short
periods through complex overseas bank transactions.
</P>
<P>
	   Such investment vehicles are "entirely fictitious," said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Henry E. Klingeman, who is prosecuting the case. No one besides Koop
has been charged, but the investigation is continuing, he said. Cruzen did not
immediately return a message left Friday at his home in Boerne, Texas. No
listings or towns were immediately available for Olit, Allen and Wingate.

<HEADLINE> Clintons Swap Roles  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After more than 20 years alongside Bill Clinton, Hillary
Rodham Clinton is a pro at the role of the political spouse, deftly deferential
to the politician himself. On Sunday, the roles reverse.
</P>
<P>
	   The president will be on the side, his wife at stage center.
</P>
<P>
	   Daughter Chelsea will be there, too -- this time cheering her mom's
political aspirations instead of her dad's.
</P>
<P>
	   With that extraordinary tableau, the Clintons' dramatic role swap of
candidate and supportive spouse will be complete.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's her turn,'' said Mitchell Moss, a political scientist at New York
University. ``For the first time in their marriage ... he's the cheerleader and
she's on the field.''
</P>
<P>
	   That stark reality will be another test of the Clintons' already famously
tested marriage, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Clintons have been through a lot, but this is different,'' Moss said,
and will require the limelight-loving president to be gracious in a supporting
role.
</P>
<P>
	   After Hillary Clinton's formal announcement of her candidacy Sunday
afternoon at the State University of New York at Purchase, the family plans to
attend one of approximately 500 ``house parties'' organized by her Senate
campaign. Afterward, the Clintons will go home to their $1.7 million new house
in nearby Chappaqua, N.Y. Mrs. Clinton has already moved in.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House has made it clear that the day belongs to the first lady.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president is not on the ballot,'' White House press secretary Joe
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockhart was blunt in acknowledging that Clinton the Senate candidate will
do a political cost-benefit analysis before inviting Clinton the president to
work the hustings for her.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Well, if the calculation is that he hurts her, my guess is he won't be
spending a lot of time there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not clear two days before the event where the president would appear
in Sunday's two-and-a-half-hour speaking lineup. Not first -- that's the warm-up
act. Not last -- that's the candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   The favored job of introducing the candidate to the crowd usually goes to
the spouse or to the senior politician on hand. In this unprecedented case, both
jobs are held by one man, and he's the president of the United States. Political
sensitivities may dictate that a New York politician makes the introduction.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's going to have to get used to that sort of thing,'' said Erwin
Hargrove, a presidential scholar at Vanderbilt University.
</P>
<P>
	   Hargrove said Clinton's best strategy is to keep his distance as the
campaign to succeed retiring New York Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan heats up.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think that people would resist it in New York if he laid on a heavy
hand,'' Hargrove said. ``His best act would be as the husband. It's her fight.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton has a fight on her hands. A poll by Marist College's Institute
for Public Opinion found that 47 percent of voters favored New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani while 40 percent supported Mrs. Clinton. But for the first time
since the question was asked a year ago, fewer than half of those surveyed said
they were not concerned that Clinton lacks New York roots. Forty-seven percent
said they were at least somewhat concerned; 41 percent said they were not
concerned at all about that.
</P>
<P>
	   As jarring as it may be to see the president in a supporting role, Clinton
has been rehearsing the part.
</P>
<P>
	   He has made many admiring references to his wife's qualifications during
speeches to Democratic audiences. He often adds a wistful note about his own
future or a self-deprecating joke.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm practicing for my role as a Senate spouse,'' Clinton said after he
obligingly fetched another speaker's dropped eyeglasses during a speech in New
York City last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Moss, for one, thinks Clinton is up to the task of playing second fiddle.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bill Clinton is the best performer in American public life,'' Moss said.
``I think he'll do his part very well.''

<HEADLINE> Gore: Better prepared for Congress than Clinton in '92  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Asked to defend the administration's spotty record of
working with Congress, Vice President Al Gore suggested Thursday that his resume
makes him better prepared for the White House than Bill Clinton was in 1992.
<P>
	   Democratic rival Bill Bradley, working the other end of California, kept up
his focus on differences between Gore and himself. At a San Francisco rally, he
said national health care "has been a part of the Democratic platform for 50
years" and is "one of those issues in this campaign that distinguishes me from
Al Gore."
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, he said, "doesn't have any plan to get to universal health care."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's hopes for a spectacular bayside rally with the Golden Gate Bridge
as backdrop fell through because of rain. Instead, more than 1,000 people jammed
a restaurant to hear his remarks.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore was in southern California with Gov. Gray Davis, touring Digital Domain
and inspecting the firm's special-effects technology being used to put together
"The Red Planet," a Val Kilmer film due in June.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore noted with a bit of envy: "Must be a fun place to work."
</P>
<P>
	   Californians, he said, "will have a very decisive voice in picking the
Democratic nominee." The state, which holds its primary on March 7, has 367 of
the 2,170 delegates needed to clinch the nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   In a question-and-answer session with employees, film editor Bill Brier told
the vice president he was disappointed with the Clinton-Gore administration's
record with a resistant Congress, particularly on comprehensive health care
reform and lifting the ban on homosexuals in the military.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, noting his 16 years in the House and Senate, suggested he would bring
more experience than Clinton did in 1993 when he went straight from the Arkansas
governor's mansion to the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   "A governor who comes to the White House without previous experience in the
Congress brings certain strengths. Someone who has served in the House and the
Senate brings certain other strengths," Gore told Brier and a couple of dozen
others.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have experience in both chambers and long-standing friendships and
personal relationships on both sides of the aisle in both in the House and the
Senate," Gore said.
</P>
<P>
	   "In serving in the Congress I was known quite frequently for a willingness
to cross party lines in order to put together bipartisan coalitions in support
of the national interest."
</P>
<P>
	   As examples, he cited his work on national security matters and on pushing
investments in the Department of Defense research that helped spawn the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   From the start of Clinton's first term, critics faulted him for not learning
"Washington's ways" and forging closer personal relationships with Capitol
powerbrokers.
</P>
<P>
	   Brier, a Democrat who said he remains undecided in the primary, said after
Gore's presentation, "I was disappointed he didn't outline a strategy for
getting comprehensive health reform passed."
</P>
<P>
	   Friendships in Congress aside, Brier added, Gore "doesn't have Clinton's
charisma and I have my doubts he can do any better."
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, one of Bradley's most active Senate supporters, Paul Wellstone of
Minnesota, said the former New Jersey senator took too long to respond to
criticism from Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   "From the word go, I was saying, 'Don't let them attack you without
responding,"' said Wellstone, who spent much of January campaigning in Iowa and
New Hampshire for Bradley. "You can fight back in a principled way.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a big mistake not to - and it hurt him."
</P>
<P>
	   Another Bradley supporter, Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, said he had asked -
and that Bradley had agreed - to stop insisting that Gore apologize for
volunteers who insulted Kerrey during a weekend rally in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   "Vice President Gore was not responsible for this incident, would never
condone it and does not need to extend me an apology," Kerrey said in a
statement that the Gore campaign distributed to reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Before returning to Washington late Thursday, Gore spoke to an overflow
rally of more than 1,000 in Olympia, Wash.
</P>
<P>
	   Taking credit for the strong economy, he said the Republican presidential
candidates are wedded "to the old Reagan-Bush approach" that produced the 1980s
recession.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a bunch that is so rooted in the long-ago, obsolete point of view
that they deserve to be overwhelmingly rejected by the American people," Gore
said.

<HEADLINE> FDIC Looks for Bank Fraud Red Flags  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., hit by its biggest
losses from bank failures since the early 1990s, is telling its examiners to
keep alert for warning signs of possible fraud at the banks they inspect.
</P>
<P>
	   Fraud is said to have been a major factor in three recent bank failures, two
of which cost the FDIC's insurance fund an estimated $982 million.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've learned some things from these cases," FDIC chairwoman Donna Tanoue
said in an interview Friday. "We want to improve our performance."
</P>
<P>
	   Tanoue said the agency will commit "whatever resources are necessary" to
investigate suspected bank fraud.
</P>
<P>
	   In a memo Thursday, James L. Sexton, director of the FDIC's Division of
Supervision, reminded examiners of the importance of quickly beginning a
thorough investigation when suspicious signs appear.
</P>
<P>
	   "When 'red flags' or other information lead to suspicions that fraudulent
activity may be present, investigation should be accorded the highest priority,
and resources should be allocated accordingly," Sexton said in the memo to
regional supervision directors, for distribution to the agency's 1,800
examiners.
</P>
<P>
	   Among warning signs at banks that failed recently, the memo said, were bank
managers and officials' refusal to cooperate with or hostility toward examiners;
large proportions of risky loans; suspicious transactions by bank insiders; lack
of internal controls; and inadequate record keeping.
</P>
<P>
	   In a related move last week, the FDIC proposed that capital requirements be
doubled for banks that specialize in risky loans to people with inferior credit
histories.
</P>
<P>
	   Regulators and lawmakers are concerned about the eight U.S. bank failures
last year, which occurred within a booming economy. The eight collapses, and
another one in late 1998, cost the FDIC about $1 billion last year, the most in
a single year since the regional banking crises of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   Compounding the worry, the FDIC is predicting that as many as 20 banks could
go under this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Already, on Jan. 14, Iowa's banking superintendent closed the
Hartford-Carlisle Savings Bank of Carlisle, Iowa, and the FDIC was named
receiver.
</P>
<P>
	   Hartford-Carlisle, with $113.8 million in assets, is among the three
recently failed banks in which fraud played a role, according to regulators.
</P>
<P>
	   The others are First National Bank of Keystone, a large bank based in
Keystone, W.Va., which grew by paying high interest rates to attract capital
from across the country; and BestBank of Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDIC's estimated $750 million loss caused by Keystone's collapse could
put it among the 10 most expensive ever in this country. Federal regulators, who
closed the bank in September, said they found evidence of apparent fraud that
resulted in the depletion of the bank's capital.
</P>
<P>
	   BestBank sold high-interest credit cards as part of a travel-club membership
to consumers with damaged credit records. Its failure in July 1998 drained some
$232 million from the insurance fund.
</P>
<P>
	   Banking Committee Chairman Jim Leach, R-Iowa, prompted by the Keystone and
BestBank failures, recently proposed legislation that would give the head of the
FDIC more authority over troubled banks.
</P>
<P>
	   The bank insurance fund, which backs each account up to $100,000, has an
adequate cushion -- now some $29 billion -- to cover depositors' losses.

<HEADLINE> Jurors hear another appraiser on land claim's worth  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - An appraiser for New York state said he considered
the 64,015-acre Cayuga Indian Nation land claim as one single tract as he began
Friday to explain how he determined the tribe's ancestral lands to be worth $46
million.
<P>
	   "It would be virtually impossible to value separate parcels of land over 204
years," John D. Dorchester Jr. told a nine-member U.S. District Court jury.
Dorchester is the state's key witness in the two-week-long damages trial.
</P>
<P>
	   An appraiser for the federal government, Arvel Hale, testified last week
that the land had a present-day market value of $264.7 million and a rental
worth of $70.4 million. The state spent three days trying to show that Hale's
methods were flawed and that the sum was grossly inflated.
</P>
<P>
	   In his first day on the witness stand, Dorchester explained the steps he
took in doing his appraisal, in which he put the land's present-day market value
between $25 million and $40 million and its rental worth at no more than $6.5
million.
</P>
<P>
	   "I looked at the property as a single tract, with single ownership ... and
with no private improvements," Dorchester said.
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout his testimony, Dorchester returned to a theme that has become the
state's refrain as it seeks to undermine the testimony from Hale, who was the
only witness for the federal government and Cayugas, who are joint plaintiffs in
the case. The state has contended that Hale reached his values by adding
individual parcels instead of considering the claim area as a whole.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury is being asked to decide how much New York state should pay the
Cayugas for illegally acquiring the land in Cayuga and Seneca counties two
centuries ago. U.S. District Judge Neal McCurn has said the Cayugas should be
compensated for the land's present-day market value, as well as compensation for
its use and occupancy since 1795.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of his testimony, Hale said he looked at 5,700 parcels and used a
"highest and best use" approach to derive a per-acre average price in
determining the claim area's worth.
</P>
<P>
	   "To try to value them as individual parcels ... would be difficult to
impossible. There are major problems in doing it that way," said Dorchester, who
will return to the witness stand Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time New York acquired the Cayuga land in 1795, that part of upstate
New York was considered frontier. New York divided the land into 600-acre
parcels and auctioned them off in 1796 to help promote settlement. They have
undergone repeated subdivision since that time.
</P>
<P>
	   Records from the earliest years are scarce and both appraisers said they
supplemented sales records with other information to calculate rental value.
Hale based his value on 6 percent of an acre's worth as farm land. Dorchester
said Friday he used a 2 percent figure.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Friday, Dorchester went over his credentials from nearly 50 years in
the profession, including his work appraising Alaskan lands damaged by the Exxon
Valdez spill.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant Attorney General John Pickett made sure the jury heard that
Dorchester had earned recognition as a Member of the Appraisal Institute, a
professional organization that sets industry standards, by completing a series
of tests and completing other requirements, and that he had help author the
industry's standards.
</P>
<P>
	   Hale told the jury under cross-examination that he had started but not
completed MAI requirements.
</P>
<P>
	   About two dozen members of Upstate Citizens for Equality, a grassroots
citizen's group opposed to the land claim, attended Friday's session.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Defends Its Cable Plan  </HEADLINE>
    By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- AT&AMP;T defended its proposed merger with cable giant
MediaOne Friday as a way to give consumers greater choice in local phone and
Internet service. But critics warned that such a combination would give AT&AMP;T too
much control over the content that reaches peoples' homes.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation's No. 1 long-distance carrier squared off with rival phone
companies and consumer advocates at a Federal Communications Commission forum on
its proposed purchase of MediaOne. That deal, originally valued at $58 billion,
would make AT&AMP;T the nation's largest cable TV company and provider of high-speed
cable Internet services.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Cicconi, vice president of government affairs for AT&AMP;T, said the deal
will give consumers a new choice for local phone service to compete with the
Bell companies. Using its brand name and MediaOne's cable lines, AT&AMP;T could
capture 30 percent of the local phone business in its cable markets in four
years, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies "will bring video, voice and data services to more
communities, more quickly, and more cost-effectively than either one of us could
have done on our own," Cicconi said.
</P>
<P>
	   But opponents of the deal questioned AT&AMP;T's commitment to offering local
phone service and accused the company of trying to dominate the market for cable
programming and high-speed Internet service.
</P>
<P>
	   "AT&AMP;T will own or control the cable pipe into consumers' television sets,
much of the content beamed through that pipe, and the high-speed Internet
service consumers use to surf the net," said Priscilla Hill-Ardoin, a vice
president at SBC Communications, the nation's largest Bell company. "If this
merger is approved, their grasp on the average American consumer will be
unprecedented."
</P>
<P>
	   According to Hill-Ardoin, the merger would give AT&AMP;T control of 98 percent
of high-speed cable Internet subscribers and interests in 60 percent of the most
popular cable programming.
</P>
<P>
	   Andrew Jay Schwartzman, president of the public interest firm Media Access
Project, chided the deal, saying it clearly violates a federal law that limits
the number of cable customers a single company can serve.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want you to slowdown and give this record a full look," Schwartzman said
to FCC cable bureau officials moderating the forum.
</P>
<P>
	   AT&AMP;T has taken various steps to persuade regulators that the deal falls
within the parameters of the rule. The company also has asked for an 18-month
waiver if the FCC determines that it still needs to take steps to comply.
Schwartzman called such a request unfair.
</P>
<P>
	   Commission officials questioned the companies directly about whether their
stakes in different entities that sell and buy cable programming from each other
would pose any conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
	   AT&AMP;T's Cicconi asserted that its connections with these companies are
distant enough so that it would not exert influence on their programming
business.
</P>
<P>
	   Greg Simon, co-director of the prominent lobbying group openNET, raised
another thorny concern: that AT&AMP;T will not give rival Internet providers equal
access to the company's cable lines to deliver high-speed service.
</P>
<P>
	   "The growth of the Internet depends on a competitive environment in each
technology upon which the Internet rides," Simon said.
</P>
<P>
	   For its part, AT&AMP;T said its customers will eventually have a choice of
Internet providers.

<HEADLINE> Bradley cranky as 'national primary' opens; Gore tired, too  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Bill Bradley, hair disheveled and tie askew, gazed
around the frigid airliner as reporters and campaign staffers huddled under
coats and blankets seeking warmth and sleep before yet another dead-of-the-night
landing.
<P>
	   "I'll speak to someone," he said. Learning that dinner once more would be
cold drew an expletive about the lack of a "f------ oven."
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, dashing from coast to coast, is getting cranky.
</P>
<P>
	   The road wear is showing, too, on Vice President Al Gore, his rival for the
Democratic presidential nomination. Gore's fatigue shows up in rambling
responses to voter questions (one, about the Internet, weirdly prompted him to
go on about oil prices) and a sort of punch-drunk energy.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of catching a rare wink when he can, Gore has been spotted pacing
his cordoned off hotel corridors in his bathrobe, rousing napping aides to talk
about plumping his schedule even fuller.
</P>
<P>
	   The campaigns have shifted into a new mode after early-season tests in Iowa
and New Hampshire, with candidates broadening their campaigns and running near
empty after 20-hour days.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Bradley camp, tempers are getting short. After losing the first two
campaign tests to Gore in Iowa and New Hampshire, there is growing pressure on
Bradley to perform.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, enduring a round of television appearances the night of the New
Hampshire primary, nearly stormed off one set, tearing off his tiny microphone,
after technical glitches arose.
</P>
<P>
	   He opened the dash toward the March 7 on Wednesday in Connecticut and New
York, before flying overnight to California to begin an uphill race against Gore
in that giant state. The flight out was a comedy of errors, taking more than
seven hours with a midnight refueling stop in Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
	   Cabin temperatures plummeted, as reporters and staffers huddled under coats
and blankets struggling to keep warm and doze. Campaign spokesman Eric Hauser
roamed the plane, blanket over his shoulder. "I feel like I'm in Washington
Square Park looking for a spot to flop," said Hauser.
</P>
<P>
	   In California, snafus continued. A spectacular bayside rally with the Golden
Gate Bridge as a backdrop was moved inside because of rain, and the sound system
faltered.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides had said Bradley planned to focus on his health care plan, but instead
he banged on GOP frontrunner George W. Bush for delivering a speech in South
Carolina at Bob Jones University, a Christian school which "explicitly
discriminated on the basis of race."
</P>
<P>
	   "That's what conservatism is," said Bradley, struggling with a hoarse voice
and developing cough.
</P>
<P>
	   After the rally, Bradley hopped back on his plane for another cross-country
trek to Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
	   Under this mind-numbing stress, Bradley and aides need to make key decisions
about confronting Gore. There are more than a dozen states holding primaries on
March 7, and a good chance the nomination will be settled that day. If not, the
victor could be decided in March 14 primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   "The adrenaline is keeping you going," said Hauser.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley is scheduled to take a day off over the weekend, while Gore rests
both days.

<HEADLINE> Haider Joins Austrian Government  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE JAHN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Austria's new governing coalition, tainted by a
party identified with racial bias and Nazi sympathies, took power Friday,
triggering diplomatic sanctions and egg-throwing protests that forced the new
ministers to leave the swearing-in ceremony through an underground tunnel.
</P>
<P>
	   President Thomas Klestil, who swore in the new center-right coalition,
appealed to the world to give the new government a chance to fulfill its
promises to govern under European standards of democracy and human rights.
</P>
<P>
	   As the ministers were taking their oaths, some 5,000 protesters massed
outside the presidential offices, pelting police with eggs and paint.
</P>
<P>
	   One protester, Wilhelm Popovic, said he was showing his opposition ``in the
name of my father,'' who he said spent seven years in a Nazi concentration camp
``because of policies like this.''
</P>
<P>
	   Later Friday, protesters roamed downtown Vienna, briefly taking over the
Social Affairs Ministry and destroying several police cars. A police official,
Peter Stiedl, said 25 officers were slightly injured in clashes with
demonstrators. Smaller protests took place in Linz, Graz and Innsbruck.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel did not even wait for the government to be sworn in. Its ambassador
flew home hours before the coalition of the center-right Austrian People's Party
and Joerg Haider's far-right Freedom Party took office.
</P>
<P>
	   And one by one, the 14 nations sharing European Union membership with
Austria started reducing diplomatic ties, canceling contracts and official
visits and freezing high-level contacts.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said U.S. Ambassador Kathryn Walt-Hall
would leave for Washington to report and then return to Vienna to monitor the
political crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   Klestil had repeatedly warned that Freedom Party participation in government
would produce a fierce reaction because of Haider's anti-foreigner stand,
opposition to European Union expansion and his past praise of Nazi policies.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider won international notoriety for statements praising Adolf Hitler's
``orderly employment'' policies and lauding veterans of the Waffen SS as
``decent people of good character'' -- comments for which he has since
apologized.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Klestil indicated he had little choice but to approve the governing
coalition. In the Oct. 3 elections, the People's Party and Freedom Party won 104
of the 183 parliament seats.
</P>
<P>
	   In a televised address, Klestil expressed his personal ``concern and
dismay'' over the negative foreign reaction and domestic turmoil. He urged all
``to give the new federal government a chance and to judge it by its work.''
</P>
<P>
	   The new government will give the far right wing a greater voice in Austrian
policies than in any other European country. The chancellor, Wolfgang Schuessel,
is the leader of the People's Party, junior partner in the outgoing center-left
coalition with the Social Democrats. Freedom Party member Suzanne Riess-Passer
is vice chancellor.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider is not part of the new government and remains governor of Carinthia
province. But critics fear he will influence government policies from the wings.
</P>
<P>
	   Many European Union governments fear that the success of Haider's party
could boost rightist parties in their own countries.
</P>
<P>
	   In Belgium, where a far-right party is expected to make big election gains
this year, the defense minister suspended an order for six Austrian-made
ambulances, schools canceled ski trips to Austria and universities flew the
blue-and-gold European flag at half-staff.
</P>
<P>
	   France's defense minister postponed a meeting with Austria on European
defense and Portugal's president called off a state visit in March.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATLANTA (AP) -- BellSouth Corp. announced plans Friday to cut 2,100 jobs
this year, most of them in Atlanta, as the telecommunications company attempts
to eliminate redundant positions in its divisions.
</P>
<P>
	   About 65 percent of the cuts -- 1,365 jobs -- will come in metro Atlanta.
Another 420 jobs will be cut in Birmingham, Ala., and the remaining 315 will be

</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the move was not a surprise.
</P>
<P>
	   "In an industry being revolutionized by technology and increased
competition, BellSouth is just doing what they need to do to stay alive and keep
regulators and their shareholders happy," said Anthony F. Ferrugia, an analyst
with A.G. Edwards in St. Louis. "In fact, they would be remiss if they didn't
take the opportunity to employ technology as a substitute for more expensive
human resources."
</P>
<P>
	   Investors were pleased with the move, pushing shares of the company up $1 to
$45.06 1/4 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Atlanta-based BellSouth is eliminating staff positions in human resources,
financial, legal and regulatory departments in order to streamline its
operations, said spokesman Bill Getch.
</P>
<P>
	   Right now, BellSouth's different divisions -- including cellular telephone,
Internet, long-distance telephone, cable television and publishing businesses --
each have their own support staff. The cuts will eliminate jobs that overlap,
Getch said.
</P>
<P>
	   "BellSouth now presents one BellSouth to customers," Getch said. "This gives
us the ability to bring new products to market faster, the ability to bundle
products, that's where the competitive market is heading."
</P>
<P>
	   The company plans to make most of the reductions by offering early
retirement or severance packages to employees who leave voluntarily. Getch said
the bulk of the cuts will be completed between April and October.
</P>
<P>
	   BellSouth will probably need to cut more jobs to remain competitive with the
many small companies entering the market, said Jeffrey Kagan, an independent
analyst based outside Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is painful for the workers, and that's the upsetting part, but it's
very healthy for the company," he said. "And Wall Street will love it."
</P>
<P>
	   BellSouth, created in 1984 after the breakup of AT&AMP;T, had 96,162 employees
last year. This job reduction represents only about 2 percent of the company's
total work force. But in Atlanta, where BellSouth is the second-largest
employer, it consists of about 10 percent of the staff.
</P>
<P>
	   Friday's announcement was the third major job cut announcement to hit the
Atlanta area in the past 10 days.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Coca-Cola announced it was eliminating 2,500 workers from its
Atlanta headquarters -- about 40 percent of its local work force -- as part of
6,000 job cuts worldwide. Later that week, aircraft manufacturer Lockheed Martin
announced 800 job cuts at its operations in suburban Marietta.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, most of the workers should have little trouble finding jobs.
Atlanta's unemployment rate is at an all-time low of 2.6 percent and the city
created 115,000 new jobs in the last year.

<HEADLINE> Empire State Building lit in gold and red for Year of the Dragon  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - In a sneak preview of this weekend's lunar new year
celebration, a swirling 50-foot long, red and yellow dragon snaked its way
around the top of the Empire State Building on Friday to the ooh's and aah's of
tourists and children alike.
<P>
	   In a tribute to New York's increasing diversity, the Asian American Business
Development Center announced that the Empire State Building will be emblazoned
in red and gold lights to join in the welcoming of the Year of the Dragon.
</P>
<P>
	   "We hope the lunar new year will become a citywide event and not just one
celebrated by the Asian community," said John Wang, center president.
</P>
<P>
	   State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, who represents Chinatown, said during
a ceremony at the 80th floor observatory that celebrating diversity has almost
become de rigueur in this modern city. "We in New York have grown very
accustomed to celebrating the diversity of all the cultures that live in our
city," Silver said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Year of the Dragon repeats itself every 12 years, according to the
Chinese lunar calendar system. It is considered to be particularly auspicious
year, as the dragon is a symbol of authority, courage and good fortune in
ancient Chinese society, said James Yu of the Taipei Economic and Cultural
Office in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   Children born during the Year of the Dragon are believed to attract wealth
and good fortune to their families, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
	   Peggy Huang, 17, of Manhattan, was part of a youth contingent that watched
the dancing dragon curl around the observatory. She said she was excited because
"it's the time of year when all the kids get a lot of red envelopes." As part of
the holiday tradition, relatives exchange red envelopes filled with money.
</P>
<P>
	   The new year, which officially begins on Saturday, is year 4698. A parade
will make its way through Manhattan's Chinatown starting around 11 a.m. The fire
department said no fireworks or pyrotechics permits were requested from parade
organizers. Four years ago, City Hall banned fireworks at most events in the
interest of safety, but still grants licenses for some major events under what
it deems controlled conditions.

<HEADLINE> British Conservatives Expel Archer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Best-selling novelist Jeffrey Archer, who was forced to drop
out of the race for London mayor after admitting he once asked a friend to lie
for him in a libel case, was expelled Friday from the Conservative Party for
five years.
</P>
<P>
	   Archer, a former deputy leader of the party, said he was ``naturally
disappointed'' and considered the decision ``grossly unfair.''
</P>
<P>
	   The expulsion is subject to appeal and Archer said he would consult his
advisers about whether to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision follows Archer's appearance before the party's ethics and
integrity committee last month.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The conduct which Lord Archer had engaged in was conduct which, once
revealed, was new and damaging to the party,'' the committee said. ``It was not
conduct which could be dismissed, as his legal advisers sought to do, merely
because it was old and stale.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is the element of concealment which also makes what Lord Archer had
done in order to promote his personal ambitions more reprehensible,'' the
committee added.
</P>
<P>
	   Under tabloid pressure, Archer admitted in November that he had asked a
friend to lie 13 years ago when the novelist was embroiled in a libel suit
against the Daily Star newspaper, which had accused him of hiring a prostitute.
</P>
<P>
	   He then quickly quit the race to become London's first elected mayor,
leaving the Conservative nomination to businessman Steven Norris, who once had
five mistresses.
</P>
<P>
	   Archer could have been banned for life by the party.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think we had to take a balanced judgment,'' ethics committee member Sir
Archie Hamilton told British Broadcasting Corp. radio. ``And it would I think
have been more than five years if we hadn't taken into account the amazing
contribution Jeffrey Archer has actually made to the Tory party.''
</P>
<P>
	   Archer was elected to the House of Commons in 1969, but had to resign within
five years after bad investments drove him to bankruptcy. That inspired his
first book, ``Not a Penny More, Not a Penny Less.'' His novel, ``Kane and
Abel,'' and the television miniseries it spawned transformed him into a
publishing powerhouse.

<HEADLINE> Finns Face Ideological Election  </HEADLINE>
   By MATTI HUUHTANEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HELSINKI, Finland (AP) -- In a presidential election more about character
and traditional leanings than policy, Finns will choose Sunday between a former
prime minister who has embraced the business community and a labor lawyer with
strong ties to the working class.
</P>
<P>
	   The race has been fierce, with recent surveys indicating Esko Aho is gaining
on Foreign Minister and Social Democrat Tarja Halonen, who hopes to become the
country's first female president.
</P>
<P>
	   Few real issues were at stake.
</P>
<P>
	   Both candidates agree on Finland's foreign and defense policies -- the
domain of the president, who stays out of day-to-day politics in the largely
symbolic post -- and there is wide consensus on Finland's membership in the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
	   So for many voters, the election has been about character and the
traditional question of political leanings to the right or left.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's very clear that the president will have his or her social values and
ideological goals. They will not disappear,'' Aho said. ``This is a social
election and social opinions will decide the vote.''
</P>
<P>
	   Aho, 45, comes from a small town in central Finland and represents a party
traditionally supported by farmers and landowners. But he has shaken off that
image with urban voters, winning the support of many high-power conservative
politicians and businessmen.
</P>
<P>
	   The jovial, red-haired Halonen, 56, a former trade union lawyer who still
lives in the workers' part of Helsinki where she grew up, is backed by leading
trade unions but has tried to play down the traditional political divide.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Splitting the election campaign into political left and right would limit
voters' freedom and right to make their own choices,'' Halonen said.
</P>
<P>
	   Aho, in a break with traditional Finnish privacy, has involved his family of
four children and stylish wife in his campaign. He openly extols family and
Christian values.
</P>
<P>
	   Halonen is divorced and lives with her longtime boyfriend. She has quit the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in a country where 85 percent are members.
</P>
<P>
	   Turnout is expected to be high on Sunday, as it was in the Jan. 16
first-round vote that whittled down the contest from seven candidates to two.
Thirty-seven percent of the 4.2 million electorate have already cast ballots in
a week of advance voting ahead of Sunday's round.
</P>
<P>
	   Surveys show Aho has steadily narrowed the gap after Halonen took an early
lead of up to 14 points.
</P>
<P>
	   In true Finnish reserved style, the candidates have declined to criticize
each other and despite predictions, have not turned the race into a battle of
the sexes.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans Change in Forest Funds  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN HUGHES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton on Monday will propose eliminating four
national forest trust funds and instead earmark the funds' $300 million to a
single, new program aimed at restoring national forests and hiring rural
workers, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmentalists welcomed the plan, saying the trust funds have been an
incentive for forest managers to log so that they could get money for pet
projects. Critics also complained that trust fund spending is not approved by
Congress and therefore, open to abuse.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly two-thirds of the timber sale revenues in national forests are
currently deposited in trust funds that local forest managers can tap for
projects, such as removing dead and dying trees and protecting stream beds. The
amount spent increased from 16 percent in 1993 to 27 percent in 1997, the
General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, found in a study.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, in his fiscal year 2001 budget, will seek to cancel the Salvage
Sale, Knutson-Vandenberg, Reforestation, and Timber Sale Pipeline Restoration
trust funds and instead send the timber receipts to the U.S. Treasury.
</P>
<P>
	   The president wants Congress to use the money to set up a single, permanent
fund that would allow Forest Service officials to target the spending for the
highest-priority projects nationwide, and where rural jobs are needed.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmentalists praised Clinton's proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a long overdue effort to address the perverse incentives within the
Forest Service,'' said Mike Anderson of The Wilderness Society in Seattle. ``It
will solve some of the Forest Service financial difficulties as well.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the plan must gain congressional approval and faces a tough fight in the
GOP-controlled House and Senate. Sending trust fund dollars to the Treasury
increases the temptation of Congress to use the money for other priorities, said
Mark Rey, a GOP staffer with the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal also will not be welcomed by many local forest managers, who
have viewed the trust funds as a source of stable revenue.

<HEADLINE> Investors Look To Save Ben &AMP; Jerry's  </HEADLINE>
    By ROSS SNEYD AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- A group of "socially conscious" investors is banding
together in an effort to save one of its own, the quirky ice cream manufacturer
famous for such flavors as Bovinity Divinity and Phish Food.
</P>
<P>
	   In the face of a takeover bid by more traditional companies, some of Ben &AMP;
Jerry's socially responsible brethren don't want to lose what many of them
consider their patron saint, the independent ice cream company that over the
years carved out its place in the business world by being known as much for its
social consciousness as the taste of its product.
</P>
<P>
	   News of a potential rival to Unilever NV, an Anglo-Dutch food conglomerate,
and Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream Inc. -- both of whom have reportedly been pursuing
the Vermont-based company -- helped boost Ben &AMP; Jerry's stock price up nearly 7
percent, or $1.50, to $24 at 4 p.m. on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides confirming that they're working on a deal, though, the group of
investors is keeping quiet.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're in the middle of forming an offer and we're all sworn to hold this in
confidence," said Judith Wicks, owner of the White Dog Cafe in Philadelphia and
a prominent member of the Social Venture Network, a San Francisco "socially
responsible" investment group.
</P>
<P>
	   Ben &AMP; Jerry's, too, has been pretty quiet since it first announced in
December that companies it did not identify were interested in taking it over.
On Friday, it merely confirmed that there had been interest by the socially
responsible group, but said it had not yet received an offer and would not
comment further.
</P>
<P>
	   Ben Cohen, the ex-hippie who co-founded the company with boyhood friend
Jerry Greenfield, told The Wall Street Journal in Friday's editions there was
logic behind a socially responsible group trying to keep his company
independent.
</P>
<P>
	   "Quirky brands don't usually do well as part of large conglomerates," Cohen
said. "I'm delighted there's an investor group trying to find a way to keep the
company independent." He stressed, however, that he isn't part of the investor
group.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the group pursuing Ben &AMP; Jerry's, many of whom are members of the
Social Venture Network, said it was uncharacteristic for them to refuse comment.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're hoping in the near future to make specific statements to the press,
in part in keeping with Ben &AMP; Jerry's philosophy of keeping all stakeholders
informed," said Robert E. Barton, chief executive of Catalyst Financial Group
Inc., a Brookfield, Vt., investment banker that focuses on environmental
companies. "I think it's frustrating."
</P>
<P>
	   But, he added, they're willing to play by the rules of publicly traded
companies because they're committed to ensuring the independence of the
freewheeling ice cream maker known as much for its devotion to social causes as
it is for its funky flavors and its bottom line.
</P>
<P>
	   Companies describing themselves as socially responsible are more interested
in their stakeholders than their stockholders. To their way of thinking,
stakeholders include not only those who hold stock, but also the employees,
suppliers, residents of the communities in which a company does business,
customers and even lenders.
</P>
<P>
	   Ben &AMP; Jerry's has been a pioneer in making sure that it treats those kind of
stakeholders as fairly as it does its stockholders. For example, it pays dairy
farmers a premium for milk to guarantee it comes from small family farms.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of people see Ben &AMP; Jerry's as one of the models for addressing
really tough issues," Barton said.
</P>
<P>
	   That philosophy might be threatened, though, if it were taken over by a more
traditional company that is focused on its quarterly profit-and-loss statements,
he added.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you and I think Ben &AMP; Jerry's has sold out and we're disillusioned, then
are we going to continue to be loyal to them or are we going to buy from the
next little micro ice cream company?" Barton said. "I would probably go to the
next micro ice cream company."

<HEADLINE> Israeli Rockets Wound 8 in Lebanon  </HEADLINE>
   By BUTROS WANNA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) -- Israeli helicopter gunships blasted a village in
southern Lebanon on Friday, wounding a guerrilla commander and seven civilians,
Lebanese security officials and witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
	   The attack came as Israeli aircraft struck suspected guerrilla targets for
the seventh straight day and just hours after an Israeli-backed militia
abandoned a front-line position, redrawing the boundary of the Israeli-occupied
zone in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   Four gunships fired three missiles at the village of Barish, 10 miles east
of the southern port city of Tyre, witnesses reported. One rocket struck the car
of a Hezbollah guerrilla commander, said Lebanese officials who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   The Iranian-backed Hezbollah said Israel had failed in an attempt to
assassinate the commander, but did not name him or say if he was hurt. The group
promised retaliation, saying in a statement it would ``choose the appropriate
time and place.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the past, Hezbollah has responded to civilian casualties by firing
rockets on northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   A second missile hit a house and a third failed to detonate.
</P>
<P>
	   A mother and her 2-year-old daughter were among seven civilians wounded in
the attack and taken to a hospital for treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   There also were airstrikes on suspected guerrilla targets. Tensions have
escalated into the worst fighting in six months following the recent killings of
three Israeli soldiers and a militia commander. Hezbollah has claimed
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
	   An Israeli army statement issued in Jerusalem confirmed the jet strikes but
made no mention of the helicopter attack.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon, which is often caught in
the cross fire, warned that the intensified conflict may force it to relocate
some of its positions.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Friday, militiamen of the Israel-allied South Lebanon Army abandoned
and destroyed their Sojod hilltop outpost, which had a commanding view of the
Hezbollah stronghold of Iqlim al-Tuffah. Hezbollah hailed the withdrawal as a
``new victory.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli army said the SLA moved to two new positions that ``afford
better protection and improve the operational ability of the SLA.''
</P>
<P>
	   Israel and the SLA patrol a strip inside southern Lebanon established in
1985 to prevent cross-border attacks by guerrillas. Hezbollah has been waging a
war to oust troops from Lebanese soil.

<HEADLINE> FDIC Looks for Bank Fraud Red Flags  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., hit by its biggest
losses from bank failures since the early 1990s, is telling its examiners to
keep alert for warning signs of possible fraud at the banks they inspect.
</P>
<P>
	   Fraud is said to have been a major factor in three recent bank failures, two
of which cost the FDIC's insurance fund an estimated $982 million.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've learned some things from these cases," FDIC chairwoman Donna Tanoue
said in an interview Friday. "We want to improve our performance."
</P>
<P>
	   Tanoue said the agency will commit "whatever resources are necessary" to
investigate suspected bank fraud.
</P>
<P>
	   In a memo Thursday, James L. Sexton, director of the FDIC's Division of
Supervision, reminded examiners of the importance of quickly beginning a
thorough investigation when suspicious signs appear.
</P>
<P>
	   "When 'red flags' or other information lead to suspicions that fraudulent
activity may be present, investigation should be accorded the highest priority,
and resources should be allocated accordingly," Sexton said in the memo to
regional supervision directors, for distribution to the agency's 1,800
examiners.
</P>
<P>
	   Among warning signs at banks that failed recently, the memo said, were bank
managers and officials' refusal to cooperate with or hostility toward examiners;
large proportions of risky loans; suspicious transactions by bank insiders; lack
of internal controls; and inadequate record keeping.
</P>
<P>
	   In a related move last week, the FDIC proposed that capital requirements be
doubled for banks that specialize in risky loans to people with inferior credit
histories.
</P>
<P>
	   Regulators and lawmakers are concerned about the eight U.S. bank failures
last year, which occurred within a booming economy. The eight collapses, and
another one in July 1998, cost the FDIC about $1 billion last year, the most in
a single year since the regional banking crises of the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   Compounding the worry, the FDIC is predicting that as many as 20 banks could
go under this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Already, on Jan. 14, Iowa's banking superintendent closed the
Hartford-Carlisle Savings Bank of Carlisle, Iowa, and the FDIC was named
receiver.
</P>
<P>
	   Hartford-Carlisle, with $113.8 million in assets, is among the three
recently failed banks in which fraud played a role, according to regulators.
</P>
<P>
	   The others are First National Bank of Keystone, a large bank based in
Keystone, W.Va., which grew by paying high interest rates to attract capital
from across the country; and BestBank of Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDIC's estimated $750 million loss caused by Keystone's collapse could
put it among the 10 most expensive ever in this country. Federal regulators, who
closed the bank in September, said they found evidence of apparent fraud that
resulted in the depletion of the bank's capital.
</P>
<P>
	   BestBank sold high-interest credit cards as part of a travel-club membership
to consumers with damaged credit records. Its failure in July 1998 drained some
$232 million from the insurance fund.
</P>
<P>
	   House Banking Committee Chairman Jim Leach, R-Iowa, prompted by the Keystone
and BestBank failures, recently proposed legislation that would give the head of
the FDIC more authority over troubled banks.
</P>
<P>
	   The bank insurance fund, which backs each account up to $100,000, has an
adequate cushion -- now some $29 billion -- to cover depositors' losses.

<HEADLINE> Russia OKs Draft Military Doctrine  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNA DOLGOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- The presidential Security Council on Friday approved a new
national military doctrine, which Moscow says is its response to a perceived
growing threat from NATO in the West and from Islamic militants in the east.
</P>
<P>
	   The adoption of the military doctrine follows the approval last month of a
new national security doctrine that broadened the Kremlin's authority to use
nuclear weapons and accused the United States of trying to weaken Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia ``cannot help noticing changes in the strategy of NATO,'' acting
President Vladimir Putin was quoted as saying by the Interfax news agency. ``We
must react appropriately (to avoid) running into surprises.''
</P>
<P>
	   Many Russian officials see the Western military alliance as a growing
threat, particularly because of NATO's eastward expansion and the airstrikes
against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
	   The new Russian military doctrine, which would replace one adopted in 1993,
must be signed by Russia's president to become law. The government intends to
put finishing touches on the draft before it is sent to the president.
</P>
<P>
	   Putin said the process could take about two months. But deputy chief of
Russia's General Staff, Col. Gen. Valery Manilov, told reporters the document
should be ready in a month.
</P>
<P>
	   The heightened emphasis on nuclear weapons in Russia's security policy
reflects the weakness of Russia's conventional forces, which might not be able
to defend the country against attack, military experts say.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia's new security doctrine allows the country's leaders to use all
existing forces ``including nuclear weapons'' to oppose any attack -- nuclear or
conventional -- if other efforts fail to repel the aggressor.
</P>
<P>
	   The previous doctrine stated that Russia would use nuclear weapons only in
cases when its national sovereignty was threatened.
</P>
<P>
	   NATO officials who have seen the document described it as having a much more
aggressive and confrontational tone than its predecessor. However, security
experts have pointed out that the new stress on nuclear weapons sounds like
NATO's own doctrine.

<P>
	   Few details were released about the new military doctrine, but it is
expected to follow similar lines.
</P>
<P>
	   Manilov said the doctrine is aimed at preventing armed conflicts and
stresses Russia's wish for ``partnership'' with other nations.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, ``the doctrine spells out very firmly what Russia must have, and what
it is allowed to do,'' he said. Russia ``must have a determent potential -- both
nuclear and conventional -- adequate to a real military threat.''
</P>
<P>
	   Approval of the new security and military doctrines comes at a time when
relations between the United States and Russia have soured, with sharp
differences over Washington's desire to amend the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty to protect itself from rogue states like North Korea.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia claims that pulling back from the treaty risks upsetting the
strategic nuclear balance and could unleash a new arms race.
</P>
<P>
	   Beside NATO and the United States, Russia is also worried about the threat
of Islamic militants, who are battling Russian troops in Chechnya and are
feuding with the governments of several former Soviet republics in Central Asia,
Putin said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We know what problems Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are facing
these days,'' he said, referring to the ex-Soviet states that have been plagued
by conflicts.

    NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index rounded out its best week in
history with a new record today as investors moved money from industrial
companies that may be hurt by rising interest rates to technology companies.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq rose 33.02 to 4,244.00, above its previous record of 4,235.40,
set Jan. 21. In percentage terms, the technology-dominated index rose 9.1
percent, its best weekly performance in history.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 49.64 to 10,963.80. Broader indicators
were mixed.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 0.60 to 1,424.37.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 1,564 down, 1,418 up and 543 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 1.03 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.11 billion in
the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.89 to 525.52.
</P>
<P>
	   "Money continues to shift from the real world to the virtual world," said
Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd. in New York.
"Money managers are going to the stocks that they know will perform."
</P>
<P>
	   Investors poured money into shares of Nasdaq's largest stocks, including
Apple Computer, Intel and Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
	   But smaller, younger companies that are just beginning to capitalize on the
technology craze drew attention as well. Firepond, a maker of software that
helps companies manage their electronic-commerce businesses, soared in its
initial public offering of stock.
</P>
<P>
	   "It takes a lot of equipment and labor to build the Internet, not just
ideas," Bleier said. "The companies that are figuring out how to improve the
Internet are going to do very well."
</P>
<P>
	   The broader market proved more vulnerable after the government delivered the
latest indication that the economy is growing quickly enough to convince the
Federal Reserve to continue raising interest rates in its effort to keep
inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
	   The Labor Department said today that employers added 387,000 jobs in
January, pushing the unemployment rate down to 4 percent, its lowest level since
1970. Still, some economists had expected the jobless rate to tumble below 4
percent, and investors drew some confidence when it did not, traders said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures, rose
a slightly higher-than-expected 0.4 percent to $13.50 in January, the fastest
pace since September.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the rise in wages, analysts said investors apparently have faith
that the Federal Reserve is in control of inflation. The central bank on
Wednesday increased rates for the fourth time since June, and indicated more
increases may be on the way.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the steady hand by the Fed is helping fuel the rally," said Barry
Berman, head trader for Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
	   Vodafone Airtouch AG was an exception to the strength in technology shares,
falling after the company sweetened its bid for German wireless company
Mannesmann AG. Mannesmann shareholders will vote by Feb. 17 on whether to accept
Vodafone's offer, now valued at $180 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Mattel shares fell on the New York Stock Exchange a day after Chief
Executive Officer Jill Barad resigned. The toymaker reported a steep loss for
the fourth quarter, disappointing Wall Street analysts for the third time in the
past four quarters.

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The Public Broadcasting Service is expected to name veteran
CNN executive Pat Mitchell as its new president, according to several published
reports.
</P>
<P>
	   PBS spokesman Thomas Epstein would not comment on the reports Friday. He
said PBS's board is meeting in Key West this weekend and will hear a
recommendation on a new leader from its search committee.
</P>
<P>
	   PBS has tentatively scheduled a news conference Monday to talk about its
leadership. The system has been without a leader since Ervin Duggan left after
five years on Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitchell has an extensive television background in front of the camera, as a
former "Today" show correspondent, and behind the scenes. She was instrumental
in guiding the production of CNN's 24-hour series on the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
	   PBS's new president will have to walk a tightrope between the need for a
system-wide identity and the desire for independence among individual station
managers. PBS is also without a chief programming executive.

<HEADLINE> French Troops, Albanians Clash  </HEADLINE>
   By ELENA BECATOROS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Hundreds of ethnic Albanians pelted
French soldiers with stones and bottles Friday to protest the NATO-led
peacekeepers' failure to prevent the deaths of at least six Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
	   The clashes in this volatile city came after a night of violence that also
left about two dozen Serbs injured and 10 U.N. vehicles burned.
</P>
<P>
	   The French troops fired tear gas to disperse about 500 rioters at a main
bridge. Armed members of the Kosovo Protection Corps, made up of former ethnic
Albanian rebels, later appeared and calmed the crowd. Four or five French
soldiers were injured, including one with a broken arm.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ibar River runs through the heart of this industrial city 30 miles
northwest of Kosovo's provincial capital, Pristina. About 9,000 Serbs control
the north bank, and 90,000 ethnic Albanians live on the south side.
</P>
<P>
	   French peacekeepers guard the two bridges, keeping the groups apart to avoid
violence. However, thousands of ethnic Albanians live north of the river -- the
Serb side.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest round of violence started after a rocket attack Wednesday killed
two Serbs on a bus run by the U.N. refugee agency that was carrying them through
predominantly Albanian areas near Kosovska Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
	   The next night, violence broke out in the Serb-controlled northern side of
the city.
</P>
<P>
	   Two ethnic Albanian men were shot to death. Half an hour later, a grenade
was thrown into a Serb cafe, wounding up to 15 people. An ethnic Albanian woman
was then shot and killed, and another grenade was tossed into another Serb cafe,
wounding 10.
</P>
<P>
	   At least three other ethnic Albanians who were injured in the shootings died
Friday, NATO said.
</P>
<P>
	   Crowds of angry Serbs and ethnic Albanians gathered on opposite sides of the
bridges. Scuffles and rock-throwing persisted into Friday, French military
spokesman Fabrice Turco said.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations said 10 of its vehicles were burned, including seven
police cars and three from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the estimated 4,000 ethnic Albanians living on the Serb side fled to
the Albanian district Thursday night and early Friday, said Paula Ghedini,
spokeswoman for the refugee agency. The agency suspended operations in the Serb
area and sent its three foreign staffers to the Albanian side.
</P>
<P>
	   An overnight curfew also was imposed. Scattered gunshots and one small
explosion could be heard coming from the northern, Serb-run district.
</P>
<P>
	   In Belgrade, Serbia's state-run Tanjug news agency said the attacks on Serb
cafes ``revolted'' the Serbs in Kosovska Mitrovica. Serbs and Albanians were
shooting at each other, Tanjug said, citing local sources.
</P>
<P>
	   A Kosovo Serb representative, Jovica Jovanovic, said the attacks were part
of ``continued attempts by ethnic Albanian terrorists to cleanse Kosovo of
Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The attitude by the United Nations mission here only encourages more
crime,'' Jovanovic said.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the presence of NATO peacekeepers in Kosovo, violence is still
common. Ethnic Albanians often stage revenge attacks against Serbs for the
18-month crackdown by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
	   On Oct. 15, more than 100 people were injured in a two-hour melee in
Kosovska Mitrovica, which includes the largest enclave of Serbs remaining in
Kosovo. Ten days before, one Serb was killed and 26 other people, mostly French
and U.N. police, were injured in an ethnic riot on the outskirts of town.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Grandma's Account Stuns Family  </HEADLINE>
   By MEG RICHARDS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives are outraged over his Cuban
grandmother's account of how she playfully bit the 6-year-old boy's tongue and
unzipped his pants during their long-awaited reunion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The family is shocked and disturbed,'' Armando Gutierrez, spokesman for
the Miami relatives, said Friday. ``That is not a Cuban custom.''
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview on Cuban television Tuesday, Elian's paternal grandmother,
Mariela Quintana, said she had ``played jokes'' with the boy during a U.S.
government-ordered meeting Jan. 26 at the home of a Roman Catholic nun in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   Quintana said the boy was ``reserved'' at the start of the meeting, so she
joked that he might have lost his tongue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I took his tongue out of his mouth,'' she said, gesturing with her hand as
if she was pulling her own tongue from her mouth. ``I bit it.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I even opened up his zipper,'' she said, making an unzipping gesture. ``I
told him, `Let me see, let me see ... if it has grown.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Meeting host Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin and Sister Lenore Esnard, who also was
in the house during the meeting, were unaware of the exchange until Quintana's
remarks were broadcast on Miami television, said Barry University spokeswoman
Michele Morris. O'Laughlin is president of the school.
</P>
<P>
	   In Cuba, few people found anything strange about Quintana's behavior, but
the spokeswoman for the Spanish-language Telemundo affiliate in Miami said the
station was flooded with calls from outraged viewers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everyone we have talked to, everyone who saw the tape, thought this was
inappropriate behavior for grandmothers,'' said Maria Lewis, managing editor at
Telemundo's WSCV-TV.
</P>
<P>
	   Uva de Aragon, assistant director of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida
International University, said Quintana's behavior might seem odd to people in
the United States, but it was probably innocent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The way the woman said it on national television shows it wasn't something
perverted,'' de Aragon said. ``She was joking with a little kid, trying to get
him to respond, the same as if she were tickling him or trying to see his
muscles.''
</P>
<P>
	   She said that most Hispanic cultures have a different concept of personal
space and that the Cuban culture traditionally has been very male-oriented.
Fathers, particularly in lower classes, often boast about the size of their
sons' genitals, associating that with bravery and virility.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was rescued on Thanksgiving after clinging to an inner tube for two
days following a shipwreck that killed his mother. The first-grader has been
living in Miami with his great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez, and his U.S. relatives
hope to keep him despite an immigration order to send him back.
</P>
<P>
	   His father back in Cuba, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, is pressing for his return.
He wrote Attorney General Janet Reno on Thursday asking her to move the boy to
the home of another Miami relative who is more sympathetic to his wishes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am deeply concerned and anguished over the present condition of my
6-year-old son, Elian Gonzalez, unfairly and cruelly separated from our family
for over two months,'' he said in a letter released to foreign news agencies by
the Cuban government.

<HEADLINE> Judge refuses to dismiss charges against rabbi in wife's killing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - A judge on Friday refused to dismiss charges against
a rabbi accused of arranging to have a hitman kill his wife so he could continue
an extramarital affair.
<P>
	   Superior Court Judge Linda G. Rosenzweig said the case against Rabbi Fred J.
Neulander in the November 1994 bludgeoning death of his wife, Carol, will
proceed to trial in September or October.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge rejected defense arguments that there was insufficient evidence to
support a two-count indictment against Neulander, and that grand jurors heard
misleading information.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no direct evidence in this case linking our client to this
matter," contended defense lawyer Dennis G. Wixted. "There's got to be some
evidence there."
</P>
<P>
	   The judge, however, ruled that the grand jury was presented with sufficient
evidence to find that the rabbi had motive - his longterm affair - and had
uttered incriminating words before and after his wife's death. She also found
that the case was not misrepresented to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
	   A witness told the grand jury that Neulander "told him that he wanted to
come home one day and find his wife lying dead on the floor." Neulander's
then-mistress told authorities that he told her after the killing, "I told you
to trust me."
</P>
<P>
	   The rabbi was considered the lone suspect in the slaying from the outset,
but it took nearly four years before charges were filed in 1998 in a largely
circumstantial case against him.
</P>
<P>
	   First Assistant Camden County Prosecutor James P. Lynch said the evidence
presented to the grand jury was "substantial in volume" and "powerful in its
impact."
</P>
<P>
	   Neulander, 58, the former leader of Congregation M'Kor Shalom in Cherry
Hill, is charged with accomplice murder and conspiracy to commit murder. He
faces life in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors allege that Carol Neulander, 52, was bludgeoned to death inside
her Cherry Hill home by a hitman posing as a deliveryman. Her husband discovered
her badly beaten body. Her purse was missing, but no other valuables were taken,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense has suggested that Mrs. Neulander, manager of a chain of
bakeries, may have been killed during a botched robbery. Lynch, however,
rejected those claims saying "this was a murder that was designed to be a
murder."
</P>
<P>
	   Neulander, maintains his innocence, and told reporters Friday that he is
looking forward to proving it. He told the judge that he would not consider a
plea agreement. The judge is expected to set a trial date on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know the truth," Neulander said outside the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors allege Neulander was desperate to end his 29-year marriage, but
thought divorce would jeopardize his position as senior rabbi at M'Kor Shalom, a
large Reform synagogue in Cherry Hill he founded with his wife in 1974.
</P>
<P>
	   Philadelphia radio personality Elaine Soncini admitted have a two-year
affair with Neulander that ended shortly after his wife's killing. She has not
been charged with any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   Soncini attended the hearing Friday with her lawyer. She left the
courthouse, commenting only to reporters that she was there "to support the
family."
</P>
<P>
	   Neulander, who is free on $400,000 bail, stepped down from his synagogue
post in February 1995 after reports of his affairs with two congregants. He said
he now writes and edits educational and religious materials and develops school
instructional programs.

<HEADLINE> German man's widow wants his body returned, but it's already  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - The widow of a German gambler who committed
suicide by jumping off a casino parking garage last summer now wants his body
returned to Europe.
<P>
	   But it has already been buried in a potter's field.
</P>
<P>
	   Frank R. Spelling, 54, plunged nine stories from the roof of the garage at
Resorts Atlantic City on Aug. 25. He was the third such suicide in eight days.
</P>
<P>
	   Police and diplomatic officials were unable to locate any family members to
tell them of his death, however. Two months later, he was laid to rest in an
unmarked grave at Seaside Cemetery in Upper Township. No relatives or mourners
attended.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, a travel agent who read about the suicide on the Internet came
forward to tell police Spelling and his wife, Hildegard Spelling, had worked
with her in Malaga, Spain, according to police Detective Joseph Hanlin.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Spelling has told German officials she wants her husband's body
returned to Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   "She wants him brought back," said Hanlin. "But it's between the Germans and
the county now."
</P>
<P>
	   Atlantic County Counsel Paul Gallagher says no formal request has been
received to exhume the body. The county, which spent about $600 on Spelling's
burial in the first place, won't pay for the procedure if it is requested, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've completed our statutory responsibility. We don't have the body," he
said. If Mrs. Spelling wants it, she must contact the cemetery, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   She has not done so, according to Seaside Cemetery owner Jay Newman.
</P>
<P>
	   The wife is living in Austria, according to Wolfgang Lauke of the German
consulate office in New York, which received a death certificate for Spelling
and forwarded it to the Austrian consulate.
</P>
<P>
	   Katrina Park, vice-consul at the Austrian consulate in New York, would not
say where Mrs. Spelling lives or give any information about the consulate's
involvement in the case. "We would have to be contacted by the wife if we were
to hand out any information," she said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans Change in Forest Funds  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN HUGHES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton on Monday will propose eliminating four
national forest trust funds and instead earmark the funds' $300 million to a
single, new program aimed at restoring national forests and hiring rural
workers, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmentalists welcomed the plan, saying the trust funds have been an
incentive for forest managers to log so that they could get money for pet
projects. Critics also complained that trust fund spending is not approved by
Congress and therefore, open to abuse.
</P>
<P>
	   More than half of the timber sale revenues in national forests are currently
deposited in trust funds that local forest managers can tap for projects, such
as removing dead and dying trees and protecting stream beds. The amount spent
increased from 16 percent in 1993 to 27 percent in 1997, the General Accounting
Office, Congress' investigative arm, found in a study.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, in his fiscal year 2001 budget, will seek to cancel the Salvage
Sale, Knutson-Vandenberg, Reforestation, and Timber Sale Pipeline Restoration
trust funds and instead send the timber receipts to the U.S. Treasury.
</P>
<P>
	   The president wants Congress to use the money to set up a single, permanent
fund that would allow Forest Service officials to target the spending for the
highest-priority projects nationwide, and where rural jobs are needed.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmentalists praised Clinton's proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a long overdue effort to address the perverse incentives within the
Forest Service,'' said Mike Anderson of The Wilderness Society in Seattle. ``It
will solve some of the Forest Service financial difficulties as well.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the plan must gain congressional approval and faces a tough fight in the
GOP-controlled House and Senate. Sending trust fund dollars to the Treasury
increases the temptation of Congress to use the money for other priorities, said
Mark Rey, a GOP staffer with the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal also will not be welcomed by many local forest managers, who
have viewed the trust funds as a source of stable revenue.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Rain Forest Protection  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is taking his environmentalist positions
beyond U.S. borders by asking Congress to provide money for rain forest
conservation to help keep thousands of tropical life forms from vanishing.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's budget plan for fiscal 2001 sets aside $150 million for a
``greening the globe'' initiative to help more than 60 countries in Africa, Asia
and Latin America save forests that are home to a diverse range of life forms
now threatened by logging or other activities. That figure represents an 88
percent increase over the budget for this fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
	   Under Clinton's plan, $100 million would go to the U.S. Agency for
International Development's forest conservation programs and $37 million to
reduce debts of poor countries that commit to financing forest conservation with
local currency.
</P>
<P>
	   Another $10 million would go into Forest Service research into forest fire
prevention and $3 million to the Fish and Wildlife Service for protecting
endangered elephants, tigers and rhinoceroses in Asia and Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also is proposing a new venture by USAID and the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration to compile satellite maps of tropical
forests and monitor changes in them from outer space.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal could help such countries as Indonesia, the leading exporter of
tropical timber and home to about 10 percent of the world's primate species; or
Bolivia, where deforestation is a threat to the biological diversity of the
Amazon.
</P>
<P>
	   Tropical forests support more than half the planet's life forms. But they
are disappearing at a rate of more than 50 acres a minute due to activity such
as illegal logging or deliberate land clearing for agriculture.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Gun, Tobacco Laws  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton opened an election-year fight Friday
over guns and cigarettes, proposing to fine the tobacco industry $3,000 for each
teen smoker and crack down on firearm dealers whose weapons wind up in
criminals' hands.
</P>
<P>
	   The double-barreled approach isn't likely to go far in Congress, which
shelved administration measures last year for a 55-cent-a-pack tax on cigarettes
and restrictions on gun show sales. But at a minimum, it will give Democrats
campaign issues for their drive to win control of Congress and keep the White
House.
</P>
<P>
	   Two days before his wife, Hillary, formally announces her Senate candidacy,
the president went to Capitol Hill to give Democrats a pep talk.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was making it clear there's not a single bone in his body that's got
lame duck written on it,'' said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. Clinton said the booming
economy presents a rare opportunity to help people who have been left behind.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's tobacco initiative was billed as an effort to cut teen smoking in
half by making cigarettes more expensive and penalizing the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is certainly our belief that the tobacco industry, through their
marketing practices, could cut teen smoking,'' White House press secretary Joe
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's budget, to be released Monday, urges a 25-cent-a-pack tax
increase. He also proposed accelerating an already approved 5 cent per pack tax
increase to take effect on Oct. 1 instead of on Jan. 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   Further, Clinton would penalize cigarette-makers $3,000 each year for every
underage smoker if teen smoking is not cut in half by 2004. Senate Republicans
rejected a similar plan in 1998 when Congress killed a sweeping anti-smoking
measure.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockhart indicated that Clinton's latest proposal was still a work in
progress, fuzzy on issues such as how to deal with a cigarette maker making a
sincere effort to reduce teen smoking. ``Obviously there are some issues we will
have to work out ...,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans denounced Clinton's plan as simply another tax increase. A
Democratic lawmaker from North Carolina, Sen. John Edwards, agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Piling additional taxes on the backs of North Caroline farmers and workers
is not the right way to help our young people,'' Edwards told leaf growers in
Raleigh, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   However, American Cancer Society chief John R. Seffrin said, ``Big Tobacco
must take responsibility for the damage it has inflicted upon the health of our
children. The tobacco industry claims to want to reduce teen tobacco use. This
plan would light a fire under Big Tobacco and force them to back up their words
with action.''
</P>
<P>
	   Renewing his gun-control push, Clinton released a federal firearms study
which found that about one percent of the gun dealers and pawnbrokers in America
sell over 57 percent of the guns used in crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're beginning the most aggressive effort ever undertaken to insure
responsible behavior by gun dealers,'' the president said. ``Dealers whose guns
most frequently wind up in criminals' hand will now be subject to intense
scrutiny'' by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF).
</P>
<P>
	   Guided by the study, the ATF will conduct ``focused inspections'' on about
1,000 of the 80,570 licensed dealers and pawnbrokers. The targeted dealers are
those that have had 10 or more crime guns traced to them in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal law allows ATF to inspect dealers only once a year. Clinton asked
Congress to remove those restriction and allow up to three visits per year. He
also renewed his call to require photo IDs for gun purchases, safety locks for
all new handguns and a ban on imports of large-capacity ammo clips.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not a nefarious, illegal trade,'' said National Rifle Association
spokesman Bill Powers. ``It's perfectly legal and lawful, and most of it is done
by mom and pop family businesses.'' He said Clinton simply was trying to help
Vice President Al Gore's campaign. ``By gosh, Al's running for president, so we
gotta give him some cover -- that's what this is about,'' Powers said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., one of the leading voices in Congress for
more gun control applauded Clinton's initiative. ``This is the best thing that
can be done, short of new laws ... given the deadlock in Congress,'' Schumer
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Limits Austria Govt. Contacts  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States distanced itself from Austria on Friday
to protest the inclusion of far-right Freedom Party members in a new government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is clearly no place inside the governments who make up the
Euro-Atlantic community, in a healthy democracy, for a party that does not
distance itself from the atrocities of the Nazi era and the politics of hate,''
said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright said Ambassador Kathryn Hall would register the United States' deep
concern to Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel, return to Washington to report on her
consultations and then go back to Vienna ``to convey our concerns about what
their policies might be.''
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. defense attache in Vienna was ordered not to participate in
ceremonies for Austria's new defense minister, Albright said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have decided to limit our contact with the new government and will
review whether further actions are necessary to advance our support for
democratic values,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Freedom Party is headed by Joerg Haider, who has praised Adolf Hitler's
``orderly employment'' policies and lauded veterans of the murderous Waffen SS
as ``decent people of good character.''
</P>
<P>
	   He also referred to concentration camps -- where millions of Jews and other
victims of Nazi Germany and its sympathizers perished in World War II -- as
``punishment camps''
</P>
<P>
	   This week, in the midst of controversy over a government role for the
Freedom Party and in line with a trend of repentance in Europe, Haider and
Schuessel, a member of the centrist Austrian People's Party, signed a statement
that ``Austria accepts its responsibility arising out of the tragic history of
the 20th century and the horrendous crimes of the Nationalist Socialist
regime.''
</P>
<P>
	   Austria was annexed by Germany as it began its moves to conquer Europe.
There was considerable support for the Nazis in Austria and the takeover was
relatively easy.
</P>
<P>
	   The other 14 nations of the European Union have threatened to isolate
Austria. Finland suspended relations with Austria on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright rejected the idea that Haider had backtracked.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I find what he has said repugnant,'' she said, accusing the 50-year-old
far-right politician of unacceptably tapping into ``xenophobic, anti-immigration
and anti-human rights policies.''
</P>
<P>
	   The United States has had a generally good relationship with post-World War
II Austria. However, from 1986 to 1992 the link was shadowed by allegations that
Kurt Waldheim, the Austrian president and former U.N. secretary-general, had
played a leading role in transporting Jews in the Balkans to their deaths during
the war.
</P>
<P>
	   Waldheim insisted he had an innocuous assignment in the German army, but the
United States revoked his entry visa.
</P>
<P>
	   Joining and supporting Albright at a news conference, Spanish Foreign
Minister Abel Juan Matutes said his government had gone beyond the European
Union and ``pressed its own initiatives, making clear its very clear position''
on the Freedom Party's inclusion in a new Austrian government. Matutes said
Spain had told Schuessel at the outset that it opposed the government being
formed.
</P>
<P>
	   In Vienna, Austria's new foreign minister, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, said
outside pressure had only offended the public.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Because of the ostracism, the Freedom Party is growing ever stronger,''
the People's Party member told Germany's Deutsche Welle radio Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   But the American Jewish Congress, condemning Austria for including Haider in
its government, said the country had ``a dismal history of selecting leaders who
reject universally affirmed beliefs about human dignity and equality.''
</P>
<P>
	   Jack Rosen, congress president, and Phil Baum, executive director, dismissed
Haider's renunciation of Nazism and xenophobia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The repudiation means little because it repudiates everything the Freedom
Party stood for during the election campaign,'' they said in a statement. ``This
particular political leopard cannot reliably or opportunistically change its
spots, and certainly not overnight.''

<HEADLINE> Students sue ex-sub teacher for assault  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   KEANSBURG, N.J. (AP) - A former high school substitute teacher wrapped
one of his students in paper and masking tape, and urged other students to tape
another boy, two lawsuits claim.
<P>
	   Steven M. Catena was fired last May from Keansburg High School and indicted
last fall on charges of endangering the welfare of a child and criminal
restraint for alleged assaults of the 14-year-old and 15-year-old boys.
</P>
<P>
	   But the lawsuits filed in Superior Court by the boys name both the teacher
and the school district, accusing the district of negligence for failing to
protect the students.
</P>
<P>
	   The school board promised ... that students would be reasonably safe and
free from harm from its employees," one lawsuit says.
</P>
<P>
	   Catena, 25, of Keansburg, allegedly wrapped the 15-year-old boy with masking
tape and white butcher paper from his chest to his knees in his classroom, and
urged other students to tape the 14-year-old to a chair. The incidents occurred
on three days in April and May, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said Catena, a member of the borough fire department and first
aid squad, also asked students to give the younger boy a "swirly," dunking him
in a flushing toilet. The other boys faked the dunking, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   The 14-year-old's suit also names the borough for permitting "dangerous,
reckless, hazardous and unsafe" conditions at school.
</P>
<P>
	   "The family is angry, and understandably so," said Richard D. Meadow, the
attorney for the 14-year-old. "You send your children to school and expect it to
be a safe environment. You can expect certain behavior from kids, but not from
teachers."
</P>
<P>
	   Meadow said the 15-year-old has enrolled at another school because of the
incident.
</P>
<P>
	   John O. Bennett III, the attorney for the borough and the Board of
Education, did not immediately return telephone messages Friday. Catena attorney
Norman M. Hobbie had no comment.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Co. Aiding With 'Smart' Gun  </HEADLINE>
    By TOM COHEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- A Canadian company has developed the technology for a
handgun that requires fingerprint identification before it can be fired.
</P>
<P>
	   Mytec Technologies of Toronto is working with U.S. gun maker Smith &AMP; Wesson
on the so-called "smart gun" intended to prevent anyone other than authorized
users from shooting the weapon, officials of both companies said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The idea of a handgun that can be programmed to prevent accidental shootings
is part of the weapons' industry response to gun control efforts in the United
States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, President Clinton proposed $10 million in grants for gun makers
to work on "smart gun" technology. Smith &AMP; Wesson has applied for such a grant,
said Frank Chen, executive vice president of business development at Mytec.
</P>
<P>
	   Chen said the technology involves a scanner on the gun handle that reads the
fingerprint, converting it into a digital representation.
</P>
<P>
	   Within milliseconds, the scanner checks the fingerprint against an
authorized one stored inside. If it matches, the gun unlocks and can be fired.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have to miniaturize the scanning device and make it more user-friendly,"
Chen said, adding that further development depends on Smith &AMP; Wesson getting the
U.S. grant.
</P>
<P>
	   Ken Jorgensen, director of public and media relations at Smith &AMP; Wesson,
said the company was seeking about $3 million in grant money.
</P>
<P>
	   Jorgensen said a "smart" gun could reach the market by 2002. He declined to
speculate how much it would sell for, but said it would cost more than
conventional guns.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics question whether the fingerprint technology can effectively prevent
unauthorized people, such as children who find their parents' gun or a robber
who grabs a homeowner's weapon, from firing off shots.

<HEADLINE> President Eulogizes Advisor Squier  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton remembered his friend and political
adviser Bob Squier on Friday as a master storyteller and predicted that students
of politics and literature will one day study the work of the Democratic
consultant who died last week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He knew how to tell a story,'' Clinton said at a memorial service for
Squier in the grand National Cathedral in Washington, ``and he knew how to see
the story that was being told right before our eyes.''
</P>
<P>
	   Squier, who died Jan. 24 at age 65, created campaign advertisements for
dozens of campaigns for the Senate, the House and governorships. He worked for
the Clinton-Gore ticket in 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Squier was a close friend of Vice President Al Gore, who attended Friday's
memorial service with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton credited Squier with bolstering Democratic spirits after Republicans
took control of Congress in 1994 and sustaining hope through the Clinton-Gore
re-election effort in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was there for us, and but for him, we might not be here today,''
Clinton said. ``There is something to be said for boundless optimism.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He saw people in politics as basically good people who struggled to
reconcile personal conviction and popular opinion into a combined force that
would lift our nation to higher grounds,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   An award-winning documentary filmmaker, Squier's first presidential campaign
work was for Hubert Humphrey in 1968. He made advertising spots for Ed Muskie in
1972 and Jimmy Carter in 1976.
</P>
<P>
	   Squier had a hand in transforming the role of television advertising in
political campaigns, and acquired a reputation for testing the bounds of ethics
or truth in some spots.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1990, a Squier ad charged a gubernatorial candidate in Massachusetts was
``plagued by questions about his corruption record.'' The questions were about
the candidate's record in prosecuting official wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   Another Squier spot accused a Michigan candidate of voting ``to let
dangerous criminals out of state prisons early'' when Squier's client had put
the same early release program into effect.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet Squier was an advocate of greater media scrutiny of the claims made by
political advertisers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You've just got to be much tougher with people like us as we make our
spots and advance our claims,'' he told reporters at a 1988 forum.

<HEADLINE> New Austria Coalition Takes Power  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE JAHN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Austria's new governing coalition, tainted by a
party identified with racial bias and Nazi sympathies, took power Friday,
triggering diplomatic sanctions and egg-throwing protests that forced the new
ministers to leave the swearing-in ceremony through an underground tunnel.
</P>
<P>
	   President Thomas Klestil, who swore in the new center-right coalition,
appealed to the world to give the new government a chance to fulfill its
promises to govern under European standards of democracy and human rights.
</P>
<P>
	   As the ministers were taking their oaths, some 5,000 protesters massed
outside the presidential offices, pelting police with eggs and paint.
</P>
<P>
	   One protester, Wilhelm Popovic, said he was showing his opposition ``in the
name of my father,'' who he said spent seven years in a Nazi concentration camp
``because of policies like this.''
</P>
<P>
	   Later Friday, protesters roamed downtown Vienna, briefly taking over the
Social Affairs Ministry and destroying several police cars. A police official,
Peter Stiedl, said 25 officers were slightly injured in clashes with
demonstrators. Smaller protests took place in Linz, Graz and Innsbruck.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel did not even wait for the government to be sworn in. Its ambassador
flew home hours before the coalition of the center-right Austrian People's Party
and Joerg Haider's far-right Freedom Party took office.
</P>
<P>
	   And one by one, the 14 nations sharing European Union membership with
Austria started reducing diplomatic ties, canceling contracts and official
visits and freezing high-level contacts.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said U.S. Ambassador Kathryn Walt-Hall
would leave for Washington to report and then return to Vienna to monitor the
political crisis.
</P>
<P>
	   Klestil had repeatedly warned that Freedom Party participation in government
would produce a fierce reaction because of Haider's anti-foreigner stand,
opposition to European Union expansion and his past praise of Nazi policies.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider won international notoriety for statements praising Adolf Hitler's
``orderly employment'' policies and lauding veterans of the Waffen SS as
``decent people of good character'' -- comments for which he has since
apologized.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Klestil indicated he had little choice but to approve the governing
coalition. In the Oct. 3 elections, the People's Party and Freedom Party won 104
of the 183 parliament seats.
</P>
<P>
	   In a televised address, Klestil expressed his personal ``concern and
dismay'' over the negative foreign reaction and domestic turmoil. He urged all
``to give the new federal government a chance and to judge it by its work.''
</P>
<P>
	   The new government will give the far right wing a greater voice in Austrian
policies than in any other European country. The chancellor, Wolfgang Schuessel,
is the leader of the People's Party, junior partner in the outgoing center-left
coalition with the Social Democrats. Freedom Party member Suzanne Riess-Passer
is vice chancellor.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider is not part of the new government and remains governor of Carinthia
province. But critics fear he will influence government policies from the wings.
</P>
<P>
	   Many European Union governments fear that the success of Haider's party
could boost rightist parties in their own countries.
</P>
<P>
	   In Belgium, where a far-right party is expected to make big election gains
this year, the defense minister suspended an order for six Austrian-made
ambulances, schools canceled ski trips to Austria and universities flew the
blue-and-gold European flag at half-staff.
</P>
<P>
	   France's defense minister postponed a meeting with Austria on European
defense and Portugal's president called off a state visit in March.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans Change in Forest Funds  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN HUGHES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton on Monday will propose eliminating four
national forest trust funds and instead earmark the funds' $300 million to a
single, new program aimed at restoring national forests and hiring rural
workers, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmentalists welcomed the plan, saying the trust funds have been an
incentive for forest managers to log so that they could get money for pet
projects. Critics also complained that trust fund spending is not approved by
Congress and therefore, open to abuse.
</P>
<P>
	   In a separate environmental initiative, Vice President Al Gore said Friday
that the administration will also ask for $211 million for new transit system
upgrades intended to stem suburban sprawl in 12 U.S. urban areas.
</P>
<P>
	   If approved by Congress, the money would underwrite grants for the transit
systems in Baltimore, Pittsburgh, Chicago, northern Illinois, Denver, Memphis,
Minneapolis-St. Paul, northern New Jersey, Portland, Salt Lake City, Seattle and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress rejected a White House anti-sprawl initiative last year.
</P>
<P>
	   More than half of the timber sale revenues in national forests are currently
deposited in trust funds that local forest managers can tap for projects, such
as removing dead and dying trees and protecting stream beds. The amount spent
increased from 16 percent in 1993 to 27 percent in 1997, the General Accounting
Office, Congress' investigative arm, found in a study.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, in his fiscal year 2001 budget, will seek to cancel the Salvage
Sale, Knutson-Vandenberg, Reforestation, and Timber Sale Pipeline Restoration
trust funds and instead send the timber receipts to the U.S. Treasury.
</P>
<P>
	   The president wants Congress to use the money to set up a single, permanent
fund that would allow Forest Service officials to target the spending for the
highest-priority projects nationwide, and where rural jobs are needed.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmentalists praised Clinton's proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a long overdue effort to address the perverse incentives within the
Forest Service,'' said Mike Anderson of The Wilderness Society in Seattle. ``It
will solve some of the Forest Service financial difficulties as well.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the plan must gain congressional approval and faces a tough fight in the
GOP-controlled House and Senate. Sending trust fund dollars to the Treasury
increases the temptation of Congress to use the money for other priorities, said
Mark Rey, a GOP staffer with the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal also will not be welcomed by many local forest managers, who
have viewed the trust funds as a source of stable revenue.

<HEADLINE> New York Post and Daily News discussed merging operations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Two of the nation's biggest and most fiercely
competitive city tabloids, The New York Post and the New York Daily News, have
discussed the possibility of merging some of their operations.
<P>
	   "The talks were of a preliminary nature. We are proceeding with our own
business plans with or without any outside parties," Ken Chandler, publisher and
editor in chief of the Post, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin D. Krall, executive vice president of the News, confirmed that there
had been brief preliminary talks within the past year.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked whether they would be revived, he said "Anything can happen, but there
are no current plans." Chandler said only that the Post would "always consider
any business opportunities."
</P>
<P>
	   Krall said the talks had been initiated by the Post, although a source close
to the Post said they had been initiated by the News.
</P>
<P>
	   The discussions focussed on the possibility of sharing such functions as
printing and distribution, officials from both newspapers confirmed.
</P>
<P>
	   The news comes against the backdrop of the city's intensely competitive
newspaper market in which both newspapers have at times struggled to survive. In
the early 1990s both papers went though severe problems that led to bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
	   The News emerged under the ownership of Mortimer B. Zuckerman and the Post
again became the property of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   The Post started a Sunday edition, initially priced at 25 cents in an effort
to entice readers. The News has invested in new printing technologies and the
Post is in the process of building a new plant.
</P>
<P>
	   But both are losing money and analysts tend to feel that there just aren't
enough readers and advertisers for both to become profitable.
</P>
<P>
	   They are also marketing against The New York Times and Newsday, which
continues to sell well in Queens while dominating Long Island.
</P>
<P>
	   The talks may have been inspired by the heavy toll fierce competition has
taken on the tabloids over the years.
</P>
<P>
	   The News had a loss of $17.9 million in 1998, despite a $19 million infusion
from Zuckerman, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Some executives close to the Post say the newspaper loses on average between
$9 million and $15 million a year, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Mostly Up but Down Vs. Yen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) --The dollar lost ground against the yen in quiet trading
Friday, but gained against most other currencies.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar was quoted at 107.35 yen in trading late Friday in New York, down
from 107.71 yen Thursday. The euro was quoted at 98.29 cents, down from 98.95
cents late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Currency trading was moderate Friday as traders digested the moves by many
of the world's central banks to hike interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   The European Central Bank raised interest rates Thursday, a day after the
U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates. Other countries raising interest rates this
week include Canada, Australia and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar also was quoted at 1.6345 Swiss francs, up from 1.6245, and
1.4416 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4394 late Thursday. The British pound fell to
$1.5908 from $1.5949.
</P>
<P>
	   Currencies of the countries participating in the euro are no longer traded
separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. Based on the euro's rate,
the dollar was worth: 1.9899 German marks, up from 1.9752; 6.6737 French francs,
up from 6.6245; and 1,969.96 Italian lire, up from 1,955.43.

	   Dow Ends Off 49.64; New Nasdaq High
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index rounded out its best
week in history with a another record high today as investors moved
money from industrial companies that may be hurt by rising interest
rates to technology companies. The Nasdaq rose 33.02 to 4,244.00,
above its previous record of 4,235.40 set Jan. 21. In percentage
terms, the technology-dominated index rose 9.1 percent, its best
weekly performance ever. The Dow Jones industrial average fell
49.64 to 10,963.80. Broader indicators were mixed. ``Money
continues to shift from the real world to the virtual world,'' said
Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd. in

	   Jobless Rate Drops to 4.0 Percent
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. unemployment rate hit a 30-year low
of 4 percent in January, down from 4.1 percent in December, the
Labor Department reported today. Employers added 387,000 jobs to
their payrolls. ``This is a very positive labor market for U.S.
workers, particularly those left behind by previous expansions,''
said Jared Bernstein, an economist with the Economic Policy
Institute, a group funded in part by labor. ``It's delivering
broad-based gains throughout the work force. ... It's lifting the
rowboats, not just the yachts.'' The unemployment rate for
Hispanics fell to an all-time monthly low of 5.6 percent in
January, while the rate for blacks rose to 8.2 percent.

smaller Internet companies involved in disputes with eBay. The
probe is focused on eBay's attempts -- including a federal lawsuit
against one competitor and threats to sue another -- to prevent
smaller Web companies from listing on their own sites items being
auctioned by eBay's customers. One of eBay's top lawyers, Jay
Monahan, said today that company officials ``have had some
discussions with staff at the Justice Department regarding eBay and
the online trading business generally.'' He said eBay welcomed the
opportunity ``to talk about our business and to express our serious
concerns regarding the practices of some of the aggregators.''

combination would give AT&AMP;T too much control over the content that
reaches peoples' homes. The nation's No. 1 long-distance carrier
squared off with rival phone companies and consumer advocates at a
Federal Communications Commission forum on its proposed purchase of
MediaOne. That deal, originally valued at $58 billion, would make
AT&AMP;T the nation's largest cable TV company and provider of
high-speed cable Internet services.

jobs -- will come in metro Atlanta. Another 420 jobs will be cut in
Birmingham, Ala., and the remaining 315 will be cut in seven other
Southeastern states. Analysts said the move was not a surprise. One
analyst, Anthony F. Perrugia of A.G. Edwards in St. Louis, said
BllSouth ``is just doing what they need to do to stay alive and
keep regulators and their shareholders happy.'' BellSouth shares
were at 45 1/2, up 1 7/16.

	   Investors Look To Save Ben &AMP; Jerry's

	   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- A group of ``socially conscious''
investors is banding together in an effort to save one of its own,
the quirky ice cream manufacturer famous for such flavors as
Bovinity Divinity and Phish Food. News of a potential rival to
Unilever NV, an Anglo-Dutch food conglomerate, and Dreyer's Grand
Ice Cream Inc. -- both of whom have reportedly been pursuing the
Vermont-based company -- helped boost Ben &AMP; Jerry's stock price on
the Nasdaq. Besides confirming that they're working on a deal,
though, the group of investors is keeping quiet. ``We're in the
middle of forming an offer and we're all sworn to hold this in
confidence,'' said Judith Wicks, a prominent member of the Social
Venture Network, a San Francisco ``socially responsible''
investment group. Ben &AMP; Jerry's stock was up 1 1/2 at 24.

	   FDIC Looks for Bank Fraud Red Flags
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., hit by
its biggest losses from bank failures since the early 1990s, is
telling its examiners to keep a sharp eye out for warning signs of
possible fraud at the banks they inspect. Fraud is said to have
been a major factor in three recent bank failures, two of which
cost the FDIC's insurance fund an estimated $982 million. ``We've
learned some things from these cases,'' FDIC chairwoman Donna
Tanoue said. ``We want to improve our performance.'' Signs at banks
that have failed include a hostile attitude toward or lack of
cooperation with examiners, large proportions of risky loans and
suspicious transactions by bank insiders.

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- TLC Beatrice International Holdings Inc. is
passing out its next-to-last $18 million to stockholders of what
once was the nation's largest black-owned company. The company, now
known as TLC-LC, began liquidation last spring as part of the
strategy that began after the death of its founder, Reginald Lewis,
six years ago. TLC-LC already has given shareholders $400 million
following the liquidation of the bulk of its operations, mainly in
Europe. After this $18 million is dispersed, at $2 a share, the
company will only own a small beverage company in Thailand. At one
time, TLC Beatrice had 64 operations in 31 countries with sales
that hit a high in 1996 of $2.23 billion.

<HEADLINE> High school student dies of Meningitis  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   GLOVERSVILLE, N.Y. (AP) - Health officials have confirmed a high school
student has died of Meningitis, and family members and others with close contact
are being treated with antibiotics.
<P>
	   Fulton County Public Health Director Regina Scrocco said Friday that the
death of the 17-year-old Gloversville High School student is isolated and no
other cases or symptoms have been reported.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no outbreak," Scrocco said.
</P>
<P>
	   A candle-light memorial was planned for Friday night for students, faculty,
staff and parents of the small city just north of the Mohawk River and 41 miles
northwest of Albany. The student was the senior class president. An autopsy this
week confirmed the death was due to Meningococcal Meningitis, county and state
health officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Family members, girlfriends, roommates and those who shared eating utensils
and drinking glasses are at a higher risk of contracting the disease, said Dr.
John Talarico, medical director of immunization programs in the state Health
Department. They are being evaluated and treated in now to prevent further
cases.
</P>
<P>
	   Classmates, casual friends and acquaintances aren't at a higher risk,
Talarico said.
</P>
<P>
	   Symptoms may appear two to 10 days after contact and include fever,
headache, vomiting and a stiff neck. Anyone with those symptoms should contact
their physician, Talarico said.
</P>
<P>
	   Statewide, about 250 cases of the disease are reported each year among 2,600
nationwide. The rate of death is about 13 percent for patients, Talarico said.
There hasn't been a case reported in Fulton County in more than a year, Scrocco
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The source of the case isn't known, but as much as 15 percent of the
population carries the bacteria in their nose and throat without symptoms or
becoming seriously ill, officials said. About 25 percent of those who contract
the disease have chronic nervous system problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Anyone can contract the disease, but infants and children are hit more
often.
</P>
<P>
	   Meningococcal Meningitis is a severe bacterial infection of the blood and
the tissue that covers the brain and spinal cord. Outbreaks or even clusters are
rare, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some antibiotics are effective in eliminating the germ from an infected
person.

<HEADLINE> Rowland plan includes cuts in gas, hospital tax  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Democratic leaders in The General Assembly said
Friday they will try to put the brakes on Gov. John G. Rowland's plan to cut
7-cents from the state's gasoline tax, a centerpiece of the governor's proposed
tax reduction package.
<P>
	   Rowland said reducing the gas tax beginning April 1 could cost about $90
million, but he offered no details Friday how to pay for it. Those will be
announced when he gives his budget address Wednesday, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor's plan would move programs currently paid for by the gasoline
tax, including a large portion of the Department of Motor Vehicles budget, to
the general fund, WTNH-TV reported, citing sources it did not identify.
</P>
<P>
	   Rowland would only say he had not plans to use the state's $240 million
surplus to pay for the cut.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're going to have some offsets in the general fund, and we'll be
transferring some responsibilities from the special transportation fund," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1997, the General Assembly has cut the gas tax 7 cents. Rowland said a
one-time 7-cent reduction will be more noticeable at the pumps and will prevent
drivers from crossing state lines to buy cheaper gas.
</P>
<P>
	   The gasoline tax is currently the highest in the nation at 32 cents per
gallon.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin Sullivan said he'll fight against any
plan that calls for cutting programs in order to pay for the cut.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't dismiss it, but I can't fathom how it can be done without cutting
the budget," said Sullivan, D-West Hartford. "I'm not going to trade off health
care and education to do it."
</P>
<P>
	   House Speaker Moira Lyons said she is open to a debate on the issue, but
said she would oppose cutting money for public transportation services to pay
for it.
</P>
<P>
	   "We all like tax cuts," said Lyons, D-Stamford. "But if we are not replacing
the $90 million on an ongoing basis, there will be a problem."
</P>
<P>
	   If a 7-cent cut is enacted, Connecticut's tax would be 25 cents per gallon,
compared with 29.8 cents in New York, 29 cents in Rhode Island, 21.5 cents in
Massachusetts, and 14.5 cents in New Jersey, based on the latest statistics.
</P>
<P>
	   The American Automobile Association of Greater Hartford endorsed Rowland's
gas tax cut plan.
</P>
<P>
	   "We hope state legislators will support this proposal and stop balancing the
state's budget on the backs of motorists," said Linda Olbrys, a AAA vice
president.
</P>
<P>
	   Rowland will also propose tax cuts to help bail out hospitals and make the
state more attractive to manufacturers. Under his plan, the gross receipts tax
that hospitals pay would be eliminated, saving the state's 30 hospitals about
$75 million a year. The corporate tax on manufacturers would also be lowered,
saving Connecticut businesses about $21 million a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Sullivan said he supported those ideas.
</P>
<P>
	   "Those are more significant cuts than lowering the gas tax," he said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Off 49.64; New Nasdaq High  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index rounded a week of powerful gains
with a new record today as investors moved money from industrial companies that
may be hurt by rising interest rates to technology companies.
</P>
<P>
	   According to preliminary calculations, the Nasdaq rose 33.02 to 4,244.00,
above its previous record of 4,235.40, set Jan. 21. In percentage terms, the
technology-dominated index rose 9.1 percent, its best weekly performance since
1974.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 49.64 to 10,963.80. Broader indicators
were mixed.
</P>
<P>
	   "Money continues to shift from the real world to the virtual world," said
Scott Bleier, chief investment strategist at Prime Charter Ltd. in New York.
"Money managers are going to the stocks that they know will perform."
</P>
<P>
	   Investors poured money into shares of Nasdaq's largest stocks, including
Apple Computer, Intel and Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
	   But smaller, younger companies that are just beginning to capitalize on the
technology craze drew attention as well. Firepond, a maker of software that
helps companies manage their electronic-commerce businesses, soared in its
initial public offering of stock.
</P>
<P>
	   "It takes a lot of equipment and labor to build the Internet, not just
ideas," Bleier said. "The companies that are figuring out how to improve the
Internet are going to do very well."
</P>
<P>
	   The broader market proved more vulnerable after the government delivered the
latest indication that the economy is growing quickly enough to convince the
Federal Reserve to continue raising interest rates in its effort to keep
inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
	   The Labor Department said today that employers added 387,000 jobs in
January, pushing the unemployment rate down to 4 percent, its lowest level since
1970. Still, some economists had expected the jobless rate to tumble below 4
percent, and investors drew some confidence when it did not, traders said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures, rose
a slightly higher-than-expected 0.4 percent to $13.50 in January, the fastest
pace since September.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the rise in wages, analysts said investors apparently have faith
that the Federal Reserve is in control of inflation. The central bank on
Wednesday increased rates for the fourth time since June, and indicated more
increases may be on the way.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the steady hand by the Fed is helping fuel the rally," said Barry
Berman, head trader for Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
	   Vodafone Airtouch AG was an exception to the strength in technology shares,
falling after the company sweetened its bid for German wireless company
Mannesmann AG. Mannesmann shareholders will vote by Feb. 17 on whether to accept
Vodafone's offer, now valued at $180 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Mattel shares fell on the New York Stock Exchange a day after Chief
Executive Officer Jill Barad resigned. The toymaker reported a steep loss for
the fourth quarter, disappointing Wall Street analysts for the third time in the
past four quarters.

<HEADLINE> US Rejects Russian Demand on Tanker  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and Russia were in a diplomatic dustup
Friday as Washington spurned a Moscow demand to immediately release a Russian
tanker seized by a U.S. Navy vessel.
</P>
<P>
	   The seizure of the Volga-Neft-147 on Wednesday in the Persian Gulf was
prompted by suspicions that the tanker was carrying Iraqi oil in violation of
U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We imperatively demand the immediate release of the Russian tanker,''
Deputy Foreign Minister Vasily Sredin told the Tass news agency. ``We shall get
it back and save both the ship and crew.''
</P>
<P>
	   But administration officials said the tanker likely would be diverted to
pro-Western Oman, where an analysis of the oil would take place to determine its
origin.
</P>
<P>
	   The tanker was in international waters off the Omani coast on Friday. A
Pentagon spokesman, Army Col. Vince Ogilvie, said Friday two officials from the
Russian consulate in the United Arab Emirates boarded the tanker, as did two
American defense attache officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia maintains the oil is from Iran, not Iraq. Iraq's government-run
Al-Thawra newspaper said in an editorial that the American claim that Iraq
benefits from illegal trade is ``a sheer lie.''
</P>
<P>
	   The United States has long been at odds with Russia over Iraq. Russia is a
strong supporter of steps in support of the eventual lifting of the U.N.
economic embargo against Iraq. The Clinton administration is insisting on full
Iraqi compliance with the U.N. Security Council resolutions, including a
requirement that Iraq not possess weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. officials said the administration was merely enforcing the embargo
against Iraq in ordering the seizure of the Russian vessel. The administration
has not said the Russian government was involved with Volga-Neft 147 or its
cargo.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russians are being told the issue is full implementation of sanctions
enforcement, officials said, noting that U.N. resolutions authorize seizures in
cases where smuggling is suspected.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq is banned from most international commerce but is allowed to export up
to $5.2 billion in oil every six months in order to buy food, medicine and other
essentials for its people, and spare parts for its oil industry.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the effort to enforce the U.N. sanctions, the State Department said
Thursday that illicit oil exports from Iraq average 100,000 barrels a day,
compared with 50,000 barrels in 1998, when oil prices were much lower.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Al-Thawra newspaper, in apparent reference to these figures, said
the Americans ``are making up stories, some backed up with false figures, about
vessels loaded with Iraqi oil and other Iraqi byproducts,''
</P>
<P>
	   Iraqi officials long have denied any smuggling of crude oil or byproducts
takes place on the Gulf. Iraq maintains the United States scrutinizes Gulf ships
traveling to and from Iraq, but does nothing to stop brisk illicit oil smuggling
over land from northern Iraq -- a Kurdish area outside the Baghdad government's
control -- into neighboring Turkey, a U.S. ally.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of Defense William Cohen said Friday in an interview en route to
Munich, Germany, there was no confirmation of Russian government involvement in
the alleged trafficking of Iraqi oil by Russian tankers. Administration
officials have raised the trafficking issue with Russian authorities, who say
they are investigating.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Overall there has been an increase on the part of Iraq to intensify its
smuggling operations, and we're going to have to simply intensify our own
intervention to prevent that,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he thinks Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein, ``will do whatever he
can to try to circumvent the sanctions. If he can get away with it, if there's a
laxity on the enforcement part, then he will seek to exploit it.''

	   Dow Ends Off 49.64; New Nasdaq High
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Nasdaq composite index set another record
high today as investors moved money from industrial companies that
may be hurt by rising interest rates to technology companies. The
Nasdaq rose 33.02 to 4,244.00, above its previous record of
4,235.40 set Jan. 21. In percentage terms, the technology-dominated
index rose 9.1 percent, its best weekly performance since 1974. The
Dow Jones industrial average fell 49.64 to 10,963.80. Broader
indicators were mixed. ``Money continues to shift from the real
world to the virtual world,'' said Scott Bleier, chief investment
strategist at Prime Charter Ltd. in New York. ``Money managers are

	   Jobless Rate Drops to 4.0 Percent
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. unemployment rate hit a 30-year low
of 4 percent in January, down from 4.1 percent in December, the
Labor Department reported today. Employers added 387,000 jobs to
their payrolls. ``This is a very positive labor market for U.S.
workers, particularly those left behind by previous expansions,''
said Jared Bernstein, an economist with the Economic Policy
Institute, a group funded in part by labor. ``It's delivering
broad-based gains throughout the work force. ... It's lifting the
rowboats, not just the yachts.'' The unemployment rate for
Hispanics fell to an all-time monthly low of 5.6 percent in
January, while the rate for blacks rose to 8.2 percent.

antitrust investigation of eBay Inc., the world's largest online
auction site. The government has interviewed top executives of two
smaller Internet companies involved in disputes with eBay. The
probe is focused on eBay's attempts -- including a federal lawsuit
against one competitor and threats to sue another -- to prevent
smaller Web companies from listing on their own sites items being
auctioned by eBay's customers. One of eBay's top lawyers, Jay
Monahan, said today that company officials ``have had some
discussions with staff at the Justice Department regarding eBay and
the online trading business generally.'' He said eBay welcomed the
opportunity ``to talk about our business and to express our serious
concerns regarding the practices of some of the aggregators.''

reaches peoples' homes. The nation's No. 1 long-distance carrier
squared off with rival phone companies and consumer advocates at a
Federal Communications Commission forum on its proposed purchase of

telecommunications company attempts to eliminate redundant
positions in its divisions. About 65 percent of the cuts -- 1,365
jobs -- will come in metro Atlanta. Another 420 jobs will be cut in
Birmingham, Ala., and the remaining 315 will be cut in seven other
Southeastern states. Analysts said the move was not a surprise. One
analyst, Anthony F. Perrugia of A.G. Edwards in St. Louis, said
BllSouth ``is just doing what they need to do to stay alive and

	   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- A group of ``socially conscious''
investors is banding together in an effort to save one of its own,
the quirky ice cream manufacturer famous for such flavors as
Bovinity Divinity and Phish Food. News of a potential rival to
Unilever NV, an Anglo-Dutch food conglomerate, and Dreyer's Grand
Ice Cream Inc. -- both of whom have reportedly been pursuing the
Vermont-based company -- helped boost Ben &AMP; Jerry's stock price on
the Nasdaq. Besides confirming that they're working on a deal,
though, the group of investors is keeping quiet. ``We're in the
middle of forming an offer and we're all sworn to hold this in
confidence,'' said Judith Wicks, a prominent member of the Social
Venture Network, a San Francisco ``socially responsible''
investment group. Ben &AMP; Jerry's stock was up 1 1/2 at 24.

	   FDIC Looks for Bank Fraud Red Flags

<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., hit by
its biggest losses from bank failures since the early 1990s, is
telling its examiners to keep a sharp eye out for warning signs of
possible fraud at the banks they inspect. Fraud is said to have
been a major factor in three recent bank failures, two of which
cost the FDIC's insurance fund an estimated $982 million. ``We've
learned some things from these cases,'' FDIC chairwoman Donna
Tanoue said. ``We want to improve our performance.'' Signs at banks
that have failed include a hostile attitude toward or lack of
cooperation with examiners, large proportions of risky loans and
suspicious transactions by bank insiders.

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- TLC Beatrice International Holdings Inc. is
passing out its next-to-last $18 million to stockholders of what
once was the nation's largest black-owned company. The company, now

six years ago. TLC-LC already has given shareholders $400 million
following the liquidation of the bulk of its operations, mainly in
Europe. After this $18 million is dispersed, at $2 a share, the
company will only own a small beverage company in Thailand. At one

<HEADLINE> Independence Party schism spills into Albany courts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - New York Reform Party Chairman Jack Essenberg on
Friday had a judge slap a restraining order on party members trying to fire him
as the split between Pat Buchanan supporters and Donald Trump supporters
widened.
<P>
	   The Reform Party - known in New York as the Independence Party - had a state
committee meeting set in Albany to remove Essenberg, a Donald Trump supporter.
The Independence Party's Democracy Coalition, led by leftist activist Lenora
Fulani, has been backing Pat Buchanan and calling for Essenberg's removal.
</P>
<P>
	   Essenberg was trying to read a letter when Buchanan supporter and Fulani
spokeswoman Cathy Stewart started interrupting him. When he wouldn't recognize
her the Buchanan supporters tried to take over the meeting to vote Essenberg
out.
</P>
<P>
	   However, his lawyer, Thomas Spargo, pulled out a restraining order signed
the day before banning the meeting from continuing without Essenberg, who then
walked out.
</P>
<P>
	   The stunned Fulani supporters were left in the room trying to figure out
their next move. They later moved to another room and continued meeting, Fulani
spokeswoman Sarah Lyons said. She said the restraining order was eventually
lifted.
</P>
<P>
	   Ironically, the restraining order was signed on Thursday by state Supreme
Court Justice Thomas McNamara, the same judge who threw Trump off the
Independence Party ballot last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides now plan to head to the courts.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is an unbelievably illegal restraining order," Stewart said. "We
should sit tight. The day is not over."
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll see what the courts say," Essenberg said.
</P>
<P>
	   Trump is not an announced presidential candidate for the Reform Party.
Nonetheless, he is considering running for the party's presidential nomination
and has picked up support from Reform Party members.
</P>
<P>
	   While Fulani is backing conservative Buchanan's bid for the Reform Party's
nomination, her faction is running delegate slates for the New York primary that
are uncommitted to any candidate. They convinced McNamara to throw out all of
the Trump delegates, saying Trump supporters did not get enough signatures to be
on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   Fulani supporters say Essenberg wants to use the Independence Party to set
himself up as a kingmaker and endorse other candidates similar to the state's
Conservative and Liberal parties.
</P>
<P>
	   Essenberg denies that and says the Fulani supporters just want control over
the party.

<HEADLINE> High school student dies of Meningitis  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   GLOVERSVILLE, N.Y. (AP) - Health officials have confirmed a high school
student has died of Meningitis, and family members and others with close contact
are being treated with antibiotics.
<P>
	   Fulton County Public Health Director Regina Scrocco said Friday that the
death of the 17-year-old Gloversville High School student is isolated and no
other cases or symptoms have been reported.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no outbreak," Scrocco said.
</P>
<P>
	   Senior class President Scott Retersdorf thought he had the flu Wednesday. He
was found that evening dead in his home.
</P>
<P>
	   A candle-light memorial was planned for Friday night for students, faculty,
staff and parents of the small city just north of the Mohawk River and 41 miles
northwest of Albany. An autopsy this week confirmed the death was due to
Meningococcal Meningitis, county and state health officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Family members, girlfriends, roommates and those who shared eating utensils
and drinking glasses are at a higher risk of contracting the disease, said Dr.
John Talarico, medical director of immunization programs in the state Health
Department. They are being evaluated and treated in now to prevent further
cases.
</P>
<P>
	   Classmates, casual friends and acquaintances aren't at a higher risk,
Talarico said.
</P>
<P>
	   Symptoms may appear two to 10 days after contact and include fever,
headache, vomiting and a stiff neck. Anyone with those symptoms should contact
their physician, Talarico said.
</P>
<P>
	   Statewide, about 250 cases of the disease are reported each year among 2,600
nationwide. The rate of death is about 13 percent for patients, Talarico said.
There hasn't been a case reported in Fulton County in more than a year, Scrocco
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The source of the case isn't known, but as much as 15 percent of the
population carries the bacteria in their nose and throat without symptoms or
becoming seriously ill, officials said. About 25 percent of those who contract
the disease have chronic nervous system problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Anyone can contract the disease, but infants and children are hit more
often.
</P>
<P>
	   Meningococcal Meningitis is a severe bacterial infection of the blood and
the tissue that covers the brain and spinal cord. Outbreaks or even clusters are
rare, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some antibiotics are effective in eliminating the germ from an infected
person.
</P>
<P>
	   A hundreds miles to the southwest in Binghamton, a 4-year-old boy died of
another rare form of bacterial meningitis. Pneumococcal meningitis is a common
germ that can be found in healthy people. The bacteria can severe injure people
with weak immune systems - including the very old or young.

<HEADLINE> Memorial fund set up for workers as investigation into accident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MILFORD, Conn. (AP) - Investigators on Friday examined blue prints and
engineering records looking for any clue that might explain the collapse of a
steel arch at a power plant construction site that resulted in the deaths of two
workers.
<P>
	   A survivor of Wednesday's accident, crane operator Robert Fitch, 62,
remained in serious condition Friday. His right leg was amputated Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Memorial funds were set up for the families of the two boilermakers who were
killed when the 80-foot arch collapsed and landed on a crane.
</P>
<P>
	   Kevin Winslow, 43, of Newington, was married and had a son, Patrick, and a
daughter, Caitlin. A funeral was scheduled for Saturday at Grace Episcopal
Church in Newington
</P>
<P>
	   Wayne Most, 38, of West Hartford, was married and had a daughter, Danielle.
A funeral was scheduled for Sunday in the chapel of the Carmon Windsor Funeral
Home in Windsor.
</P>
<P>
	   The construction company Black &AMP; Veatch said work on the 544-megawatt power
plant would resume Monday, but not in the area where the accident happened. The
arch that fell over was part of the housing for a boiler unit for the plant.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators continued Friday to photograph the scene and pore over
documents for clues about how the arch, made of several hundred tons of steel,
could have toppled over.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're still looking to see whether any building code violation was present
at the time of the incident, and if it was present, did it contribute to the
collapse," said George Luther, deputy commissioner of the state Department of
Public Safety.
</P>
<P>
	   Luther said the investigation could find that no building code violations
occurred.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators from the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration
also prepared to start disassembling the pile of rubble from the accident, said
Clifford Weston of OSHA's Bridgeport office.
</P>
<P>
	   Starting as soon as Monday, the pile will be taken apart piece by piece, and
key pieces will be set aside for investigators to inspect, Weston said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's going to be a long process before we are able to determine this," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Black &AMP; Veatch of Kansas City, Mo., has been fined by OSHA a few times in
the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
	   In October, OSHA assessed a $8,000 penalty for an accident where a worker
fell and broke bones in his foot on a power plant construction job in Agawam,
Mass. Black &AMP; Veatch is contesting OSHA's citations.
</P>
<P>
	   In the April before that accident, Black &AMP; Veatch received an award from
OSHA for its safety programs at the Agawam site. The award allowed the site to
go without the normal OSHA inspections.
</P>
<P>
	   Milford project manager Brent Freeman said the company was working to get
the same safety designation for the Milford site and that the project's 270
workers had not had one lost-time incident in more than eight months of
construction until Wednesday's accident.
</P>
<P>
	   OSHA spokesman John Chavez said OSHA has inspected Black &AMP; Veatch job sites
43 times from 1973 to 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   "Not too many of these inspections have too many alleged violations, and not
many of them are a big deal. I don't think we can term this as a bad or unsafe
company," Chavez said.
</P>
<P>
	   City councilors in Agawam have created an oversight council to see that
PDC-El Paso, which owns the Agawam and Milford plants, are following a 1996
agreement to build the plant.
</P>
<P>
	   Some city councilors were upset about Black &AMP; Veatch's responses to safety
questions at the site and about an oil storage tank that was built without the
permission of the state fire marshal. ---

<HEADLINE> Rowland plan includes cuts in gas, hospital tax  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Democratic leaders in the General Assembly said
Friday they will try to put the brakes on Gov. John G. Rowland's plan to cut 7
cents from the state's gasoline tax, a centerpiece of the governor's proposed
tax reduction package.
<P>
	   Rowland said reducing the gas tax beginning April 1 could cost about $90
million, but he offered no details Friday how to pay for it. Those will be
announced when he gives his budget address Wednesday, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor's plan would move programs currently paid for by the gasoline
tax, including a large portion of the Department of Motor Vehicles budget, to
the general fund, WTNH-TV reported, citing sources it did not identify.
</P>
<P>
	   Rowland said he had no plans to use the state's $240 million surplus to pay
for the cut.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're going to have some offsets in the general fund, and we'll be
transferring some responsibilities from the special transportation fund," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1997, the General Assembly has cut the gas tax 7 cents. Rowland said a
one-time 7-cent reduction will be more noticeable at the pumps and will prevent
drivers from crossing state lines to buy cheaper gas.
</P>
<P>
	   The gasoline tax is currently the highest in the nation at 32 cents per
gallon.
</P>
<P>
	   Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin Sullivan said he'll fight against any
plan that calls for cutting programs in order to pay for the cut.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't dismiss it, but I can't fathom how it can be done without cutting
the budget," said Sullivan, D-West Hartford. "I'm not going to trade off health
care and education to do it."
</P>
<P>
	   House Speaker Moira Lyons said she is open to a debate on the issue, but
said she would oppose cutting money for public transportation services to pay
for it.
</P>
<P>
	   "We all like tax cuts," said Lyons, D-Stamford. "But if we are not replacing
the $90 million on an ongoing basis, there will be a problem."
</P>
<P>
	   If a 7-cent cut is enacted, Connecticut's tax would be 25 cents per gallon,
compared with 29.8 cents in New York, 29 cents in Rhode Island, 21.5 cents in
Massachusetts, and 14.5 cents in New Jersey, based on the latest statistics.
</P>
<P>
	   The American Automobile Association of Greater Hartford endorsed Rowland's
gas tax cut plan.
</P>
<P>
	   "We hope state legislators will support this proposal and stop balancing the
state's budget on the backs of motorists," said Linda Olbrys, a AAA vice
president.
</P>
<P>
	   Rowland will also propose tax cuts to help bail out hospitals and make the
state more attractive to manufacturers. Under his plan, the gross receipts tax
that hospitals pay would be eliminated, saving the state's 30 hospitals about
$75 million a year. The corporate tax on manufacturers would also be lowered,
saving Connecticut businesses about $21 million a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Sullivan said he supported those ideas.
</P>
<P>
	   "Those are more significant cuts than lowering the gas tax," he said.

<HEADLINE> Gold Soars; Cocoa at 27-Year Low  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Gold investors went on a buying spree Friday, sending prices roaring up 8
percent after new evidence of the U.S. economy's sizzle and producer optimism
suggested strengthening demand for the metal as an inflation hedge.
</P>
<P>
	   It was gold's biggest one-day rise in more than four months. Silver followed
its lead on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, jumping 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In other commodity markets, cocoa sank to a 27-year low and soybean and
grain prices reversed an early slide to finish with solid gains.
</P>
<P>
	   Gold prices rallied strongly after the government said U.S. unemployment had
sunk to a 30-year low of 4 percent last month, heightening concerns that
inflation could rise. Also, the decline in bond prices helped support gold's
rise.
</P>
<P>
	   Then the market went sky-high when the world's No. 5 gold producer, Placer
Dome, announced it would suspend its hedging activities and cut back gold hedges
this year by 2 million ounces. The Canadian producer said other producers were
certain to follow.
</P>
<P>
	   The moves essentially signaled that big producers were bullish on gold, and
they sent speculators into a frenzy, pushing prices back to last fall's levels.
</P>
<P>
	   Gold for April delivery rose $22.60, settling at $312.50 an ounce, after
reaching its highest level in three months at $318.50.
</P>
<P>
	   It hasn't taken a bigger leap since last Sept. 28, when it snapped out of
the doldrums after sinking to a 20-year low of $255 last summer. That fever,
which began when European banks moved to limit their gold sales, touched off a
frantic two weeks in which gold spiked 34 percent to a high of $339 on Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the market may be eyeing that lofty high again after Friday's
stunning gain, particularly with rumors flying about hedge funds in trouble.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the emotions that we are playing on right now continue ... we can
obviously see a significant rise further in the price of gold," said Dave Meger,
senior metals analyst for Alaron Trading Corp. in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   Dan Vaught of A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons agreed. "The first suspicions is that you
will get some followthrough here," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cocoa plummeted on New York's Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange as the crop
arriving at West African ports for export continues to be heavy.
</P>
<P>
	   Cocoa prices, almost in free fall with supply growing and demand shrinking,
aren't expected to turn around until later in February when the activity on
docks in Ivory Coast and Ghana begins subsiding.
</P>
<P>
	   March cocoa slid to $751 a ton before recovering to $765, down $9 for the
day.
</P>
<P>
	   Soybeans surged in a late rally on the Chicago Board of Trade after falling
to a two-week low on continuing rains in once-dry growing regions of South
America.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat also rebounded in technically inspired buying after prices declined
early on suggestions Pakistan might postpone any wheat tenders for several
months. Corn found support from the rally in other farm commodities as well as
from forecasts calling for a dry weekend in key crop areas of South America.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat for March delivery rose 3 1/4 cents to $2.57 a bushel; March corn rose
1 3/4 cent to $2.19 3/4 a bushel; March oats rose  1/2 cent to $1.10 1/2 a
bushel; March soybeans rose 4 1/2 cents to $5.05 1/2 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Judge orders open NY primary, strikes down GOP ballot rules  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A federal judge ordered state Republicans on Friday to
open their March presidential primary to all four remaining candidates and
struck down major elements of the GOP's notoriously complicated ballot rules.
<P>
	   Bowing to heavy pressure to let Arizona Sen. John McCain on the ballot,
state GOP leaders conceded that parts of their election rules were unfair and
agreed not to appeal the judge's order.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision means Republican voters in every New York congressional
district will be able to choose on March 7 from among Gov. George Bush, McCain,
publisher Steve Forbes and conservative activist Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Edward Korman declared large parts of the state GOP's
election rules invalid, accusing party leaders of rigging the race in favor of
their favorite candidate - Bush. Korman said the requirements unfairly abridge
New Yorkers' voting rights by making it too difficult for legitimate candidates
to get on primary ballots.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a good day for McCain, it's a good day for New Yorkers, and it's a
great day for democracy," crowed McCain lawyer Burt Neuborne. "It's a perfect
primary. ... Everybody's on everywhere and all the voters have a choice."
</P>
<P>
	   The decision came a day after Gov. George Pataki decided to abandon a
politically damaging - and clearly losing - effort to keep McCain's name off
ballots in more than a third of New York's congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki and the state party are backing Bush and had hoped to guarantee him
an easy ride through the primary.
</P>
<P>
	   But McCain, who trounced the Texas governor in the New Hampshire primary,
made his ballot troubles a potent campaign issue, using them to bolster his
image as a renegade and likening New York's system to that of the former Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
	   Sensing voters' frustration, the Bush campaign asked the state party this
week not to appeal if Korman ruled against them in the Brooklyn federal court
lawsuit filed by McCain and joined by Forbes and Keyes.
</P>
<P>
	   The McCain camp declared complete victory, saying the judge's order would
end the days of New York party bosses planning closed elections.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am glad there will not be a repetition of the kind of machine-style
political control of the process of selecting the nominee of our party," McCain
said in a statement. "I am pleased that the Republicans in the state of New York
will now be able to make a choice on March 7th."
</P>
<P>
	   State GOP chairman Bill Powers defended the old rules, adding that the party
did not like Korman's order but would accept it.
</P>
<P>
	   "New York's primary process ensures that every individual seeking the
highest office in the land ... develop(s) the grassroots support needed to earn
the right to represent our families in the fall election," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Korman said it was clear party leaders were using petition requirements
to block ballot access.
</P>
<P>
	   "While this may further the interest of the Republican State Committe ... it
undermines the very purpose of a primary," he wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Korman did not cut the number of signatures Republican candidates must
collect in each of the state's 31 congressional districts. Party rules, enacted
into law by the state legislature, require presidential hopefuls to get
signatures from 0.5 percent of registered Republicans in each district, plus
5,000 more statewide.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge said the problem was the restrictions placed on how signatures can
be gathered and the legal challenges the party uses to invalidate opponents'
petitions.
</P>
<P>
	   He singled out as unconstitutional a requirement that petitions be
circulated only by people who live within the district where they gather
signatures. Korman said the rule gives unfair advantage to the candidate favored
by the party, since GOP leaders can easily mobilize local foot soldiers, while
outside candidates struggle to find workers in every district.
</P>
<P>
	   He also struck down a requirement that signers list the town where they live
instead of the village. He said that rule - used to knock Forbes off ballots in
three Long Island districts and McCain in one - was an unconstitutional
technicality.
</P>
<P>
	   Korman told each campaign to submit the names of the convention delegates it
wants listed on ballots by Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision restores McCain's candidacy in 12 districts where challenges to
his petitions were unresolved and puts Bush's name back on in a South Bronx
district where it was removed because his supporters forged signatures.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican leaders had tried to eliminate McCain in 17 districts, but Pataki
relented on Thursday. "John McCain should be on the ballot," he said. "This
should be a campaign about ideas and issues, not technicalities."
</P>
<P>
	   Bush praised Pataki's move, saying before the judge's order was annnounced,
"It's the right decision. I welcome it."
</P>
<P>
	   In most other states, candidates can get on primary ballots with minimal
petitioning or by getting media recognition as serious contenders. New York
Democrats require 5,000 signatures statewide.
</P>
<P>
	   State legislators - who routinely approve the primary plans submitted by the
parties before each presidential election season - will have to take Korman's
ruling into account before the 2004 primary.

<HEADLINE> Appeals court OKs Union Township's decision to close nude dancing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A state appeals court has upheld the decision by
Union Township officials to shut down a club featuring nude female dancers.
<P>
	   Officials tried to close the juice bar in 1995 and filed charges against the
owners because they violated buffer zone rules. The ordinance prohibited
sex-oriented businesses within 1000 feet of schools or churches, or within 500
feet of any homes.
</P>
<P>
	   Owners of the club, "Hott 22," claimed the township's ordinance was so
restrictive, it effectively outlawed sex-oriented businesses, and was thus
unconstitutional. The club was within 500 feet of a residential area, though the
lawyer, A. Kenneth Weiner, said it was in a shopping center next to a bowling
alley.
</P>
<P>
	   Weiner said the club remained in operation pending the appeal. He said it
was not clear to him whether Hott 22 must close immediately.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeals court on Friday ruled that the Union Township law forming buffer
zones was OK because substantial areas of the business district were available
for sex-oriented businesses. The court noted four such establishments exist in
this area.
</P>
<P>
	   The court, however, did dismiss charges against the owners for failing to
obtain a business license. The municipal law gave the police chief discretion to
deny licenses based on his assessment of the applicant's "moral character,"
which the court said was too broad.
</P>
<P>
	   "They said: You know what, the chief of police does not govern morality in
our town," Weiner said. The court ordered reconsideration of $17,500 in fines
that had been assessed against the club owners.
</P>
<P>
	   Weiner said it was confusing to have the court strike down the licensing law
while upholding the buffer-zone law.

<HEADLINE> Interfaith prayers mark anniversary of Amadou Diallo's death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Exactly a year ago, 41 police bullets made Amadou Diallo
a martyr. On Friday, the violence that prompted charges of police brutality was
softened by prayers on the anniversary of the West African man's death.
<P>
	   "Is this the proper time to talk about healing?" asked Sheik Abd'Allah Latif
Ali during a sermon at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine.
</P>
<P>
	   He spoke at an interfaith healing service several days after four police
officers went on trial in the shooting of the unarmed immigrant. The Muslim
cleric noted that some observers were concerned that such a service could damage
the prosecutors' case.
</P>
<P>
	   But he said it was the Diallo family "who inspired me to say, 'We need a
healing service.' ... a healing to parallel the court process."
</P>
<P>
	   Chairs reserved for Diallo's parents, Saikou Diallo and Kadiatou Diallo,
remained empty during the two-hour memorial that included rites following
Islamic, Christian, Jewish, Hindu and Native American traditions.
</P>
<P>
	   The massive cathedral on Manhattan's Upper West Side was chosen for the
service as "a place of compassion, a place of justice, and a place of community
healing," said its dean, the Very Rev. Harry Pritchett, Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   For some on Friday, that meant compassion for both Diallo and the officers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Very Rev. James P. Morton pointed to "the many injustices that befell so
many immigrants, so many people of color."
</P>
<P>
	   But we must not forget "the suffering that (the officers) and their families
are enduring at this moment," the head of New York's Interfaith Center told
several hundred people gathered in the stone-and-stained-glass house of worship.
</P>
<P>
	   At least one member of the congregation disagreed.
</P>
<P>
	   "We want justice for Amadou!" she yelled out, repeating the words throughout
the service.
</P>
<P>
	   Other Muslim clerics offered prayers in Arabic as the rite ended at about 4
p.m., just hours before Diallo's relatives planned a vigil for him at the Bronx
site where he was shot.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo was stuck by 19 of the 41 bullets police fired into a vestibule of
his apartment building.

<HEADLINE> Jan. Jobless Rate Down to 4 Percent  </HEADLINE>
    By JEANNINE AVERSA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's historic economic expansion propelled the
unemployment rate to a 30-year low of 4 percent in January, giving many workers
the best labor market they have seen since taking their first job.
</P>
<P>
	   Trying to keep pace with the roaring economy, employers added a whopping
387,000 jobs to their payrolls last month, the largest leap since September
1997, the Labor Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Usually January isn't a big month for hiring, but the better-than-normal
weather early in the month gave a big boost to employment, particularly in
construction and other fields that tend to flourish when the weather is good,
economists said.
</P>
<P>
	   The dip in January's unemployment rate -- down from December's 4.1 percent
-- was the lowest jobless rate since January 1970 when it stood at 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a very positive labor market for U.S. workers, particularly those
left behind by previous expansions," said Jared Bernstein, an economist with the
Economic Policy Institute, a group funded in part by labor. "It's delivering
broad-based gains throughout the work force. ... It's lifting the rowboats, not
just the yachts."
</P>
<P>
	   The unemployment rate for Hispanics fell to an all-time monthly low of 5.6
percent in January, while the rate for blacks rose to 8.2 percent, up from 7.9
percent the month before.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, the economy entered 107 months of uninterrupted economic growth,
the longest expansion in U.S. history, beating the old mark of 106 months set
during the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
	   "Today's strong employment numbers confirm once and for all that this is the
longest economic expansion in our history," President Clinton told reporters at
the White House. "The milestone is a credit to the American people, to their
hard work."
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Reserve boosted interest rates Wednesday by a quarter of a
percentage point -- the fourth increase since June -- to help ensure the
expansion stays on track. The Fed raised rates to slow the red-hot economy and
keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
	   Many analysts, citing continuing strong economic growth, expect additional
rate increases this year and said Friday's report justifies such a move at the
Fed's next meeting in March.
</P>
<P>
	   "The economy still has plenty of momentum and more Fed tightening is coming
down the pike," said Merrill Lynch's chief economist, Bruce Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
	   Wall Street, which has been volatile in recent sessions, offered a mixed
reaction to the report. The Dow Jones closed down 49.64 points at 10,963.80 and
bond prices slid as the yield on the bellwether 30-year Treasury rose to 6.27
percent from 6.13 percent late Thursday. But the Nasdaq blazed a new record,
finishing up 33.16 points to 4,244.14, surpassing its previous high of 4,235.40,
set Jan. 21.
</P>
<P>
	   January's big burst in hiring was helped by a huge and usual 116,000 new
construction jobs -- the biggest gain in nearly 16 years -- aided by mild
weather. Heavy construction, concrete, masonry and roofing trades posted the
largest increases.
</P>
<P>
	   Given that, some economists didn't believe the bigger-than-expected 387,000
total new jobs created in January was a worrisome sign that the economy may be
on the brink of overheating. They expect the next report to show jobs growth
moderating.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures, rose
0.4 percent to $13.50 in January, the fastest pace since September. But some
economists didn't find the uptick troubling. In December, wages grew by 0.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   "The 0.4 percent increase is not excessive," said Gary Thayer, chief
economist for A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc. "Workers are seeing wage gains above
inflation which stretches their income. But wage gains are not so high as to
force companies to raise their prices."
</P>
<P>
	   While strong wage and job growth are good for workers, economists are always
looking for signs that the combination could trigger inflation, fearing that
employers trying to attract scarce workers will lure them with higher wages and
benefits -- increased costs that could drive up consumer prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Jobs gains were so widespread that even manufacturing, which lost 248,000
jobs last year, added 13,000 jobs in January. The largest increases came from
electrical equipment and auto production. Manufacturers are recovering from the
effects of a global financial crisis that struck in 1997, depressing overseas'
demand for U.S. goods.
</P>
<P>
	   The service sector, the driving force of job creation in the United States,
added 256,000 jobs in January with landscaping firms, clothing stores and car
dealerships all showing gains.
</P>
<P>
	   Business services added 152,000 jobs, while 35,000 government jobs were
added, reflecting in part the hiring of 11,000 federal census workers.

<HEADLINE> Wen Ho Lee Challenges 'Secret' Label  </HEADLINE>
   By SUE MAJOR HOLMES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Attorneys for a scientist accused of putting
nuclear secrets on unsecured computer tapes said the information, far from being
``crown jewels'' of U.S. weapons science, was not even classified top secret.
</P>
<P>
	   Wen Ho Lee's attorneys, in a filing sent Thursday to the 10th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Denver, said if the information had been as vital as
government witnesses said it was, it would have been given the top secret
classification.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the tapes contained information that was classified secret or
confidential restricted data, they said in seeking to get Lee released from jail
pending trial.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. attorney's office had no comment on the filing, said spokeswoman
Patricia Chavez.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee, fired from Los Alamos National Laboratory in March, is accused of
transferring nuclear weapons information to unsecured computers and tapes.
</P>
<P>
	   Lee, 60, has pleaded innocent to 59 criminal counts under the Atomic Energy
and Espionage acts. He is not charged with espionage.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. weapons labs executives testified at Lee's detention hearings that the
tapes contain electronic blueprints to a variety of weapons designs -- from
easily made atomic bombs attractive to terrorists to thermonuclear warheads the
officials said they feared could change the global nuclear balance of power.

<HEADLINE> French Troops, Kosovars Clash  </HEADLINE>
   By ELENA BECATOROS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Hundreds of ethnic Albanians pelted
French soldiers with stones and bottles Friday, charging that NATO-led
peacekeepers failed to prevent the deaths of at least six Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
	   Two dozen Serbs were also injured in the volatile, divided city of Kosovska
Mitrovica on Thursday night in violence that demonstrates how tensions between
the two ethnic groups remain passionately high, despite the presence of
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
	   The French troops fired tear gas to disperse about 500 rioters at one of two
bridges that span the Ibar River, which runs through the heart of this
industrial city 30 miles northwest of Kosovo's provincial capital, Pristina.
About 9,000 Serbs control the north bank, and 90,000 ethnic Albanians live on
the south side.
</P>
<P>
	   Armed members of the Kosovo Protection Corps, made up of former ethnic
Albanian rebels, later appeared and calmed the crowd. Four or five French
soldiers were injured, including one with a broken arm.
</P>
<P>
	   French peacekeepers guard the two bridges, keeping the groups apart to avoid
violence. However, thousands of ethnic Albanians live north of the river -- the
Serb side.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest round of violence started after a rocket attack Wednesday killed
two elderly Serbs on a bus run by the U.N. refugee agency that was carrying them
through predominantly Albanian areas near Kosovska Mitrovica. That attack
destroyed what little faith minority Serbs had in the power of U.N. peacekeepers
to protect them from violence by ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
	   The next night, violence broke out in the Serb-controlled northern side of
the city.
</P>
<P>
	   Two ethnic Albanian men were shot to death. Half an hour later, a grenade
was thrown into a Serb cafe, wounding up to 15 people. An ethnic Albanian woman
was then shot and killed, and another grenade was tossed into another Serb cafe,
wounding 10.
</P>
<P>
	   At least three other ethnic Albanians who were injured in the shootings died
Friday, NATO said.
</P>
<P>
	   Crowds of angry Serbs and ethnic Albanians gathered on opposite sides of the
bridges. Scuffles and rock-throwing persisted into Friday, French military
spokesman Fabrice Turco said.
</P>
<P>
	   The United Nations said 10 of its vehicles were burned, including seven
police cars and three from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the estimated 4,000 ethnic Albanians living on the Serb side fled to
the Albanian district Thursday night and early Friday, said Paula Ghedini,
spokeswoman for the refugee agency. The agency suspended operations in the Serb
area and sent its three foreign staffers to the Albanian side.
</P>
<P>
	   An overnight curfew also was imposed. Scattered gunshots and one small
explosion could be heard coming from the northern, Serb-run district.
</P>
<P>
	   In Belgrade, Serbia's state-run Tanjug news agency said the attacks on Serb
cafes ``revolted'' the Serbs in Kosovska Mitrovica. Serbs and Albanians were
shooting at each other, Tanjug said, citing local sources.
</P>
<P>
	   A Kosovo Serb representative, Jovica Jovanovic, said the attacks were part
of ``continued attempts by ethnic Albanian terrorists to cleanse Kosovo of
Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The attitude by the United Nations mission here only encourages more
crime,'' Jovanovic said.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the presence of NATO peacekeepers in Kosovo, violence is still
common. Ethnic Albanians often stage revenge attacks against Serbs for the
18-month crackdown by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
	   On Oct. 15, more than 100 people were injured in a two-hour melee in
Kosovska Mitrovica, which includes the largest enclave of Serbs remaining in
Kosovo. Ten days before, one Serb was killed and 26 other people, mostly French
and U.N. police, were injured in an ethnic riot on the outskirts of town.

<HEADLINE> Chavez Marks Date of Coup Attempt  </HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GUTKIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Thousands of Venezuelans took to the streets
Friday to help President Hugo Chavez celebrate the eighth anniversary of his
failed military coup.
</P>
<P>
	   Massive rallies were being held in major cities with former coup
participants giving speeches lauding the 1992 putsch.
</P>
<P>
	   But critics insisted that glorifying the event sends the wrong message to
the South American nation's military: that it's OK to take up arms against your
superiors.
</P>
<P>
	   The coup attempt catapulted Chavez onto Venezuela's national scene.
</P>
<P>
	   At midnight on Feb. 3, 1992, Chavez and three other mid-level officers led
15,000 rebel soldiers intent on imposing a ``progressive'' civilian-military
junta. Heavy gunfire rattled the presidential palace in Caracas and a tank tried
to smash down the palace door.
</P>
<P>
	   By noon the next day, dozens of people lay dead and the government had the
upper hand. A captured Chavez went before TV cameras and admitted defeat ``for
now.'' Chavez surrendered the night of the coup and was jailed for two years. He
was pardoned in 1994 by ex-President Rafael Caldera.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time, most of the world condemned the attempted coup and
congratulated then-President Carlos Andres Perez for restoring the elected
government.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Chavez began building a steady following that grew and eventually
led to his presidential victory in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech Friday, Chavez called the attempted coup ``inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said he ordered palace workers not to repair damage to the palace caused
by the coup attempt because he wanted it as a constant reminder of the night
that changed Venezuelan history.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It helps me in my solitude not to forget,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The other former officers who helped Chavez lead the coup attempt staged
their own celebrations Friday in the western city of Coro.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez's supporters in an assembly that rewrote Venezuela's constitution
last week reinstated into the armed forces more than 260 former coup
participants who fought alongside Chavez.
</P>
<P>
	   Retired Vice Adm. Mario Ivan Carratu, who was in charge of Perez's security
during the attempted coup, said Friday's commemoration is an affront to soldiers
who remained loyal and ``stimulates the idea of insurrection inside the armed
forces.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are changing the heroic military chiefs of the past for the failed coup
leaders of 1992,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Vodafone-Mannesmann Deal Biggest Yet  </HEADLINE>
    By HANS GREIMEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- With Vodafone AirTouch paying a record $180
billion to acquire Germany's Mannesmann AG, wireless communications have taken
center stage in two of the three biggest mergers in history.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, although Mannesmann squeezed nearly twice as much money from
Vodafone as the British company first proposed -- and 50 percent more than MCI
WorldCom is paying for Sprint and its valuable wireless unit -- analysts say the
price is right for a deal that will place Vodafone at the pinnacle of a mobile
communications revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, the supervisory board at Mannesmann recommended that the
company's shareholders approve the deal, the product of a 2 1/2-month takeover
battle that was unusally hard-fought by European standards.
</P>
<P>
	   The merger will form a global force in wireless communications with 42
million customers worldwide. The company will have a substantial U.S. presence
through a new alliance between its AirTouch unit and Bell Atlantic's mobile
operations, but the new Vodafone's true stronghold will be Europe, with 29
million customers and a No. 1 or No. 2 market position in 11 countries on the
continent.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, since Europe is the most advanced market in terms of mobile phone
use, the new company may hold considerable sway in forging a global standard for
the robust wireless technologies that will be deployed in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
	   With a single format, mobile callers would be able to use the same phone
wherever they travel, opening the door to explosive growth, especially for
companies with an early start and a wide reach.
</P>
<P>
	   Right now, mobile phone systems around the world are largely incompatible
with each other. Europe uses GSM, a technology that plays third fiddle in the
United States to the CDMA system championed by Sprint PCS, and the TDMA format
used by AT&AMP;T and SBC Communications.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of the disparity, when mobile callers leave town, cross state lines
or go overseas, it's not always guaranteed they can make a call on their
wireless phones. Matters are further complicated in the United States when
callers roam from place to place, encountering mobile networks that use older
"analog" signals or digital "PCS" technology.
</P>
<P>
	   But a mobile phone provider with truly global coverage would likely sport an
advantage with customers, especially those who travel a lot, by providing
uninterrupted service wherever they go.
</P>
<P>
	   That's why the high-priced deal "was definitely worth it," said Kevin M.
Roe, an industry analyst with ABN Amro in New York. In fact, he said, "It was a
must-do transaction."
</P>
<P>
	   Big mobile players can also expect to prosper as wireless phones meld with
palmtop computers, providing services such as video conferencing or making
payments at vending machines and cash registers. Actually, experts say mobile
phones are likely to surpass personal computers as the most popular way of
surfing the Web.
</P>
<P>
	   For all those reasons, the Vodafone deal is expected to trigger more telecom
mergers as companies rush to grab bigger shares of the mobile market and shift
away from the traditional focus on a single technology such as wireless,
fixed-line or Internet service.
</P>
<P>
	   "What we're going to see is just a few companies competing on the basis of
one-stop shopping," said M.S. Krishnan, a professor of information systems at
the University of Michigan business school. "The Internet is no longer separated
from media and telecom companies. There could soon be only four or five players
worldwide."
</P>
<P>
	   Vodafone chief executive Chris Gent said Friday in a conference call that
his company was already eyeing another target. This time it was Airtel, Spain's
fastest-growing cellular company.
</P>
<P>
	   "As to other alliances, we'll have to wait and see who comes to us with
ideas," he said. "I can tell you that my diary is already becoming filled with
appointments to talk about cooperation."
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, both companies lost ground on the stock market Friday. Mannesmann
closed down 1 percent in Germany, while Vodafone dropped 6 percent in London.

<HEADLINE> False Data Alleged in Cancer Study  </HEADLINE>
    By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A South African study of a last-ditch treatment that had
given hope to some women with advanced breast cancer contained falsified data,
U.S. cancer officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement came after U.S. officials received word from a university
in Johannesburg that the study's author acknowledged he had made a "foolish"
mistake.
</P>
<P>
	   At issue is an aggressive treatment usually reserved for the most advanced
breast cancer: ultrahigh doses of chemotherapy followed by a bone marrow
transplant.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of women have demanded the procedure, believing it is their last
best hope even though there has been no scientific proof of its effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
	   Last spring, five long-awaited studies that experts hoped would settle the
issue were announced -- and four found no difference in survival for breast
cancer patients who underwent the arduous bone-marrow transplant therapy than
those who tried less risky treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   That prompted top cancer specialists to conclude that, at least for women
with advanced breast cancer, high-dose chemotherapy was not a good option.
Whether it helps other women is still under study.
</P>
<P>
	   But the fifth study, performed by a South African researcher on 150
late-stage cancer patients there, had positive results, prompting believers in
the therapy to cling to hope that this arduous treatment might work in some
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
	   Late Friday, U.S. cancer officials released a letter from Johannesburg's
University of Witwatersrand announcing that that study now "is discredited."
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement, the university said it is investigating Professor Werner
Bezwoda for scientific misconduct for misrepresenting the study's results.
Bezwoda could not be reached for comment, but the university released a
statement attributed to Bezwoda in which he said, "I acknowledge my error and
take sole responsibility."
</P>
<P>
	   "This was done out of a foolish desire to make the presentation more
acceptable to an audience" of cancer experts, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bezwoda's presentation at a high-profile cancer meeting in Atlanta last May
prompted the U.S. National Cancer Institute to convene a meeting of oncology
specialists to consider why his results were so positive, said NCI spokesman
Brian Vastag.
</P>
<P>
	   Bezwoda claimed to use different chemotherapy agents than U.S. researchers,
prompting speculation that maybe different drugs could produce better results.
</P>
<P>
	   A team of five oncologists went to Johannesburg to audit Bezwoda's results,
but were only able to find 50 of the 150 patients' records, Vastag said. They
reported the inconsistencies to the university's ethics office, which began
investigating and notified U.S. cancer officials Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   "We felt an obligation to notify everyone as soon as we had the
information," said Dr. Joseph P. Bailes of the American Society of Clinical
Oncology, which alerted cancer patient groups of the problem late Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The society allowed Bezwoda's study to be presented its May meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   As far as U.S. cancer patients are concerned, Bailes noted that the South
African study used different chemotherapy drugs than Americans have tried.
Still, "it adds further to the weight of evidence that the procedure has not had
as much effect as many people had hoped," said Dr. Harmon Eyre of the American
Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
	   But the issue is not entirely settled, Bailes said. In the four studies that
found no benefit to high-dose chemotherapy, women continue to be watched in case
some late-term improvement is seen, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   And the NCI is sponsoring another study of high-dose chemotherapy in 1,000
women whose breast cancer is not as advanced to see if this treatment helps at
an earlier stage of the disease, Vastag said.
</P>
<P>
	   Americans who wish to try high-dose chemotherapy should do so only in a
clinical trial, Eyre and Bailes stressed.

<HEADLINE> Bonds Prices Pull Back After 2 Days  </HEADLINE>
    By DUNSTAN PRIAL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK -- The bond market pulled back sharply Friday following two days of
spectacular gains.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders took profits on long-term bonds and surveyed the new landscape amid
widespread speculation that large trading desks suffered severe losses because
of bad bets on the direction of long-term yields. But no victims immediately
surfaced.
</P>
<P>
	   Fresh signs of growing inflationary pressures added to the reasons to sell.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the 30-year bond plunged 1 27/32 points, or $18.44 per $1,000
in face value.
</P>
<P>
	   The decline came after a two-day run up that saw the long-term Treasury rise
a total of 3 7/8 points, or $38.75 1/4.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the long bond, which moves in the opposite direction of the
price, shot up to 6.27 percent Friday from Thursday's 6.13 percent. But that
still is well below the 2 1/2-year high of 6.75 percent reached Jan. 18.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the unprecedented volatility in the usually staid market for
low-risk government bonds will likely continue until the dust settles from
Wednesday's announcement that the U.S. government intends to reduce the amount
of long-term bonds to help pay down the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   The pay-down program means some government bonds could be phased out
altogether.
</P>
<P>
	   "Treasury bonds will develop into more and more of a niche market, and
that's not been the case before," said John Poole, a senior vice president at
Mellon Private Asset Management in Boston.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. government backed Treasury bonds are widely considered the safest and
most liquid -- or most easily traded -- of all investment securities available
to investors.
</P>
<P>
	   Poole said supply and demand will now dictate Treasury bond price
fluctuations rather than broad economic factors, as was formerly the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Speculation was rampant Friday that major losses were incurred on Wednesday
and Thursday by large trading firms and other investors who bet long-term bond
prices would fall and yields would rise as the Federal Reserve Board continued
its policy of raising short-term interest rates to stave off inflationary
pressures.
</P>
<P>
	   But that's not what happened.
</P>
<P>
	   "Instead, there was an extraordinary surge in long-term bond prices, and
that's when we started hearing about the losses. That's when a lot of people got
hurt," said John Canavan, a market analyst at Stone &AMP; McCarthy in Princeton,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
	   Traders found an excuse to sell in a government report of rising wages as
unemployment in January fell to 4 percent, its lowest level in 30 years. With
the economy roaring ahead, analysts said the Federal Reserve could continue to
raise rates on top of the four increases since June.
</P>
<P>
	   Prices of short-term Treasury securities also fell Friday, dropping 3/16 to
5/16 point, while intermediate maturities fell 9/16 to  3/4 point, according to
Bridge Telerate news service.
</P>
<P>
	   In other trading Wednesday, yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.65
percent, with the discount rising 0.05 percentage point from late Thursday to
5.49 percent. Six-month yields were 5.94 percent as the discount rose 0.11
percentage point to 5.69 percent. One-year yields finished at 6.19 percent, with
the discount rising 0.06 percentage point to 5.83 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the
interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, fell
to 5.63 percent from 5.75 percent late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bond Buyer index of municipal bonds fell 3/16 point to 91 31/32. The
yield was 6.26 percent, up from Thursday's 6.24 percent.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Defense Fund Increase  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will make a final crack at politically
unpopular military base closings in the $300 billion defense budget he sends to
Congress on Monday. That request appears doomed in an election year, but other
parts of the request seem likely to win more favor among military-minded
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
	   At roughly $300 billion, the budget will be up from last year's $288 billion
and will represent ``the first real defense increase in over a decade,''
according to Defense Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
	   The budget for the fiscal year that begins next Oct. 1 is expected to
earmark $60 billion in money to buy new weapons, defense officials say.
</P>
<P>
	   About $1 billion of that will be devoted to repairing shortcomings exposed
in the Kosovo war last spring, including the purchase of an additional Joint
Stars ground surveillance radar aircraft, an additional squadron of Navy EA-6B
Prowler electronic warfare aircraft and more unmanned surveillance planes.
</P>
<P>
	   It will also provide funds to replenish the supply of Joint Direct Attack
Munition, or JDAM, precision bombs to make up for those used in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   Pentagon officials said the budget would include $5 billion over the next
five years for housing allowances to military members who live off-base, with
the goal of paying the entire cost of off-base housing within five years.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also will ask for a $2.2 billion increase on spending for a national
missile defense system, long a top priority of congressional Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   The president has said he will make a decision this June on whether to move
to the next stage and actually begin plans for deploying such a system.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also will ask for authority to close more bases starting in 2003.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Republican congressional leaders have expressed almost blanket
opposition to more base closings any time soon, and even Senate Democratic
Leader Tom Daschle has been an opponent of a new round.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration has not said how many bases it thinks should be closed,
nor which would be targeted. That would be decided by a congressionally
authorized Base Realignment and Closure Commission, subject to presidential
approval. The Pentagon lacks the authority to close bases on its own.
</P>
<P>
	   The last round of base closings was approved by the president and Congress
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   But Republicans contend they were double-crossed by Clinton when he made
campaign promises in his 1996 reelection campaign to work to save jobs at
military bases in California and Texas that the commission had designated for
closing.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's budget will also renew the Pentagon's commitment to develop three
new fighter jets for the future: the Air Force's F-22 ``Stealth'' bomber, nearly
killed off by Congress last year; the Navy's FA-18 E and F jet fighters; and the
multi-service Joint Strike Fighter.

<HEADLINE> Gold Soars; Cocoa at 27-Year Low  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Gold investors went on a buying spree Friday, sending prices roaring up 8
percent after new evidence of the U.S. economy's sizzle and producer optimism
suggested strengthening demand for the metal as an inflation hedge.
</P>
<P>
	   It was gold's biggest one-day rise in more than four months. Silver followed
its lead on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange, jumping 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In other commodity markets, cocoa sank to a 27-year low and soybean and
grain prices reversed an early slide to finish with solid gains.
</P>
<P>
	   Gold prices rallied strongly after the government said U.S. unemployment had
sunk to a 30-year low of 4 percent last month, heightening concerns that
inflation could rise. Also, the decline in bond prices helped support gold's
rise.
</P>
<P>
	   Then the market went sky-high when the world's No. 5 gold producer, Placer
Dome, announced it would suspend its hedging activities and cut back gold hedges
this year by 2 million ounces. The Canadian producer said other producers were
certain to follow.
</P>
<P>
	   The moves essentially signaled that big producers were bullish on gold, and
they sent speculators into a frenzy, pushing prices back to last fall's levels.
</P>
<P>
	   Gold for April delivery rose $22.60, settling at $312.50 an ounce, after
reaching its highest level in three months at $318.50.
</P>
<P>
	   It hasn't taken a bigger leap since last Sept. 28, when it snapped out of
the doldrums after sinking to a 20-year low of $255 last summer. That fever,
which began when European banks moved to limit their gold sales, touched off a
frantic two weeks in which gold spiked 34 percent to a high of $339 on Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts said the market may be eyeing that lofty high again after Friday's
stunning gain, particularly with rumors flying about hedge funds in trouble.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the emotions that we are playing on right now continue ... we can
obviously see a significant rise further in the price of gold," said Dave Meger,
senior metals analyst for Alaron Trading Corp. in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   Dan Vaught of A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons agreed. "The first suspicions is that you
will get some followthrough here," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Silver for April delivery, moving in sympathy with gold, was 28.7 cents
higher at $5.547 a troy ounce.
</P>
<P>
	   Cocoa plummeted on New York's Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange as the crop
arriving at West African ports for export continues to be heavy.
</P>
<P>
	   Cocoa prices, almost in free fall with supply growing and demand shrinking,
aren't expected to turn around until later in February when the activity on
docks in Ivory Coast and Ghana begins subsiding.
</P>
<P>
	   March cocoa slid to $751 a ton before recovering to $765, down $9 for the
day.
</P>
<P>
	   Soybeans surged in a late rally on the Chicago Board of Trade after falling
to a two-week low on continuing rains in once-dry growing regions of South
America.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat also rebounded in technically inspired buying after prices declined
early on suggestions Pakistan might postpone any wheat tenders for several
months. Corn found support from the rally in other farm commodities as well as
from forecasts calling for a dry weekend in key crop areas of South America.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat for March delivery rose 3 1/4 cents to $2.57 a bushel; March corn rose
1 3/4 cent to $2.19 3/4 a bushel; March oats rose  1/2 cent to $1.10 1/2 a
bushel; March soybeans rose 4 1/2 cents to $5.05 1/2 a bushel.

<P>
	   But smaller, younger companies that are just beginning to capitalize on the
technology craze drew attention as well. Firepond, a maker of software that
helps companies manage their electronic-commerce businesses, soared in its
initial public offering of stock. Shares were offered at 22, opened at 52 and
closed at 100 1/4.
</P>

	   "It takes a lot of equipment and labor to build the Internet, not just
ideas," Bleier said. "The companies that are figuring out how to improve the
Internet are going to do very well."
</P>
<P>
	   The broader market proved more vulnerable after the government delivered the
latest indication that the economy is growing quickly enough to convince the
Federal Reserve to continue raising interest rates in its effort to keep
inflation at bay.
</P>
<P>
	   The Labor Department said employers added 387,000 jobs in January, pushing
the unemployment rate down to 4 percent, its lowest level since 1970. Still,
some economists had expected the jobless rate to tumble below 4 percent, and
investors drew some confidence when it did not, traders said.
</P>
<P>
	   Average hourly earnings, a key gauge of inflation pressures, rose a slightly
higher-than-expected 0.4 percent to $13.50 in January, the fastest pace since
September.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial services stocks, which are most sensitive to inflation and
interest rates, faltered. J.P. Morgan fell 3 5/8 to 119 1/8, contributing most
to the Dow's loss.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, analysts said investors apparently have faith that the Federal
Reserve is in control of inflation. The central bank on Wednesday increased
rates for the fourth time since June, and indicated more increases may be on the
way.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the steady hand by the Fed is helping fuel the rally," said Barry
Berman, head trader for Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
	   Vodafone Airtouch AG was an exception to the strength in technology shares,
falling 3 15/16 to 57 13/16 after the company sweetened its bid for German
wireless company Mannesmann AG. Mannesmann shareholders will vote by Feb. 17 on
whether to accept Vodafone's offer, now valued at $180 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Mattel shares fell  1/8 to 10 3/4 on the New York Stock Exchange a day after
Chief Executive Officer Jill Barad resigned. The toymaker reported a steep loss
for the fourth quarter, disappointing Wall Street analysts for the third time in
the past four quarters.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange. On the Nasdaq, 10 stocks rose for every nine that fell.

<P>
	   NYSE composite volume totaled 1.28 billion shares, compared with 1.35
billion in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Investors Look To Save Ben &AMP; Jerry's  </HEADLINE>
    By ROSS SNEYD AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) -- A group of "socially conscious" investors is banding
together in an effort to save one of its own, the quirky ice cream manufacturer
famous for such flavors as Bovinity Divinity and Phish Food.
</P>
<P>
	   In the face of a takeover bid by more traditional companies, some of Ben &AMP;
Jerry's socially responsible brethren don't want to lose what many of them
consider their patron saint, the independent ice cream company that over the
years carved out its place in the business world by being known as much for its
social consciousness as the taste of its product.
</P>
<P>
	   News of a potential rival to Unilever NV, an Anglo-Dutch food conglomerate,
and Dreyer's Grand Ice Cream Inc. -- both of whom have reportedly been pursuing
Ben &AMP; Jerry's -- helped boost Ben &AMP; Jerry's stock price up nearly 7 percent, or
$1.50, to $24 at 4 p.m. on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   The Oakland, Calif.-based Dreyer's issued a statement Friday saying it would
not court Ben &AMP; Jerry's -- or any other company -- without being welcomed,
though it did not confirm it was actively trying to take over the Vermont-based
company.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides confirming that they're working on a deal, though, the group of Ben
&AMP; Jerry's investors is keeping quiet.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're in the middle of forming an offer and we're all sworn to hold this in
confidence," said Judith Wicks, owner of the White Dog Cafe in Philadelphia and
a prominent member of the Social Venture Network, a San Francisco "socially
responsible" investment group.
</P>
<P>
	   Ben &AMP; Jerry's, too, has been pretty quiet since it first announced in
December that companies it did not identify were interested in taking it over.
On Friday, it merely confirmed that there had been interest by the socially
responsible group, but said it had not yet received an offer and would not
comment further.
</P>
<P>
	   Ben Cohen, the ex-hippie who co-founded the company with boyhood friend
Jerry Greenfield, told The Wall Street Journal in Friday's editions there was
logic behind a socially responsible group trying to keep his company
independent.
</P>
<P>
	   "Quirky brands don't usually do well as part of large conglomerates," Cohen
said. "I'm delighted there's an investor group trying to find a way to keep the
company independent." He stressed, however, that he isn't part of the investor
group.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the group pursuing Ben &AMP; Jerry's, many of whom are members of the
Social Venture Network, said it was uncharacteristic for them to refuse comment.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're hoping in the near future to make specific statements to the press,
in part in keeping with Ben &AMP; Jerry's philosophy of keeping all stakeholders
informed," said Robert E. Barton, chief executive of Catalyst Financial Group
Inc., a Brookfield, Vt., investment banker that focuses on environmental
companies. "I think it's frustrating."
</P>
<P>
	   But, he added, they're willing to play by the rules of publicly traded
companies because they're committed to ensuring the independence of the
freewheeling ice cream maker known as much for its devotion to social causes as
it is for its funky flavors and its bottom line.
</P>
<P>
	   These companies are more interested in a company's stakeholders than its
stockholders. To their way of thinking, stakeholders include not only those who
hold stock in a company, but also the employees, suppliers, residents of the
communities in which it does business, customers and even lenders.
</P>
<P>
	   Ben &AMP; Jerry's has been a pioneer in making sure that it treats those kind of
stakeholders as fairly as it does its stockholders. For example, it pays dairy
farmers a premium for milk to guarantee it comes from small family farms. It
buys coffee beans from organic growers.
</P>
<P>
	   "A lot of people see Ben &AMP; Jerry's as one of the models for addressing
really tough issues," Barton said.
</P>
<P>
	   That philosophy might be threatened, though, if it were taken over by a more
traditional company that is focused on its quarterly profit-and-loss statements,
he added.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you and I think Ben &AMP; Jerry's has sold out and we're disillusioned, then
are we going to continue to be loyal to them or are we going to buy from the
next little micro ice cream company?" Barton said. "I would probably go to the
next micro ice cream company."

<HEADLINE> Vodafone-Mannesmann Deal Biggest Yet  </HEADLINE>
    By HANS GREIMEL AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- With Vodafone AirTouch paying a record $180
billion to acquire Germany's Mannesmann AG, wireless communications have taken
center stage in two of the three biggest mergers in history.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, although Mannesmann squeezed nearly twice as much money from
Vodafone as the British company first proposed -- and 50 percent more than MCI
WorldCom is paying for Sprint and its valuable wireless unit -- analysts say the
price is right for a deal that will place Vodafone at the pinnacle of a mobile
communications revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, the supervisory board at Mannesmann recommended that the
company's shareholders approve the deal, the product of a 2 1/2-month takeover
battle that was unusally hard-fought by European standards.
</P>
<P>
	   The merger will form a global force in wireless communications with 42
million customers worldwide. The company will have a substantial U.S. presence
through a new alliance between its AirTouch unit and Bell Atlantic's mobile
operations, but the new Vodafone's true stronghold will be Europe, with 29
million customers and a No. 1 or No. 2 market position in 11 countries on the
continent.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, since Europe is the most advanced market in terms of mobile phone
use, the new company may hold considerable sway in forging a global standard for
the robust wireless technologies that will be deployed in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
	   With a single format, mobile callers would be able to use the same phone
wherever they travel, opening the door to explosive growth, especially for
companies with an early start and a wide reach.
</P>
<P>
	   Right now, mobile phone systems around the world are largely incompatible
with each other. Europe uses GSM, a technology that plays third fiddle in the
United States to the CDMA system championed by Sprint PCS, and the TDMA format
used by AT&AMP;T and SBC Communications.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of the disparity, when mobile callers leave town, cross state lines
or go overseas, it's not always guaranteed they can make a call on their
wireless phones. Matters are further complicated in the United States when
callers roam from place to place, encountering mobile networks that use older
"analog" signals or digital "PCS" technology.
</P>
<P>
	   But a mobile phone provider with truly global coverage would likely sport an
advantage with customers, especially those who travel a lot, by providing
uninterrupted service wherever they go.
</P>
<P>
	   That's why the high-priced deal "was definitely worth it," said Kevin M.
Roe, an industry analyst with ABN Amro in New York. In fact, he said, "It was a
must-do transaction."
</P>
<P>
	   Big mobile players can also expect to prosper as wireless phones meld with
palmtop computers, providing services such as video conferencing or making
payments at vending machines and cash registers. Actually, experts say mobile
phones are likely to surpass personal computers as the most popular way of
surfing the Web.
</P>
<P>
	   For all those reasons, the Vodafone deal is expected to trigger more telecom
mergers as companies rush to grab bigger shares of the mobile market and shift
away from the traditional focus on a single technology such as wireless,
fixed-line or Internet service.
</P>
<P>
	   "What we're going to see is just a few companies competing on the basis of
one-stop shopping," said M.S. Krishnan, a professor of information systems at
the University of Michigan business school. "The Internet is no longer separated
from media and telecom companies. There could soon be only four or five players
worldwide."
</P>
<P>
	   Vodafone chief executive Chris Gent said Friday in a conference call that
his company was already eyeing another target. This time it was Airtel, Spain's
fastest-growing cellular company.
</P>
<P>
	   "As to other alliances, we'll have to wait and see who comes to us with
ideas," he said. "I can tell you that my diary is already becoming filled with
appointments to talk about cooperation."
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, both companies lost ground on the stock market Friday. Mannesmann
closed down 1 percent in Germany, while Vodafone dropped 6 percent in London.

<HEADLINE> FCC Rejects Digital TV Request  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Communications Commission on Friday rejected
a request from a broadcasting company to consider another standard for digital
TV, saying it would slow the rollout of the new service.
</P>
<P>
	   Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc. had petitioned the FCC to allow broadcasters
to transmit digital TV using a different standard than the one the commission
had adopted. The company argued that the existing standard failed to provide
acceptable over-the-air reception using simple consumer antennas. It conducted a
number of tests in markets to support this assertion.
</P>
<P>
	   But the FCC determined that Sinclair had not presented enough evidence to
warrant re-opening the standard -- and doing so would slow the introduction of
digital TV and make the public less willing to embrace the new technology.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Contrary to Sinclair's claims, we believe that granting its request would
lead to a significant delay in the implementation and provision of (digital) TV
services to the public,'' the commission wrote in its letter.
</P>
<P>
	   The FCC reiterated that it had chosen one single standard so that
broadcasters, equipment manufacturers and consumers would have certainty about
the service. More than one standard could increase the risk that digital TV
equipment purchased in one place might not work in another or after the course
of a few years.
</P>
<P>
	   The Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association had opposed Sinclair's
efforts as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Mark Hyman, vice president of corporate relations for Sinclair, said it
would not make a statement until it had reviewed the FCC's decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Addressing Sinclair's conclusions about reception using the original digital
TV standard, the FCC said that the company had merely demonstrated the
shortcomings of early receiver models rather than a basic flaw.
</P>
<P>
	   But the FCC added that it had already planned to conduct a mandated review
of the digital TV transition in the two months and would take comments from
parties on the standards.

<HEADLINE> Oneidas fight city trying to foreclose on property  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SHERRILL, N.Y. (AP) - The Oneida Indian Nation is going to court to try
to keep a central New York city from foreclosing on what the tribe said is the
land of its ancestors.
<P>
	   The Indians announced late Friday that they filed a suit in federal court to
protect two parcels along Route 5. The Oneidas operate a convenience store, gas
station and clothing design business on the property a few miles from the
tribe's Turning Stone Casino.
</P>
<P>
	   The city, located about 30 miles east of Syracuse, is a target in a huge
land claim suit brought by the tribe. The city has tried to tax and foreclose on
the properties, according to the tribe. But Oneida officials contend the land is
their sovereign property and guaranteed by a 1794 treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   Sovereign Indian land, like reservations but not necessarily private land
purchased by tribes, are separate of the municipalities in which they are
geographically located. Sovereign lands aren't subject to taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   Sherrill Mayor Dwight Evans said the city began to tax the property
purchased by the tribe more than two years ago. He said further comment will be
made within the lawsuit. Attorneys for the city couldn't be reached for comment
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Oneidas, with the support of the U.S. Justice Department, are seeking
hundreds of millions of dollars for the loss of 250,000 acres of ancestral land
in Oneida and Madison counties. The U.S. Supreme Court found in 1985 that the
land was seized in questionable transactions with the state and private
individuals and ruled the Oneidas are entitled to compensation.
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiations continue.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A major journalism organization has condemned the Russian
military for its arrest of a radio correspondent in the breakaway province of
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   The World Press Freedom Committee, which represents 44 news organizations on
six continents, accused Russian authorities of exerting a ``high -- and
unacceptable -- level of control over journalistic reporting of events'' in
Chechnya. Many journalists working from Chechnya complain of Russian
restrictions and intimidation on their reporting.
</P>
<P>
	   In its statement dated Thursday, the group specifically criticized the
recent detention of Russian journalist Andrei Babitsky and demanded that Moscow
restore his freedom and investigate circumstances of his imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
	   Babitsky, a reporter for Radio Liberty, is known for reports from the region
that often contradicts official government statements. Russian forces accused
him of assisting Chechen rebels and took him into custody in mid-January; the
formal charge was lacking government permission to work in the war zone.
</P>
<P>
	   This week, the Russian government said Babitsky was transferred to Chechen
fighters in exchange for ``two or three'' captured Russian soldiers. There has
been no independent confirmation.
</P>
<P>
	   Babitsky's wife, Lyudmila Babitskaya, has not heard from her husband since
his arrest and has said that she does not believe he is still alive.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Grandma's Account Stuns Family  </HEADLINE>
   By MEG RICHARDS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives are outraged over his Cuban
grandmother's account of how she playfully bit the 6-year-old boy's tongue and
unzipped his pants during their long-awaited reunion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The family is shocked and disturbed,'' Armando Gutierrez, spokesman for
the Miami relatives, said Friday. ``That is not a Cuban custom.''
</P>
<P>
	   Through Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., Elian's Florida relatives requested a
meeting with Attorney General Janet Reno next week to discuss unspecified new
information about the case, Justice spokesman Carole Florman said. The request
was being considered.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview on Cuban television Tuesday, Elian's paternal grandmother,
Mariela Quintana, said she had ``played jokes'' with the boy during a U.S.
government-ordered meeting Jan. 26 at the home of a Roman Catholic nun in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   Quintana said the boy was ``reserved'' at the start of the meeting, so she
joked that he might have lost his tongue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I took his tongue out of his mouth,'' she said, gesturing with her hand as
if she was pulling her own tongue from her mouth. ``I bit it.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I even opened up his zipper,'' she said, making an unzipping gesture. ``I
told him, `Let me see, let me see ... if it has grown.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Meeting host Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin and Sister Lenore Esnard, who also was
in the house during the meeting, were unaware of the exchange until Quintana's
remarks were broadcast on Miami television, said Barry University spokeswoman
Michele Morris. O'Laughlin is president of the school.
</P>
<P>
	   In Cuba, few people found anything strange about Quintana's behavior, but
the spokeswoman for the Spanish-language Telemundo affiliate in Miami said the
station was flooded with calls from outraged viewers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everyone we have talked to, everyone who saw the tape, thought this was
inappropriate behavior for grandmothers,'' said Maria Lewis, managing editor at
Telemundo's WSCV-TV.
</P>
<P>
	   Uva de Aragon, assistant director of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida
International University, said Quintana's behavior might seem odd to people in
the United States, but it was probably innocent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The way the woman said it on national television shows it wasn't something
perverted,'' de Aragon said. ``She was joking with a little kid, trying to get
him to respond, the same as if she were tickling him or trying to see his
muscles.''
</P>
<P>
	   She said that most Hispanic cultures have a different concept of personal
space and that the Cuban culture traditionally has been very male-oriented.
Fathers, particularly in lower classes, often boast about the size of their
sons' genitals, associating that with bravery and virility.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was rescued on Thanksgiving after clinging to an inner tube for two
days following a shipwreck that killed his mother. The first-grader has been
living in Miami with his great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez, and his U.S. relatives
hope to keep him despite an immigration order to send him back.
</P>
<P>
	   His father back in Cuba, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, is pressing for his return.
He wrote Reno on Thursday asking her to move the boy to the home of another
Miami relative who is more sympathetic to his wishes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am deeply concerned and anguished over the present condition of my
6-year-old son, Elian Gonzalez, unfairly and cruelly separated from our family
for over two months,'' he said in a letter released to foreign news agencies by
the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
	   Florman said the Justice Department was reviewing the letter.

<HEADLINE> Symphony Based on D.C. Monuments  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lots of things get written about this capital -- some of
them not so melodious -- but now it's getting its own symphony by a composer who
won popularity setting music to Dr. Seuss' famous children's stories.
</P>
<P>
	   "DC Citypiece" by Robert Kapilow will have its first full performance by the
National Symphony Orchestra on June 29. On Saturday, he was scheduled to play a
series of what he calls "sketches" from the work at a free performance on the
Kennedy Center's "Millennium Stage."
</P>
<P>
	   With him will be 16-year-old rapper poet Donell Washington, a percussionist
and members of a Washington chorus.
</P>
<P>
	   A former director of the Yale Symphony Orchestra and assistant professor at
the university, Kapilow wrote his first opera, "Many Moons," in 1996, based on a
story by humorist James Thurber.
</P>
<P>
	   He got his first commission five years ago to write music for Dr. Seuss'
"Green Eggs and Ham." He has since done scores for the same author's "Gertrude
McFuzz' and other children's works.
</P>
<P>
	   "DC Citypiece" is inspired by the monuments of the capital and is part of a
yearlong project celebrating the new millennium that was sponsored by the
Kreeger Museum, which devoted to 19th and 20th century art.
</P>
<P>
	   Kapilow, 47, held 13 meetings in Washington communities, asking adults and
children questions like:
</P>
<P>
	   --What do you think a monument is?
</P>
<P>
	   --Why do we need monuments?
</P>
<P>
	   --Could a person in your community be a monument?
</P>
<P>
	   Organizers of the project said he used their ideas as inspiration for his
music.

    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A former swimming pool contractor suspected of
cheating dozens of investors around the nation admitted Friday that he swindled
the inventor of the Big Bertha golf club out of $2.5 million.
<P>
	   William H. Koop has also agreed to cooperate with authorities here and in
South Carolina investigating bogus "prime bank note" investments he promoted
with two men in Britain and two men in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Koop, 73, told U.S. District Judge Katharine S. Hayden that he did not know
at the beginning of the scam that his actions were illegal. He acknowledged,
however, that after learning of the fraud he continued to assure at least one
victim, club inventor Glenn Schmidt, he would get his money back, along with the
promised $16 million profit.
</P>
<P>
	   Schmidt, of Rancho Santa Fe, Calif., had been told in early 1998 by Koop
that the windfall would take just 45 banking days, court papers said.
</P>
<P>
	   Schmidt is among investors around the nation who have sued Koop, and they
are not buying his story this time.
</P>
<P>
	   "Basically, he's just a flat-out liar," said Linda K. Baessler, a
businesswoman in Sterling, Colo., who claims Koop took her for about $100,000,
including $60,000 in unreimbursed credit card charges.
</P>
<P>
	   She met him in August 1997, and introduced him to over 100 others, in
California, Florida, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas, who invested about
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
	   "He seemed to be a very knowledgeable person. He seemed like he had
credentials that were very upstanding: on the board of AT&AMP;T, was a former
football player, raced speedboats," Baessler said. "In the long run, he turned
out to be a rat, a scam artist."
</P>
<P>
	   Koop, of Franklin Lakes in Bergen County, never served on the AT&AMP;T board,
played in the NFL or raced speedboats, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   His lawyer, Stephen A. Geffner, maintained Koop is also a victim of the
investment scheme.
</P>
<P>
	   "He was duped himself and also suffered substantial losses," Geffner said
outside court. "The bottom line is he doesn't have a dime. I had to give him
money last week to eat."
</P>
<P>
	   Koop began cooperating with authorities when federal agents approached him
about six months ago, Geffner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Koop faces up to five years in prison and a fine of up to twice his
proceeds, as well as an order of restitution. His sentencing, scheduled for
April 28, is likely to be postponed because of the continuing investigation. He
remains free on $50,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
	   Under his plea agreement with federal prosecutors in New Jersey and South
Carolina, Koop could get a reduced sentence if authorities certify he provided
"substantial cooperation."
</P>
<P>
	   Yet questions about his honesty remain: The deal can be scrapped if South
Carolina U.S. Attorney J. Rene Josey is dissatisfied with the results of a
lie-detector examination he may decide to impose to determine Koop's assets.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuits against Koop include one from six South Carolina investors who
claim Koop and the Rev. Johnny William "Bill" Cabe of HisWay International
Ministries in South Carolina, cheated them of at least $390,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Cabe, who helps operate HisWay from his home in York, S.C., filed an
anti-racketeering lawsuit against federal officials last year after they seized
$1.7 million from five ministry accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   Cabe has not been charged, but Koop's lawyer said his client will testify
about Cabe.
</P>
<P>
	   Told of Koop's plea bargain, Cabe said, "It comes as news to me that the
federal government would be cooperating with the biggest crook in New Jersey."
</P>
<P>
	   Cabe said his ministry gave Koop $4 million and instead of the promised
"huge" return, has seen nothing.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've been violated by the crook, and we've been violated by the
government," Cabe said, saying the seizure of $1.7 million ran afoul of the
constitutional separation of church and state.
</P>
<P>
	   Koop named as coconspirators two men in Britain, Winston Allen and Terrence
Wingrove, and two in the United States, Glenn Cruzen and Richard Olit.
</P>
<P>
	   He said they dealt in "prime bank notes," and promised huge returns in short
periods through complex overseas bank transactions.
</P>
<P>
	   Such investment vehicles are "entirely fictitious," said Assistant U.S.
Attorney Henry E. Klingeman, who is prosecuting the case. No one besides Koop
has been charged, but the investigation is continuing, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cruzen, of Boerne, Texas, said he testified before a federal grand jury here
in the Koop case, but declined to comment further. No listings or towns were
immediately available for Olitt, Allen and Wingate.

<HEADLINE> Pa. Jails Choose 'Wholesome' TV  </HEADLINE>
    By GEORGE STRAWLEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- The state's prison inmates will be switching off
premium channels like HBO and tuning in to a satellite-television service that
emphasizes more wholesome fare.
</P>
<P>
	   That means goodbye to "The Sopranos" and documentaries on strippers and
hello to "The Waltons" and the Recovery Network.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nobody had the Playboy Channel, but some of the stuff on these premium
channels can be pretty suggestive," Corrections Secretary Martin F. Horn said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The new statewide service gives the 14,900 inmates at the state's 24 prisons
who subscribe to cable a one-size-fits-all package similar to a typical basic
cable setup.
</P>
<P>
	   Inmates will pay $15.25 a month for 38 channels, replacing deals negotiated
between individual prisons and cable providers.
</P>
<P>
	   Prison officials had considered eliminating cable service entirely from the
prison system, but decided to make a switch in line with the department's
philosophy of "sobriety, education and work," Horn said.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal being worked out includes three channels of ESPN sports
programming, all the major broadcast networks and cable networks like Discovery
Channel and CNN, as well as minority-themed programming.
</P>
<P>
	   The Corrections Department also gets two institutional channels over which
it plans to beam instructional programming.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials plan to have eight of the institutions online by May. Other
prisons will be included in the system as current cable contracts expire.
</P>
<P>
	   Word of the change has slipped out to inmates mostly by word of mouth, said
William DiMascio, executive director of the Pennsylvania Prison Society, an
organization that assists prisoners and their families.
</P>
<P>
	   As for the loss of premium channels, "I can't get myself too exercised about
that," he said.

<HEADLINE> Efforts Vs. Fruit Disease Stepped Up  </HEADLINE>
    By KARIN MEADOWS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- About 50 inspectors will be hired to check
thousands of acres of citrus north of Miami for citrus canker, the disease
already ravaging thousands of fruit trees to the south.
</P>
<P>
	   There's been no trace of the bacteria in the Indian River agricultural
district, but grapefruit is king here and growers are nervous, said Mike
Shannon, U.S. Department of Agriculture plant inspector.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's great concern and there should be," Shannon said Friday. "But this
isn't about controlling citrus canker. It's about providing a program to detect
it -- should it show up -- so we can get it out of there in a timely manner."
</P>
<P>
	   The additional inspections of commercial and residential groves should begin
within the next couple of weeks, said Richard Gaskalla, director of the plant
industry division of the Florida Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
	   Gaskalla called the hiring of more inspectors a precautionary measure
following the destruction of thousands of lime trees in south Miami-Dade County
commercial groves after canker was detected there Jan. 5. Growers there already
have lost more than half of the fruits of their $20 million a year industry.
</P>
<P>
	   The contagious plant disease causes unsightly lesions that make the fruit
drop prematurely, but is not harmful to humans. Canker can be spread numerous
ways -- by human hands, machinery, wind and rain.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida ranks No. 1 in grapefruit production, selling an estimated $173
million worth a year, according to the Florida Agricultural Statistics Service.
Most Florida grapefruit comes from St. Lucie, Indian River and Martin counties
and the inland counties to the west.

<HEADLINE> 1965 Dylan Film Coming to DVD  </HEADLINE>
    By LARRY McSHANE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- D.A. Pennebaker still remembers the look on young Bob
Dylan's face. The 26-year-old singer was watching himself in Pennebaker's
soon-to-be released documentary, "Don't Look Back."
</P>
<P>
	   Dylan appeared ... well, stunned is a good word.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the first time he saw it, he went into shock," Pennebaker recalls,
laughing slightly. "He had no idea that one camera sitting on one guy's shoulder
could make him feel so naked."
</P>
<P>
	   The chastened Dylan returned a night later, watched it again, then gave his
OK to Pennebaker's film. Now, three decades later, the director's chronicle of
Dylan's three-week 1965 British tour returns this month in an enhanced DVD
version released by New Video.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've always admired Dylan for letting (the film) go the way it was,"
Pennebaker says. "That was something a lot of lesser talents -- and a lot of
greater talents -- would have had trouble doing."
</P>
<P>
	   Pennebaker's critically acclaimed documentary, released in 1967, stands the
test of time -- although its creator once felt the 96-minute film would never
see a theatrical release.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the kindness of several West Coast pornographic theaters that changed
that, he says -- in particular, The Presidio in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   "This group of Western theaters was showing porno, and they wanted to
upgrade their act," the self-deprecating Pennebaker recalls. "It was perfect for
me, because my movie looked like porno, but it's not."
</P>
<P>
	   Pennebaker, who earned an Academy Award nomination for his look at the
Clinton presidential campaign in "The War Room," is quick to poke fun at
himself. Talking about his acclaimed black and white Dylan piece, he describes
it as "a very ratty-looking film."
</P>
<P>
	   Critics disagreed.
</P>
<P>
	   "A portrait of the young Dylan tearing the pop world apart," a San Francisco
Examiner reviewer enthused in a typical rave.
</P>
<P>
	   Pennebaker, an Illinois native, earned a degree in mechanical engineering at
Yale University before going into filmmaking. Using his college skills, he
developed a portable camera that allowed filmmakers full access -- one of the
keys to the cinema verite style that he helped define.
</P>
<P>
	   According to Pennebaker, the movie wasn't his idea, and it wasn't Dylan's
either. The credit belongs to Dylan's late manager, Albert Grossman.
</P>
<P>
	   "I probably couldn't have convinced Dylan myself," Pennebaker says. "He was
mercurial. It would be hard to convince him of anything for three hours in a
row. But Albert Grossman asked me if I wanted to do a film with one of his
clients."
</P>
<P>
	   Pennebaker knew little about his subject, who wore his hair long, his
sunglasses dark and his attitude on his sleeve: "I didn't have much of a take on
him. I knew who he was, probably heard a couple of his songs. To hear him sing
the first time, he wasn't Rudy Vallee. I was less than swept away."
</P>
<P>
	   That soon changed.
</P>
<P>
	   Pennebaker, watching through his lens, saw "an amazing prodigy. Very smart
in an untutored way. He created his own persona right before your eyes. ... He
was a compendium of things it takes professors years to figure out --
startlingly naive, but smart."
</P>
<P>
	   The 74-year-old Pennebaker acknowledges that he had 40 to 50 extra hours of
footage from the Dylan sessions, and that the idea of recutting his movie
flashed through his brain.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought about it," he says. "I thought, 'This is a chance to make a new
film.' Then I thought, 'Why a new film? What would that get us?' ... It would be
interesting to people who'll take any Dylan you can give them, but not to a
major audience."
</P>
<P>
	   The extra footage, along with outtakes and originals of all Pennebaker's
work, such as "Monterey Pop" and "The War Room," now sits in the Museum of
Modern Art's archives.
</P>
<P>
	   The film's title appears in a line from Dylan's song, "She Belongs to Me":
"She's an artist, she don't look back."
</P>
<P>
	   Yet Pennebaker says the credit for his title actually goes to Negro Leagues
star and Hall of Famer Satchel Paige, who once advised, "Don't look back. It
might be gaining on you."
</P>
<P>
	   Pennebaker offers his own tip on staying a step or two ahead of the
audience: "The one barometer I believe in is boredom. The minute people start to
lose interest, that's it."
</P>
<P>
	   That explains the tight running time of "Don't Look Back": It's barely an
hour and a half.
</P>
<P>
	   The DVD comes with a bonus -- five never-before-released Dylan audio
performances and a previously unreleased version of the landmark cue-card
flipping bit for "Subterranean Homesick Blues."
</P>
<P>
	   Pennebaker's grainy video for the Dylan tune turned out to be about 20 years
ahead of its time, presaging MTV and VH1. So when he flips past the video music
channels today ...
</P>
<P>
	   "I think, 'Without me, they'd be bankrupt,"' he says, laughing loudly. "I'm
sure the check is in the mail."

<HEADLINE> Ally Sheedy: Unpacking Brat Pack  </HEADLINE>
    By MARK KENNEDY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Before things went sour, Ally Sheedy was living in a
dominatrix's paradise.
</P>
<P>
	   Her dressing room was stacked with studded belts and funky fishnets. There
were leather bustiers, each adorned with chains. There were 2-inch eyelashes
that looked like fuzzy tarantulas.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's nothing," Sheedy insisted. "You have to see the wigs!"
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, they were glorious -- a half-dozen mops of cascading, bottle-blond
hair, each more pouffy and outrageous than the next.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheedy loved showing off this stuff, bounding from one end of the
off-off-Broadway theater to another, with all the glee of a 6-year-old tearing
through Toys R Us.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is what I'm suited for, this is what's interesting," the former Brat
Pack sweetie said late last year before slipping into her costume and
transforming herself into ... a German male transsexual rock singer.
</P>
<P>
	   "For me right now, it's a question of finding roles that are challenging --
sexually, emotionally, in every way," she said. "Just not cookie-cutter."
</P>
<P>
	   Her lead role in "Hedwig and the Angry Inch" was indeed a challenge -- but
the stage run didn't last. Around Christmas, an exhausted Sheedy abruptly pulled
out of the show. Her publicist, Reid Rosefelt, said the actress wouldn't
comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Tom D'Ambrosio, a spokesman for "Hedwig," said the show's producers also
wouldn't discuss the situation, other than to say that Sheedy asked for, and was
granted, permission to leave early.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheedy's run might have been cut short, but she nevertheless made her point:
The actress is back in business after more than a decade of living with
irrelevance.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was a whole period of time when I just could not get seen for a job,"
she said in an interview before leaving the show. "The Brat Pack label stuck for
a long time and I just felt there was a very dismissive attitude of, 'Oh, no.
She can't. Not her."'
</P>
<P>
	   Now a slew of edgy, indie roles -- not to mention her brief gender-bending
theatrical role -- have brought renewed attention to the star of "The Breakfast
Club."
</P>
<P>
	   And something else has arrived: respect.
</P>
<P>
	   "She's one of the most extraordinary, dedicated, hardworking, brave
performers that I've ever encountered," said Stephen Trask, composer and
co-creator of "Hedwig."
</P>
<P>
	   "To do something this difficult -- in a stage performance which is not even
her medium, in a role that few thought could work with a woman playing it, at a
time when her career was probably fragile -- seemed to me a high-wire act."
</P>
<P>
	   Sheedy laughs it off: After all the doors slammed in her face, after
battling addiction to sleeping pills, after being dropped by her agent, well,
she simply had nothing more to lose.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was losing faith that I would be able to do the kind of things that I
wanted to do, that I could be the kind of actor I wanted to be. I felt that that
was out of my reach," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Everything seemed in reach for Alexandra Elizabeth Sheedy as a child growing
up in New York City. At age 6, she appeared with the American Ballet Theater at
Lincoln Center. Six years later, she published a best-selling children's book,
"She Was Nice to Mice."
</P>
<P>
	   Arriving at the University of Southern California at the dawn of the 1980s,
Sheedy did commercials and then co-starred in a string of now-classic teen hits:
"WarGames," as Matthew Broderick's cutie; "The Breakfast Club" as a misfit who's
really a princess; and "St. Elmo's Fire," in which she was a wholesome dumpling.
</P>
<P>
	   Her twitchy on-screen demeanor and whippet-thin figure gave her a special
allure. People still approach her and shake dandruff from their hair, a homage
to her offbeat character in "The Breakfast Club."
</P>
<P>
	   But she was quickly lumped into the teen explosion in film, an explosion
that also was making stars of, among others, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald, Andrew
McCarthy, Rob Lowe and Demi Moore.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheedy, though, was uneasy: "To me there's a chasm between someone who said,
'I really want to be an actor,' ... and somebody who said, 'I want celebrity."'
</P>
<P>
	   One day, at a political gathering, the young starlet sought the advice of an
old Hollywood pro and a woman she greatly admired -- Jane Fonda.
</P>
<P>
	   "She said to me, 'You're a character actress. You are not going to figure
that out just playing the golden girl roles. You're really going to have to find
your own way.'
</P>
<P>
	   "She was the first person who ever told me that. I was 21 or 22," Sheedy
said. "It kind of put into words this feeling that I'd had for a long time from
someone I really respected."
</P>
<P>
	   The advice was too late. By the mid-1980s, the bottom was falling out of the
teen market. Sheedy's "Short Circuit," which paired her with Steve Guttenberg
and a robot, fizzled. The final nail came when a cover story in New York
magazine christened the new gang of young actors a punishing label: They were
now The Brat Pack.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was in complete shock when that Brat Pack thing came out," she said. "I
was extremely naive on some of those interviews -- and actually came off as a
little bit stupid. I didn't see it coming."
</P>
<P>
	   She should have. After all, Sheedy grew up in a savvy family: Her mother,
Charlotte Sheedy, is a book agent and her father, John, is a marketing
director-turned-consultant.
</P>
<P>
	   "I grew up surrounded by a lot of people who were very political, a lot of
writers, a lot of intellectuals," she said. "I didn't think my answers were
going to be twisted into some kind of way. The writers that I grew up around
were of a different ilk."
</P>
<P>
	   Sheedy's first true starring role -- as a bratty heiress turned into a maid
in 1987's "Maid to Order" -- soon bombed. Hollywood balked. Sheedy was left to
wander cinema's wasteland, doing more than a decade's diet of TV movies,
uncredited voice-overs and cameos.
</P>
<P>
	   To get back in the industry's good graces, she was told she had to change
her look. That included, she was informed, straightening her teeth, changing her
hair, lowering her voice, smoothing her complexion and boosting her breasts.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's Hollywood," she said. "I don't think that many people would talk
about it because they want to come off as they were perfect to begin with, but I
was absolutely bald-faced, point-blank told to change practically every single
inch of myself."
</P>
<P>
	   She refused.
</P>
<P>
	   Well, actually, desperation forced her to experiment.
</P>
<P>
	   "I tried for a little while to do the makeup," Sheedy said sadly. "I went to
this wonderful, sweet man. He showed me, 'OK, they want you to look glamorous.
Here's what you need to do.' And he put this stuff on my face and tried to show
me how to do it and I practiced at home.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was just so ridiculous! They weren't just looking for someone with
makeup on looking a certain way. They were looking for some sort of persona,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the nature of how the business works with women," said Allison Anders,
who directed and befriended Sheedy during the making of 1999's "Sugar Town," a
black comedy about has-beens in the music business.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you become a star, it's when you're young and desirable and 18 to 25. At
the same time, they're willing to not only throw you away, but they're also not
willing to give you respect. It's a real mess for girls."
</P>
<P>
	   Sheedy struggled on. She battled an addiction to Halcion and bouts of
bulimia. She waited in lines for auditions. She moved back to New York, married
and had a daughter, Rebecca.
</P>
<P>
	   Rock bottom came when her agent at William Morris dropped her.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everything is perception -- how people see you, unfortunately. It's hard
because what they really need to see is your work and what you're capable of
doing," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm 37 now, and I've gotten out of the ingenue thing. I thank God as I've
gotten older that the way I am inside and the way I am on the outside have
gotten closer together."
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, Rachel Wein, her sister-in-law and herself an agent, passed along a
script that seemed dynamite. Sheedy called all the phone numbers listed on the
cover and wrangled her way into an audition.
</P>
<P>
	   The director, Lisa Cholodenko, was intrigued. She had never heard of Ally
Sheedy, had never even seen "The Breakfast Club" or "St. Elmo's Fire."
</P>
<P>
	   "It was in my favor," Sheedy said, laughing. "She really didn't have an idea
of who I was before I walked in."
</P>
<P>
	   And that's how she got the part of a heroin-addicted lesbian photographer in
"High Art," a film that was cheered at the Sundance Film Festival and won Sheedy
the best actress award of the National Society of Film Critics.
</P>
<P>
	   "As far as my career is concerned, as far as my work is concerned, 'High
Art' is the best thing that ever happened to me," she said. "Suddenly, people
were interested in talking to me who hadn't been interested in talking to me for
years."
</P>
<P>
	   Sheedy is the new darling of the indie world, happily mining a darker career
that turns her former golden girl image on its head.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's the incredible thing: It's that she doesn't mind playing
unsympathetic roles or roles where the character is an idiot," Anders said.
"It's parts that a lot of people wouldn't take on -- they'd be too worried, too
self-conscious."
</P>
<P>
	   But what choice does she have? Like her former Brat Packers, it has been a
taxing 15 years: Andrew McCarthy, Judd Nelson, Anthony Michael Hall and Molly
Ringwald also have struggled to remake themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   Demi Moore, the fastest out of the blocks, initially soared but has since
stumbled; Emilio Estevez has been largely confined to the "Mighty Ducks"
franchise; Robert Downey Jr. has battled drugs; and Rob Lowe only recently
re-emerged from exile after his video romp with a minor.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheedy, though, has few regrets on her life's difficult path.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would do exactly the same thing," she said. "I have a daughter, I'm
married to a man who I love. I'm very happy in my life right now. That's
actually true! I'm not trying to make everything sound wonderful.
</P>
<P>
	   "Whatever brought me to this place is fine. I don't particularly want to go
through the painful episodes, but if that was necessary to get here, then that
was necessary."
</P>
<P>
	   Next on her horizon is publishing another book, written from the perspective
of a dog named Betty who wants to become a Hollywood star. It's targeted for
girls between 11 to 14 because Sheedy said it has a "special message" for them.
</P>
<P>
	   "The dog has learned how to speak and wants to be an actor and does not want
to be pigeonholed into playing these dog parts," she said with a smile.
</P>
<P>
	   "All names have been changed to protect the un-innocent," she joked.
</P>
<P>
	   So what exactly does Betty the dog want to be?
</P>
<P>
	   "She wants to be Jane Fonda," Sheedy said.

<HEADLINE> Drama, Reality Merge in Rwanda Film  </HEADLINE>
    By DIANNA CAHN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KIBUYE, Rwanda (AP) -- The human bones the actor found behind the movie set
were real.
</P>
<P>
	   When he pried the rest of the skeleton from the soft, dark earth with his
hands, his fellow actors cried. Some were Rwandans who may have known the person
who fell under the blade of a machete and whose remains were left to rot in the
weeds.
</P>
<P>
	   Day after day, the makers of "100 Days" faced reminders of horrors they want
the world not to forget.
</P>
<P>
	   "The country is a graveyard," said Nick Hughes, who directed and wrote the
script for the feature-length film, a love story set during the days of madness
in 1994 when Rwanda's Hutu government orchestrated the slaughter of at least
500,000 people, most of them minority Tutsis.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are so many ruined houses, so many bodies," said Hughes, who covered
the bloodbath as a free-lance TV cameraman. Five years later, he returned to
Rwanda as a filmmaker, hoping to show the world what really took place.
</P>
<P>
	   "The international community, the international public, does not realize
what happened in Rwanda," Hughes said in an interview, as three months of
filming drew to an end.
</P>
<P>
	   "What happened in Germany in 1941 to 1945 has been reworked and reworked and
reworked, and every year it is reworked more. The Rwandan genocide is not
reworked. It is slowly dying, apart from the memories of the people who
experienced it and lost everybody."
</P>
<P>
	   The British-born Hughes, 38, wanted a sweeping movie that would draw an
audience not particularly interested in Rwanda. But no one would finance it.
</P>
<P>
	   He peddled his script from Europe to Hollywood, pleading for financing from
independent film companies and broadcasters in Europe and North America.
Holocaust organizations and Stephen Spielberg, maker of the Academy
Award-winning "Schindler's List," did not respond either.
</P>
<P>
	   "One person even suggested I change the script to be one that was based
around Bosnia," Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
	   But that was unthinkable to the filmmaker. Hughes had covered violent events
all over Africa, but none had affected him like the Rwanda genocide.
</P>
<P>
	   For three months, people were chased into maize fields and banana
plantations and hacked down by machete-wielding soldiers bent on ethnic
extermination. The 100-day slaughter was "of a different magnitude, something
incomprehensible."
</P>
<P>
	   Rwandan producer Eric Kabera helped raise $500,000 from Rwandan businessmen
and local hotel owners and entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
	   With another $150,000 of his own money and $750,000 in equipment, time and
personnel from Vivid Features, his Kenya-based media company, Hughes hired a
handful of professional Kenyan actors and a mostly inexperienced Rwandan cast
and crew, and went to western Rwanda to film.
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't difficult to get into character. The effects of the genocide
pervade the tiny, beautiful country in the heart of Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   St. Jean Roman Catholic Church in Kibuye was abandoned after thousands of
Tutsis, sent there by Hutu officials who promised them security, were
slaughtered inside the building.
</P>
<P>
	   Like so many parishes that dot Rwanda's hilltops, the church still bears the
stench of death. It was the perfect setting for many scenes.
</P>
<P>
	   On the first day of filming, the cast and crew reverently entered the
church, and some wept as survivors told their stories, Hughes recalled. Many
quickly fled the church, unable to tolerate the grief.
</P>
<P>
	   But a few weeks into a grueling filming schedule, they were sleeping inside
the church. It was, he said, as if making the movie had exorcised the demons
from the gray stone building.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes, whose videotape of a machete-wielding man hacking a woman pleading
for her life was broadcast all over the world in 1994, based his script on what
he saw and on stories from dozens of survivors.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is not Hollywood coming to Africa," said Steve Parr, who is producing
a one-hour documentary on the filming called "The Making of 100 Days."
</P>
<P>
	   "Actors are actual survivors. Some have physical scars, all have emotional
scars."
</P>
<P>
	   Centered on two young lovers, the film follows their families through the
horrors of being Rwandan Tutsis as the world around them goes mad with the
desire to kill.
</P>
<P>
	   Young Josette's family is murdered in the church, but she is saved by a
priest who later rapes her, and she bears his child.
</P>
<P>
	   As one of the film's characters says: "This is not Rwanda, this is hell."
</P>
<P>
	   As the reality of the genocide unfolded, so does the film.
</P>
<P>
	   It portrays how the killing gains pace, how officials become not just
killers, but master planners of the slaughter, and how priests, through their
actions or simply by silent acquiescence, become willing accomplices.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. peacekeeping forces in Rwanda at the outbreak of the genocide abandon
the victims just days after the nightmare begins. And troops from France, which
had close ties with the Hutu government, help Hutu officials and clergymen
escape while Tutsis are left behind.
</P>
<P>
	   Hughes is seeking another $100,000 to produce the documentary and a final
copy of the film by the end of this month, in time for the international film
festival circuit.
</P>
<P>
	   With a total budget of $1.5 million and no professional distributor to aid
them, Hughes does not expect the film to be a blockbuster. But interest in the
project has picked up since filming was completed in November, and he does hope
the story will resonate enough to keep the memory of the Rwanda genocide alive.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the critics he most values, are the ones whose feedback he will never
hear.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just really hope that the ghosts out there watching us making this film
-- (will know) that we have not let them down," he said.

<HEADLINE> Atypical Art Show Bridges the Gap  </HEADLINE>
    By GEORGE WATSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Tiny red squares of varying shades cover the paper,
creating a mesmerizing mix that looks as if it came straight out of a modern
artist's mind.
</P>
<P>
	   The colors don't amount to anything distinguishable but they call for
attention because their vibrancy seems to beam from the framed artwork hanging
on a wall.
</P>
<P>
	   Another intriguing piece appears to be a photograph of an ancient wall. The
stone structure is now in pieces, seemingly ravaged over time.
</P>
<P>
	   Both are part of "Beyond Appearance: Imagery in Science at the Millennium,"
an unusual exhibit on display at the PaineWebber Art Gallery through March. It
is a show that is intended to bridge the gap between art and science. Both are
also not what they seem to be: the array of red squares is actually a computer
simulated map of the universe, while the picture of the dilapidated wall is a
microscopic photo of ascorbic acid -- better known as vitamin C.
</P>
<P>
	   Actually, none of the exhibit's pieces are what they seem. That's because
they are not really art -- or, at least their creators didn't intend them to be.
</P>
<P>
	   They originated as scientific projects.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is pure science," said curator Lynn Gamwell. "It's artistically
beautiful to look at, but they are all science images."
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the pieces are microscopic photographs of bacteria. Others are of
the human body, and even more are taken from the cosmos.
</P>
<P>
	   Therein lies one of the oddities of the show. Typically, art is interpreted
by the viewer. But in this case, the pieces are based purely on fact -- meaning
there is no leeway when viewing.
</P>
<P>
	   But that's just one of the differences. The show draws a more diverse
audience -- which is exactly what organizers hoped would happen. The standard
gallery visitors are attending, as well as science-lovers who might not normally
visit an art show.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's mind-boggling," said Tony Denisof, who regularly attends openings at
the gallery, as she stared at the photo taken with an electron microscope of the
ascorbic acid. "I know nothing about science, but this is amazing stuff. It's
art and yet I'm learning something."
</P>
<P>
	   But some people apparently struggle to separate the left side of their brain
from the right.
</P>
<P>
	   Galma Jahic said she came specifically to see the exhibit because she enjoys
science.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not art work," she said. "I take it as science. That doesn't mean that
it's not valuable."
</P>
<P>
	   Another obvious difference can be found in the titles of the pieces.
</P>
<P>
	   "Staphylococcus Epidermidis" reads one. "Nucleus-to-Nucleus Head-on
Collision of Gold" states another.
</P>
<P>
	   And, of course, a final difference is the creators are scientists. Suddenly,
these men and women who have dedicated their lives to working behind closed
doors have become artists out in full view of the public.
</P>
<P>
	   "Who could have imagined that -- you know? I mean, come on," asked Dr. Louis
Henderson during the recent opening as he stood before his contribution -- a
diagram depicting the life cycle of HIV. The piece looked like a bright, funky
concoction of bubbles and globules straight from the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
	   Some pieces, such as the photo of a sperm burrowing into an ovum, are
famous, having appeared in Life magazine. Many others, though, are just another
step forward in the march of science.
</P>
<P>
	   Martha Browne, a self-described "gallery-crawler," snickered after looking
at the piece titled Staphylococcus Epidermidis, which is bacteria.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm laughing at that picture because I'll be thinking of it when I take the
subway home," Browne said.

<HEADLINE> Irving and 'Cider House' Odyssey  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUGLAS J. ROWE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- John Irving saw a nearly 14-year odyssey end when his
novel, "The Cider House Rules," hit movie screens.
</P>
<P>
	   There were times he thought it never would become a film, but critics have
said that Irving's screenplay is so "lovingly distilled" from his book that he
could be nominated for an Academy Award come Feb. 15.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of the time he spent going through four directors and numerous
rewrites, however, Irving figures he could have written two more books -- a loss
he acutely feels as he faces his 58th birthday March 2.
</P>
<P>
	   "You don't think about how many books you have left when you're
thirtysomething," he says.
</P>
<P>
	   Irving's new memoir, "My Movie Business," recounts his experiences with
Hollywood and getting "The Cider House Rules" made. He is also finishing his
10th novel.
</P>
<P>
	   The latter, he says, is something of a first for him, a book based on an
idea someone else came up with -- his wife. Not wanting to give away the book,
he relates:
</P>
<P>
	   "We were going to bed and we were watching the news. ... She said, 'Wouldn't
it be amazing if somebody dada-da dada-da dada-da ... .' She kind of did a
what-if thing. ... What if that wasn't the story? What if this was the story?"
</P>
<P>
	   The New England native, who splits his time between southern Vermont and
Toronto, was passing through Manhattan to talk up his new movie and memoir. But
he's glad to be concentrating on what he calls his "day job," as a novelist. As
pleased as he is with how "The Cider House Rules" turned out, he says it isn't
an experience he'd like to repeat.
</P>
<P>
	   He's written the screenplay for his book, "A Son of the Circus," but he has
happily handed over the script adaptation duties to someone else for his 1998
best seller, "A Widow for One Year."
</P>
<P>
	   In "My Movie Business," he tells how he was content not to be involved in
writing the screenplay for "The World According to Garp" and "The Hotel New
Hampshire," his other books that have been adapted into movies.
</P>
<P>
	   But he's never been "emotionally satisfied" by the film versions of his
novels until "The Cider House Rules."
</P>
<P>
	   The film stars Tobey Maguire as a young man who was raised in an orphanage,
leaves home, finds love (with Charlize Theron), then discovers his place in the
world -- back at the orphanage as a doctor. Along the way, he learns about life
and decides for himself the value of the lesson from his mentor and surrogate
father (Michael Caine): that in your life it's most important "to be of use."
</P>
<P>
	   Irving, who had almost total creative control over the film, says novelists
have two choices in getting a book made into a movie:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Put it in the hands of someone you trust and walk away.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Or, be the boss.
</P>
<P>
	   "Be the one who fires somebody else instead of the one who gets fired. Be
the one who says, 'No, it's not working out with this director. Get a new
director! ...
</P>
<P>
	   "Sitting at home at your desk as a novelist, you don't ever get to fire
anybody," he said, laughing. "It never comes up."
</P>
<P>
	   Irving's first choice to direct "Cider House" -- Phillip Borsos, whose
movies included "The Mean Season" -- died. Irving subsequently engaged Wayne
Wang, who directed "The Joy Luck Club" and "Smoke," then Michael Winterbottom,
director of "Welcome to Sarajevo" and "Jude." He parted with Wang amicably and
cashiered Winterbottom not-so-amicably before glomming onto Lasse Hallstrom ("My
Life As a Dog" and "What's Eating Gilbert Grape?")
</P>
<P>
	   Long before Irving could hope to have the autonomy he received for "The
Cider House Rules" movie, his first three books were well-received. Then "Garp,"
published in 1978, became a sensation, and ever since Irving has been one of
those few writers who enjoys both commercial and critical success.
</P>
<P>
	   Every reader seemed to know the story of "Garp," a writer who's a loving
father, a devoted (though not always faithful) husband -- and the son of a
famous mother. She conceived Garp with a brain-dead man while she worked as a
nurse, then became a feminist idol.
</P>
<P>
	   "Garp" soared to the top of the best-seller lists, was nominated for a
National Book Award, became a best seller again when it went into paperback, and
again when the movie starring Robin Williams and Glenn Close came out. T-shirts
across the nation proclaimed: I LOVE GARP!
</P>
<P>
	   Irving, who has two grown sons from his first marriage and another son with
second wife Janet Turnbull, made a cameo in the movie "Garp" as a wrestling
referee. And he appears in "Cider House" as a train stationmaster.
</P>
<P>
	   Irving's eldest son, Colin, has a small role, too, as a military officer who
delivers bad news to Theron. Irving writes in his movie memoir that he had hoped
Colin would play the bigger role of Theron's boyfriend, a handsome World War II
bomber pilot, which Paul Rudd eventually filled. But because the film took so
long to get made, Colin grew too old for the part. Consequently, Irving lost a
lot of his passion for the project.
</P>
<P>
	   Irving says he's never been one of those writers who believed that a novel
was somehow incomplete if a film isn't made of the book, or that a novel is
spoiled if a bad film version is made.
</P>
<P>
	   "A novel is a novel," he says. "People say all the time, 'Well, aren't you
afraid people will see the film and (if) the film is terrible, they'll presume
the novel is terrible?' Well, I say, anybody who sees a film, good or bad, and
presumes the novel is good or bad because of it, that's not an audience for a
book in the first place. That's a movie audience.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't want that person as a reader. I don't need that person as a reader.
I have readers. I don't feel, across the board, proprietary or protectionist
about my novels in that way."
</P>
<P>
	   But Irving is not a writer who easily lets go of his work. His novel, "A
Prayer for Owen Meany," for example, was titled "Simon Birch" when it was made
into a movie because there barely was a passing resemblance to his book.
</P>
<P>
	   He's also never written a novel with an eye toward making it into a film.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've never paused at the writing of something or the reading of something
and said, 'Gee, wouldn't that look good on screen?' I just don't do that."
</P>
<P>
	   One exception he admits to: He saw the end of "The Cider House Rules" when
Maguire's character returns to the orphanage as "a movie moment."
</P>
<P>
	   "It almost came with the music," he says.

<HEADLINE> Reviewing the Latest Music  </HEADLINE>
    By ERIC FIDLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   "Broke Down" (Philo) -- Slaid Cleaves
</P>
<P>
	   Slaid Cleaves' excellent second release for Philo concerns itself mostly
with broken dreams and bent but not quite broken dreamers. If "Broke Down" were
a living room, it would be strewn with empty beer bottles and full ashtrays.
</P>
<P>
	   In lesser hands, this would be the stuff of yet another deep, dark, boring
and depressing singer-songwriter album. But Cleaves is too good a lyricist to
fall into that trap. A band of crack players, led by guitar ace and producer
Gurf Morlix, keeps things happening instrumentally.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the standouts here is "Breakfast in Hell," a story song about an
ill-fated lumberman so convincing it's hard to believe it's an original rather
than a cover of a traditional song.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   "Evolver" (Zoe) -- The Kennedys
</P>
<P>
	   The Kennedys first made a name for themselves as a husband-wife team of
folkies with a bent for jangly, Byrds-style guitar pop. "Evolver" puts the
emphasis on jangly pop, with some looping thrown in. The obvious references here
are the Beatles -- the title is a pun on "Revolver" -- and the Byrds, but Pete
and Maura Kennedy are not wholly derivative, and even if they were, its
do-it-yourself charm, Pete's guitar wizardry and Maura's sweet voice would make
this one worth owning.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   "Aire y Candela" (Alula) -- De Madera
</P>
<P>
	   Rooted in flamenco but traversing a broad swath of Latin styles, the
U.S.-based Latin guitar duo De Madera makes some magical music on "Aire y
Candela." Juan Benavides' solo on the closing "Isabel" alone is worth the price
of the CD, but throughout the disc he and Jaime Ibarra combine expressive,
lyrical solos with deep, textured rhythms.

<HEADLINE> Violinist Isaac Stern Pens Book  </HEADLINE>
    By MARY CAMPBELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Violinist Isaac Stern has played more than 155 concerts at
Carnegie Hall and its stage still holds a mystical attraction for him, more than
any other in the world.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you walk out there and listen in silence, you hear Toscanini,
Horowitz, Heifetz, Bernstein, Anderson, saying, 'Come on kid, try.' They're in
the walls. You walk out and they welcome you."
</P>
<P>
	   The celebrated violinist is credited as being the man who saved Carnegie
Hall from being torn down. In May 1960, when Lincoln Center was being built and
the New York Philharmonic was ready to move there, Carnegie Hall was to be torn
down and replaced by an office building.
</P>
<P>
	   "For me, Carnegie Hall was the Holy Grail, the be-all and end-all of musical
life in this country for all performing artists," the 79-year-old Stern says in
his memoir, "My First 79 Years."
</P>
<P>
	   "I could not see the one building that represented the American tradition of
music internationally be torn down -- I just could not bear the thought of it,"
Stern says in the book. He explains that he didn't know what to do but, after
talking to many people, decided city and state politicians must be convinced
that the hall was necessary, viable and central to the cultural life of New York
City.
</P>
<P>
	   Just before a deadline, the state Legislature passed two bills allowing the
city to buy the hall, which it did for $5 million, then lease it to the Carnegie
Hall Corp. The corporation voted Stern president, which he still is.
</P>
<P>
	   "My First 79 Years" was published by Knopf in October. Chaim Potok did the
writing, based on cassette tapes, telephone conversations and some other notes
from Stern, and Potok has beautifully captured the violinist's voice.
</P>
<P>
	   Stern found that one memory called up other memories as the book progressed.
"Right now I realize how many more things I wanted to say to people. They'll be
in the next book. Maybe I'll only wait 59 years to write the next one. Jews say,
'Live to 120.' Now there's inflation we say to 132."
</P>
<P>
	   The final page of the book recounts Stern's recent difficulty gripping the
bow because of a repetitive strain injury. After he performed at the Miyazaki
Festival in Japan in May, he decided to stop playing.
</P>
<P>
	   When he returned from Japan, Stern went to his doctor to see about what he
thought was arthritis.
</P>
<P>
	   "I told him arthritis had got me to the point I can't control the bow,"
Stern says. "He had a hand surgeon see me. He put electric needles into my arms
to check the nerves. ... He said, 'You're an idiot.' I said, 'Thank you.' He
said, 'You've got carpal tunnel syndrome."'
</P>
<P>
	   Stern's right wrist was operated on in June. He believes the problem started
2 1/2 years ago when he began to modify how he played. "I began to use muscles
differently," he says.
</P>
<P>
	   "Now I'm having a very good time, because going back to playing is fun. I'm
re-examining how I'm using my hands. I'm finding out how to do it better and
more simply. It's a little time-consuming but it's for a good purpose -- being
able to continue playing."
</P>
<P>
	   He played in Beijing Nov. 19 and is booked this month to play chamber music
with Yo-Yo Ma, Emanuel Ax and Jaime Laredo in Los Angeles, San Francisco and at
Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
	   Stern has played with all but a few of the great conductors of his time.
</P>
<P>
	   "With such wonderful musicians we play like we're having an evening of
chamber music," he says.
</P>
<P>
	   "If a lesser conductor obdurately doesn't want to be with you, you can get
caught by the music and close your eyes and turn away and play. There's nothing
he can do. He's got to follow you. You've left him in left field."
</P>
<P>
	   Stern was born in Kreminiecz, Poland, on July 21, 1920. He grew up in San
Francisco and made his New York debut at Town Hall. But for Stern, it was
Carnegie Hall that held the magic.	   Stern's secretary counts his Carnegie
concerts in a book of tributes and photographs he was given in January 1997 when
Carnegie's auditorium was named the Isaac Stern Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
	   He continues to refer to it, though, as "the main auditorium."
</P>
<P>
	   "They want to call it Stern Auditorium, be my guest, but I can't do that,"
says Stern, who felt so humbled by the honor that he didn't open the book of
tributes for nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
	   His eyes sparkle when he turns the subject to a small hall being built
downstairs in space Carnegie once rented to a movie theater. "It'll be the most
advanced and flexible hall in the country, maybe of one or two in the world.
It'll have the latest lighting and sound, connections for TV. We're going to do
extraordinary educational things.
</P>
<P>
	   "Classical music will survive. It exists because human beings need it and
that will continue. How it will be presented will be affected by the quality of
education."
</P>
<P>
	   Stern wants to start educating children 4 and 5, "opening their heads to the
idea classical music exists. It's like language, which kids learn from their
surroundings."

<HEADLINE> Lawyers in SLA Case Resist Testimony  </HEADLINE>
   By LINDA DEUTSCH AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Prosecutors of former fugitive Sara Jane Olson resisted
a defense request Friday to take emergency testimony from a key witness who may
die before Olson goes to trial on bombing conspiracy charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said during a hearing that they had not been provided anything
on what the witness may say and could not prepare for the testimony. But defense
lawyer Susan Jordan accused them of ulterior motives.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a smokescreen,'' she said, ``They want to let this witness die.''
</P>
<P>
	   Friday's hearing came on the anniversary of the Feb. 4, 1974, kidnapping of
Patty Hearst by the Symbionese Liberation Army, an event which dominated
headlines in the 1970s as Hearst and her captors robbed banks and fled from the
law. Six members of the SLA were killed in their Los Angeles hideout in a
shootout with police.
</P>
<P>
	   Olson, formerly known as Kathleen Ann Soliah, is accused of conspiring to
murder by planting pipe bombs under two Los Angeles police cars in a 1975 plot
to avenge the SLA shootout deaths. The bombs did not explode and no one was
injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Jordan asked for court permission to take a deposition from onetime radical
sports writer Jack Scott, who arranged the cross-country flight of Hearst when
she was the most-wanted fugitive in the nation. Scott, 57, is dying of throat
cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott is the witness most likely to contradict Hearst, the expected star
witness of the prosecution case.
</P>
<P>
	   Superior Court Judge James Ideman said he would take up the issue of
emergency testimony at a hearing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Olson was indicted in 1976. During her years as a fugitive she became a
doctor's wife and mother of three, a community activist and actress in local
productions in St. Paul, Minn.

<HEADLINE> New Austria Coalition Takes Power  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE JAHN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- A governing coalition tainted by a party identified
with Nazi sympathies took power Friday, triggering diplomatic sanctions and
egg-throwing protests that forced the new ministers to leave the swearing-in
ceremony through an underground tunnel.
</P>
<P>
	   President Thomas Klestil, who swore in the new center-right coalition,
appealed to the world to give the new government a chance to fulfill its
promises to govern under European standards of democracy and human rights.
</P>
<P>
	   As the ministers were taking their oaths, some 5,000 protesters massed
outside the presidential offices, pelting police with eggs and paint.
</P>
<P>
	   One protester, Wilhelm Popovic, said he was showing his opposition ``in the
name of my father,'' who he said spent seven years in a Nazi concentration camp
``because of policies like this.''
</P>
<P>
	   Later Friday, protesters roamed downtown Vienna, briefly taking over the
Social Affairs Ministry and destroying several police cars.
</P>
<P>
	   Late Friday, police used water cannon and tear gas to disperse a group of
demonstrators in front of the Freedom party office on Kaerntner Strasse, the
capital's main street and a tourist center lined with expensive boutiques.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 30 police were injured in the daylong clashes with protesters.
Smaller protests took place in Linz, Graz and Innsbruck.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel did not even wait for the government to be sworn in. Its ambassador
flew home hours before the coalition of the center-right Austrian People's Party
and Joerg Haider's far-right Freedom Party took office.
</P>
<P>
	   And one by one, the 14 nations sharing European Union membership with
Austria started reducing diplomatic ties, canceling contracts and official
visits and freezing high-level contacts.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said U.S. Ambassador Kathryn Walt-Hall
would leave for Washington to report and then return to Vienna to monitor the
political crisis. The State Department said the action did not amount to a
recall.
</P>
<P>
	   Klestil had repeatedly warned that Freedom Party participation in government
would produce a fierce reaction because of Haider's anti-foreigner stand,
opposition to European Union expansion and his past praise of Nazi policies.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider won international notoriety for statements praising Adolf Hitler's
``orderly employment'' policies and lauding veterans of the Waffen SS as
``decent people of good character'' -- comments for which he has since
apologized.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Klestil indicated he had little choice but to approve the governing
coalition. In the Oct. 3 elections, the People's Party and Freedom Party won 104
of the 183 parliament seats.
</P>
<P>
	   In a televised address, Klestil expressed his personal ``concern and
dismay'' over the negative foreign reaction and domestic turmoil. He urged all
``to give the new federal government a chance and to judge it by its work.''
</P>
<P>
	   The new government will give the far right wing a greater voice in Austrian
policies than in any other European country. The chancellor, Wolfgang Schuessel,
is the leader of the People's Party, junior partner in the outgoing center-left
coalition with the Social Democrats. Freedom Party member Suzanne Riess-Passer
is vice chancellor.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider is not part of the new government and remains governor of Carinthia
province. But critics fear he will influence government policies from the wings.
</P>
<P>
	   Many European Union governments fear that the success of Haider's party
could boost rightist parties in their own countries.
</P>
<P>
	   In Belgium, where a far-right party is expected to make big election gains
this year, the defense minister suspended an order for six Austrian-made
ambulances, schools canceled ski trips to Austria and universities flew the
blue-and-gold European flag at half-staff.
</P>
<P>
	   France's defense minister postponed a meeting with Austria on European
defense and Portugal's president called off a state visit in March.

<HEADLINE> Bush Hits Back at McCain in New Ad  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fighting back against an energized John McCain, George W.
Bush has a new TV commercial that accuses McCain of distorting Bush's tax plan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``John McCain's ad about Governor Bush isn't true and McCain knows it,''
says the new ad set to air in South Carolina. ``On taxes, McCain echoes
Washington Democrats when we need a conservative leader to challenge them.''
</P>
<P>
	   The new spot -- Bush's first to name the Arizona senator by name -- reflects
a more aggressive new strategy for the Texas governor, who was stunned by his
lopsided loss in New Hampshire's primary Tuesday. Bush also went after McCain on
the campaign trail Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This ad shows Governor Bush intends to fight back. He's got the fire in
the belly necessary to fight and win this nomination,'' said Bush spokesman Ari
Fleischer. ``We know we have a fight on our hands.''
</P>
<P>
	   Next week, after responding to McCain's criticisms, the Bush team will take
the offense in the air wars, with possible topics including taxes, education and
campaign finance reform, said a Bush adviser, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, the issue in the ad war is how much each man sets aside to bolster a
Social Security system that might otherwise run out of money as the baby boomers
begin to retire.
</P>
<P>
	   In a TV ad that ran in New Hampshire and is now running in South Carolina,
McCain implies that Bush would spend ``every last dime'' of the budget surplus
on tax cuts, mostly for the rich.
</P>
<P>
	   The dispute stems from the fact that there are actually two surpluses in
Washington. There's the ``Social Security surplus,'' made up of the extra money
coming into the trust fund from Social Security taxes. And there's the extra
money coming into the general treasury from other federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   Both men would leave the Social Security surplus untouched, but Bush would
spend most of the rest on tax cuts whereas McCain would save some of it to
bolster the retirement program.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush complained about the McCain ad, called ``Every Dime,'' when it aired in
New Hampshire but opted against responding in his campaign's paid advertising.
After losing in New Hampshire by 18 points, Bush is changing strategy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was 'above the fray' in New Hampshire and look what happened,''
Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's spokesman had no immediate response to the ad. But asked Thursday
about the possibility of an ad like this, media adviser Greg Stevens said:
``Bring 'em on.''
</P>
<P>
	   As for next week's Bush ads, campaign polling shows South Carolina voters
respond when McCain's tax plan is termed more liberal than President Clinton's.
On education, the Bush team believes McCain is vulnerable because he has few
school policies and is opposed to Bush's plan for vouchers.
</P>
<P>
	   The campaign is divided on how to handle campaign finance reform, McCain's
signature issue. Some say Bush's best argument is that campaign finance reform
would turn politics over to the media and labor organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   Some narrowly targeted advertising also may question McCain's commitment to
abortion rights, an adviser said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's team plans to discuss their options throughout the weekend.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Gun, Tobacco Laws  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton opened an election-year fight Friday
over guns and cigarettes, proposing to fine the tobacco industry $3,000 for each
teen smoker and crack down on firearm dealers whose weapons wind up in
criminals' hands.
</P>
<P>
	   The double-barreled approach isn't likely to go far in Congress, which
shelved administration measures last year for a 55-cent-a-pack tax on cigarettes
and restrictions on gun show sales. But at a minimum, it will give Democrats
campaign issues for their drive to win control of Congress and keep the White
House.
</P>
<P>
	   Two days before his wife, Hillary, formally announces her Senate candidacy,
the president went to Capitol Hill to give Democrats a pep talk.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was making it clear there's not a single bone in his body that's got
lame duck written on it,'' said Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore. Clinton said the booming
economy presents a rare opportunity to help people who have been left behind.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's tobacco initiative was billed as an effort to cut teen smoking in
half by making cigarettes more expensive and penalizing the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is certainly our belief that the tobacco industry, through their
marketing practices, could cut teen smoking,'' White House press secretary Joe
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
	   The president's budget, to be released Monday, urges a 25-cent-a-pack tax
increase. He also proposed accelerating an already approved 5 cent per pack tax
increase to take effect on Oct. 1 instead of on Jan. 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   Further, Clinton would penalize cigarette-makers $3,000 each year for every
underage smoker if teen smoking is not cut in half by 2004. Senate Republicans
rejected a similar plan in 1998 when Congress killed a sweeping anti-smoking
measure.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockhart indicated that Clinton's latest proposal was still a work in
progress, fuzzy on issues such as how to deal with a cigarette maker making a
sincere effort to reduce teen smoking. ``Obviously there are some issues we will
have to work out ...,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans denounced Clinton's plan as simply another tax increase. A
Democratic lawmaker from North Carolina, Sen. John Edwards, agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Piling additional taxes on the backs of North Caroline farmers and workers
is not the right way to help our young people,'' Edwards told leaf growers in
Raleigh, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   However, American Cancer Society chief John R. Seffrin said, ``Big Tobacco
must take responsibility for the damage it has inflicted upon the health of our
children. The tobacco industry claims to want to reduce teen tobacco use. This
plan would light a fire under Big Tobacco and force them to back up their words
with action.''
</P>
<P>
	   Renewing his gun-control push, Clinton released a federal firearms study
which found that about one percent of the gun dealers and pawnbrokers in America
sell over 57 percent of the guns used in crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're beginning the most aggressive effort ever undertaken to insure
responsible behavior by gun dealers,'' the president said. ``Dealers whose guns
most frequently wind up in criminals' hand will now be subject to intense
scrutiny'' by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF).
</P>
<P>
	   Guided by the study, the ATF will conduct ``focused inspections'' on about
1,000 of the 80,570 licensed dealers and pawnbrokers. The targeted dealers are
those that have had 10 or more crime guns traced to them in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal law allows ATF to inspect dealers only once a year. Clinton asked
Congress to remove those restriction and allow up to three visits per year. He
also renewed his call to require photo IDs for gun purchases, safety locks for
all new handguns and a ban on imports of large-capacity ammo clips.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not a nefarious, illegal trade,'' said National Rifle Association
spokesman Bill Powers. ``It's perfectly legal and lawful, and most of it is done
by mom and pop family businesses.'' He said Clinton simply was trying to help
Vice President Al Gore's campaign. ``By gosh, Al's running for president, so we
gotta give him some cover -- that's what this is about,'' Powers said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., one of the leading voices in Congress for
more gun control applauded Clinton's initiative. ``This is the best thing that
can be done, short of new laws ... given the deadlock in Congress,'' Schumer
said.

<HEADLINE> Missing Musher Found Alive in Alaska  </HEADLINE>
   By MARY PEMBERTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- A rookie sled dog racer who disappeared in
blizzard conditions six days ago during a 200-mile race was found alive Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Rod Boyce was found near the race trail in the Caribou Hills of the Kenai
Peninsula at about 1:30 p.m., said Greg Wilkinson, an Alaska state troopers
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   A group of snowmobilers found Boyce and took him to a nearby lodge. Sgt. Jim
Hibpshman, commander of the trooper post in Homer, said Boyce refused medical
treatment and instead said he wanted to go to the Soldotna airport, where his
wife was waiting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He is tired, hungry, but he's talking and says he's fine,'' said
Hibpshman.
</P>
<P>
	   Boyce was found without his dog team, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Boyce was last seen early Sunday morning while competing in the Tustumena
200 Sled Dog Race, on Alaska's Kenai Peninsula south of Anchorage. He passed
through a race checkpoint, but failed to reach the next checkpoint 18 miles
away.
</P>
<P>
	   Boyce, 38, is a recreational musher who was competing in his first race. He
is the city editor for the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner and lives in Two Rivers.
</P>
<P>
	   When Boyce's colleagues learned he was alive, cheers erupted in the
newsroom.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I had a lot of respect for Rod as an editor before this,'' said managing
editor Kelly Bostian. ``I mean I am amazed and impressed that he could pull
through that. ... That takes somebody with a good head on their shoulders. I am
just very impressed that he was able to pull this out.''
</P>
<P>
	   Troopers and race officials suspect Boyce took a wrong turn in blizzard
conditions. He was carrying survival equipment and enough food for himself and
the dogs to last two days.

<HEADLINE> Hockey coach charged with assaulting two boys  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MOUNT HOLLY, N.J. (AP) - A Pennsylvania hockey coach is charged with
sexually assaulting two 11-year-old boys in Burlington County, authorities said.
<P>
	   Larry Henry, 26, remains in the Burlington County Jail in lieu of $50,000
bail. If he makes bail, Henry is not allowed to have contact with anyone under
the age of 16, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   Henry was charged with the first offense on Wednesday. He allegedly touched
a boy's genitals four years ago while the boy was visiting the coach in his
former Willingboro home, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   He was charged again on Thursday for the sexual assault of a second boy in a
car in the Bordentown area last winter. Henry knew that boy through their hockey
activities, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   Henry was known by his nickname "Kiefer" at several ice arenas in New Jersey
and Pennsylvania. The self-employed goalie coach operates K.K. Goal Tending Co.
</P>
<P>
	   The Willow Grove, Pa., resident has been involved with hockey activities at
the Medford Ice Rink, Twin Rinks in Pennsauken, the New Jersey Roller Hockey
club in Westampton, and the Hollydell Ice Arena in Washington Township,
Gloucester County. He also has been involved in hockey at rinks in Aston and
West Chester, Pa., authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   The first boy's parents informed police about the alleged offense in
November, after the boy told his parents, authorities said.

<HEADLINE> Independence Party schism spills into Albany courts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - New York Reform Party Chairman Jack Essenberg on
Friday had a judge slap a restraining order on party members trying to fire him
as the split between Pat Buchanan supporters and Donald Trump supporters
widened.
<P>
	   The Reform Party - known in New York as the Independence Party - had a state
committee meeting set in Albany to remove Essenberg, a Donald Trump supporter.
The Independence Party's Democracy Coalition, led by leftist activist Lenora
Fulani, has been backing Pat Buchanan and calling for Essenberg's removal.
</P>
<P>
	   Essenberg was trying to read a letter when Buchanan supporter and Fulani
spokeswoman Cathy Stewart started interrupting him. When he wouldn't recognize
her the Buchanan supporters tried to take over the meeting to vote Essenberg
out.
</P>
<P>
	   However, his lawyer, Thomas Spargo, pulled out a restraining order signed
the day before banning the meeting from continuing without Essenberg, who then
walked out.
</P>
<P>
	   The stunned Fulani supporters were left in the room trying to figure out
their next move. They later moved to another room and continued meeting, Fulani
spokeswoman Sarah Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is an unbelievably illegal restraining order," Stewart said. "We
should sit tight. The day is not over."
</P>
<P>
	   Lyons said the restraining order was eventually lifted and the meeting
continued. Essenburg and his supporters were voted out, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Frank MacKay of Babylon was voted in as state chairman, Lyons said.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides now plan to head to the courts.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll see what the courts say," Essenberg said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ironically, the restraining order was signed on Thursday by state Supreme
Court Justice Thomas McNamara, the same judge who threw Trump off the
Independence Party ballot last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Trump is not an announced presidential candidate for the Reform Party.
Nonetheless, he is considering running for the party's presidential nomination
and has picked up support from Reform Party members.
</P>
<P>
	   While Fulani is backing conservative Buchanan's bid for the Reform Party's
nomination, her faction is running delegate slates for the New York primary that
are uncommitted to any candidate. They convinced McNamara to throw out all of
the Trump delegates, saying Trump supporters did not get enough signatures to be
on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   Fulani supporters say Essenberg wants to use the Independence Party to set
himself up as a kingmaker and endorse other candidates similar to the state's
Conservative and Liberal parties.
</P>
<P>
	   Essenberg denies that and says the Fulani supporters just want control over
the party.

<P>
	   TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- A state commission recommended Friday that reparations
be paid for one of the nation's deadliest racial clashes: a little-known, 1921
rampage by a white Tulsa mob that killed as many as 300 people, most of them
black.
</P>
<P>
	   The 11-member panel called for direct payments to survivors and victims'
descendants, scholarships and a tax checkoff program to fund economic
development in Tulsa's mostly black Greenwood area and a memorial to the dead.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I asked myself, 'What would I want if my life was basically destroyed,'''
commission member Vivian Clark said in favor of payments to survivors. ``The
country has a problem as a whole in giving compensations to African Americans.''
</P>
<P>
	   The commission recommended that the direct payments be a priority.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This way we will be helping people first, which is what we are supposed to
be doing,'' said commission member Jim Loyd, who is white.
</P>
<P>
	   The panel gave no specifics on how much the package would cost and offered
no details on such things as who would get the scholarships. It also didn't say
who should make the payments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We haven't pointed fingers at anyone, yet,'' said commission Chairman Bob
Blackburn, who is white.
</P>
<P>
	   But the commission passed a resolution that said the racial hatred then was
tolerated through laws of local, state and federal governments and said
restitution would be good public policy and help repair the emotional and
physical scars of the riot.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission's recommendation is subject to approval by the Legislature,
which created the commission.
</P>
<P>
	   Genevieve Elizabeth Tillman Jackson, an 84-year-old black woman who survived
the riot, said after the vote that she never thought she would see the day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's great. I think the survivors should be helped, and the children of
survivors,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   About a half-dozen of the 80 known riot survivors watched on Friday as the
commission heard personal accounts, newspaper stories and a subcommittee
recommendation before approving the payment of reparations.
</P>
<P>
	   Ten of the 11 members voted in favor of the memorial and the scholarship
after one commissioner left the meeting early. The vote was 9-1 on the direct
payments and the tax checkoff.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have a big problems with reparations. Will it solve what we're looking
at?'' said white commission member Sen. Robert Milacek. He cast votes in favor
of scholarships and a memorial but went against direct payments.
</P>
<P>
	   No cheers of joy or even clapping met the vote. Most of the survivors there
had a hard time hearing. Friends and family members whispered the results into
their ears, the quiet words bringing looks of contentment to their faces. Their
eyes were watering.
</P>
<P>
	   The survivors left quickly after the vote while the commission continued
their meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   The riot broke out May 31, 1921, when a white lynch mob clashed with blacks
who were protecting a black man accused of assaulting a white elevator operator.
</P>
<P>
	   Over two days, white mobs set fire to homes, businesses and churches in
Greenwood, a thriving black business district known at the time as the Black
Wall Street of America. When the smoke cleared, the area lay in ruins.
</P>
<P>
	   Many blacks left and never returned. The National Guard rounded up thousands
of others and held them at the fairgrounds, convention hall and a baseball
stadium.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission, which included a survivor, historians, lawmakers and
community members, held meetings for two years and agreed that it may be
impossible to get a complete, accurate account of what happened.
</P>
<P>
	   There is uncertainty over such things as how many died, whether a Tulsa
cemetery holds mass graves, and what role the National Guard played.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, some in the crowd shouted and others let out a low ``no, no, no''
when white Democratic state Rep. Abe Deutschendorf recalled a riot survivor's
account that the National Guard saved his life.
</P>
<P>
	   For decades, the city ignored the riot. It was only in 1996 that it
recognized its anniversary. The next year, the Legislature created the
commission when Tulsa lawmakers raised the issue of restitution.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1994, Florida set the precedent in reparations by paying up to $150,000
to survivors of a 1923 attack on blacks in Rosewood, Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   In Arkansas, historians and residents are holding a conference next week to
discuss a major race riot in 1919 at Elaine, Ark. The death toll has been put at
anywhere from 20 to 200.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Soldier Fights Discharge  </HEADLINE>
   By BRIGITTE GREENBERG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A U.S. soldier's bad-conduct discharge for refusing to
serve on a U.N. peacekeeping mission should be overturned because the jury was
not allowed to decide whether President Clinton's order to deploy was legal, the
soldier's lawyer argued Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney Henry L. Hamilton, representing Army medic Michael New, told five
judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces that Clinton's order to
deploy troops to Macedonia in 1995 was illegal because he did not have
congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Superiors may not compel subordinates to obey illegal orders,'' said
Hamilton, a retired Army judge advocate general. ``The government must prove
lawfulness. ... If it's not a legal order, there's no duty to obey it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Capt. Kelly Haywood, representing the government, argued that the order's
legitimacy was never for the seven-member military jury to decide, and New had a
duty to obey the commander in chief.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The mission lives and dies by the soldier following an order,'' Haywood
said.
</P>
<P>
	   New was among a few hundred mainly support troops that Clinton sent in 1995
to Macedonia, one of six republics of former Yugoslavia, to guard against the
spread of unrest from other areas torn by ethnic turmoil because of Yugoslavia's
dismemberment. They served in a peacekeeping force dispatched by the United
Nations, and New refused to wear U.N. insignia on his U.S. Army uniform.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeals court judges must decide whether Army Judge Lt. Col. Gary
Jewell, who oversaw court-martial proceedings against New in January 1996, erred
by essentially telling the jury that Clinton's order was constitutional. If so,
the case would be sent back down for new court-martial proceedings.
</P>
<P>
	   The judges' decision is expected within two to three months.
</P>
<P>
	   At New's court-martial four years ago, the jury took only 20 minutes to
convict him of disobeying an order. He was sentenced to be given a bad-conduct
discharge, but the discharge is being held in abeyance during his appeals.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What's at stake here is whether or not it's illegal for a soldier to wear
the uniform of foreign nations, of foreign commanders,'' New said later, outside
the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
	   While stationed in Germany in 1995, the native of Conroe, Texas, refused to
remove his American military uniform patch in favor of the insignia and blue
beret of the United Nations, saying he would not serve a foreign power. Hamilton
described his client as a patriot.
</P>
<P>
	   ``President Clinton lied to Congress to effect the deployment in
Macedonia,'' Hamilton said outside the courthouse. ``It all stemmed from his
duplicity in failing to inform Congress.''
</P>
<P>
	   New joined the Army in 1993. He served with U.S. units in Kuwait since the
1991 Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
	   While awaiting the outcome of his case, New is on involuntary leave. The
26-year-old medical specialist has been working for a Texas manufacturing firm
and studying computers at a local college.
</P>
<P>
	   He was arrested last July on drug charges for allegedly phoning in a phony
prescription to a pharmacy for a drug commonly prescribed for people suffering
anxiety. If convicted on that charge, he could be sentenced to as much as 10
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   He was convicted in January 1998 of forging prescriptions and was fined $500
and sentenced to seven years probation.
</P>
<P>
	   In March, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear New's military case. The
justices said he must exhaust all avenues of military appeals before seeking
relief from federal civilian courts.

<HEADLINE> Peru: US Prisoner Transfer Possible  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- An American woman convicted and imprisoned in Peru for
aiding leftist rebels might be allowed to serve her time in the United States,
the country's prime minister said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   New York native Lori Berenson, 30, has been held for four years in Peruvian
prisons following her treason conviction in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Prime Minister Alberto Bustamante said late Friday that Peru's law could be
changed to allow people convicted of treason to be eligible for a prisoner
transfer treaty, which is in effect between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Berenson's father Mark Berenson, reached at his New York home, said
Bustamante is simply offering his daughter an opportunity she has already
rejected.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Berenson could have requested to be transferred to a prison in the
United States at any time before October 1998, when Peru's Congress passed a law
at President Alberto Fujimori's request excluding people convicted of treason
from taking advantage of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Lori never ever would make that request,'' he said. ``For three years,
Lori had this option and for three years Lori said 'I am not guilty, I am not a
criminal.'''
</P>
<P>
	   A military judge, wearing a hood to protect his identity to guard against
reprisals by rebels, convicted Berenson of treason for helping to lead a
thwarted assault on Peru's Congress by leftist Tupac Amaru Revolutionary
Movement rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   Berenson's supporters have argued that her treason conviction was illegal
because she is not a Peruvian citizen.
</P>
<P>
	   The 30-year-old New York native and her family say she did not receive a
fair trial in the secretive military court. Her parents have campaigned to free
her or have her receive an open civilian trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Berenson carried out a two-week hunger strike last month to protest her four
years of imprisonment.

<HEADLINE> US Rejects Russian Demand on Tanker  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States and Russia were in a diplomatic dustup
Friday as Washington spurned a Moscow demand to immediately release a Russian
tanker seized by a U.S. Navy vessel.
</P>
<P>
	   The seizure of the Volga-Neft-147 on Wednesday in the Persian Gulf was
prompted by suspicions that the tanker was carrying Iraqi oil in violation of
U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We imperatively demand the immediate release of the Russian tanker,''
Deputy Foreign Minister Vasily Sredin told the Tass news agency. ``We shall get
it back and save both the ship and crew.''
</P>
<P>
	   State Department spokesman James Foley said the tanker was being diverted to
Oman. If an analysis of the oil proves that it is of Iraqi origin, the cargo
will be off loaded and then sold, with a portion of the proceeds used to pay for
the U.N. sanctions monitoring operation, other officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Once the disposition of the cargo is determined, the tanker and its crew
would be released, they added.
</P>
<P>
	   The tanker was in international waters off the Omani coast on Friday. A
Pentagon spokesman, Army Col. Vince Ogilvie, said Friday two officials from the
Russian consulate in the United Arab Emirates boarded the tanker, as did two
American defense attache officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia maintains the oil is from Iran, not Iraq. Iraq's government-run
Al-Thawra newspaper said in an editorial that the American claim that Iraq
benefits from illegal trade is ``a sheer lie.''
</P>
<P>
	   The United States has long been at odds with Russia over Iraq. Russia is a
strong supporter of steps in support of the eventual lifting of the U.N.
economic embargo against Iraq. The Clinton administration is insisting on full
Iraqi compliance with the U.N. Security Council resolutions, including a
requirement that Iraq not possess weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. officials said the administration was merely enforcing the embargo
against Iraq in ordering the seizure of the Russian vessel. The administration
has not said the Russian government was involved with Volga-Neft 147 or its
cargo.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russians are being told the issue is full implementation of sanctions
enforcement, officials said, noting that U.N. resolutions authorize seizures in
cases where smuggling is suspected.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq is banned from most international commerce but is allowed to export up
to $5.2 billion in oil every six months in order to buy food, medicine and other
essentials for its people, and spare parts for its oil industry.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the effort to enforce the U.N. sanctions, the State Department said
Thursday that illicit oil exports from Iraq average 100,000 barrels a day,
compared with 50,000 barrels in 1998, when oil prices were much lower.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Al-Thawra newspaper, in apparent reference to these figures, said
the Americans ``are making up stories, some backed up with false figures, about
vessels loaded with Iraqi oil and other Iraqi byproducts.''
</P>
<P>
	   Iraqi officials long have denied any smuggling of crude oil or byproducts
takes place on the Gulf. Iraq maintains the United States scrutinizes Gulf ships
traveling to and from Iraq, but does nothing to stop brisk illicit oil smuggling
over land from northern Iraq -- a Kurdish area outside the Baghdad government's
control -- into neighboring Turkey, a U.S. ally.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of Defense William Cohen said Friday in an interview en route to
Munich, Germany, there was no confirmation of Russian government involvement in
the alleged trafficking of Iraqi oil by Russian tankers. Administration
officials have raised the trafficking issue with Russian authorities, who say
they are investigating.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Overall there has been an increase on the part of Iraq to intensify its
smuggling operations, and we're going to have to simply intensify our own
intervention to prevent that,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he thinks Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein, ``will do whatever he
can to try to circumvent the sanctions. If he can get away with it, if there's a
laxity on the enforcement part, then he will seek to exploit it.''

<HEADLINE> Analysis of Bush's Latest Commercial  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   An analysis of George W. Bush's latest television commercial, which responds
to an earlier ad by John McCain:
</P>
<P>
	   TITLE: ``Solid Values.''
</P>
<P>
	   LENGTH: 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   PRODUCER: Maverick Media.
</P>
<P>
	   AIRING: South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   SCRIPT: (Announcer:) ``John McCain's ad about Governor Bush isn't true and
McCain knows it. McCain's economic advisor says he'd support Bush's plan -- $2
trillion to protect Social Security, pay down debt and a real tax cut. McCain's
plan? A tax cut smaller than Clinton's, and not a penny in tax cuts for 30
million Americans. On taxes, McCain echoes Washington Democrats when we need a
conservative leader to challenge them. Governor Bush. Proven. Tested. And ready
to lead America.''
</P>
<P>
	   KEY IMAGES: Words on screen echoing the announcer's script. Ends with images
of Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ANALYSIS: In the sharpest ad of his campaign, Bush takes on a McCain spot
now airing in South Carolina. Bush opted against a similar response when McCain
aired this ad in New Hampshire, but that was before the governor was walloped in
the primary. Newly aggressive, Bush's team is going on the attack, even though
it means the campaign may appear defensive.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain and Bush have been battling for weeks over how large a tax cut the
nation can afford, with Bush proposing a $483 billion, five-year tax cut plan --
about double McCain. The Arizona senator says more money is needed to pay down
the debt and secure Social Security and Bush argues that any money left in
Washington will be spent on federal programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush ad objects to a line in the McCain ad where McCain says: ``There's
one difference between me and the others. I won't take every last dime of the
surplus and spend it on tax cuts that mostly benefit the wealthy.'' Bush
protests that his plan saves $2 trillion over 10 years for the retirement
program.
</P>
<P>
	   Who's right? Arguably, both. The surplus is actually made up of two streams
of cash. There's the extra money pouring into the Social Security trust fund and
then there's extra money coming into the general treasury from other federal
taxes and fees. Both men leave the Social Security surplus untouched, but Bush
spends most of the rest on tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's ad is right when he says McCain's tax plan is closer to what
Democrats prefer -- given that Democrats think Bush's tax cut is far too
expensive. But he's misleading when he says ``McCain's economic adviser'' said
he'd support Bush's plan. He's referring to former Rep. Vin Weber of Minnesota
-- a McCain supporter but hardly the man who shapes economic policy for the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush charges that McCain's tax cut is smaller than Clinton's, but they are
difficult to compare. Clinton would cut taxes by $350 billion over 10 years,
whereas McCain's is $237 billion is over five years.

<HEADLINE> McCain Takes on Tobacco Politics  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FLORENCE, S.C. (AP) -- Out here in tobacco country, John McCain's attacks on
the golden leaf don't sit too well with some of the people still trying to make
a living from the crop.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If I were him, I wouldn't be walking into a tobacco warehouse anytime
soon,'' Palmer Johnson, a 66-year-old veteran of the tobacco fields, mused
Friday as McCain campaigned nearby.
</P>
<P>
	   But McCain's stance wins some respect in tobacco country, too. Phil Ward of
Florence, whose family has farmed tobacco in past years, questioned why McCain
shouldn't take on tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's willingness to offend some people fits in with his pledge to ``tell
you the truth, even if it's a message you don't want to hear,'' Ward said.
</P>
<P>
	   Already, voters in South Carolina are being reminded of McCain's
unsuccessful attempt in 1998 to raise cigarette taxes by $1.10 per pack and give
the federal government new power to regulate nicotine.
</P>
<P>
	   Television ads by the National Smokers Alliance, a group supported by the
tobacco industry, started showing this week in Columbia, Charleston and Florence
bashing the Arizona senator for supporting the tobacco tax increase favored by
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm honored by their opposition,'' McCain said at a campaign stop.
``There's no other group I would rather be attacked by.'' He said Big Tobacco
``addicted our children and lied to Congress.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, opening an election-year fight, on Friday proposed a 25-cent-a-pack
tax increase on cigarettes for an anti-smoking campaign. He also proposed
accelerating an approved 5 cent per pack tax increase to take effect Oct. 1
instead of Jan. 1, 2002. And he wants to penalize cigarette-makers $3,000 each
year for every underage smoker if teen smoking is not cut in half by 2004.
</P>
<P>
	   Strategists for Texas Gov. George W. Bush have been considering making
McCain's tobacco record an issue in the state. But they are not sure if that
should be done through ads, local politicians or Bush himself.
</P>
<P>
	   Southern political analysts said the ad campaign could backfire and end up
helping McCain in his contest with Bush for the Feb. 19 South Carolina primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has a more moderate record on tobacco, playing little role in his
state's lawsuit against tobacco companies except to resist high legal fees
charged by the private lawyers who represented Texas in what became a $17
billion settlement for the state.
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina isn't the monolithic tobacco state it used to be.
</P>
<P>
	   Jack Bass, political scientist at the College of Charleston and co-author of
``The Transformation of Southern Politics,'' sees no advantage in going after
McCain on tobacco.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It does not make him vulnerable at all,'' said Bass, who thinks McCain
could win big in South Carolina. ``It may make a marginal difference with some
tobacco growers.''
</P>
<P>
	   While tobacco is still a big cash crop, it is grown primarily in one
congressional district in the northeastern part of the state, including
Florence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The type of voters McCain appeals to probably would be in agreement'' with
him in taking on the tobacco companies, said Merle Black, a political scientist
at Emory University in Atlanta. ``The tobacco companies themselves are very
unpopular. A lot of the farmers don't like the companies.''
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina went after the industry aggressively and won a big settlement
from the companies, Bass noted, adding: ``It's not what it used to be.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said in an interview his tobacco stance might be a disadvantage in
some respects.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Does it hurt me -- the fact that I took up this issue? It does in some
areas,'' McCain said. ``You just can't worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said his proposed legislation, which failed in Congress, would have
provided $3 billion to help farmers get out of tobacco growing.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain didn't bring the topic up at a rally in Florence, sticking to his
popular stands on veterans' issues and taxes. And no one asked him about tobacco
either. Instead, the crowd cheered and praised the former Vietnam prisoner of
war as a hero.
</P>
<P>
	   But his comment that he was honored to be attacked by tobacco interests
struck a sour note up the highway in Mullins, a town dependent on the leaf.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I had thought about voting for him,'' said Johnson, a tobacco warehouse
worker, who reported getting calls from others upset by McCain's comments. ``How
would you feel if somebody were talking that way about your livelihood?''

    	   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) - A 45-year-old Saratoga County man met with
state police instead of the 13-year-old Internet intimate from Virginia he
expected.
<P>
	   Timothy Farnum of Halfmoon, 17 miles south of Saratoga Springs, was arrested
without incident at Albany County International Airport Thursday following an
investigation by the Bedford County Sheriff's Internet Crimes Against Children
unit in Virginia and several New York police agencies.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigation was initiated by the Virginia unit in November, when
Investigator Jamie Watson posed as a 13-year-old female. The nature of the
online correspondence and the actions of Farnum led to a felony charge of
disseminating indecent material to a minor.
</P>
<P>
	   Farnum may face additional charges in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   Farnum was arraigned in Halfmoon town court. He was released from Saratoga
County jail after posting $5,000 bail and is scheduled to return to court
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Bush Hits Back at McCain in New Ad  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fighting back against an energized John McCain, George W.
Bush has a new TV commercial that accuses McCain of distorting Bush's tax plan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``John McCain's ad about Governor Bush isn't true and McCain knows it,''
says the new ad set to air in South Carolina. ``On taxes, McCain echoes
Washington Democrats when we need a conservative leader to challenge them.''
</P>
<P>
	   The new spot -- Bush's first to name the Arizona senator by name -- reflects
a more aggressive new strategy for the Texas governor, who was stunned by his
lopsided loss in New Hampshire's primary Tuesday. Bush also went after McCain on
the campaign trail Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This ad shows Governor Bush intends to fight back. He's got the fire in
the belly necessary to fight and win this nomination,'' said Bush spokesman Ari
Fleischer. ``We know we have a fight on our hands.''
</P>
<P>
	   Next week, after responding to McCain's criticisms, the Bush team will take
the offense in the air wars, with possible topics including taxes, education and
campaign finance reform, said a Bush adviser, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, the issue in the ad war is how much each man sets aside to bolster a
Social Security system that might otherwise run out of money as the baby boomers
begin to retire.
</P>
<P>
	   In a TV ad that ran in New Hampshire and is now running in South Carolina,
McCain implies that Bush would spend ``every last dime'' of the budget surplus
on tax cuts, mostly for the rich.
</P>
<P>
	   The dispute stems from the fact that there are actually two surpluses in
Washington. There's the ``Social Security surplus,'' made up of the extra money
coming into the trust fund from Social Security taxes. And there's the extra
money coming into the general treasury from other federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   Both men would leave the Social Security surplus untouched, but Bush would
spend most of the rest on tax cuts whereas McCain would save some of it to
bolster the retirement program.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush complained about the McCain ad, called ``Every Dime,'' when it aired in
New Hampshire but opted against responding in his campaign's paid advertising.
After losing in New Hampshire by 18 points, Bush is changing strategy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was 'above the fray' in New Hampshire and look what happened,''
Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's spokesman, Howard Opinsky, said it was disappointing to see Bush
turn on a fellow Republican. ``Governor Bush, seeing his inevitability quickly
fade, is resorting to typical desperate tactics,'' he said. Asked earlier about
the possibility of an ad like this, media adviser Greg Stevens said they are
ready for the fight: ``Bring 'em on.''
</P>
<P>
	   As for next week's Bush ads, campaign polling shows South Carolina voters
respond when McCain's tax plan is termed more liberal than President Clinton's.
On education, the Bush team believes McCain is vulnerable because he has few
school policies and is opposed to Bush's plan for vouchers.
</P>
<P>
	   The campaign is divided on how to handle campaign finance reform, McCain's
signature issue. Some say Bush's best argument is that campaign finance reform
would turn politics over to the media and labor organizations.
</P>
<P>
	   Some narrowly targeted advertising also may question McCain's commitment to
abortion rights, an adviser said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's team plans to discuss their options throughout the weekend.

<HEADLINE> EgyptAir Says Pilot Asks for Asylum  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- An EgyptAir pilot who claims to have information about
the crash of one of the airline's planes last year that killed everyone on board
reportedly has asked for political asylum in Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   The official Middle East News Agency carried a statement Friday by EgyptAir
quoting the airline's chairman, Mohammed Fahim Rayan, as saying that the pilot,
Hamdi Hanafi Taha, had asked for asylum, saying ``he has information on the
EgyptAir crash.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the report said that Taha ``does not have any connection to or knowledge
about the cause of the plane crash.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Oct. 31 EgyptAir crash off the eastern coast of the United States killed
all 217 people aboard. The plane went down in the ocean 40 minutes into an
11-hour flight from New York to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
	   A team of American and Egyptian investigators has yet to release any
official findings on the cause of the crash. Some U.S. sources have said the
U.S. National Transportation and Safety Board is working on the theory the plane
was brought down deliberately by a copilot who died in the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   Egyptian officials have dismissed that possibility, saying instead that they
believe an as-yet unexplained problem in the plane's tail section was
responsible for the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   State-owned EgyptAir's brief statement did not elaborate on whether Taha
claimed to have information about the copilot on the ill-fated jet.
</P>
<P>
	   Both the Egyptian government and public have condemned as outrageous and
insulting any speculation that an Egyptian pilot may have committed suicide and
killed innocent people in the downing of Flight 990.
</P>
<P>
	   If Taha has information contradicting that stand, he may fear being
ostracized -- or worse -- in a country where human rights activists have been
jailed for speech considered harmful to the national interest.
</P>
<P>
	   Taha flew a planeload of passengers to London earlier Friday and made his
asylum request at Heathrow Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   In London, a spokesman for the Home Office, when asked if an EgyptAir pilot
had requested asylum, said: ``We can confirm an Egyptian national has sought
entry into the U.K. and his application is being considered by the immigration
services.'' The spokesman refused to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane Taha had flown to London returned to Cairo as scheduled early
Saturday piloted by reserve pilot Mohammed Salama. Upon arrival in Cairo, Salama
told reporters only that the crew had seen Taha being escorted away by police in
London.

<HEADLINE> 1954 Testimony OKd in Sheppard Case  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN AFFLECK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Testimony from the 1954 trial at which Dr. Sam Sheppard
was convicted of killing his wife may be used at a new trial aimed at clearing
his name, a judge ruled Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheppard's son, Sam Reese Sheppard, is suing the state of Ohio, claiming his
father was wrongfully imprisoned for his mother's beating death. Sheppard was
found guilty of murder and spent 10 years in prison before being acquitted at a
retrial. He died in 1970.
</P>
<P>
	   The doctor's son wanted the old testimony banned. But County Prosecutor
William Mason said prosecutors have no choice but to read transcripts to the
jury -- the case is 46 years old, and many original witnesses have died.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheppard's lawyers argued that the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the
original verdict partly because the testimony had been publicized before
witnesses appeared in court.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge Ronald Suster ruled the witnesses' testimony was not tainted.
</P>
<P>
	   The original trial was one of the most highly publicized of the 1950s and
inspired ``The Fugitive'' TV series and movie. Sheppard had insisted that a
``bushy-haired intruder'' killed his wife, Marilyn.
</P>
<P>
	   Sam Reese Sheppard, the couple's only child, contends that the weight of
evidence indicates his father was innocent.
</P>
<P>
	   Jury selection is scheduled to begin Monday.

<HEADLINE> NY Post, Daily News Discuss Merger  </HEADLINE>
    By KATHERINE ROTH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Two of the nation's biggest and most fiercely competitive
city tabloids, the New York Post and the New York Daily News, confirmed Friday
they have discussed the possibility of merging some of their operations.
</P>
<P>
	   "The talks were of a preliminary nature. We are proceeding with our own
business plans with or without any outside parties," Ken Chandler, publisher and
editor in chief of the Post, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin D. Krall, executive vice president of the News, confirmed there had
been brief, preliminary talks within the past year.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked whether they would be revived, he said "Anything can happen, but there
are no current plans."
</P>
<P>
	   Chandler said only that the Post would "always consider any business
opportunities."
</P>
<P>
	   The discussions focused on the possibility of sharing such functions as
printing and distribution, officials from both newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
	   The news comes against the backdrop of the city's intensely competitive
newspaper market in which both newspapers have at times struggled to survive. In
the early 1990s both papers went though severe problems that led to bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
	   The News emerged under the ownership of Mortimer B. Zuckerman and the Post
again became the property of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   The News has invested in new printing technologies and the Post is in the
process of building a new plant. But both are losing money and some analysts
believe there just aren't enough readers and advertisers for both to become
profitable.
</P>
<P>
	   The News had a loss of $17.9 million in 1998, despite a $19 million infusion
from Zuckerman, said The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the
discussions.
</P>
<P>
	   The Journal quoted executives close to the Post as saying the newspaper
loses on average between $9 million and $15 million a year.
</P>
<P>
	   They are also competing against The New York Times and Newsday, which
continues to sell well in Queens while dominating Long Island.
</P>
<P>
	   For the six months ended Sept. 30, 1999, the Daily News, the nation's sixth
largest newspaper, had average weekday circulation of 701,831, down 2.9 percent,
according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. The Post was No. 14 with 438,158,
up 0.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> New Worries About Uranium Plants  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHERINE RIZZO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The company that owns both the nation's uranium
enrichment operations had its credit rating cut Friday, increasing the
possibility that a plant might be closed.
</P>
<P>
	   The move by Standard &AMP; Poor's Corp. sent U.S. Enrichment Corp. stock
tumbling 23 percent on the New York Stock Exchange. At 5:15 p.m. EST, it was
down $1.37 1/2 at $4.50.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress approved a plan in 1998 that changed USEC from a government agency
into a private, investor-owned company. The deal included a promise by USEC
officials to keep open the Portsmouth plant and the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion
Plant in Kentucky until Jan. 1, 2005.
</P>
<P>
	   Closing one of the plants is possible only under certain conditions. One of
those conditions, a decline in the corporate credit rating to below investment
grade -- junk bond status -- was met Friday when Standard &AMP; Poor's dropped
USEC's rating from BBB to BB-plus.
</P>
<P>
	   USEC spokeswoman Elizabeth Stuckle said the company has made no decision
about its next move.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're analyzing the Standard &AMP; Poor's downgrade as we speak,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   USEC cut 250 jobs last year and announced plans Thursday to trim 850 more
people from its work force of 3,800 at the two plants.
</P>
<P>
	   USEC has been hurt by falling prices for enriched uranium, used to fuel
nuclear power plants. The company also is losing money on a deal to buy Russia's
uranium stockpile and sell it to utility companies worldwide. The deal was set
up by the U.S. government to keep Soviet-era warhead uranium away from
terrorists and from radical nations trying to develop nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
	   Criticism of USEC is intensifying on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration should have been keeping a close eye on USEC all
along, said House Commerce Committee Chairman Tom Bliley, R-Va., but ``it seems
the administration only responds after a crisis occurs.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am especially concerned that the Clinton administration's continuing
failure to predict or plan for USEC's problems may have compromised our ability
to protect our country's national security.''

<HEADLINE> FTC Sues To Halt BP Amoco Merger  </HEADLINE>
    By BOB EGELKO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The Federal Trade Commission asked a judge Friday to
stop BP Amoco's $30 billion takeover of Atlantic Richfield Co., saying the new
company would dominate Alaska oil production and control supplies to West Coast
refiners.
</P>
<P>
	   The FTC sued the companies in U.S. District Court, seeking a preliminary
injunction to halt the merger. Commission members voted 3-2 Wednesday to oppose
the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   The merger was originally scheduled to be completed Monday. But Atlantic
Richfield spokeswoman Linda Dozier said the companies had agreed with the FTC to
await the outcome of the request for an injunction. A hearing is scheduled March
10.
</P>
<P>
	   London-based BP Amoco was created a little more than a year ago by the
merger of British Petroleum and Amoco. The company agreed last March to acquire
Los Angeles-based Atlantic Richfield, known as Arco, a purchase that would
create the second largest non-government oil company, behind Exxon Mobil.
</P>
<P>
	   BP Amoco and Arco account for about 70 percent of Alaska crude oil
production and dominate oil activities in the state. The FTC's lawsuit argued
that increased control of Alaska supplies to West Coast refiners would create a
dangerous concentration in the market.
</P>
<P>
	   "The merger will reduce competition in the market for crude oil to targeted
refineries on the West Coast by reducing the amount of (Alaska North Slope)
crude oil reserves found and developed," the suit said.
</P>
<P>
	   The result will be an increase in oil prices charged to refineries, the
commission said.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies contend the proper focus is the international oil market,
which would compensate for any effect on the price of Alaska oil.
</P>
<P>
	   BP Amoco has agreed with the state of Alaska to sell off holdings that would
reduce its share of production to 55 percent and shed part ownership in two
Alaska oil fields.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles said Thursday his state would go to court to
support the merger. He said uncertainty over the deal was hurting Alaska's
economy.

<HEADLINE> Man Gets $2.6M After Amputation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOWLING GREEN, Ky. (AP) -- A federal jury awarded more than $2.3 million in
damages to a man who said his penis and left testicle were removed without his
consent during surgery for an infection.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury on Thursday also awarded $250,000 to the man's wife.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorneys argued that the amputation was medically necessary. They
did not return messages seeking comment on the verdict.
</P>
<P>
	   William Rogers' lawsuit says he was admitted to T.J. Samson Community
Hospital in Glasgow three times in 1997 for treatment of an infected cyst in one
of his legs. The infection later spread to his groin and he underwent surgery to
remove the cyst and other infected areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Rogers, 54, said he never was told that amputation was a possibility during
surgery.
</P>
<P>
	   He sued the hospital and physicians Gilman Peterson and Milton Slocum.
</P>
<P>
	   Jurors awarded $1.9 million to Rogers for pain and suffering and $449,832
for past and future medical bills. The hospital was not found to be at fault.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My clients were happy with the verdict,'' Rogers' attorney, Steven D.
Downey, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Rogers moved to Indiana because of his embarrassment and humiliation,
according to court records.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Plans Money To Save Salmon  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN HUGHES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A permanent conservation fund that President Clinton will
propose Monday includes $100 million for initiatives to preserve salmon in four
West Coast states, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   If Clinton gets his way, the money to save salmon in Alaska, Washington,
Oregon and California would be replenished automatically at $100 million each
year for at least a decade.
</P>
<P>
	   The money would go to the states annually without approval from Congress --
if Congress agrees to enact Clinton's ``Lands Legacy'' program into law this
year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fact that we've come back and asked for the full $100 million, and
this year proposed in addition that it be made permanent, shows how serious we
are about making this a priority,'' said George Frampton, chairman of the White
House Council on Environmental Quality.
</P>
<P>
	   In all, Clinton is proposing $290 million for salmon conservation programs
in the West and Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
	   That includes $91 million for U.S. Army Corps of Engineers projects in the
Columbia-Snake river system; $60 million to implement the Pacific Salmon Treaty
between the United States and Canada; and $39 million for the National Marine
Fisheries Service's salmon recovery efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposals represent increases of 30 percent or more over what Congress
approved last year for salmon.
</P>
<P>
	   Salmon are a cultural icon on the Pacific Northwest and have been suffering
for decades from dams, development, overfishing, runoff and other problems.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, Oregon, Idaho and California, 26 salmon populations are
threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton first proposed the $100 million to help rebuild coastal salmon
stocks a year ago, but Congress approved just $58 million for the effort.
</P>
<P>
	   Frampton declined to discuss other details of the ``Lands Legacy'' proposal
until the administration reveals its fiscal 2001 budget on Monday. But he said
the program will use off-shore oil drilling royalties and other revenues to
create a permanent, dedicated fund for environmental preservation.
</P>
<P>
	   The House Resources Committee last November approved a bill that is similar
to what the administration is proposing. The measure would set aside more than
60 percent of off-shore oil drilling revenues for buying land and conserving
coastline. But that measure, which is pending on the House floor, did not single
out salmon for funding.

    DALLAS (AP) -- 7-Eleven Inc. president and chief executive Clark J. Matthews
II will retire in April and be succeeded by chief operating officer James W.
Keyes.
</P>
<P>
	   Matthews, 63, has been president and chief executive since 1991 when the
Dallas-based convenience-store company, then known as Southland Corp., emerged
from bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
	   The announcement Thursday came the same day that the company reported a 52
percent jump in net income in the fourth quarter, to $10.5 million, or 3 cents a
share, compared to $6.9 million, or 2 cents a share, in the same quarter of
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, the chain reported net income of $83.1 million, or 18 cents
a share, compared to $74 million, or 17 cents a share, in 1998. Revenue for the
year grew nearly 14 percent, to $8.35 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Matthews joined 7-Eleven in 1965 as an attorney and became vice president
and general counsel in 1973. He rose to executive vice president and chief
financial officer in 1979.
</P>
<P>
	   Matthews will remain on the company's board of directors, the company said.

<HEADLINE> Interfaith prayers mark anniversary of Amadou Diallo's death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Exactly a year ago, 41 police bullets made Amadou Diallo
a martyr. On Friday, several hundreds of people joined Diallo's family for a
candlelight vigil on the Bronx block where he was shot.
<P>
	   " We think what happened to him should not happen to anyone anywhere in the
world," said Kadiatou Diallo, his mother. "We pray and hope that justice will be
done. We don't want this child to die in vain. Make sure he will not be
forgotten."
</P>
<P>
	   Joining his mother - on a tiny stage erected directly in front of the home
where he was shot - were his father, Saikou Diallo, his three siblings, and Rev.
Al Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
	   The violence that prompted charges of police brutality was also softened by
prayers at an interfaith healing service held earlier on Friday and several days
after four police officers went on trial in the shooting of the unarmed
immigrant.
</P>
<P>
	   "Is this the proper time to talk about healing?" asked Sheik Abd'Allah Latif
Ali during a sermon at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine.
</P>
<P>
	   The Muslim cleric noted that some observers were concerned that such a
service could damage the prosecutors' case.
</P>
<P>
	   But he said it was the Diallo family "who inspired me to say, 'We need a
healing service.' ... a healing to parallel the court process."
</P>
<P>
	   Chairs reserved for Diallo's parents remained empty during the two-hour
memorial that included rites following Islamic, Christian, Jewish, Hindu and
Native American traditions.
</P>
<P>
	   The massive cathedral on Manhattan's Upper West Side was chosen for the
service as "a place of compassion, a place of justice, and a place of community
healing," said its dean, the Very Rev. Harry Pritchett, Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   For some on Friday, that meant compassion for both Diallo and the officers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Very Rev. James P. Morton pointed to "the many injustices that befell so
many immigrants, so many people of color."
</P>
<P>
	   But we must not forget "the suffering that (the officers) and their families
are enduring at this moment," the head of New York's Interfaith Center told
several hundred people gathered in the stone-and-stained-glass house of worship.
</P>
<P>
	   At least one member of the congregation disagreed.

</P>
<P>
	   During the vigil Friday, many in the crowd inspected the bullet holes which
had riddled the vestibule. Others scribbled notes upon the walls of the
entrance, which was well-lit.
</P>
<P>
	   The fact that the vestibule was illuminated touched on a key point in the
court case. Prosecutors have said the police officers should have been able to
see into the entrance well enough, while defense attorneys argue that it was too
dark for them to see Diallo was reaching for his wallet and not for a weapon.
</P>
<P>
	   For Bertrand Simmons, a 71-year-old neighbor of Diallo's, watching the vigil
from his first-floor apartment brought back memories of the victim.
</P>
<P>
	   And then he wondered how the officers could make their claim about the lack
of light when, "they saw him well enough to shoot 19 bullets into his body."

<HEADLINE> Bradley, Gore Sharpen Differences  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) -- Bill Bradley, keeping his criticism strong and
personal, accused Democratic rival Al Gore on Friday of practicing politics
designed to ``rip your opponent's lungs out.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's spokesman said Bradley's daily comments were sounding more and more
like the Republicans' ``standard attack lines,'' and he wondered aloud if the
former senator was planning to leave the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The watchword is attack, deny, distort,'' Bradley said of Gore. ``It's the
old politics that says the ends justify the means, any means to win an election
and the end is holding power and not exercising power to do good.''
</P>
<P>
	   At a college rally, Bradley told about 500 students that he will continue to
underscore his differences with Gore as the two head into the big round of
primary elections March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a campaign about differences,'' said Bradley, though his comments
about Gore focused on political style more than policy issues.
</P>
<P>
	   He told his audience at the University of Maryland that the nation's
political climate has shifted ``in the last decade.'' President Clinton and Gore
have led the government for most of that period.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Partisanship and negative campaigning have driven people further and
further away,'' Bradley said. ``In 1991, Al Gore told his hometown newspaper
that in order to win an election you have to rip your opponent's lungs out and
then move on.''
</P>
<P>
	   He accused Gore of ``relentlessly negative'' campaigning, and said, ``I'm
trying to be direct with people.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane had a different reading.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Over the last two weeks, Senator Bradley has been mimicking and amplifying
the Republican National Committee's standard attack lines. He has flirted with
leaving the Democratic Party, and he appears to be following in that
direction,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
	   He defended Gore's recent comments, saying the vice president has merely
pointed out Bradley flaws.
</P>
<P>
	   After Iowa and New Hampshire, the campaign's focus has now shifted to giant
media markets, including New York and California, which are part of the March 7
lineup.
</P>
<P>
	   Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo said Friday he is taking a lead role in Al
Gore's New York campaign and will travel extensively around his home state
stumping for the vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   The heightened visibility by Cuomo -- who is mulling a run for governor in
New York -- began with an appearance at a senior citizen center Friday in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Gore and Bradley have begun to sharpen their distinctions, developing
sound-bite stump themes aimed beyond the audience showing up at campaign events.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It requires a national campaign that is more media oriented,'' Bradley
said. ``This is a campaign not just about me, but it's also a campaign about
him. It's a campaign about differences.''
</P>
<P>
	   The two men have been campaigning relentlessly since long before Tuesday's
New Hampshire primary, in which Gore handed Bradley his second consecutive
defeat. But now they are being forced to dash from coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
	   Both are taking time off this weekend, and it's likely they'll huddle with
aides to shape a strategy for the crucial next month.
</P>
<P>
	   As Bradley has become more personal in his criticism, the vice president has
responded by arguing that Bradley is being driven by desperation after losing in
Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, Bradley aides distributed a transcript of a television program on
which former Republican Sen. Alan Simpson said Gore traded his support for the
Gulf War a decade ago for a prominent speaking role in the Senate debate.
</P>
<P>
	   In his remarks at the Maryland event, Bradley said New Hampshire students
had been intimidated from voting, suggesting while not directly charging that
the Gore camp was behind it. He said state officials warned students their aid
could be threatened by voter registration changes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That kind of voter intimidation would be illegal if it involved
African-Americans,'' Bradley said. ``This is a serious, serious issue.''

<HEADLINE> New Austria Coalition Takes Power  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE JAHN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- A governing coalition tainted by a party identified
with Nazi sympathies took power Friday, triggering diplomatic sanctions and
egg-throwing protests that forced the new ministers to leave the swearing-in
ceremony through an underground tunnel.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no Hitler on the rise,'' the new chancellor, Wolfgang Schuessel
of the People's Party, told a nationwide television audience.
</P>
<P>
	   President Thomas Klestil, who swore in the new center-right coalition,
appealed to the world to give the new government a chance to fulfill its
promises to govern under European standards of democracy and human rights.
</P>
<P>
	   As the ministers were taking their oaths, some 5,000 protesters massed
outside the presidential offices, pelting police with eggs and paint.
</P>
<P>
	   One protester, Wilhelm Popovic, said he was showing his opposition ``in the
name of my father,'' who he said spent seven years in a Nazi concentration camp
``because of policies like this.''
</P>
<P>
	   Later Friday, protesters roamed downtown Vienna, briefly taking over the
Social Affairs Ministry and destroying several police cars.
</P>
<P>
	   Late Friday, police used water cannon and tear gas to disperse a group of
demonstrators in front of the Freedom party office on Kaerntner Strasse, the
capital's main street and a tourist center lined with expensive boutiques.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 30 police were injured in the daylong clashes with protesters.
Smaller protests took place in Linz, Graz and Innsbruck.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel did not even wait for the government to be sworn in. Its ambassador
flew home hours before the coalition of the center-right Austrian People's Party
and Joerg Haider's far-right Freedom Party took office.
</P>
<P>
	   And one by one, the 14 nations sharing European Union membership with
Austria started reducing diplomatic ties, canceling contracts and official
visits and freezing high-level contacts.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said U.S. Ambassador Kathryn Walt-Hall
would leave for Washington to report and then return to Vienna to monitor the
political crisis. The State Department said the action did not amount to a
recall.
</P>
<P>
	   Klestil had repeatedly warned that Freedom Party participation in government
would produce a fierce reaction because of Haider's anti-foreigner stand,
opposition to European Union expansion and his past praise of Nazi policies.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider won international notoriety for statements praising Adolf Hitler's
``orderly employment'' policies and lauding veterans of the Waffen SS as
``decent people of good character'' -- comments for which he has since
apologized.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Klestil indicated he had little choice but to approve the governing
coalition. In the Oct. 3 elections, the People's Party and Freedom Party won 104
of the 183 parliament seats.
</P>
<P>
	   In a televised address, Klestil expressed his personal ``concern and
dismay'' over the negative foreign reaction and domestic turmoil. He urged all
``to give the new federal government a chance and to judge it by its work.''
</P>
<P>
	   The new government will give the far right wing a greater voice in Austrian
policies than in any other European country. Schuessel is the leader of the
People's Party, junior partner in the outgoing center-left coalition with the
Social Democrats. Freedom Party member Suzanne Riess-Passer is vice chancellor.
</P>
<P>
	   Haider is not part of the new government and remains governor of Carinthia
province. But critics fear he will influence government policies from the wings.
</P>
<P>
	   Many European Union governments fear that the success of Haider's party
could boost rightist parties in their own countries.
</P>
<P>
	   In Belgium, where a far-right party is expected to make big election gains
this year, the defense minister suspended an order for six Austrian-made
ambulances, schools canceled ski trips to Austria and universities flew the
blue-and-gold European flag at half-staff.
</P>
<P>
	   France's defense minister postponed a meeting with Austria on European
defense and Portugal's president called off a state visit in March.

<HEADLINE> Analysis of Bush's Latest Commercial  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   An analysis of George W. Bush's latest television commercial, which responds
to an earlier ad by John McCain:
</P>
<P>
	   TITLE: ``Solid Values.''
</P>
<P>
	   LENGTH: 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   PRODUCER: Maverick Media.
</P>
<P>
	   AIRING: South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   SCRIPT: (Announcer:) ``John McCain's ad about Governor Bush isn't true and
McCain knows it. McCain's economic advisor says he'd support Bush's plan -- $2
trillion to protect Social Security, pay down debt and a real tax cut. McCain's
plan? A tax cut smaller than Clinton's, and not a penny in tax cuts for 30
million Americans. On taxes, McCain echoes Washington Democrats when we need a
conservative leader to challenge them. Governor Bush. Proven. Tested. And ready
to lead America.''
</P>
<P>
	   KEY IMAGES: Words on screen echoing the announcer's script. Ends with images
of Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ANALYSIS: In the sharpest ad of his campaign, Bush takes on a McCain spot
now airing in South Carolina. Bush opted against a similar response when McCain
aired this ad in New Hampshire, but that was before the governor was walloped in
the primary. Newly aggressive, Bush's team is going on the attack, even though
it means the campaign may appear defensive.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain and Bush have been battling for weeks over how large a tax cut the
nation can afford, with Bush proposing a $483 billion, five-year tax cut plan --
about double McCain. The Arizona senator says more money is needed to pay down
the debt and secure Social Security and Bush argues that any money left in
Washington will be spent on federal programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush ad objects to a line in the McCain ad where McCain says: ``There's
one difference between me and the others. I won't take every last dime of the
surplus and spend it on tax cuts...'' Bush protests that his plan saves $2
trillion over 10 years for the retirement program.
</P>
<P>
	   Who's right? Arguably, both. The surplus is actually made up of two streams
of cash. There's the extra money pouring into the Social Security trust fund and
then there's extra money coming into the general treasury from other federal
taxes and fees. Both men leave the Social Security surplus untouched, but Bush
spends most of the rest on tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's ad is right when he says McCain's tax plan is closer to the smaller
tax cuts that Democrats prefer. And he's right that the McCain plan would not
mean a tax cut for everyone. But he's misleading when he says ``McCain's
economic adviser'' said he'd support Bush's plan. He's referring to former Rep.
Vin Weber of Minnesota -- a McCain supporter but hardly the man who shapes
economic policy for the campaign. And the ad takes Weber's quote out of context;
Weber said he would support the Bush plan if it were presented to him as a
member of Congress, but he prefers McCain's approach.
</P>
<P>
	   Finally, Bush charges that McCain's tax cut is smaller than Clinton's, and
it is if you account for the $150 billion in tax loopholes that McCain would
close. Closing a loophole amounts to raising taxes somewhere, but McCain rightly
notes that generally this affects special interests rather than regular
Americans.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Party Reaches Impasse in Probe  </HEADLINE>
   By TONY CZUCZKA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) -- Germany's scandal-plagued Christian Democrats said
Friday they had reached an impasse in identifying the sources of millions in
covert campaign donations, even while tracing more money solicited by Helmut
Kohl than the ex-chancellor had acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
	   But in an impassioned television interview, Kohl denied any knowledge of the
party holding alleged secret accounts abroad and said he had done all he could
-- short of breaking his word to unnamed donors -- to help the Christian
Democrats untangle the scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have served this party as no one else has, and I have served this
country,'' Kohl said on Germany's ZDF. ``I knew absolutely nothing about secret
accounts, I had nothing to do with them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Party leaders said after a meeting in Bonn that interviews with key players
who set up a network of secret accounts failed to establish who gave Kohl the $1
million he said he received between 1993 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   And while Kohl admitted for the first time that he also received funds
between 1989 and 1992, he said they were relatively small amounts and he could
not remember the donors, party officials told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Party general secretary Angela Merkel said ``the cartel of silence'' by
former Kohl aides had been broken. But because the aides repeatedly contradicted
each other and Kohl refused to cooperate, she added: ``We have gotten as far as
we could.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Of course you can't regain credibility with one stroke with these
revelations,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Chairman Wolfgang Schaeuble said he would leave further investigation to
Bonn prosecutors pursuing a criminal probe against Kohl and a parliament
committee examining whether political donations bought decisions during Kohl's
16 years in power.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of Kohl's steadfast silence -- or memory gaps -- on the money
sources, the party's report fell short of expectations that it would unravel
crucial elements of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, while clearing up some aspects, it added more unresolved questions
and exposed the inner workings of a slush fund under Kohl that involved discreet
cash handovers, Swiss accounts and campaign funds kept off the books.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have a whole list of new, and painful, findings,'' Schaeuble said.
</P>
<P>
	   They included confirmation that the secret party accounts dated from 1971 --
earlier than previously acknowledged -- included accounts abroad, and that Kohl
had directly accepted more money than he has so far admitted.
</P>
<P>
	   Party manager Willi Hausmann said a top party official, Uwe Luethje,
recalled that Kohl turned over $1 million to $1.5 million in cash donations from
1989 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl conceded that he had received funds during that period, but said the
amount was ``significantly lower'' than Luethje's recollection, Hausmann said.
</P>
<P>
	   Former party tax adviser Horst Weyrauch revealed the federal party had
diverted money to a Swiss account, Hausmann said. Previously, only the Hesse
state party branch had been linked to accounts held abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   Weyrauch also told investigators that Hans Terlinden, the former money
handler at the party's national headquarters, once told him he believed one
source of money was German television mogul Leo Kirch, Hausmann said.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Terlinden said he could not recall ever saying that, Hausmann said,
and Kirch has denied making any anonymous donations.

<HEADLINE> US Mediation Sought in Mideast Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By DANA BUDEIRI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat asked for
international help Friday in its dealings with Israel, saying peace talks had
hit an ``unprecedented crisis.''
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat was furious over a summit with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
Thursday that ended in sharp disagreement over the location of West Bank
territory Israel is to hand over next week.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel has downplayed the dispute, but the Palestinians on Friday used
uncharacteristically sharp language to express their anger.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Barak completely backed off yesterday from all agreements, dates and
stages of the withdrawals, using unfounded pretexts,'' Arafat said in a
statement issued after the Palestinian Cabinet's weekly meeting. ``The
Palestinian-Israeli negotiations are going through a major, unprecedented
crisis.''
</P>
<P>
	   Israel and the Palestinians face a Feb. 13 deadline for a framework for a
final peace treaty, which after the failed summit appeared unattainable.
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat met with U.S. mediator Dennis Ross for more than three hours Friday
night after calling for ``European, American and Arab intervention.'' The
Cabinet statement said that help was needed immediately ``to salvage the peace
process from imminent collapse and the return of anarchy to the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
	   After the meeting, Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Ross would meet
with Israeli and Palestinian officials Saturday for a joint ``hearing'' in which
both sides would present their positions.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel has rejected intensive international mediation, saying it was up to
the two sides to resolve their disputes.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak adviser Danny Yatom denied on Israel Radio that talks were in crisis,
but warned that the withdrawal dispute should not prevent negotiators from
bridging the gaps in a final treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   Negotiators have been conducting marathon 10-day talks to reach the
framework agreement, but little progress has been made so far. It was assumed
that the Barak-Arafat summit would focus on the peace treaty, but it broke up
over the interim negotiations, which are being conducted in parallel.
</P>
<P>
	   The Palestinians rejected the remote West Bank territory Israel planned to
hand over in the coming days, as part of interim agreements, holding out for
villages bordering Jerusalem. The Israelis said the agreement allows them to
make that decision themselves, but the Palestinians insisted that they must be
consulted.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers in SLA Case Resist Testimony  </HEADLINE>
   By LINDA DEUTSCH AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Prosecutors of former fugitive Sara Jane Olson resisted
a defense request Friday to take emergency testimony from a key witness who may
die before Olson goes to trial on bombing conspiracy charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors said during a hearing that they had not been provided anything
on what the witness may say and could not prepare for the testimony. But defense
lawyer Susan Jordan accused them of ulterior motives.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a smokescreen,'' she said, ``They want to let this witness die.''
</P>
<P>
	   Friday's hearing came on the anniversary of the Feb. 4, 1974, kidnapping of
Patty Hearst by the Symbionese Liberation Army, an event which dominated
headlines in the 1970s as Hearst and her captors robbed banks and fled from the
law. Six members of the SLA were killed in their Los Angeles hideout in a
shootout with police.
</P>
<P>
	   Olson, formerly known as Kathleen Ann Soliah, is accused of conspiring to
murder by planting pipe bombs under two Los Angeles police cars in a 1975 plot
to avenge the SLA shootout deaths. The bombs did not explode and no one was
injured.
</P>
<P>
	   Jordan asked for court permission to take a deposition from onetime radical
sports writer Jack Scott, who arranged the cross-country flight of Hearst when
she was the most-wanted fugitive in the nation. Scott, 57, is dying of throat
cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   Scott is the witness most likely to contradict Hearst, the expected star
witness of the prosecution case.
</P>
<P>
	   In a declaration filed with the court, Jordan outlined Scott's claims made
during an FBI interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Among them were: Hearst told him she had arranged her own kidnapping in
order to escape her impending marriage and that she stayed with the SLA because
the group treated her so well.
</P>
<P>
	   Jordan said Scott's testimony would directly impeach the story of fear and
loathing of the SLA which Hearst has told over the years and is expected to
repeat when she is called to testify.
</P>
<P>
	   Superior Court Judge James Ideman said he would take up the issue of
emergency testimony at a hearing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Olson was indicted in 1976. During her years as a fugitive she became a
doctor's wife and mother of three, a community activist and actress in local
productions in St. Paul, Minn.

<HEADLINE> Russians Close on Grozny Rebels  </HEADLINE>
   By LYOMA TURPALOV Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALKHAN-KALA, Russia (AP) -- Russian troops backed by mortar fire and air
bombardment closed in Friday on small bands of rebels scattered among Grozny's
shell-shattered houses and high-rises.
</P>
<P>
	   Artillery and rocket fire shook the Chechen capital overnight, and
helicopter gunships blasted the city in the morning. Shelling persisted off and
on throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
	   Street fighting was concentrated just west of strategic Minutka Square,
which the Russians seized earlier this week, and in part of eastern Grozny, the
Russian military command said.
</P>
<P>
	   At least 3,000 rebels have fled the capital since Monday, militants say.
Although they suffered heavy losses in their escape, many more fighters made it
out alive and were moving toward the rugged, southern mountains, where thousands
of their comrades are believed to be based.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside the capital, tanks ringed villages and helicopters clattered
overhead as Russian soldiers searched house to house for militants. Scores of
dead militants were still lying on the frozen ground near Alkhan-Kala, days
after hundreds of rebels blundered into a minefield as they escaped Grozny.
</P>
<P>
	   As the rebels filtered into villages west of Grozny, many of the communities
came under attack, said Chechen refugees in the neighboring republic of
Ingushetia. The main checkpoint into Ingushetia was closed Friday to most people
because of reports of nearby fighting.
</P>
<P>
	   In Achkoi-Martan, a large town in western Chechnya, there were ``scenes of
panic'' as rumors spread that rebels were coming and that Russian forces would
attack, said refugee Satsita Askhlanova.
</P>
<P>
	   The deputy chief of the Russian General Staff, Col. Gen. Valery Manilov,
claimed Friday that Russia's military was blocking rebel attempts to reach the
mountains.
</P>
<P>
	   But residents of villages along the escape route said the Russians had
arrived only after large groups of fighters had already left, and that small
groups that fled Grozny overnight had slipped past Russian lines.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels insist the outbreak has strengthened their position, by freeing
them from blockaded Grozny and allowing them more mobility to wage a guerrilla
war.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russians claim that the rebels' exodus, as well as the deaths of
prominent commanders in the minefield, signals that federal forces have the
upper hand.
</P>
<P>
	   Manilov told a news conference in Moscow that Russia had decided to prepare
to start pulling troops out of Chechnya because of the recent changes in
fighting. He gave no date or specifics.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian officials say that about 93,000 troops are deployed in and around
Chechnya. Officials said this week that they were preparing plans for a
15,000-strong, permanent troop presence in the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
	   Manilov said that since the beginning of October, 1,063 Russian servicemen
had been killed, 3,181 injured, and 41 missing. The reported death toll was only
slightly higher than a Jan. 25 announcement of 1,055, and the military is widely
believed to be underreporting Russian casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian troops entered Chechnya in September after an invasion by
Chechen-based militants into the neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan, and
deadly apartment bombings elsewhere in Russia that were blamed on Chechens.

<HEADLINE> Man Charged in Pregnant Teen Case  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHELLE RUSHLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- A 37-year-old man was arrested Friday on charges he had sex
with a teen-age girl the Arizona Supreme Court permitted last year to go to
another state for a late-term abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   The girl, who is a ward of the state, received court permission in August to
go to Kansas for an abortion because no Arizona clinics perform them after the
20th week of pregnancy. She was 14 and said to have been in the 25th week of
pregnancy, though most information about her is sealed.
</P>
<P>
	   Glendale police spokesman Matthew Brown said the investigation took about
six months because the girl, who is now 15, didn't cooperate initially and
because they had to wait for DNA test results.
</P>
<P>
	   She later identified Phillip Rivera to authorities, who obtained DNA samples
from her, the aborted fetus and Rivera, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rivera, a Phoenix telemarketer, was indicted Thursday for sexual conduct
with a minor and dangerous crimes against children -- felonies that could bring
up to 4 1/2 years in prison, said Bill FitzGerald, a spokesman for the Maricopa
County Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
	   Police arrested Rivera at a halfway house for drug probationers in central
Phoenix, said Glendale police spokesman Matthew Brown.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately clear if Rivera had an attorney yet.
</P>
<P>
	   The abortion order reached the state's highest court after lower court
judges ruled that Arizona law banned abortion of a viable fetus unless the life
or health of the mother was endangered.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona Supreme Court said the teen had a constitutional right to travel
and the state cannot apply its abortion restrictions on procedures performed in
other states.
</P>
<P>
	   The court also said that because the girl was too young to consent to sex
under Arizona law, her alleged contact with Rivera would be considered statutory
rape, giving her the right under federal law to a therapeutic abortion.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Maker Suing Insurers  </HEADLINE>
    By PATRICK REYNA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Cigarette maker Liggett Group Inc. is going to court to get
its own insurance companies to pay its defense bills and settlements in lawsuits
brought over smoking's effects.
</P>
<P>
	   Liggett confirmed that it is taking legal action against its insurance
companies and is seeking a declaratory judgment against them to pay attorney
fees, settlement costs and other litigation-related costs.
</P>
<P>
	   "In response to inquiries, Brooke Group Ltd. today confirmed that its
Liggett Group Inc. tobacco subsidiary recently made necessary filings to
preserve potential claims for insurance coverage," Miami-based Brooke Group said
in a statement issued late Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Brooke Group spokesman Paul Caminiti, interviewed on the phone from New
York, declined to expand on the limited response.
</P>
<P>
	   The Durham, N.C.-based Liggett is undertaking the suit alone and not working
in conjuction with the other tobacco companies, said one source familiar with
the suit, who would only talk on condition of anonymity. The suit was filed in
an unidentified state court, the source added.
</P>
<P>
	   Brooke Group's statement, in response to a report on the CNBC financial
cable network earlier Friday, did not identify which state court, and Caminiti
would not comment on the question.
</P>
<P>
	   Liggett is one of the tobacco company defendants in the ongoing class-action
lawsuit trial in Miami over smoking-related illness among Florida smokers. The
nation's five biggest cigarette makers face a potential $300 billion punitive
damage verdict, if the Miami jury allows compensatory damages for any of three
smokers whose cases have been central to the plaintiffs' case.
</P>
<P>
	   The source said Liggett is seeking relief from its 30 insurers that are
solvent, as well as insolvent insurer American Mutual, which insured Liggett
from 1911 through the 1970s. Because American Mutual is insolvent, Liggett has
filed in all 50 states to notify each state's Guaranty Fund that Liggett is
seeking to recover defense and indemnity costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the insurers being sued is Connecticut-based Hartford Life Inc., CNBC
said. A spokeswoman told CNBC that the company has filed its own statement in
Connecticut state court seeking declaratory relief from any judgment.
</P>
<P>
	   Phone calls left with officials at Hartford Life after business hours Friday
were not immediately returned.

<HEADLINE> Media seek access to court hearing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - A lawyer for the 39-year-old suspect charged in
the 1975 murder of a Greenwich teen-ager says he is in favor of opening up the
arraignment in juvenile court next week.
<P>
	   "I'm absolutely not opposed to it," said Michael Sherman, attorney for
Michael Skakel. "There's been enough of the 'Kennedy kin cover-up' garbage," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Skakel, a nephew of Ethel and the late U.S. Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, is
scheduled to be arraigned in the murder of Martha Moxley in Stamford Juvenile
Court on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Skakel's case is in juvenile court, at least for now, because he was 15 in
October 1975, when he is alleged to have killed Moxley, who was then his
15-year-old neighbor in Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
	   Several newspapers have filed a motion to open up the hearing to the public.
Normally, juvenile proceedings are held in closed courtrooms to protect children
from negative publicity that might affect their rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
	   The Advocate of Stamford, Greenwich Time, The Hartford Courant, Newsday and
The New York Times Thursday filed a motion seeking access to Skakel's
arraignment. A hearing is scheduled for Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The media motion argues that concerns that typically justify sealing a
juvenile courtroom don't apply in Skakel's case.
</P>
<P>
	   The motion notes that Skakel is now an adult, and his name and the charges
against him are already known throughout the state and the nation.
</P>
<P>
	   "Indeed, Mr. Skakel's legal team has already sought and received significant
media coverage publicly naming him as the person charged in the murder of Martha
Moxley, and invited the public scrutiny of these proceedings," the motion
states.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney Mark Kravitz said he believes Sherman's support of the motion
guarantees its success.
</P>
<P>
	   "The only reason for secrecy in juvenile proceedings is to protect the
child," Kravitz said. "We have someone who is not a child, and someone who is
agreeing to have it open."
</P>
<P>
	   Even though Sherman said he would not oppose the media's motion to open the
proceedings, he would not go so far as to say he would waive confidentiality -
an option open to the defendant - if the motion fails.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'll cross that bridge when I come to it," Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Skakel surrendered to police in Greenwich on Jan. 19 after a warrant was
issued for his arrest on the recommendation of a grand jury consisting of a
single judge.
</P>
<P>
	   Skakel's father, Rushton Skakel Sr., is the brother of Robert F. Kennedy's
widow, Ethel.

   ABOARD AIR FORCE TWO (AP) -- The headline, ``Bradley cranky as campaign heats
up,'' was so delicious that Al Gore put on an apron and tried out his best
French accent.
</P>
<P>
	   Madame, may I pour you some wine?
</P>
<P>
	   A linen napkin folded over his forearm, the vice president had perfected the
snooty sommelier's down-his-nose glance as he passed through the press cabin of
his airplane on an overnight flight Thursday night (from Washington state to
Washington, D.C) to score a point against his opponent, Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Salmon anyone?
</P>
<P>
	   An Associated Press report that day detailed how Bradley was cranky -- and
his press and staff entourage miserable -- as they flew the country aboard a
lamely heated campaign jet with no working oven for hot meals.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore offered his traveling reporters white wine and a china plate of fresh
salmon with garlic mashed potatoes and chowder.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As a former journalist, I was truly distressed to read of the suffering on
the Bradley plane,'' Gore deadpanned. ``Here on the Gore 2000 plane, we want to
make certain that everyone is well taken care of and if there's anything we can
do to make your travel more enjoyable please speak to me personally.''
</P>
<P>
	   One reporter offered: How about daily press conferences?
</P>
<P>
	   ``Daily wine tastings,'' Gore countered.

Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   THIS DATE FOUR YEARS AGO:
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes defended himself as ``absolutely pro-life'' because he would outlaw
late-term and sex-selection abortions while gradually urging the public to turn
against abortion. But that wasn't strong enough anti-abortion medicine for some
in the GOP.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan Gov. John Engler said voters in Republican primaries and caucuses
might want a tougher stance than that. Pat Buchanan, battling Forbes and others
for the GOP nomination, called the publisher ``pro-abortion.'' Forbes has taken
a harder line against abortion rights in the 2000 campaign.

McCain called for ``a real good debate on national security and foreign
policy.'' Forbes continued his tour of Delaware, including a town hall meeting
in Dewey Beach. Alan Keyes campaigned in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley told students at a University of Maryland rally that the Democratic

<HEADLINE> Keyes Skips Calif. GOP Convention  </HEADLINE>
   By SCOTT LINDLAW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BURLINGAME, Calif. (AP) -- GOP presidential contender Alan Keyes scrapped an
appearance at the state Republican convention this weekend, saying the party
wouldn't provide him a prime speaking slot.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes wanted to address nearly 800 party activists at a dinner Saturday
night -- a slot claimed by Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, who dropped out of the
presidential race last month. Hatch declined to relinquish his speaking spot.
</P>
<P>
	   Party spokesman Stuart DeVeaux said the convention schedule was set by the
time Keyes made his request earlier this week. ``Hatch made the request first,
so the slot went to him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP offered to let Keyes address the general session Sunday, he said.
Keyes state director Chuck Williams said the party offered a Saturday slot
before a smaller ``VIP reception.''
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes wasn't interested in flying from a Friday engagement for such a small
audience, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's worth our time to come here and speak to a packed house and do two
redeyes, in and out,'' Williams said. ``It's not worth it for five minutes at a
reception.''
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes electrified activists with fiery speeches at the last two state GOP
conventions and is hoping to capitalize on momentum he appeared to gather in
Iowa and New Hampshire, where he carried 14 percent and 9 percent of the vote,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
	   But Williams did not see a major risk in Keyes skipping the California
event. Texas Gov. George W. Bush is not attending; rivals John McCain and Steve
Forbes are.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not really a negative in terms of how it affects our campaign,''
Williams said. ``It's just an opportunity we feel was missed in California.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked whether he felt snubbed, Williams said no, but added: ``I just have a
funny feeling that if G.W. had dropped in, they would have said, 'Move over,
Hatch.'''

	   RCMP Testimony Decision Soon
</P>
<P>
	   VANCOUVER (AP) -- The head of the APEC inquiry must decide whether RCMP
officers will have to testify about infiltration and undercover techniques used
by operatives during the 1997 summit.
</P>
<P>
	   Ted Hughes must decide whether some witnesses should be recalled to give
testimony that was previously cut off by federal government lawyers who cited
national security.

have been cited about 30 times since the long-running inquiry began, said a
source with the inquiry who asked not to be named.
</P>

Association, said Hughes must decide ``whether or not the evidence of undercover
RCMP officers who were investigating protesters at APEC should be disclosed or

	   HR Faces Boondoggle Questions
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Human Resources Minister Jane Stewart has agreed to appear
before a Commons committee Thursday, and the following week, to answer questions
about a billion-dollar boondoggle in her department.
</P>
<P>
	   But Pierre Pettigrew, the man who presided over a raft of programs
criticized by auditors as poorly administered, will escape scrutiny by the
all-party human resources committee, vice chairman Bryon Wilfert said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Stewart, ``following up on the need for accountability and transparency, has
agreed officially to appear,'' Wilfert said from his Toronto-area riding.
</P>
<P>
	   As a former minister, Pettigrew will be out of the committee's reach,
Wilfert said. Procedures of the House of Commons prohibit members from asking a
former minister questions about previous portfolios, he contended.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe, since the committees are an instrument of the House, that we
would not have the ability to call Pettigrew.''
</P>
<P>
	   Wilfert was trying to find out if the same applies to former bureaucrats
like Mel Cappe, clerk of the Privy Council, who was deputy minister of Human
Resources during much of the time examined by auditors.
</P>
<P>
	   Reform MP Diane Ablonczy said Friday the Liberals are trying to hide behind
the rules.

	   Jobless Rate 6.8 Percent in Jan.
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Canada's caboose remains firmly hitched to the powerful U.S.
economic locomotive and the latest employment numbers suggest the train isn't
about to slow down.
</P>
<P>
	   The unemployment rate held steady at 6.8 percent in January, a low not seen
in almost 24 years, Statistics Canada reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The rate was unchanged from the revised December figure of 6.8 percent and
is the lowest since April 1976.
</P>
<P>
	   An estimated 44,000 jobs were created last month, most full-time.
</P>
<P>
	   But because continued strong employment reports are drawing more job-hunters
back into the market, the overall rate isn't budging.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, analysts are applauding the fact that much of the job-creation during
the last year has come in full-time positions, which tend to be better-paying
and more stable.

months visiting four provinces last year, has high hopes for the committee's

	   Toronto's Top Cop Ends Union Fight
</P>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- The city's police chief extended an olive branch to its
militant union today, the first peace offering after weeks of bitter feuding
over the union's controversial fundraising scheme.
</P>
<P>
	   Police Chief David Boothby says he won't proceed with charges of
discreditable conduct against the union brass, who bowed to public pressure on
Thursday and called off its so-called True Blue campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This morning I spoke with the trial office and I will not be proceeding
with Police Act charges,'' Boothby said.
</P>
<P>
	   He added: ``I just want to get on with business. We've got a lot of police
business out there to do, and quite frankly, in the last week or so we've been
consumed with things we shouldn't be consuming our time with.''
</P>
<P>
	   The union, which last week stopped selling windshield stickers as part of
the campaign after Boothby condemned the practice, went further Thursday and
halted the drive altogether.
</P>
<P>
	   The union was raising money for political purposes, including opposing
politicians who don't support law-and-order causes.

<HEADLINE> Loud Noise Recorded Before Crash  </HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTINE HANLEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PORT HUENEME, Calif. (AP) -- One of the ``black boxes'' aboard Alaska
Airlines Flight 261 recorded a loud noise in the minutes before the MD-83 went
out of control and plunged into the ocean, a federal investigator said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The noise was one of two revealed by analysis of the cockpit voice recorder,
said John Hammerschmidt, a member of the National Transportation Safety Board.
</P>
<P>
	   The tape revealed new details of what occurred on the flight in its last
minutes as the pilots struggled to control a problem with the horizontal
stabilizer -- the wide part of the tail that keeps a plane flying level.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane nose-dived into the Pacific Ocean en route from Puerto Vallarta,
Mexico, to San Francisco on Monday, killing all 88 aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   About 12 minutes before the end of the recording the plane apparently lost
vertical control, Hammerschmidt said.
</P>
<P>
	   The crew recovered control in about 1 1/2 minutes. Some time later, a flight
attendant is heard telling the pilots of a loud noise from the rear of the jet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The crew acknowledged that they had heard it too,'' Hammerschmidt said.
</P>
<P>
	   A second noise, which was actually recorded by the device, then sounded just
near the end of the tape.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Slightly more than one minute before the end of the recording, a loud
noise can be heard on the recording and the airplane appears to go out of
control,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane has an audible alarm to indicate a stall, or dangerous loss of
lift. No such warning is heard on the tape, Hammerschmidt said.
</P>
<P>
	   The noises -- and the fact that control was regained after the first sound
-- are consistent with a worsening structural or mechanical problem in the tail,
said William Waldock, associate director of the Center for Aerospace Safety
Education at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It sounds like something failed in the tail, and it certainly would
account for a jammed stabilizer,'' he said, but cautioned that it was impossible
to diagnose the noises without a better description of them.
</P>
<P>
	   The noises could have originated from any number of problems, including
structural failure or a compressor stall in the engines caused by erratic
airflow, said C.O. Miller, who headed the NTSB's Bureau of Safety during much of
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   Hammerschmidt said the investigation was progressing rapidly, including work
by a Navy vessel using side-scan sonar to map debris in the Santa Barbara
Channel about 10 miles from shore.
</P>
<P>
	   Sonar appeared to show the debris in a single concentration within an area
the size of a football field, and the survey was continuing one mile out in each
direction, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the debris has been videotaped by a remote-operated underwater
vehicle. Most of the debris examined so far were pieces about 5 feet or 6 feet
long, but there was a section of fuselage estimated to be 10 feet long.
</P>
<P>
	   The submersible has sent up video of the tail and a 5-foot section of the
leading edge of the horizontal stablizer, Hammerschmidt said. The stabilizer is
40 feet long.
</P>
<P>
	   The process of getting sonar pictures of the ocean floor -- sailors call it
``mowing the lawn'' -- had been expected to take two to three days, but
Hammerschmidt said it would likely be completed Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   After that, remote-operated vehicles like the one that salvaged the plane's
``black box'' flight recorders will be sent down to take video images and
eventually help retrieve bodies and wreckage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You can't do it overnight,'' said Navy Capt. Terry Labrecque. ``You have
to be methodical.''
</P>
<P>
	   The NTSB has previously said that radio transmissions and eyewitness reports
from other commercial pilots in the area show the plane turned upside down or
``corkscrewed'' into the water following a series of increasingly desperate
maneuvers that lasted at least half an hour.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Friday, relatives of victims -- many of whom worked for or were
connected with Alaska Airlines -- were preparing for another private memorial,
set for Saturday in the Pepperdine University chapel overlooking the ocean in
Malibu. On Sunday, the Coast Guard planned to drop flowers from that service
over the crash site.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifteen members of various bands of American Indians gathered on marshland
near Point Mugu Friday for a ceremony in honor of victim Morris Thompson and his
family.
</P>
<P>
	   A prominent Athabaskan Indian leader in Alaska and former commissioner for
the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Thompson, 61, his wife, Thelma, and daughter
Sheryl were killed in the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   The Indians burned sage to cleanse their spirits; passed a pipe, which is a
symbol of life; took turns leading tribal chants; then turned east, west, south
and north, some pointing feathers to the sky, to honor the four directions.
</P>
<P>
	   Only four bodies have been recovered. Relatives waited for word on further
efforts to bring back remains.
</P>
<P>
	   The wreckage lies in an underwater canyon beneath the Santa Barbara Channel,
where depths range from 90 feet at the edges to 700 feet.

<HEADLINE> Family To Get Crash Victim's Ring  </HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTINE HANLEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OXNARD, Calif. (AP) -- A ring found in floating wreckage from Alaska
Airlines Flight 261 was headed to its owner's family in Washington state Friday
after an attempt by local authorities to seize it as evidence in the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   A crewman from the fishing boat Meridian was being flown by the airline to
deliver the Mason's ring to the daughter of Bob and Patty Williams, a Poulsbo,
Wash., couple killed when the MD-83 plunged into the Santa Barbara Channel on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The ring's return was in doubt earlier Friday when Ventura County sheriff's
deputies arrived at the home of boat captain Scott Jarvis and told his wife,
Mary, that she had to turn it in rather than try to send it to the Williams'
family.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My wife called me and said they were going to arrest her if she didn't
give them the ring,'' Jarvis said. ``She wasn't giving it up -- she was that
strong in her convictions.''
</P>
<P>
	   Jarvis said that as he drove back home he phoned the Sheriff's Department
and someone there called off the detectives.
</P>
<P>
	   The department decided to allow the ring to be returned to Williams' family
but will seek ``visual documentation,'' perhaps pictures taken by news media.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are not pressing charges against Mr. Jarvis,'' said sheriff's spokesman
Eric Nishimoto. ``However, we want to emphasize that he did break the law.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sheriff's Sgt. Steve Bourke said deputies learned of the ring through news
stories on Jarvis' plan to give the ring to Williams' daughter, Tracy Knizek of
Suquamish, Wash.
</P>
<P>
	   Until she learned of its recovery, Knizek said she had struggled to accept
her parents' deaths.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Ever since I was a little girl, my dad and I had a deal. Whoever died
first, the other one would come back and tell them what it's like,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   She said it was as if her father had left the ring to say their connection
would never be broken.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When that ring came around, I thought, 'Wow.' It's just to tell us, 'This
is really happening, Tracy, this is real, and you're going to be OK and your
brothers are going to be OK.'''
</P>
<P>
	   State law says the medical examiner is responsible for a dead person's
property, Bourke said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not out to arrest anybody, and we understand his intent -- a very
emotional thing,'' he said. ``However, property like this is used to identify
people. There are official avenues.''
</P>
<P>
	   Jarvis' boat was among many that rushed to search for survivors and collect
wreckage. The ring was found the next day on deck after debris had been brought
to shore. Its ownership was determined with the help of the Masons.
</P>
<P>
	   Nishimoto emphasized that authorities don't want to lose any other evidence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't want anyone else doing this,'' he said. ``We're asking the public
not to gather personal effects and attempt to return them on their own.''
</P>
<P>
	   Jarvis' mother could not understand why authorities wanted the ring.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a father's ring,'' Cathy Jarvis said. ``It's not a black box. It's
not a part of the plane. How in the world does this have any meaning? But it is
worth an immeasurable valuable, heartfelt value.''
</P>
<P>
	   She said the intentions of her son and daughter-in-law were noble.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This ring, by all rights, should have been 700 feet down,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Avalanche-Plagued Alaska Road Opened  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- A section of the highway connecting the Kenai
Peninsula to the rest of Alaska reopened Friday afternoon, liberating
communities trapped for days by avalanches.
</P>
<P>
	   The Seward Highway was open from Anchorage south to Hope, about 70 miles
away, said state Department of Transportation spokesman Murph O'Brien. Patches
of deep, slushy snow remained in the roadway, and snow 10 feet and higher was
piled alongside.
</P>
<P>
	   A 35-mile stretch south of Hope remained closed because of the risk of new
avalanches, O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
	   One person was killed by the avalanches that started Monday, and Gov. Tony
Knowles has requested the Clinton admininstration declare the region a disaster
area.
</P>
<P>
	   The avalanches also caused power line breaks that could leave residents of
the ski resort of Girdwood and smaller communities without electricity for up to
a week.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, National Guard crews airlifted utility repair equipment, a diesel
generator and fuel to Hope, where the 150 residents were among those left
without power.
</P>
<P>
	   More bad weather was forecast for the weekend. ``If it starts snowing again,
it could start all over again,'' O'Brien said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Backer's Remark Spurs Conflict  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Five senators, four of them Democrats, urged Republican
presidential candidate George W. Bush on Friday to apologize for the actions of
a supporter who challenged Sen. John McCain's record on veteran's affairs.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and McCain are seeking the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   During a Bush event in South Carolina, veterans activist J. Thomas Burch Jr.
said McCain returned from a Vietnam prisoner of war camp and ``forgot about
us.''
</P>
<P>
	   The senators, including one of McCain's key supporters, listed his work on
behalf of veterans, and urged Bush to not associated with ``those who would
impugn John McCain's character and so maliciously distort his record on these
critical issues.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about Burch's remarks, Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said the Texas
governor ``would not say that'' about McCain. Bush called McCain an American
hero.
</P>
<P>
	   Fleischer, however, said the Arizona senator must be ``worried about
Governor Bush's strength among South Carolina veterans and is using this as a
distraction.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush and McCain are in a tight primary race in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   The senators, all veterans themselves, are Max Cleland, D-Ga., Chuck Hagel,
R-Neb., Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., John Kerry, D-Mass., and Charles Robb, D-Va. Hagel
is one of the few GOP lawmakers endorsing McCain.

<HEADLINE> Early Elections Set in Greece  </HEADLINE>
   By BRIAN MURPHY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- In an apparent bid to take advantage of unprecedented
economic advances, Greek Premier Costas Simitis ended months of speculation and
called early elections Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   With his Socialist Party holding 161 of 300 seats in the current parliament,
Simitis announced he would move scheduled elections up from September to April
9.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision could bring some stability to the Athens Stock Exchange, which
had risen sharply since 1998 but recently stumbled. The main share index spiked
sharply higher after the election date was set.
</P>
<P>
	   Opposition parties and the media had put pressure on Simitis to clarify the
government's position on elections. Supporters believe the time was ripe for the
Socialists, which some opinion polls show to be in a tight race with the
conservative opposition New Democracy party.
</P>
<P>
	   A New Democracy statement said it was ``pleased'' that there would be early
elections, and predicted ``certain victory.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the Socialists have powerful bragging rights, after bringing Greece to
its strongest economic position after double-digit inflation in the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   Entry into the euro, EU's single currency group, has been the mainstay of
Simitis' policies for the past several years. Tight fiscal policies have brought
inflation below 3 percent and tackled the debt that once crippled the EU's
poorest nation. Now, EU leaders have signaled that Greece will likely be
accepted into the euro zone, or EMU.
</P>
<P>
	   Greece's formal application is expected in March, and an EU vote is
predicted for June.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The country needs a strong government to negotiate EMU entry,'' Simitis
said in a nationally televised address. ``Elections must be held after the bid
is submitted.''
</P>
<P>
	   Greece was the only nation that wanted to enter the single currency bloc but
failed to meet the fiscal standards.
</P>
<P>
	   The Socialists also hope to capitalize on recently improving relations with
Turkey, whose foreign minister, Ismail Cem, was in Athens on Friday for talks --
the first official visit by such a high level Turkish diplomat since 1960.
</P>
<P>
	   Also helping the Socialists is the recent completion of some long-awaited
public works projects. Last week, Simitis inaugurated Athens' new subway system,
including 13 stations decorated with ancient artifacts and linking the most
populated areas in the traffic-clogged city.
</P>
<P>
	   Seeking the support of labor unions, which once complained bitterly about
the Socialists' austerity measures, leaders slashed rates on farmers' loans this
week, and promised more than 10,000 contract workers permanent jobs in the
public sector.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Greek Communist Party has said the moves were just pre-election
window dressing, and predicted the government would return to slashing social
spending if it wins.
</P>
<P>
	   The Socialists have led Greece for 16 of the past 19 years.

<HEADLINE> Gay-Straight School Club To Meet  </HEADLINE>
   By CHELSEA J. CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- A federal judge Friday ordered school officials to
allow a gay tolerance club to meet on campus pending resolution of a lawsuit,
saying they would otherwise suffer ``irreparable harm.''
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Court Judge David O. Carter issued the preliminary injunction
against the Orange Unified School District while a lawsuit filed by two El
Modena High School students plays out in court.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Plaintiffs have been injured not only by the board's excessive delay, but
also by the inability to effectively address the hardships they encounter at
school every day,'' Carter said in a written ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter denied a request by attorneys for the school district to stay the
order pending an appeal. School district officials did not immediately return a
telephone call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside of the courthouse, protesters chanted anti-gay slogans and carried
placards. ``Gay clubs are propaganda,'' read one sign.
</P>
<P>
	   The students filed the federal lawsuit in November, saying the board
discriminated and violated their free speech rights. The following month, the
board, which had earlier put off making a decision, voted unanimously not to
allow the club.
</P>
<P>
	   In court papers, attorneys for the school district said the club was
disallowed because it covers issues taught in the sex education curriculum. The
district said it would reconsider the club if it changed its name and refrained
from discussing human sexuality topics.
</P>
<P>
	   Students Anthony Colin, 15, and Heather Zetin, 16, have said their proposed
Gay-Straight Alliance Club is meant as a forum for gay students to discuss
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither student was in court today. But their parents expressed relief with
the judge's ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's about who these kids are. It's about who they love. It's not about
sex,'' said Zetin's mother, Judy Anderson.
</P>
<P>
	   El Modena already allows clubs that represent Christians and ethnic
minorities.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Braces for Protests  </HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BAJAK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEIVA, Colombia (AP) -- The government is bracing from protests when
U.S.-trained troops push into a southern region this year to wipe out Colombia's
largest concentration of cocaine-producing plants, the defense minister said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's predictable that there's going to be violence and marches,'' the
official, Luis Fernando Ramirez, told U.S. reporters during a trip highlighting
drug eradication efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   Spearheaded by a new 950-man narcotics battalion, the government intends to
move shortly into Putumayo State, where authorities estimate about a third of
Colombia's coca crop is grown.
</P>
<P>
	   Although U.S. officials don't expect to release 1999 figures until later
this month, they say Colombia's illicit coca crop increased dramatically over
the past year.
</P>
<P>
	   One reason is the increasing involvement of leftist rebels who tax and
regulate the drug trade in their vast areas of control. Guerrillas regularly
fire on herbicide-spraying planes in defense of peasants' coca plots and fields
of heroin-producing opium poppies.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, Ramirez and police director Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano proudly
displayed three new Blackhawk helicopters donated by Washington to help
eradication efforts. Colombia supplies 80 percent of the world's cocaine and is
a growing heroin producer.
</P>
<P>
	   They flew journalists to an opium plot in a steep Andean valley near this
southwestern city, depositing the reporters on a 7,500-foot hillside.
</P>
<P>
	   As heavily armed police commandos scanned ridges for rebels, a TurboThrush
crop-duster dive-bombed the plot. The reporters and their hosts were covered in
a drizzle of the herbicide glyphosate.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress is expected to debate this month a proposed $1.6 billion aid
package for Colombia that would pay for two more battalions, dozens of attack
helicopters and funds for weaning peasants off illegal crops.
</P>
<P>
	   Ramirez would not specify a timetable for the army's southern thrust.
</P>
<P>
	   President Andres Pastrana's government cannot proceed, he said, without a
comprehensive strategy for dealing with the tens of thousands of peasants living
in the state who depend on coca income to feed their families.
</P>
<P>
	   Without providing alternatives, the potential exists for unrest far worse
than 1996 riots by tens of thousands coca growers in adjacent Caqueta State in
which at least six people were killed protesting aerial eradication.
</P>
<P>
	   The strategy for aggressive aerial fumigation of coca plots in Putumayo is
expected to include alternative crop programs.
</P>
<P>
	   Human rights and U.S. church groups insist that the U.S. aid package will
fuel human rights abuses in the areas where the counterdrug battalions operate.

<HEADLINE> Gore's wine counters Bradley's whine, and other notes and quotes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ABOARD AIR FORCE TWO (AP) - The headline, "Bradley cranky as campaign
heats up," was so delicious that Al Gore put on an apron and tried out his best
French accent.
<P>
	   Madame, may I pour you some wine?
</P>
<P>
	   A linen napkin folded over his forearm, the vice president had perfected the
snooty sommelier's down-his-nose glance as he passed through the press cabin of
his airplane on an overnight flight Thursday night (from Washington state to
Washington, D.C) to score a point against his opponent, Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Salmon anyone?
</P>
<P>
	   An Associated Press report that day detailed how Bradley was cranky - and
his press and staff entourage miserable - as they flew the country aboard a
lamely heated campaign jet with no working oven for hot meals.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore offered his traveling reporters white wine and a china plate of fresh
salmon with garlic mashed potatoes and chowder.
</P>
<P>
	   "As a former journalist, I was truly distressed to read of the suffering on
the Bradley plane," Gore deadpanned. "Here on the Gore 2000 plane, we want to
make certain that everyone is well taken care of and if there's anything we can
do to make your travel more enjoyable please speak to me personally."
</P>
<P>
	   One reporter offered: How about daily press conferences?
</P>

<P>
	   THIS DATE FOUR YEARS AGO:

<P>
	   Forbes defended himself as "absolutely pro-life" because he would outlaw
late-term and sex-selection abortions while gradually urging the public to turn
against abortion. But that wasn't strong enough anti-abortion medicine for some
in the GOP.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan Gov. John Engler said voters in Republican primaries and caucuses
might want a tougher stance than that. Pat Buchanan, battling Forbes and others
for the GOP nomination, called the publisher "pro-abortion." Forbes has taken a
harder line against abortion rights in the 2000 campaign.

called for "a real good debate on national security and foreign policy." Forbes
continued his tour of Delaware, including a town hall meeting in Dewey Beach.
Alan Keyes campaigned in South Carolina.

<HEADLINE> 1921 Race Riot Panel Urges Redress  </HEADLINE>
   By RENEE RUBLE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- A state commission recommended Friday that reparations
be paid for one of the nation's deadliest racial clashes: a little-known, 1921
rampage by a white Tulsa mob that killed as many as 300 people, most of them
black.
</P>
<P>
	   The 11-member panel called for direct payments to survivors and victims'
descendants, scholarships and a tax checkoff program to fund economic
development in Tulsa's mostly black Greenwood area and a memorial to the dead.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I asked myself, 'What would I want if my life was basically destroyed,'''
commission member Vivian Clark said in favor of payments to survivors. ``The
country has a problem as a whole in giving compensations to African Americans.''
</P>
<P>
	   The commission recommended that the direct payments be a priority.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This way we will be helping people first, which is what we are supposed to
be doing,'' said commission member Jim Lloyd, who is white.
</P>
<P>
	   The panel gave no specifics on how much the package would cost and offered
no details on such things as who would get the scholarships. It also didn't say
who should make the payments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We haven't pointed fingers at anyone, yet,'' said commission Chairman Bob
Blackburn, who is white.
</P>
<P>
	   But the commission passed a resolution that said the racial hatred then was
tolerated through laws of local, state and federal governments and said
restitution would be good public policy and help repair the emotional and
physical scars of the riot.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission's recommendation is subject to approval by the Legislature,
which created the commission.
</P>
<P>
	   Genevieve Elizabeth Tillman Jackson, an 84-year-old black woman who survived
the riot, said after the vote that she never thought she would see the day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's great. I think the survivors should be helped, and the children of
survivors,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   About a half-dozen of the 80 known riot survivors watched on Friday as the
commission heard personal accounts, newspaper stories and a subcommittee
recommendation before approving the payment of reparations.
</P>
<P>
	   Ten of the 11 members voted in favor of the memorial and the scholarship
after one commissioner left the meeting early. The vote was 9-1 on the direct
payments and the tax checkoff.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have big problems with reparations. Will it solve what we're looking
at?'' said white commission member Sen. Robert Milacek. He cast votes in favor
of scholarships and a memorial but went against direct payments.
</P>
<P>
	   No cheers of joy or even clapping met the vote. Most of the survivors there
had a hard time hearing. Friends and family members whispered the results into
their ears, the quiet words bringing looks of contentment to their faces. Their
eyes were watering.
</P>
<P>
	   The survivors left quickly after the vote while the commission continued
their meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   The riot broke out May 31, 1921, when a white lynch mob clashed with blacks
who were protecting a black man accused of assaulting a white elevator operator.
</P>
<P>
	   Over two days, white mobs set fire to homes, businesses and churches in
Greenwood, a thriving black business district known at the time as the Black
Wall Street of America. When the smoke cleared, the area lay in ruins.
</P>
<P>
	   Many blacks left and never returned. The National Guard rounded up thousands
of others and held them at the fairgrounds, convention hall and a baseball
stadium.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission, which included a survivor, historians, lawmakers and

<HEADLINE> Bolivia Demonstration Turns Violent  </HEADLINE>
   By PETER McFARREN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LA PAZ, Bolivia (AP) -- Police and soldiers used tear gas, clubs and whips
Friday to scatter thousands of rock-throwing demonstrators protesting a 20
percent hike in water prices in Cochabamba, Bolivia's third largest city.
</P>
<P>
	   At least 200 protesters were arrested and dozens injured, including two who
are in critical condition, the police reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The confrontations lasted all day in Cochabamba, 350 miles southeast of La
Paz. Thousands of farmers threatened to surround the city and block all access
routes. Soldiers and police were deployed throughout the city and surrounding
areas.
</P>
<P>
	   The government said it will declare a state of siege in the city if order is
not restored, but set no deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said at least 10,000 people joined the protests, bringing the city
of 500,000 people to a virtual standstill. Hundreds of tear gas canisters were
fired as protesters blocked city streets, set up roadblocks and threw rocks at
police. Police also used dogs and whips in response to the protests.
</P>
<P>
	   Civic leaders said the protests would continue with thousands of farmers and
city residents preparing to block roads leading to the city unless the
government reverses its decision to increase water prices.
</P>
<P>
	   The government said that in spite of the planned rate hike, few Cochabamba
residents would pay more than $5 a month for their water bills. Residents
complained that increases were often more than 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The government says the increase is necessary to fund the expansion of the
city's water supply system, including the construction of a multimillion-dollar
tunnel pipeline. Water shortages have been common.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Court Martial Process Begins  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Ecuador's military said Friday it planned to try 16
officers and a sergeant for their part in an uprising that led to President
Jamil Mahuad's overthrow.
</P>
<P>
	   Together with hundreds of Indians, a cadre of young army officers seized
Congress on Jan. 21 and proclaimed a ``Parliament of the People'' to fight
corruption and end poverty.
</P>
<P>
	   Their formation of a three-man governing junta prompted the military high
command to force Mahuad from office to avoid ``a social explosion.'' The junta
said it wanted fight corruption and work to improve the lives of the poor.
</P>
<P>
	   Armed forces chief Gen. Carlos Mendoza briefly took a place in the junta
before turning power over to Vice President Gustavo Noboa. Last week, Noboa
received the presidential sash in a ceremony in Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Mendoza said he agreed to join the coup until democratic order could be
restored.
</P>
<P>
	   Mendoza, who has since resigned his post, was among 96 officers still being
investigated, said Gen. Norton Narvaez, chief of Ecuador's army.
</P>
<P>
	   Police on Thursday used tear gas to disperse demonstrators who marched in
support of officers who had been arrested or detained. About 2,000 students,
Indians and relatives of the colonels who led the military uprising demanded the
officers' release.
</P>
<P>
	   Narvaez said ``the officers that had been detained are in barracks in Quito,
with all guarantees and respect that any citizen would receive.''

<HEADLINE> Missing Musher Found Alive in Alaska  </HEADLINE>
   By MARY PEMBERTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- A rookie sled dog racer who disappeared in
blizzard conditions during a 200-mile race was found alive Friday afternoon, six
days after he was last seen.
</P>
<P>
	   Rod Boyce was found near the race trail in the Caribou Hills of the Kenai
Peninsula at about 1:30 p.m., said Greg Wilkinson, an Alaska state troopers
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   A group of snowmobilers found Boyce and took him to a nearby lodge. Sgt. Jim
Hibpshman, commander of the trooper post in Homer, said Boyce refused medical
treatment and instead went to the Soldotna airport, where his wife was waiting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He is tired, hungry, but he's talking and says he's fine,'' said
Hibpshman.
</P>
<P>
	   Boyce told troopers he got lost on a ridge during the storm and decided to
stop, stake his dog team and wait for a break in the weather. He used a cooker
to melt snow and rationed his two-day supply of food. When he got very hungry,
he tried eating dog food and used candy to get rid of the taste, Hibpshman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Boyce heard snowmachiners looking for him but the weather prevented him from
getting to them. When it cleared Friday, he left the dog team and decided to
hike out. He probably walked 4 or 5 miles before he was found.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A snowmachiner came up and said, 'Gee, are you the guy we're looking
for,''' Hibpshman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Boyce was loaded aboard the snowmachine and told rescuers where his dog team
could be found.
</P>
<P>
	   Boyce was last seen early Sunday morning while competing in the Tustumena
200 Sled Dog Race, on Alaska's Kenai Peninsula south of Anchorage. He passed
through a race checkpoint, but failed to reach the next checkpoint 18 miles
away.
</P>
<P>
	   Boyce, 38, is a recreational musher who was competing in his first race. He
is the city editor for the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner and lives in Two Rivers.
</P>
<P>
	   When Boyce's colleagues learned he was alive, cheers erupted in the
newsroom.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I had a lot of respect for Rod as an editor before this,'' said managing
editor Kelly Bostian. ``I mean I am amazed and impressed that he could pull
through that. ... That takes somebody with a good head on their shoulders. I am
just very impressed that he was able to pull this out.''
</P>
<P>
	   Troopers and race officials suspect Boyce took a wrong turn in blizzard
conditions. He was carrying survival equipment and enough food for himself and
the dogs to last two days.

<HEADLINE> Attorney Favors Opening Skakel Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A lawyer for the 39-year-old nephew of Robert F.
Kennedy charged in the 1975 murder of a Greenwich teen-ager says he favors
opening next week's arraignment in juvenile court to the public.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm absolutely not opposed to it,'' said Michael Sherman, attorney for
Michael Skakel. ``There's been enough of the `Kennedy kin cover-up' garbage.''
</P>
<P>
	   Skakel, a nephew of Ethel and the late U.S. senator, is scheduled to be
arraigned Tuesday. The hearing on whether to open the arraignment is scheduled
for Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Skakel's case is in juvenile court because he was 15 in October 1975, when
he is alleged to have killed Martha Moxley, his 15-year-old neighbor.
</P>
<P>
	   Several newspapers have filed a motion to open the hearing to the public.
Normally, juvenile proceedings are held in closed courtrooms to protect children
from negative publicity that might affect their rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
	   Those concerns don't apply in Skakel's case, according to the motion filed
Thursday by The Advocate of Stamford, Greenwich Time, The Hartford Courant,
Newsday and The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney Mark Kravitz said he believes Sherman's support of the motion
guarantees its success.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The only reason for secrecy in juvenile proceedings is to protect the
child,'' Kravitz said. ``We have someone who is not a child, and someone who is
agreeing to have it open.''

<HEADLINE> Falun Gong Members Arrested  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN LEICESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BEIJING (AP) -- As fireworks thundered from Beijing's outskirts, police on
Tiananmen Square beat, kicked and detained at least 50 Falun Gong members who
welcomed the Year of the Dragon with one of their biggest and most dramatic
protests of recent months.
</P>
<P>
	   Practitioners, ranging in age and some with children, began converging on
the vast square minutes late Friday before the new year began. Many pulled red
banners from beneath their clothing and waved them aloft. At least two dozen
people emerged from a pedestrian tunnel that opens onto the square and sat down
cross-legged in unison, a pose typical of the sect that the government banned in
July.
</P>
<P>
	   Police pounced on the protesters immediately, running toward them from all
corners of the square. They kicked, punched and dragged protesters to their
feet, herded them into vans and drove them away.
</P>
<P>
	   Other protesters who came to the square alone or in smaller groups of two or
three were likewise quickly and violently tackled. At least two men were felled
by police who took running kicks and knocked their legs out from under them.
Some officers shouted obscenities at practitioners as they beat them into
submission.
</P>
<P>
	   The buildings around the square were decorated for the holiday, which is
traditionally celebrated with family reunions and feasts of steamed dumplings.
Trees were strung with multicolored lights, and Tiananmen gate, which overlooks
the square, was decorated with big red lanterns.
</P>
<P>
	   Wang Xiaoping, a Falun Gong member from Beijing in her 20s, said she felt it
was more important to express her dissatisfaction with the government ban on the
group than spend the most important holiday of the year with her family.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They won't let us practice, they are trying to crush us,'' she said.
``We're not against the government, we just want the government to have peaceful
talks with our master, Li Hongzhi.''
</P>
<P>
	   She then walked straight for the police, pulling a red banner from her
anorak, and was flung to the ground within seconds. As she tried to get up, she
was knocked back to the ground and kicked several times. Wang and her two
companions, a man in his 50s and a woman in her 40s, were also hit and shouted
at by at least six policemen before being taken away.
</P>
<P>
	   A man, strolling with a woman and a young girl, also was set upon. Police
punched him in the face, while the girl screamed, ``Don't hit, don't hit!''
</P>
<P>
	   Three tourists were detained, apparently because one took pictures. The film
was removed from the camera.
</P>
<P>
	   After about 25 minutes, columns of police ran into the square and closed it,
ushering bystanders away. Officers were positioned every twenty yards to keep
anyone from entering, and police vans patrolled the edges.
</P>
<P>
	   Beijing banned Falun Gong in July as a threat to Communist Party control.
The blend of meditation, slow-motion exercises and ideas drawn from Buddhism,
Taoism and the group's founder, Li, had attracted millions of followers around
the country. China has issued a warrant for Li's arrest, and he now lives in New
York.
</P>
<P>
	   The streets of Beijing had been eerily quiet earlier Friday as people headed
home to welcome the Year of the Dragon, which is considered one of the luckiest
times in the 12-year zodiac.
</P>
<P>
	   Many people left work early to gather with family at home to feast and watch
a gala of song, dance and comedy on New Year's television specials. Prisons sent
well-behaved inmates home to join with loved ones. Villages prepared fireworks
shows, staged to scare off evil spirits.
</P>
<P>
	   This year is particularly special for Chinese, many of whom identify
themselves with the dragon, calling themselves the ``dragon's descendants.'' In
ancient times, emperors regarded themselves as reincarnations of dragons, and
children born during the year are considered blessed.

Countries Reduce Ties to Austria
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Shortly after Austria swore in it's new governing
coalition the 14 nations sharing European Union membership with Austria started
reducing diplomatic ties, canceling contracts and official visits and freezing
high-level contacts. President Thomas Klestil had repeatedly warned that Freedom
Party participation in government would produce a fierce reaction because of
Joerg Haider's anti-foreigner stand, opposition to European Union expansion and
his past praise of Nazi policies. Klestil said he had little choice but to
approve the governing coalition since the People's Party and Freedom Party won
104 of the 183 parliament seats.

Alaska Airline Recorder Reveals Details
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   PORT HUENEME, Calif. (AP) -- Analysis of the Alaskan Airlines 'black boxes'
reveal two loud noises in the minutes before the flight crashed in the Pacific
Ocean, killing all 88 people on board. The tape revealed new details of what
occurred on the flight in its last minutes as the pilots struggled to control a
problem with the horizontal stabilizer -- the wide part of the tail that keeps a
plane flying level. The noises could have originated from any number of
problems, including structural failure or a compressor stall in the engines
caused by erratic airflow, said C.O. Miller, who headed the NTSB's Bureau of
Safety during much of the 1980s.

location of West Bank territory Israel is to hand over next week. Israel has

Kohl Party Reaches Impasse in Probe

	   BONN, Germany (AP) -- Germany's scandal-plagued Christian Democrats said
Friday they had reached an impasse in identifying the sources of millions in
covert campaign donations, even while tracing more money solicited by Helmut
Kohl than the ex-chancellor had acknowledged. But in an impassioned television
interview, Kohl denied any knowledge of the party holding alleged secret
accounts abroad and said he had done all he could -- short of breaking his word
to unnamed donors -- to help the Christian Democrats untangle the scandal.
Because of Kohl's steadfast silence -- or memory gaps -- on the money sources,
the party's report fell short of expectations that it would unravel crucial
elements of the scandal.

violence demonstrates how tensions between the two ethnic groups remain
passionately high, despite the presence of peacekeepers. The latest round of

<HEADLINE> Man Arrested in Pregnant Teen Case  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHELLE RUSHLO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PHOENIX (AP) -- A man was arrested Friday on charges he impregnated a
teen-age girl who later won permission from the Arizona Supreme Court to go to
another state for a late-term abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   The girl, who is a ward of the state, received court permission in August to
go to Kansas for an abortion because no Arizona clinics perform them after the
20th week of pregnancy. She was 14 and said to have been in the 25th week of
pregnancy, though most information about her is sealed.
</P>
<P>
	   Glendale police spokesman Matthew Brown said the investigation took about
six months because the girl, who is now 15, didn't cooperate initially and
because they had to wait for DNA test results.
</P>
<P>
	   She later identified Phillip Rivera, 37, to authorities, who obtained DNA
samples from her, the aborted fetus and Rivera, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rivera, a Phoenix telemarketer, was indicted Thursday for sexual conduct
with a minor and dangerous crimes against children -- felonies that could bring
up to 4 1/2 years in prison, said Bill FitzGerald, a spokesman for the Maricopa
County Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
	   Rivera was being held in jail pending a bail hearing. He was arrested at a
halfway house for drug probationers in central Phoenix, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not clear if he had an attorney yet.
</P>
<P>
	   Rivera apparently met the girl when she was 13, and they allegedly had sex
for the first time in August or September of 1998. Prosecutors say they had sex
again in March 1999, when she was 14. They believe that contact resulted in the
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
	   The abortion order reached the state's highest court after lower court
judges ruled that Arizona law banned abortion of a viable fetus unless the life
or health of the mother was endangered.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona Supreme Court said the teen had a constitutional right to travel
and the state cannot apply its abortion restrictions on procedures performed in
other states.
</P>
<P>
	   The court also said that because the girl was too young to consent to sex
under Arizona law, her alleged contact with Rivera would be considered statutory
rape, giving her the right under federal law to a therapeutic abortion.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Industry Attacks Fla. Case  </HEADLINE>
    By CATHERINE WILSON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Tobacco companies tried Friday to whittle away at the issues a
jury will be allowed to decide when considering damages for three
cancer-stricken Florida smokers.
</P>
<P>
	   The three brought a class-action lawsuit on behalf of about 500,000 Florida
smokers. The trial is proceeding before the same jury that in July found the
nation's five largest cigarette makers produced a product that causes emphysema,
lung cancer and other illnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   In this phase, the jury is hearing evidence to determine damages. The
industry has warned that the jury might award a crippling lump-sum verdict of
$300 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The industry filed numerous motions asking the court to enter a directed
verdict, which would effectively take the case out of the jurors' hands.
</P>
<P>
	   Plaintiffs' attorney Stanley Rosenblatt argued the motions were a strategy
to gut an "incredibly clear" verdict that repudiated industry conduct since the
1950s.
</P>
<P>
	   Among other arguments, the companies said plaintiffs failed to prove a
conspiracy claim, and they challenged the application of Florida law to the
three smokers, fraud claims and claims for intentional infliction of emotional
distress.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge Robert Kaye did not indicate when he would rule on the motions.
</P>
<P>
	   The jury would be left with nothing to decide if the judge granted all 25 or
so motions attacking the legal foundation of the smokers' case.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is just one of many facing cigarette makers, which owe nearly $10
billion this year under settlements with states for the public costs of
smoking-related disease.
</P>
<P>
	   Liggett Group Inc., one of the defendant companies, said Friday it is suing
its insurance companies to recover its attorney fees, settlement costs and other
litigation-related expenses.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelans Mark Coup Attempt  </HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GUTKIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Tens of thousands of Venezuelans took to the
streets Friday to help President Hugo Chavez celebrate the eighth anniversary of
his failed military coup.
</P>
<P>
	   Massive rallies were being held in major cities with former coup
participants giving speeches lauding the 1992 putsch.
</P>
<P>
	   But critics insisted that glorifying the event sends the wrong message to
the South American nation's military: that it's OK to take up arms against your
superiors.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Eight years after those events I say this without a doubt: it was worth
it,'' Chavez said in a rousing speech Friday evening before cheering supporters
at a downtown Caracas square.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez wore a red beret and army camouflage fatigues similar to the ones he
donned the night of the coup. Many people in the crowd also wore a red beret.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez spent much of the speech attacking the country's traditional
political class, saying it has been ``buried in a deep tomb.'' The former coup
leader has revolutionized Venezuelan politics since becoming president a year
ago, pushing through a new constitution, raising the role of the military and
bolstering presidential powers.
</P>
<P>
	   The coup attempt catapulted Chavez onto Venezuela's national scene.
</P>
<P>
	   At midnight on Feb. 3, 1992, Chavez and three other mid-level officers led
15,000 rebel soldiers intent on imposing a ``progressive'' civilian-military
junta. Heavy gunfire rattled the presidential palace in Caracas and a tank tried
to smash down the palace door.
</P>
<P>
	   By noon the next day, dozens of people lay dead and the government had the
upper hand. A captured Chavez went before TV cameras and admitted defeat ``for
now.'' Chavez surrendered the night of the coup and was jailed for two years. He
was pardoned in 1994 by ex-President Rafael Caldera.
</P>
<P>
	   At the time, most of the world condemned the attempted coup and
congratulated then-President Carlos Andres Perez for restoring the elected
government.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Chavez began building a steady following that grew and eventually
led to his presidential victory in December 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech Friday, Chavez called the attempted coup ``inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said he ordered palace workers not to repair damage to the palace caused
by the coup attempt because he wanted it as a constant reminder of the night
that changed Venezuelan history.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It helps me in my solitude not to forget,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The other former officers who helped Chavez lead the coup attempt staged
their own celebrations Friday in the western city of Coro.
</P>
<P>
	   Chavez's supporters in an assembly that rewrote Venezuela's constitution
last week reinstated into the armed forces more than 260 former coup
participants who fought alongside Chavez.
</P>
<P>
	   Retired Vice Adm. Mario Ivan Carratu, who was in charge of Perez's security
during the attempted coup, said Friday's commemoration is an affront to soldiers
who remained loyal and ``stimulates the idea of insurrection inside the armed
forces.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are changing the heroic military chiefs of the past for the failed coup
leaders of 1992,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Vigil Marks Amadou Diallo's Death  </HEADLINE>
   By VERENA DOBNIK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The family of an African immigrant fatally shot by police
was joined by several hundred people Friday for a candlelight vigil to mark the
one-year anniversay of Amadou Diallo's death.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We think what happened to him should not happen to anyone anywhere in the
world,'' said Kadiatou Diallo, his mother. ``We pray and hope that justice will
be done.''
</P>
<P>
	   Joining his mother -- on a tiny stage erected directly in front of the home
where Diallo was hit by 19 of 41 bullets fired -- were his father, Saikou
Diallo, his three siblings, and the Rev. Al Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
	   An interfaith healing service was held earlier Friday at the Cathedral of
St. John the Divine. The massive cathedral in Manhattan was chosen for the
service as ``a place of compassion, a place of justice, and a place of community
healing,'' said its dean, the Very Rev. Harry Pritchett, Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   For some on Friday, that meant compassion for both Diallo and the officers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Very Rev. James P. Morton pointed to ``the many injustices that befell
so many immigrants, so many people of color.''
</P>
<P>
	   But we must not forget ``the suffering that (the officers) and their
families are enduring at this moment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Four white police officers are on trial in Albany, accused of second-degree
murder.
</P>
<P>
	   The defense alleges Diallo, 22, provoked the shooting by lurking around his
front door, ignoring orders to halt and pulling a black object out of his
pocket; the object turned out to be a wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   The plainclothes officers were searching the neighborhood for violent
suspects at the time.

<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- The second of two men accused of raping and
murdering an 18-year-old college freshman two years ago was convicted of
first-degree murder Friday, the judge and prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jesse Avalos Jr. could face life in prison plus 99 years when sentenced on
charges of murdering, kidnapping and raping Carly Martinez, Chief Deputy
District Attorney Susan Riedel said. A sentencing date has not been set.

	   Carly Martinez, of El Paso, Texas, disappeared in January 1998 from Las
Cruces, where she was returning for classes at New Mexico State University.
Investigators found her nearly nude body in the desert six miles away on March
22, 1998, stabbed more than 30 times.
</P>
<P>
	   Avalos, 27, was convicted of first-degree felony murder, three counts of
tampering with evidence, three counts of conspiring to tamper with evidence, and
single counts of kidnapping and rape, Riedel said.
</P>
<P>
	   His co-defendant. Jason Desnoyers, 24, was convicted in November of murder,
rape, kidnapping and 10 other counts. He faces 85 years in prison.

<HEADLINE> Bradley accuses Gore of scorched-earth politics  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) - Bill Bradley, keeping his criticism strong and
personal, accused Democratic rival Al Gore on Friday of practicing politics
designed to "rip your opponent's lungs out."
<P>
	   Gore's spokesman said Bradley's daily comments were sounding more and more
like the Republicans' "standard attack lines," and he wondered aloud if the
former senator was planning to leave the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
	   "The watchword is attack, deny, distort," Bradley said of Gore. "It's the
old politics that says the ends justify the means, any means to win an election
and the end is holding power and not exercising power to do good."
</P>
<P>
	   At a college rally, Bradley told about 500 students that he will continue to
underscore his differences with Gore as the two head into the big round of
primary elections March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a campaign about differences," said Bradley, though his comments about
Gore focused on political style more than policy issues.
</P>
<P>
	   He told his audience at the University of Maryland that the nation's
political climate has shifted "in the last decade." President Clinton and Gore
have led the government for most of that period.
</P>
<P>
	   "Partisanship and negative campaigning have driven people further and
further away," Bradley said. "In 1991, Al Gore told his hometown newspaper that
in order to win an election you have to rip your opponent's lungs out and then
move on."
</P>
<P>
	   He accused Gore of "relentlessly negative" campaigning, and said, "I'm
trying to be direct with people."
</P>
<P>
	   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane had a different reading.
</P>
<P>
	   "Over the last two weeks, Senator Bradley has been mimicking and amplifying
the Republican National Committee's standard attack lines. He has flirted with
leaving the Democratic Party, and he appears to be following in that direction,"
Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
	   He defended Gore's recent comments, saying the vice president has merely
pointed out Bradley flaws.
</P>
<P>
	   After Iowa and New Hampshire, the campaign's focus has now shifted to giant
media markets, including New York and California, which are part of the March 7
lineup.
</P>
<P>
	   Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo said Friday he is taking a lead role in Al
Gore's New York campaign and will travel extensively around his home state
stumping for the vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   The heightened visibility by Cuomo - who is mulling a run for governor in
New York - began with an appearance at a senior citizen center Friday in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Gore and Bradley have begun to sharpen their distinctions, developing
sound-bite stump themes aimed beyond the audience showing up at campaign events.
</P>
<P>
	   "It requires a national campaign that is more media oriented," Bradley said.
"This is a campaign not just about me, but it's also a campaign about him. It's
a campaign about differences."
</P>
<P>
	   The two men have been campaigning relentlessly since long before Tuesday's
New Hampshire primary, in which Gore handed Bradley his second consecutive
defeat. But now they are being forced to dash from coast to coast.
</P>
<P>
	   Both are taking time off this weekend, and it's likely they'll huddle with
aides to shape a strategy for the crucial next month.
</P>
<P>
	   As Bradley has become more personal in his criticism, the vice president has
responded by arguing that Bradley is being driven by desperation after losing in
Iowa and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, Bradley aides distributed a transcript of a television program on
which former Republican Sen. Alan Simpson said Gore traded his support for the
Gulf War a decade ago for a prominent speaking role in the Senate debate.
</P>
<P>
	   In his remarks at the Maryland event, Bradley said New Hampshire students
had been intimidated from voting, suggesting while not directly charging that
the Gore camp was behind it. He said state officials warned students their aid
could be threatened by voter registration changes.
</P>
<P>
	   "That kind of voter intimidation would be illegal if it involved
African-Americans," Bradley said. "This is a serious, serious issue."

<HEADLINE> US Biological Attack Said Inevitable  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHELLE WILLIAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Terrorists will likely attack the United States with the
small pox or anthrax viruses within the next five to 10 years, says an expert
who warns the country is unprepared.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are a long way away from being even modestly prepared,'' D.A.
Henderson, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Civilian Biodefense Studies,
said Friday at a conference on bioterrorism. ``But we're doing a lot more now
than we did 12 months, or even 6 months ago.''
</P>
<P>
	   The two-day conference brings together more than 300 physicians, scientists,
public officials and law enforcement agents to discuss possible ways to respond
in the event of an attack.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a problem that's going to have to be dealt with at the local
level,'' said Henderson, who was a leader in the effort to eradicate smallpox
and now is mobilizing health workers against bioterrorism. ``Doctors and nurses
in emergency rooms will be the first ones to see signs of an epidemic. They need
to know how to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bioterrorism is the release of deadly bacteria, viruses or products of those
agents. Those that pose the greatest threat are smallpox, anthrax and plague
because they have the potential to spread quickly and cause large numbers of
deaths.
</P>
<P>
	   Such an attack is expected in this country within the decade, Henderson
said, noting that some governments have stockpiles of the agents. Fringe groups,
meanwhile, have already launched attacks elsewhere, including the deadly sarin
nerve gas attack carried out by a cult on a Tokyo subway in 1995 that killed 12
people.
</P>
<P>
	   Policy-makers know how to respond to chemical spills and nuclear plant
leaks, but those hazardous material plans won't work for a bioterrorist attack,
Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With a virus, signs aren't apparent for days or weeks,'' Henderson said.
``The flu-like symptoms may get misdiagnosed until the disease reaches an
epidemic level.''
</P>
<P>
	   With shortages of hospital space, vaccines and antibiotics, ``there would be
chaos,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Margaret Hamburg, who helps direct a bioterrorism initiative of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, urged people not to panic, saying the
federal government has allocated millions of dollars to help states prepared for
bioterrorism.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People shouldn't go to bed at night worrying about it,'' Hamburg said.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States hasn't vaccinated against smallpox since the 1970s, and
there's only enough vaccine left for 7.5 million people and no factories to make
more, Henderson said. The development of an anthrax vaccine available to the
public is another 5 years away, he said.

<HEADLINE> Missing Musher Found Alive in Alaska  </HEADLINE>
   By MARY PEMBERTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- A rookie sled dog racer who disappeared in
blizzard conditions during a 200-mile race was found alive Friday afternoon, six
days after he was last seen.
</P>
<P>
	   Rod Boyce was found near the race trail in the Caribou Hills of the Kenai
Peninsula at about 1:30 p.m., said Greg Wilkinson, an Alaska state troopers
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
	   A group of snowmobilers found Boyce and took him to a nearby lodge. Sgt. Jim
Hibpshman, commander of the trooper post in Homer, said Boyce refused medical
treatment and instead went to the Soldotna airport, where his wife was waiting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He is tired, hungry, but he's talking and says he's fine,'' said
Hibpshman.
</P>
<P>
	   Boyce told troopers he got lost on a ridge during the storm and decided to
stop, stake his dog team and wait for a break in the weather. He used a cooker
to melt snow and rationed his two-day supply of food. When he got very hungry,
he tried eating dog food and used candy to get rid of the taste, Hibpshman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Boyce heard snowmachiners looking for him but the weather prevented him from
getting to them. When it cleared Friday, he left the dog team and decided to
hike out. He probably walked 4 or 5 miles before he was found.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A snowmachiner came up and said, 'Gee, are you the guy we're looking
for,''' Hibpshman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Boyce was loaded aboard the snowmachine and told rescuers where his dog team
could be found. Another musher retrieved the team. ``They are all alive, hungry,
tired and thirsty, too,'' said trooper John Brown, who had overseen the search.
</P>
<P>
	   Boyce was last seen early Sunday morning while competing in the Tustumena
200 Sled Dog Race, on Alaska's Kenai Peninsula south of Anchorage. He passed
through a race checkpoint, but failed to reach the next checkpoint 18 miles
away.
</P>
<P>
	   Boyce, 38, is a recreational musher who was competing in his first race. He
is the city editor for the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner and lives in Two Rivers.
</P>
<P>
	   When Boyce's colleagues learned he was alive, cheers erupted in the
newsroom.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I had a lot of respect for Rod as an editor before this,'' said managing
editor Kelly Bostian. ``I mean I am amazed and impressed that he could pull
through that. ... That takes somebody with a good head on their shoulders. I am
just very impressed that he was able to pull this out.''
</P>
<P>
	   Troopers and race officials suspect Boyce took a wrong turn in blizzard
conditions. He was carrying survival equipment and enough food for himself and
the dogs to last two days.

<HEADLINE> UN Reaches Child Prostitution Accord  </HEADLINE>
   By CLARE NULLIS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GENEVA (AP) -- An international accord aimed at combating child prostitution
and pornography was finalized by experts from more than 100 countries Friday
after more than six years of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   The text is meant to serve as a global framework to standardize national
laws against the selling children for sexual exploitation, for illegal adoption
or for use of their organs.
</P>
<P>
	   The text will now be put to the U.N. Human Rights Commission for approval
next month.
</P>
<P>
	   Ivan Mora Godoy, an expert from Cuba who served as chairman of the 10-day
meeting, said the child pornography and prostitution industry is conservatively
estimated at $4 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. estimates indicate that 1 million children in Asia alone are victims of
sexual exploitation, with millions more falling prey to other forms of abuse.
</P>
<P>
	   Friday's accord calls for closer legal cooperation between governments,
including cross-border prosecutions and extradition treaties to make it easier
to pursue suspects.
</P>
<P>
	   It also calls for better treatment of child victims by law enforcement and
justice authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   The accord was intended to help beef up the existing 10-year-old U.N.
Convention on the Rights of the Child. Signatories of the 1990 convention have
the option of passing up the new accord. The United States has not ratified the
treaty, citing concerns that it would infringe on parental rights.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Medics Help Haitians  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL NORTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAP-HAITIEN, Haiti (AP) -- When they pulled in last month, the 120 U.S. Air
Force engineers and National Guard medics were armed enough to spur a worried
buzz that the Americans had invaded again. But these reservists have a different
mission: to provide much needed medical and humanitarian services.
</P>
<P>
	   This week, dozens of bedraggled people gathered outside the Baptist Church
of Christ, waiting to be treated by National Guard medics at a makeshift clinic.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeunisse Dorsin, 19, cuddled 4-month-old Isaac Evenson. Both suffered from a
virulent skin irritation and the baby was too weak to even suckle. ``There's
nowhere else to go for care,'' the young mother said. ``I don't have the
money.''
</P>
<P>
	   Next door, some 30 Air Force engineers were laying the foundations of a new
four-room dormitory for an orphanage. U.S. troops will rewire the electrical
system, extend the dining area and build a latrine.
</P>
<P>
	   The 10-week humanitarian mission is all that remains of a once-mighty U.S.
presence that began five years ago, when 20,000 U.S. troops led an intervention
to kick out military dictators and restore elected rulers to Haiti.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996, the peacekeeping mission was converted into a humanitarian one in
the capital, Port-au-Prince.
</P>
<P>
	   That mission -- which wound down last month -- provided 138,000 people with
medical treatment, distributed more than 85 tons of donated goods and clothing,
repaired and drilled scores of water wells, built or repaired 50 schools, and
constructed or repaired roads, a bridge and a boat ramp.
</P>
<P>
	   The mission in Cap-Haitien, an impoverished town on the north coast, is part
of a series of rotating, short-term humanitarian efforts staffed by a mix of
reservists and active-duty soldiers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're trying to incorporate Haiti in our New Horizons program, the same as
elsewhere in Latin America,'' said the camp commander, Air Force Maj. Carl
Jerrett, 36, of Havelock, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Those currently assigned to Cap-Haitien will leave by March. From May to
October, other troops will repair and renovate Justinien Hospital in
Cap-Haitien.
</P>
<P>
	   After that, ``if things go well, the military will look to move on to
Jacmel,'' on the south coast, said a spokeswoman, Lt. Col. Lisa Bogdansky, 41,
of North Salt Lake, Utah.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Life here opens your eyes. The people are so poor and yet so friendly,''
said Kevin Black, 36, of Colorado Springs, who took time off from nursing school
to volunteer for duty in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
	   Although most local people seemed happy enough to host the Americans, some
were concerned by the emphasis on security: 45 heavily armed army soldiers,
there to protect their colleagues, account for more than a third of mission
members.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a virtual occupation!'' exclaimed electrician Ronald Pierre, 40. ``To
do what they say they are going to do, they don't need weapons!''
</P>
<P>
	   But gradually the U.S. force has been accepted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When we got here, some people yelled unpleasant things,'' said physician's
assistant Maj. Lonnie Grant, 48, from Mitchell, Neb. ``But now they're warming
up to us. They understand we're not an invasion force, that we're here to
help.''

<HEADLINE> Cuban Grandma's Account Stuns Family  </HEADLINE>
   By MEG RICHARDS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives are outraged over his Cuban
grandmother's account of how she playfully bit the 6-year-old boy's tongue and
unzipped his pants during their long-awaited reunion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The family is shocked and disturbed,'' Armando Gutierrez, spokesman for
the Miami relatives, said Friday. ``That is not a Cuban custom.''
</P>
<P>
	   Through Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., Elian's Florida relatives requested a
meeting with Attorney General Janet Reno next week to discuss unspecified new
information about the case, Justice spokesman Carole Florman said. The request
was being considered.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview on Cuban television Tuesday, Elian's paternal grandmother,
Mariela Quintana, said she had ``played jokes'' with the boy during a U.S.
government-ordered meeting Jan. 26 at the home of a Roman Catholic nun in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   Quintana said the boy was ``reserved'' at the start of the meeting, so she
joked that he might have lost his tongue.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I took his tongue out of his mouth,'' she said, gesturing with her hand as
if she was pulling her own tongue from her mouth. ``I bit it.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I even opened up his zipper,'' she said, making an unzipping gesture. ``I
told him, `Let me see, let me see ... if it has grown.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Meeting host Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin and Sister Lenore Esnard, who also was
in the house during the meeting, were unaware of the exchange until Quintana's
remarks were broadcast on Miami television, said Barry University spokeswoman
Michele Morris. O'Laughlin is president of the school.
</P>
<P>
	   In Cuba, few people found anything strange about Quintana's behavior, but
the spokeswoman for the Spanish-language Telemundo affiliate in Miami said the
station was flooded with calls from outraged viewers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everyone we have talked to, everyone who saw the tape, thought this was
inappropriate behavior for grandmothers,'' said Maria Lewis, managing editor at
Telemundo's WSCV-TV.
</P>
<P>
	   Uva de Aragon, assistant director of the Cuban Research Institute at Florida
International University, said Quintana's behavior might seem odd to people in
the United States, but it was probably innocent.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The way the woman said it on national television shows it wasn't something
perverted,'' de Aragon said. ``She was joking with a little kid, trying to get
him to respond, the same as if she were tickling him or trying to see his
muscles.''
</P>
<P>
	   She said that most Hispanic cultures have a different concept of personal
space and that the Cuban culture traditionally has been very male-oriented.
Fathers, particularly in lower classes, often boast about the size of their
sons' genitals, associating that with bravery and virility.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was rescued on Thanksgiving after clinging to an inner tube for two
days following a shipwreck that killed his mother. The first-grader has been
living in Miami with his great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez, and his U.S. relatives
hope to keep him despite an immigration order to send him back.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials from the Florida Department of Children and Families went to the
home of Elian's relatives Friday night. They were at the house for more than an
hour, but did not comment on the visit.
</P>
<P>
	   His father back in Cuba, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, is pressing for his return.
He wrote Reno on Thursday asking her to move the boy to the home of another
Miami relative who is more sympathetic to his wishes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am deeply concerned and anguished over the present condition of my
6-year-old son, Elian Gonzalez, unfairly and cruelly separated from our family
for over two months,'' he said in a letter released to foreign news agencies by
the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
	   Florman said the Justice Department was reviewing the letter.

my landlord, police and the city of Westminster would,'' Tran said.
``Unfortunately they took the side of censorship. They not only failed to
protect my free speech rights but actually helped to rob them from me.''

	   Thousands of Vietnamese immigrants picketed his Hi Tek video store starting

	   Tran's landlord sued to force removal of the display, but a judge upheld his
free-speech rights. Tran has since closed the store.
</P>
<P>
	   In the lawsuit, Tran alleges police notified protesters when he was
returning to the store and accuses police of false arrest by removing him from
the scene.

<HEADLINE> Cuomo to lead Gore effort in New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo said Friday he is
taking a lead role in Al Gore's New York campaign and will travel extensively
around his home state stumping for the vice president.
<P>
	   The heightened visibility by Cuomo - who is mulling a run for governor in
New York - began with an appearance at a senior citizen center Friday in
Manhattan where he came out swinging at Bill Bradley's health care plan.
</P>
<P>
	   "New York is going to be a very competitive state. It's Bill Bradley's
backyard - senator of New Jersey, former (New York) Knick," Cuomo said in an
interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   "But I truly believe the more people hear the positions on the issues the
more they're going to support Al Gore, which is what happened in New Hampshire,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuomo said Gore was stronger on issues like Medicare and Medicaid that
affect millions of New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bradley camp did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore squeezed by Bradley in the first-in-the-nation New Hampshire Primary.
Most polls show Gore and Bradley in a statistical dead heat in New York, a
crucial battleground for Democrats. New York's primary is March 7.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan is among Bradley's New York backers.
</P>
<P>
	   Political observers say they expect the combative Cuomo to act as Gore's
attack dog in New York so that the vice president is able to stay above the
fray. And they say that role will also help Cuomo's own profile.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's far better to have Andrew as the guy who beats up on Bradley," said
Democratic consultant Hank Sheinkopf.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's better for Gore, he doesn't get his hands dirty," Sheinkopf said.
"It's better for Andrew because it allows him to be very visible on an issue
like health care that's important in New York."
</P>
<P>
	   Cuomo would only say, "I'm going to be doing all I can to make sure he wins.
"
</P>
<P>
	   It is widely speculated that Cuomo would be a front runner to be White House
chief of staff if Gore is elected. But Cuomo, the son of former Gov. Mario
Cuomo, has expressed interest recently in running for his father's old job.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is something I would seriously consider," Cuomo said Friday. "But now is
not the time to be discussing it or be distracted by it.'
</P>
<P>
	   State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, the first black elected to statewide
office in New York, is already lining up support among Democrats in anticipation
of entering the race in 2002.

Falun Gong Members Arrested
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   BEIJING (AP) -- As fireworks thundered from Beijing's outskirts, police on
Tiananmen Square beat, kicked and detained at least 50 Falun Gong members who
welcomed the Year of the Dragon with one of their biggest and most dramatic
protests of recent months. Police pounced on the protesters immediately, running
toward them from all corners of the square. They kicked, punched and dragged
protesters to their feet, herded them into vans and drove them away. Beijing
banned Falun Gong in July as a threat to Communist Party control. The group's
founder, Li Hongzhi, has attracted millions of followers around the country.
China has issued a warrant for his arrest.

Noises Heard on Airline 'Black Box'

	   PORT HUENEME, Calif. (AP) -- One of the "black boxes" aboard Alaska Airlines
Flight 261 recorded a loud noise in the minutes before the MD-83 went out of
control and plunged into the ocean, a federal investigator said today. The noise
was one of two revealed by analysis of the cockpit voice recorder, officials
said. The tape revealed new details of what occurred on the flight in its last
minutes as the pilots struggled to control a problem with the horizontal
stabilizer -- the wide part of the tail that keeps a plane flying level.

U.S. Said Ill-Prepared for Attack
</SUBHEAD>

	   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Terrorists will likely attack the United States with the
small pox or anthrax viruses within the next five to 10 years, says an expert
who warns the country is unprepared. The two-day conference brings together more
than 300 physicians, scientists, public officials and law enforcement agents to
discuss possible ways to respond in the event of an attack. But Margaret
Hamburg, who helps direct a bioterrorism initiative of the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services, urged people not to panic, saying the federal
government has allocated millions of dollars to help states prepared for
bioterrorism.

Venezuelans Mark Failed Coup Attempt
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Tens of thousands of Venezuelans took to the
streets today to help President Hugo Chavez celebrate the eighth anniversary of
his failed military coup. Chavez wore a red beret and army camouflage fatigues
similar to the ones he donned the night of the coup. At midnight on Feb. 3,
1992, Chavez and three other mid-level officers led 15,000 rebel soldiers intent
on imposing a "progressive" civilian-military junta. By noon the next day,
dozens of people lay dead and the government had the upper hand. Chavez
surrendered the night of the coup and was jailed for two years.

Pa. Jails Choose 'Wholesome' TV
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- The state's prison inmates will be switching off
premium channels like HBO and tuning in to a satellite-television service that
emphasizes more wholesome fare. The new statewide service gives the 14,900
inmates at the state's 24 prisons who subscribe to cable a one-size-fits-all
package similar to a typical basic cable setup. Prison officials had considered
eliminating cable service entirely from the prison system, but decided to make a
switch in line with the department's philosophy of "sobriety, education and
work," officials said.

Timberwolves Beat the Rockets 102-85
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Kevin Garnett's 23 points and 18 rebounds and the
absence of Houston's sensational rookie guard Steve Francis helped the Minnesota
Timberwolves rout the Rockets 102-85. Garnett added nine assists, narrowly
missing his third career triple double. Francis, who is averaging 18.3 points,
5.3 rebounds and 7.1 assists, missed the trip so he could get treatment for a
minor hernia. The Rockets also were missing their shooting touch, hitting just
38 percent from the floor.

   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Outfielder Todd Greene agreed and the
Anaheim Angels agreed Friday to a $650,000, one-year contract and
avoided an arbitration hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Greene, 28, split the 1999 season between the Angels and their
Triple-A affiliate in Edmonton. He hit .243 with 14 homers and 42
RBIs in 97 games with the Angels, and .243 with five homers and 14
RBIs in 19 games for the Trappers of the Pacific Coast League.
</P>
<P>
	   Greene, who made $225,000 last season, had asked for $750,000 in
arbitration. The Angels had offered $500,000, and a hearing had
been scheduled for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Originally selected by the Angels in the 12th round of the 1993
amateur draft, Greene has a career average of .247 with 26 homers
and 82 RBIs in 189 games.
</P>
<P>
	   Right-handers Jason Dickson and Mark Petkovsek are the two

<HEADLINE> Colo. Cops Cleared in No-Knock Raid  </HEADLINE>
   By JUDITH KOHLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- Two police officers were cleared Friday of wrongdoing in the
killing of a man during a no-knock raid on the wrong house, a tragedy that
forced the city to re-examine the practice.
</P>
<P>
	   A third officer, Joseph Bini, was charged with perjury.
</P>
<P>
	   Ismael Mena, 45, a Mexican immigrant, was shot eight times Sept. 29 when a
Denver police SWAT team raided his house. Officers said Mena, using his bedroom
door to shield most of his body, pointed a handgun at them.
</P>
<P>
	   Bini, 31, was accused of lying on the affidavit for a search warrant for the
home where Mena lived, said Jefferson County District Attorney Dave Thomas,
appointed special prosecutor in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   The warrant Bini prepared listed Mena's house but the correct target was a
suspected drug house next door.
</P>
<P>
	   Bini faces a first-degree perjury charge and has been suspended without pay.
If convicted he could face up to six years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Two other officers were justified in shooting Mena when he pointed a weapon
at them, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting prompted calls by friends, family and the Mexican government
for a federal investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas said the case has caused him and others on his staff to question how
such no knock raids, in which police force their way in without notice, are
conducted.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayor Wellington Webb said Friday the search warrant procedure will be
reviewed.

	   TORONTO (AP) -- Hayley Wickenheiser had three assists and Sami Jo Small
stopped 18 shots as Canada routed the United States 6-0 on Friday night in a
women's hockey exhibition played as part of the NHL All-Star Weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   The game was played in front of a vocal crowd of 14,658 at the Air Canada
Centre, the site of Sunday's 50th NHL All-Star game. The Canadian team, buoyed
by its exuberant, flag-waving fans, scored early and often while limiting a
frustrated American team to a handful of poor scoring chances.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States beat Canada 4-1 in Buffalo, N.Y., on Wednesday night. It
was the Americans' first victory over their archrivals since the 1998 Winter
Olympics, in which the United States won the gold. Canada had won all eight
previous rematches.
</P>
<P>
	   But in Toronto, Canada reclaimed control of the rivalry with an impressive
performance featuring six goal scorers and an outstanding game from star forward
Wickenheiser. Thousands of teen-aged and pre-teen girls, many wearing the
jerseys of their own minor-hockey teams, squealed their approval after each goal
and filled the building with chants of "Can-a-da!"
</P>
<P>
	   This week's two games were used by the teams' coaches as an evaluation
period for the world championships, to be held in Mississauga, Ontario, in
April.
</P>
<P>
	   Veteran goalie Erin Whitten, cut from the American team that won gold in
Nagano, was shaky in net for the United States as her personal 13-game winning
streak was snapped. She stopped 24 of 30 shots.
</P>
<P>
	   As she usually does, the 21-year-old Wickenheiser, who plays collegiately at
Minnesota-Duluth, dominated play for long stretches and was selected player of
the game. After Canada's Amy Turek started the scoring in the first period,
Wickenheiser set up Danielle Goyette's first-period goal that put Canada up 2-0.
</P>
<P>
	   Vicky Sunohara, left alone in front of the USA net during a Canada power
play, redirected Wickenheiser's slap shot into the top corner to give Canada a
3-0 lead midway through the second period. Two minutes later, Whitten misplayed
Jayna Hefford's soft wrister to put Canada up 4-0.
</P>
<P>
	   Judy Diduck, the sister of Toronto Maple Leafs defenseman Gerald Diduck,
added a breakaway goal later in the period. Dana Antal completed the scoring
with a third-period goal on a Wickenheiser pass.
</P>
<P>
	   Small, though rarely tested, was solid in net for Canada. She made a diving
poke-check near the blue line that prevented Karyn Bye from cashing in a
short-handed breakaway midway through the first period.
</P>
<P>
	   Small has emerged as the leader in a battle with three other goalies,
including Manon Rheaume, who was a scratch Friday, for two spots on the Canadian
national team. American backup goalie Sara Tueting has lost to Canada three
times this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Maple Leafs stars Darryl Sittler and Lanny McDonald got loud ovations
when they were shown on the Air Canada Centre's video screen. Sittler's
daughter, Meaghan, was selected the American team's top player.

<P>
	   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Mark Jackson had a triple-double and cold-shooting
Reggie Miller hit two key jumpers as the Indiana Pacers defeated Sacramento
104-94 Friday night to tie their franchise record of 17 straight home wins.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pacers won despite losing All-Star forward Dale Davis to a broken nose.
He had helped limit Chris Webber to eight points on 4-of-13 shooting until he
caught an inadvertent elbow from Nick Anderson with 1:20 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson had 15 points, 15 assists and 10 rebounds. It was the 16th
triple-double of his career and first this season.
</P>
<P>
	   Miller finished with 14 points, including the 1,800th 3-pointer of his
career to put Indiana ahead 99-92 with 1:34 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   Miller, who had been 2-of-14 from the field until that point, then sank a
jumper from just inside the arc on Indiana's next possession.
</P>
<P>
	   Jalen Rose scored 22 points and Rik Smits had 18 for the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
	   Webber led the Kings with 26 points. He capitalized on the absence of Davis
to score 14 in the third period when Sacramento took an eight-point lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Mullin's 3-pointer with 9:22 left gave the Pacers the lead for good at
78-75. Indiana, the league's top free throw shooting team, held off the Kings
with the help of 11 free throws in the final eight minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   For the game, Indiana hit 24-of-27 free throws. Vlade Divac had 17 points
and 14 rebounds for the Kings.

Friday, a day after he was hit by a car. He was 77.
</P>
<P>
	   Berendt was critically injured when he was struck Thursday as he was walking
to an event to promote his new book ``Nur Gehen,'' or ``Only Walking.''
</P>
<P>
	   He was the author of a number of works on jazz, including ``The Jazz Book,''
published in 1952, ``Variations of Jazz,'' in 1956, and ``I Hear, Therefore I
Exist,'' in 1996. ``The Jazz Book'' was translated into 18 languages and sold
more than 1.5 million copies worldwide.
Ben Burns
</P>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Ben Burns, a white Jewish journalist who helped run and
found black newspapers and magazines in the racially charged '40s and '50s, died
Saturday at his home in Atlantis, Fla. He was 86.
</P>
<P>
	   Burns' 30-year career included stints as national editor and editor in chief
for the Chicago Defender. In 1945, he helped found Ebony magazine.
</P>
<P>
	   Burns began working for black publications after he was blacklisted in San
Francisco. He had joined the Communist Party during the Great Depression and had
written for three communist newspapers.
</P>
<P>
	   The magazine's owner, John Johnson, fired Burns in 1954 for including too
many sensational stories in the magazine, a charge Burns denied. Burns finished
his career at Sepia, a rival publication, where he stayed until 1977.
Jimmy Green
</P>
<P>
	   CLARKTON, N.C. (AP) -- Lt. Gov. Jimmy Green, who ran the state Senate with
an iron fist, avoided conviction in one trial but eventually was convicted of
tax evasion, died Friday. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
	   In February 1997, Green was sentenced and fined for tax evasion in
connection with tobacco fraud. Prosecutors said he didn't report more than
$92,000 in 1991 by selling tobacco without a legal sales allotment.
</P>
<P>
	   He was sentenced to 33 months home confinement and fined $250,000. He also
was ordered to pay $20,000 to cover the cost of prosecuting the case and of the
home monitoring device.
</P>
<P>
	   Green was known for his power-broker approach to politics. Elected to the
first of two four-year terms as lieutenant governor in 1976, Green used his
office to promote and block legislation moving through the General Assembly. He
left office in 1985.
</P>
<P>
	   After the bribery acquittal, Green lost a bid for the Democratic nomination
for governor in a 10-man primary. But he got a job as a highly paid political
consultant to Republican Gov. Jim Martin.
Lee Hills
</P>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Lee Hills, a former chairman of publishing giant Knight Ridder
and a veteran reporter and editor whose aggressive stamp of journalism helped
The Miami Herald win its first Pulitzer Prize, died Thursday. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
	   The two-time Pulitzer winner once ran the Herald and The Detroit Free Press
simultaneously. He took on organized crime and was largely responsible for the
Herald's tradition of investigative journalism.
</P>
<P>
	   Hills helped forge the 1974 merger of Knight Newspapers Inc. and Ridder
Publications Inc. He was the first chairman and chief executive of the fledgling
newspaper group that then had the nation's largest circulation.
</P>
<P>
	   He retired as editorial chairman in 1981.
</P>
<P>
	   Hills was active in the Inter-American Press Association, serving as its
president from 1987-88.
</P>
<P>
	   He won a Pulitzer Prize in 1956 for local reporting in Detroit during tense
negotiations between automakers and the auto workers union.
</P>
<P>
	   But Hills was later to note that he was ``prouder'' of another Pulitzer
Prize, The Herald's 1951 gold medal for meritorious public service.
</P>
<P>
	   Hills is survived by his wife and a son, Ronald Lee Hills.
Edward Scripps Meanley
</P>
<P>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Edward Scripps Meanley, a collector of vintage cars and
grandson of pioneering newspaper publisher E.W. Scripps, died Monday of cancer.
He was 73.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanley had about a half-dozen vintage cars over the years, including a rare
1897 Benz Velo, a predecessor of the Mercedes-Benz. He also purchased a 1904
Oldsmobile that later became part of a General Motors museum in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanley's mother, Nackey Scripps Meanley, was the daughter of E.W. Scripps,
who founded what became Scripps Howard Newspapers.
</P>
<P>
	   He ran Meanley's Home Store in La Jolla, frequented by well-known people
like J. Edgar Hoover and Lucille Ball.
John Moose
</P>
<P>
	   CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- John Moose, a racing pioneer in the Carolinas, died
Thursday. He was 73.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1949, Moose organized the Carolina Racing Team, a rival to NASCAR, and
staged events at dirt tracks and fairgrounds throughout the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
	   Moose began racing in 1950 against such short-track stars as Ralph
Earnhardt, Fireball Roberts, Ned Jarrett, Speedy Thompson, Glenn Wood and Buck
Baker.
</P>
<P>
	   Moose also was one of the operators of Southern States Fairgrounds in
Charlotte, where Richard Petty got his first Grand National victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Moose was responsible for the ``Road to Charlotte'' series that provided
short track racers in the Carolinas with the opportunity to race in NASCAR
support events at Lowe's.
A.E. van Vogt
</P>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A.E. van Vogt, an award-winning science fiction writer
who wrote more than 85 books, died Jan. 26. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
	   Van Vogt first gained attention for stories published in monthly science
fiction magazines in the 1940s and 50s.
</P>
<P>
	   The Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America in 1976 named van Vogt a
``grand master'' for life achievement, the group's highest honor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Black Destroyer,'' his first published science-fiction story, appeared in
Astounding Science Fiction in 1939. The story about a preying, cat-like alien is
considered the inspiration for the ``Aliens'' film series.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1946, he published ``Slan,'' a dark story about a telepathic mutant who
tries to escape from fearful humans.

<HEADLINE> Mets Sign Mahomes for $750,000  </HEADLINE>
   By RONALD BLUM
AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Last year, Turk Wendell signed for $1.2 million
plus 99 cents.
</P>
<P>
	   He had to be even odder this year, so when the colorful reliever
avoided salary arbitration Friday night, he did it with a deal
worth $2.05 million -- plus a $13.99 bonus.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We finally gave into the bonus,'' Mets general manager Steve
Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wendell, who wears No. 99 and likes to slam resin bags into the
mound, was 5-4 with a 3.05 ERA and three saves in 80 relief
appearances last year. The 32-year-old right-hander, who is
eligible for free agency after next season, had sought a three-year
contract, but the Mets weren't interested at his price.
</P>
<P>
	   He had asked for $2.15 million in arbitration and had been
offered $1.85 million.
</P>
<P>
	   New York also agreed to a $750,000, one-year contract with Pat
Mahomes and added another arm for spring training by signing free
agent Dennis Springer.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahomes, a 29-year-old right-hander, was 8-0 with a 3.63 ERA in
39 games last year, all in relief. He made $310,000.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He kept us in so many games that we were able to come back and
win,'' Phillips said. ``We know he'll be a force out of the bullpen
this year.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mahomes, who struck out 51 in 63 2-3 innings, can earn an
additional $100,000 in performance bonuses based on a points
system. He had asked for $940,000 in arbitration and had been
offered $625,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Closer Armando Benitez is the only Met remaining in arbitration.
His hearing is scheduled for Feb. 17.
</P>
<P>
	   Springer, a right-hander who turns 35 next week, opted for free
agency after last season rather than accept an outright assignment
to the minors from the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
	   He was 6-16 with one save and a 4.86 ERA in 29 starts and nine
relief appearances, throwing shutouts against Atlanta and Tampa
Bay.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Hampton, Al Leiter, Rick Reed and Bobby J. Jones figure to
be the Mets' top four starters, while Springer and Mahomes compete
for the fifth spot with Bobby M. Jones, Bill Pulsipher, Rich
Rodriguez and Glendon Rusch.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We feel we have added depth,'' Phillips said. ``He's versatile
and has proven that he can throw a lot of innings.''

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Demand Puts Funds in Jeopardy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Iraq is insisting that the United Nations transfer $50
million directly to its central bank to pay travel expenses for thousands of
Iraqis hoping to make the annual Muslim pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia, U.N.
diplomats said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Security Council rejected similar requests for the last two years to
give Iraq direct access to funds in a special account used to finance
humanitarian activities by selling Iraqi oil.
</P>
<P>
	   Baghdad's latest demand again threatens to curtail Iraq's participation in
the hajj pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina next month.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, the Iraq Sanctions Committee authorized third parties, including
the Red Crescent, to distribute the pilgrimage money, but Iraq refused.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter sent Thursday to the chairman of the sanctions committee, Iraqi
U.N. Ambassador Saeed Hasan said he hoped that this year the committee would
agree to let the Central Bank of Iraq distribute the $50 million, about $2,000
for each of the 24,700 expected pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. legal experts have ruled that transferring the money to the central
bank is prohibited under U.N. economic sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
	   In a sweeping resolution on Iraq approved in December, the Security Council
exempted hajj pilgrimage flights from a ban on flights into and out of Iraq. The
measure also called on Secretary-General Kofi Annan to arrange for the
distribution of money from the ``oil-for-food'' program to hajj pilgrims.
</P>
<P>
	   This year's hajj is set to run from early March to March 17. All able-bodied
Muslims are required to make at least one pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina in
their lifetimes if they can afford it.

<HEADLINE> Miss Tennessee Wins Miss USA Pageant  </HEADLINE>
   By DOUG JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRANSON, Mo. (AP) -- A 21-year-old pre-law student from Tennessee who had
some good advice for her home state's football team won the Miss USA title
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   During a staged news conference early in the show, Lynette Cole was asked
whether she had any advice for the Tennessee Titans, the NFL team that lost the
Super Bowl to the St. Louis Rams.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wish their arms were longer,'' quipped Cole, referring to the last play
of the game when the team came a yard short of a tying touchdown.
</P>
<P>
	   Miss New Hampshire, Bridget Jane Vezina, was named first runner-up. Miss
Alabama, Jina Mitchell, was the second runner-up.
</P>
<P>
	   For the second straight year, the pageant was held at the Grand Palace, one
of the many theaters that draw millions of tourists to Branson, southwest
Missouri's country music mecca.
</P>
<P>
	   Carson Daly of MTV emceed the show. Grammy nominees Lou Bega and Christina
Aguilera were among several stars who performed.
</P>
<P>
	   Cole, of Columbia, Tenn., moves on to compete in the Miss Universe Pageant
in Nicosia, Cyprus, on May 12. Donald Trump, the New York real estate magnate
and a possible Reform Party presidential candidate, is a co-owner of the Miss
Universe Organization with CBS Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Cole will be given a media coach and a travel manager as she makes
appearances on behalf of charities and events held by Miss Universe corporate
sponsors.
</P>
<P>
	   From the various sponsors, the winner receives a silver convertible Camaro,
a year's supply of makeup, a $5,000 scholarship and, because she is on the road
for most of the year, $7,500 in phone cards.

<HEADLINE> Shirelles Singer Kenner Dead at 58  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Doris Kenner-Jackson of the pop-rock group the
Shirelles, whose soaring harmonies on ``Soldier Boy'' and a number of other
songs brought huge success in the early 1960s, died Friday. She was 58.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson, who had breast cancer, died at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center,
her cousin Evelyn Jackson said from her home in Goldsboro, N.C.
</P>
<P>
	   The Shirelles, composed of Jackson, Shirley Alston Reeves, Beverly Lee and
the late Addie ``Micki'' Harris, began their career at a high school talent show
in Passaic, N.J., in 1957, singing their own composition, ``I Met Him on
Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
	   A classmate who heard them told her mother, independent record producer
Florence Greenberg, who helped them record the song the following year.
</P>
<P>
	   Aided by legendary producer Phil Specter, they turned out a string of hits
through the early '60s, including ``Tonight's The Night,'' ``Will You Still Love
Me Tomorrow,'' ``Soldier Boy,'' ``Baby It's You,'' and ``Dedicated to the One I
Love,'' the latter featuring Jackson on lead vocal.
</P>
<P>
	   Their songs, like those of several other popular ``girl groups'' of the
early '60s including Specter's Ronettes, were notable for their tight harmonies,
bouncy upbeat lyrics and lush musical arrangements known as Specter's ``Wall of
Sound.''
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson, who was born in North Carolina, moved to New Jersey as a child,
where she sang in church and with friends.
</P>
<P>
	   After their early success with ``I Met Him on Sunday,'' all four of the
group dropped out of high school to pursue their musical careers, each earning
diplomas later.

<HEADLINE> Mavericks Waive Leon Smith  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DALLAS (AP) -- Leon Smith, the teen-age basketball star whose emotional and
legal troubles have kept him off the court, was waived by the Dallas Mavericks
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith, who signed with the Mavericks on Nov. 2, was placed on the team's
suspended list Dec. 6. He became a free agent Tuesday without playing a single
game for the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
	   He leaves the team with the assurance he'll receive the $1.45 million
guaranteed to him as a first-round draft pick. If another team takes a chance on
the 19-year-old forward, they must fulfill the three-year deal Smith signed. If
not, the Mavericks will pay it out over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith, who was raised in a series of group and foster homes in Chicago,
refused Dallas' request that he play in a developmental league or go overseas to
ease his transition to the NBA. Instead, he signed the day the season began.
</P>
<P>
	   But Smith worked out away from his teammates and within two weeks he
attempted suicide by swallowing more than 200 aspirin. He has since said he was
distraught over a breakup with a girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
	   Weeks later, Smith spent a destructive few days in Chicago and was arrested
twice within 24 hours. Since then, he has been in and out of psychiatric care.
</P>
<P>
	   He moved to Houston last month to work out with players union representative
Purvis Short.

	   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Hundreds of ethnic Albanians pelted
French soldiers with stones and bottles Friday, charging that NATO-led
peacekeepers failed to prevent the deaths of at least six Kosovo Albanians. The
latest round of violence started after a rocket attack Wednesday killed two
elderly Serbs on a bus run by the U.N. refugee agency that was carrying them
through predominantly Albanian areas near Kosovska Mitrovica. That attack
destroyed what little faith minority Serbs had in the power of U.N. peacekeepers
to protect them from violence by ethnic Albanians.

welcomed the Year of the Dragon with one of their biggest and most dramatic
protests of recent months. Police pounced on the protesters immediately, running
toward them from all corners of the square. They kicked, punched and dragged
protesters to their feet, herded them into vans and drove them away. Beijing
banned Falun Gong in July as a threat to Communist Party control. The group's
founder, Li Hongzhi, has attracted millions of followers around the country.
China has issued a warrant for his arrest.
