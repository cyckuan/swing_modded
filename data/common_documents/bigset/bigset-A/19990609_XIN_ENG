<P>
PARIS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Foreign Minister Mustafa
Osman Ismail began an official visit to France on Tuesday, the
first visit here by a foreign minister of Sudan in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
French officials said that France would consider helping Sudan
return to the international community if "the internal situation
(of Sudan) continues to evolve toward democracy and human rights."
</P>
<P>
"I think the moment has come for Sunday to return fully into
the international community," said French delegate minister in
charge of cooperations with developing countries, Charles
Josselin.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Security Council imposed economic sanctions
on Sudan in 1996 for its alleged involvement in an assassination
attempt on Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions have resulted in rampant misery among the
Sudanese population already tortured by a long civil war and

<HEADLINE> China: United Nations Must Play Decisive Role on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- China said Tuesday that
bringing the Kosovo issue back into the framework of the United
Nations "is the sole right way out of the current crisis," and the
United Nations must play "a decisive role" in the process of the
political solution.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang, deputy Chinese permanent representative to the
United Nations, told reporters, "We support any efforts to achieve
a political solution. Only the coming back to the United Nations
is the sole right out of the current crisis, and the United
Nations must play a decisive role in the process of the political
settlement."
</P>
<P>
Shen made the statement after the U.N. Security Council
adjourned its closed-door consultations on a draft resolution,
hammered out by Russia and seven major Western countries.
</P>
<P>
Shen once again condemned NATO's wanton bombing of Yugoslavia,
saying that the NATO move violates the U.N. Charter and the norms
governing international law and international relations.
</P>
<P>
"China is the victim of the NATO bombing," Shen said, referring
to the May 7 bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, in
which three Chinese people were kilLed and the Embassy
premises were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
"Morally and legally, we have all the reason to demand that
NATO should unconditionally stop the military strikes on the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) so as to create an
environment and atmosphere necessary for the Security Council to
discuss a proposed political solution," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Only after the Security Council gets the confirmation that
NATO has stopped the bombing can the Council take action" on the
draft resolution, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We hold, as always, any settlement should respect the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of the FRY," he said, "We
condemn all violence in Kosovo, and maintain that efforts should
be made to safeguard the rights of all ethnic groups in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
"The Government of the FRY should be a direct participant in
the negotiations, and any international military presence in
Kosovo should be authorised by the United Nations Security Council
and the consent of the FRY should be sought as well."
</P>
<P>
"Without the consent and participation of the FRY, any peace
plan can achieve nothing," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shen said that China needs to further study the agreement
reached by Russia and seven major Western countries, and "we have
some difficulties in some wordings of the text" of the draft
resolution.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council is not a rubber stamp, and its members
should give full consideration to the draft resolution," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House Tuesday voted
420-0 to pass a bill which allows cash-strapped school districts
in the country to buy small parcels of Forest Service land at
minimal cost for educational purposes.
</P>
<P>
Under the Education Land Grant Bill, school districts could
apply for up to 32.4 hectares of land. Before transferring the
land, the agriculture secretary must determine that it will be
used for a public elementary or secondary school, will serve the
public interest and is not otherwise needed for National Forest
System.
</P>
<P>
Mineral rights would not be included in any transfer, and title
to the land would revert to the government if a district tries to
transfer the land or use it for purposes other than education.
</P>
<P>
Currently, only school districts near land supervised by the
Bureau of Land Management in the Interior Department can apply for
such transfers.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Takes Measures to Deal with Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has put in
place a structure to ensure that corrective measures are taken to
avoid negative effects that maybe caused by the failure of systems
due to the Millennium Bug.
</P>
<P>
According to the Y2K Current Status Report presented by the
government to the third Southern Africa Development Community
(SADC) Y2K National Coordinators Meeting, which was ended here
Tuesday, the measures include the formation of the National
Steering Committee comprising cabinet ministers from key
ministries chaired by the country's vice-president.
</P>
<P>
This committee receives summary reports from the National Task
Force and is also mandated with apportioning national resources to
various areas needing assistance after recommendation from the
task force.
</P>
<P>
Officially formed in September 1998, the task force is charged
with major responsibility to monitor, coordinate and enforce
compliance in both private and public sectors in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the key year-2000 contingency plan was drawn up with
a similar format to the sectors' Year 2000 Project, and the
country's all key sectors already have Disaster Recovery Plans for
natural disasters and other technical problems.
</P>
<P>
Each key sector, such as finance, defense, energy,
communication and transport, mining and education, has a technical
committee that coordinates and monitors year 2000 compliance in
their respective sector and report to the task force.
</P>
<P>
The committees endeavor to provide guidance on Millennium Bug
issues related to their respective sector and also interact with
each other by sharing experiences.
</P>
<P>
Through this sectoral arrangement, the government is able to
effectively monitor the national level of year 2000 preparedness.

According to the minister, the government would continue to
improve benefits for civil servants including monthly transport
allowances as the financial position improved.
</P>

<P>
CAIRO, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The American "Waterworks" company is planning to
establish a waterworks in the Gulf region to be used for
irrigating reclaimed desert areas and improving productivity.
</P>
<P>
The company's regional director Gamal Abdul Khaleq said the
plant will cost 4 billion U.S. dollars and can meet the needs of
the whole region, the Arabic daily Al Hayat reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- Yemeni national currency rial dropped by some 4
percent against the U.S. dollar over the past few days due to the
revenue decline in tourism and the rising demand for the greenback.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was traded at 164 rials Monday, compared with 158
rials last week, the Al Hayat said Tuesday. In March, the exchange
rate is 1:152.
</P>
<P>
Economists attributed the devaluation of the rial to a decline
in tourism revenues following the abduction of 16 western tourists
last December and the deaths of four in a rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- A recent economic study estimated the volume of Saudi
investments in financial and international markets through banks
and investment funds at about 500 billion rials (133.3 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The study attributed the outflow of Saudi capital abroad to the
fact that Saudi capital market has not met "the required level" in
scope and efficiency in introducing and using capital, the Al Hayat
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Thomson Financial Bankwatch, an international rating
company, has revised its sovereign outlook on Lebanon's economy
from positive to stable, the Daily Star reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot uncertainty in the country and we cannot yet be
positive about its future," said Alain Bifani, the company's
sovereign risk analyst in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot be sure what effect the government's fiscal policy
will have," he added.
</P>

The Lebanese government, which was formed last December, is

deficit and public debt.

<HEADLINE> Tehran Mayor Underlines Financial Transparency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Tehran's new mayor Morteza Alviri
Tuesday underlined the need for greater transparency in financial
affairs of the municipality against any possible misappropriation
of funds.
</P>
<P>
Alviri said in his introduction ceremony that a team has been
working in this aspect with an aim of lessening possible
misappropriation of funds and giving answers to official inquiries
whenever they arise.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the remarks indicate that the new mayor
wants to take a lesson from his predecessor Gholamhussein
Karbaschi, who has been jailed since April on graft charges.
</P>
<P>
Both Karbaschi and Alviri are believed here to be the
followers of former Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani and
strong supporters of sitting President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Karbaschi's case was believed to be a political revenge of the
conservatives on him and his party for supporting moderate Khatami
during the 1997 presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Alviri, who was elected Tehran mayor last Tuesday by the
newly-established municipal council, lauded Karbaschi as a
"competent manager" after the Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
He said he would keep Karbaschi's municipal staff "unless and
until they request to be replaced or are incapable of carrying out
their tasks."
</P>
<P>
The mayor said that Tehran municipality does not favor any
political faction and has only the welfare of the citizens in mind.
</P>
<P>
The municipality, by building a healthy city, can lay the
foundation of a civil society, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the municipal affairs, Alviri said that he agreed
to assume the mayorship at a time when the debts of the
municipality amounted to 1,000 billion rials (about 333 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"My initial goal is to prepare a comprehensive city plan," he
said, adding that the plan is formulated by the city council and
the mayor has the responsibility of carrying it out.
</P>
<P>
Alviri, who is also advisor to President Khatami and secretary
general of the Organization of Iranian Free Trade Zones, said that
smoothing city traffic and reducing pollution will top his agenda.
</P>
<P>
As far as air and noise pollution is concerned, Tehran is one
of the most polluted cities in the world, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Begins Meeting on Draft Kosovo Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
began to meet on a draft resolution on Kosovo, hammered out in
Germany by Russia and major Western countries, at 12:00 EST
Tuesday, U.N. officials announced.
</P>
<P>
Before stepping into the Security Council Chamber, Shen
Guofang, deputy Chinese permanent representative to the United
Nations, told reporters that "The most important thing is the
cessation of the bombing, this is important for the Chinese side."
</P>
<P>
Ambassadors of Russia and the seven major Western countries
held talks Tuesday morning ahead of the closed-door Security
Council meeting to introduce a resolution on Kosovo. The eight
ambassadors were also joined by their counterparts from the
Contact Group, which is in charge of the Balkan diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
After two days of talks in Germany, foreign ministers from
Russia and the West reached an agreement Tuesday on how to bring
peace to the Balkans while the U.S.-led NATO is stepping up
bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the U.N. headquarters earlier Tuesday, U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan told reporters of the draft
resolution, saying "I expect it to be at the (Security) Council
today. I hope whatever hurdles there may be, will not be
insurmountable."
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution, to be submitted to the discussion of the
15-nation Security Council Tuesday, deals with the future of
Kosovo, a Serb province, and the role of 50,000 peacekeepers in
the province.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said in Cologne, Germany,
Tuesday that further discussions would be needed in the Security
Council on the make-up of an international peacekeeping force for
Kosovo, reports said.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales In Britain Fall Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Evidence of an economic revival on
the high street has yet to materialise, with sales in May falling
1.3 percent compared to the same month last year, the British
Retail Consortium (BRC) said.
</P>
<P>
Over a longer period, sales dropped by 0.4 percent on a
three-month moving average. That was the weakest showing since the
survey began in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Higginson, chairman of the BRC's economics committee was
quoted as saying Tuesday: "There is no prospect of any overheating
on the high street, which accounts for almost a quarter of UK
spending."
</P>
<P>
Economic observers here believe that the news will add to
concerns that the UK economy is still not growing fast enough,
after a first quarter that saw growth at a standstill.
</P>
<P>
The BRC called on the Bank of England to consider further
interest rate cuts in light of the lack of inflation in the UK.
</P>
<P>
The Bank has cut interest rates six times since last October,
but it has recently called for a halt after seeing what it called
more mixed signals of the state of the economy.

<HEADLINE> EU Women Earn Quarter Less Than Men: Eurostat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The average European Union (EU)
woman has a long way to go before achieving equal pay with the
average man, Eurostat, the EU's statistical office said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey suggests that on average women earn at least a
quarter lean than men. "CaLculations are based on full-time
employees in all economic activities except agriculture,
education, health, personal services and administration," the
Eurostat said.
</P>
<P>
The EU said these averages reflect structural differences in
the characteristics of working women and men, mostly age,
education and occupation. "Fewer women than men occupy management
positions, which are amongst the best paid jobs."
</P>
<P>
The 15 EU countries are Belgium, Germany, Spain, France,
Ireland, Italy, luxemburg, Netherlands, Austria, Portugal,
Finland, Britain, Denmark, Sweden and Greece. The EU-wide survey
said the imbalance in the representation of women and men in
certain economic sectors and occupations is one of the determining
elements of the gender pay gap.
</P>
<P>
"Even when trying to apply male structures to women's average
earnings, the gap is reduced but remains around 15 percent," the
Eurostat said.
</P>
<P>
The overall average wage data should be carefully looked at to
take into account the different position of women and men in the
EU labor market, especially due to concentration of women in
certain types of jobs, the Eurostat added.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Civilian Killed in Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 8 (Xinhua) -- An Iraqi civilian was killed on
Tuesday in U.S. and British warplanes attacks in northern Iraq, an
Iraqi military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was quoted by the Iraqi News Agency as saying
that at 10:30 (0630 GMT), 10 formations of enemy warplanes coming
from Turkish airspace violated northern Iraqi airspace over
Neineva, Dohuk and Erbil provinces.
</P>
<P>
The enemy planes bombed civilian facilities in Bartella
village in Neineva province, killing one civilian, said the
spokesman, adding that Iraqi air defenses fired back.
</P>
<P>
Since the United States and Britain launched four nights of
airstrikes against Iraq last December, their warplanes have made
1,562 sorties over the so-called northern no-fly zone, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed two no-fly zones in Iraq
following the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
"Baghdad's suppression."
</P>
<P>
Since last December's bombardment of Iraqi targets, U.S. and
British warplanes have been regularly bombing Iraqi civilian and
military targets and caused severe civilian casualties and
property damages.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has ever since declared that it does not recognize the
no-fly zones unilaterally imposed by the U.S. and Britain without
authorization from the United Nations, and has vowed to continue
confronting any allied planes violating its airspace.

<HEADLINE> UK Opposition To Euro Reaches Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Opposition to Britain joining the
euro has surged to record heights on the eve of Thursday's
elections to the European Parliament, according to a new opinion
poll published Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An ICM poll for the Guardian newspaper showed that 61 percent
of British people would vote against signing up for the single
currency - a jump of eight points on a month ago when it was 53
percent.
</P>
<P>
ICM interviewed a random sample of 1067 adults aged 18 plus by
telephone between June 4-5. Interviews were conducted across the
country and the results have been weighted to the profile of all
adults.
</P>
<P>
The euro currency has had a troubled time since its birth at
the beginning of the year, falling 12 percent against its main
rival, the U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The latest poll findings will be a further blow for the
Government, which has said it will recommend membership of the
single currency in a referendum after the next election, if the
economic conditions are right.
</P>
<P>
The surge in opposition to the euro was foreshadowed in last
week's Eurobarometer opinion poll which showed that 63 percent
were satisfied with the government's decision not to join the
first wave of EU countries in the single currency.
</P>
<P>
The news that it has turned into firm opposition indicates that
far from the election campaign providing an opportunity for Labor
to turn around the argument over the euro, it has actually gone
backwards.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- African countries have been
urged to modernize their traditional farming methods to skirt
socio-economic problems.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopian Vice Minister of Agriculture Belay Ejigu made the
call Monday when opening an agricultural projects management
training course at Debre- Zeit, some 40 kms away from capital
Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency Tuesday quoted Belay as saying that
agriculture, which is the mainstay of many African countries, is
at its infancy on the continent.
</P>
<P>
"Africa ought to improve its backward farming system to achieve
food self-sufficiency and augment its income," he stated.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian official stressed that political stability,
economic cooperation and peace are vital to ensure food
self-sufficiency and food security on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Some 39 agricultural experts form Ethiopia, Uganda, Tanzania
and Namibia are attending the two-month training course jointly
sponsored by the African Development Bank, the International
Agricultural Development Fund and the Organization of African
Unity.
</P>
<P>
About 750 agricultural experts from 27 African countries have
been trained so far under the African agricultural management
training program, according to the African Development Institute.

<HEADLINE> Bombing Kosovo Knocks Euro, U.S. Economists say </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Peter Canelo, U.S. investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, was quoted Tuesday by Investor's Business Daily as saying
that the impact of bombing Kosovo shows up most in the decline of
euro against the U.S. dollar. "The Europan currency has dropped
nearly 13 percent against the dollar since its January 4 debut at
around 1.18 U.S. dollars. The euro traded Monday afternoon below
1.03 dollars, a new low," Canelo said.
</P>
<P>
Canelo attributed part of that decline to Kosovo. "To the
extent that euro-denominated assets lose favor, that helps
dollar-denominated assets," he said.
</P>
<P>
The dollar-euro rate "actually is a benefit for the U.S.
market. In Asia, we were the safe haven," Canelo said, adding
that "That enables our markets to be relatively insulated to
what is going on in other markets."
</P>
<P>
Currency analyst David Gilmore from Foreign Exchange
Analytics also acknowledged impact of bombing Kosovo on the
European currency. Kosovo has really been a "background issue" for
most of the move down in the euro or the move up in the dollar
and markets have not ignored it.
</P>
<P>
U.S. economists believed that bombing Kosovo poses limited,
digestible repercussions for the U.S. economy. Canelo said fears
about the bombing have probably contributed to the recent
decline in equity prices but he believed cloud is lifting.
</P>
<P>
Short of significant escalation such as a NATO ground
invasion in Kosovo, the bombing seems to hold no major threat
to the U.S. economy, he said.

JERUSALEM, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Ministry said here
Tuesday that no Jews in Iran were spying for Israel as was charged
by the Iranian authorities.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon declared that no
one of the arrested Jews in Iran was involved in espionage and no
one of them has or had any connection with any Israeli
intelligence agency.
</P>
<P>
"Israel is worried about these arrests which have occurred
only because they are Jewish. Israel is deeply concerned about
their fate and demands their immediate release," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Iranian radio reported Monday night that Iranian authorities
have arrested 13 Jews living in the southern Fars province on
charges of spying for Israel and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The arrests were made several weeks ago in the city of Shiraz,
but Israeli officials have ever since refrained from commenting on
the case, fearing that any comment could make things worse for
the arrested Jews.
</P>

In 1977, Iran hanged two people convicted of spying for Israel

BISHKEK, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Kirghizstan's President Askar
Akayevich Akayev held talks with visiting Chinese Vice Premier

</P>
<P>
During the talks, Akayev said cooperation between the two
neighboring nations is developing well. He pointed out that
economic aid projects conducted by China in Kirghizstan have
already produced good results.
</P>
<P>
A stronger economic and trade relationship between the two

president noted.
</P>
<P>
Qian said bilateral relationship has been strengthened and
mutual understanding and trust have been deepened since the two
nations established diplomatic ties seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is committed to further development of
bilateral ties, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
The two said they are happy to see that the border agreement
signed in 1996 has demarcated most of their common border.
</P>
<P>
Recently, experts from China and Kirghizstan agreed on the
demarcation of the last controversial part of their border, they

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
today that the U.S.-led NATO's military intervention of Yugoslavia
goes against the will of the people.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks in a telephone conversation with his
Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
He said that NATO's wanton use of force against Yugoslavia is
not an ordinary, or isolated matter, but is a key issue which has
a bearing on what kind of new international order can be
established and where the world is going in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president said that the Chinese government's
position on the Kosovo issue is consistent and clear cut,
stressing that the independence, sovereignty and territorial
integrity of Yugoslavia should be respected. and a Security
Council resolution should fully reflect the positions of all
parties, and in particular, Yugoslavia's opinions should be heard.
</P>
<P>
"China and Russia have maintained close consultations and
reached wide-ranging consensus on the Yugoslav issue in various
forms and through various channels recently," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As long as we are convinced that our proposals are correct, we
should hold our stance to the end," Jiang said.

Yeltsin said that Russia and China share the same views on the
Kosovo issue, and these reflect the will of the international
community. When the Security Council reviews relevant resolutions,
Russia will maintain consultations with China, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the two countries should work hard to safeguard
and respect the authority and dignity of the United Nations,
adding that the interests and will of any single country or a bloc
of countries cannot be placed over the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"All U.N. members should respect the basic principles of the U.
N. Charter, including respecting national sovereignty, and non-
interference in others' internal affairs and a peaceful solution
to conflicts," Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that the world should be multi-polarized,
otherwise it will not enjoy peace at all.
</P>
<P>
Jiang told Yeltsin that he looks forward to the second informal
meeting with Yeltsin in Beijing scheduled for this autumn. He said
that the meeting will be of great significance in the current new
international situation.
</P>
<P>
The two countries should further strengthen cooperation in all
fields, he added.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Unveil Medicare Change Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton is
planning to change the Medicare program to offer prescription drug
coverage to all beneficiaries, The New York Times reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The new proposal, to be announced later this month, would allow
tens of millions of U.S. seniors to receive prescription drug
coverage for the first time, White House Chief of Staff John
Podesta said.
</P>
<P>
Podesta said Clinton's plan would require seniors to pay a
"modest premium" in exchange for prescription drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
Such a plan is expected to save the government money by
reducing the need for hospital stays and nursing home care.
</P>
<P>
The premium for the prescription drug coverage would be less
than 25 dollars a month, possibly as little as 10 dollars a month,
the administration officials were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Beneficiaries of Medicare, which serves 39 million elderly or
disabled people, now pay a 45.50 dollars monthly premium for
coverage that doesn't include drugs.
</P>
<P>
Many beneficiaries pay 80 dollars a month or more for
prescription drug coverage under private insurance to plug the
gaps in Medicare. The medication costs leave some financially
strapped seniors unable to pay for drugs.
</P>
<P>
Experts said without major changes, Medicare is expected to run
short of money when the first wave of baby boomers retire around
2010.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Productivity Increases 3.5 Percent in First </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. workers' productivity rose
at an annual rate of 3.5 percent in the first quarter of the year
while wage pressures remained well contained, the Labor Department
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 3.5 percent increase in productivity for the first three
months represented a slight downward revision from the
Department's initial estimate a month ago that productivity had
risen 4 percent in the period.
</P>
<P>
In today's report, unit labor costs, the amount of compensation
per unit of output, picked up 0.7 percent at an annual rate in the
first quarter, compared to an original estimate of a 0.3 percent
increase.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said even with the upward revision, a rise of just 0.7
percent in unit labor costs is considered a good sign that wage
pressures are well contained, though the nation's unemployment
rate was down to a 29-year low of just 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The 0.7 percent rise in unit labor costs followed an actual
decline of 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter last year. For all of
1998, unit labor costs were up 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The productivity increase for the first quarter represents a
strong advance, better than the 2.2 percent gain for all of 1998.
And even the 2.2 percent annual figure represented an improvement
from weak productivity growth over the last two decades, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
Productivity is considered the key measurement determining
whether workers' living standards will increase.

<HEADLINE> Bhutanese Group to Organize Mass Return of Refugees to Bhutan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A Bhutanese political group is
scheduled to organize Thursday a mass return to Bhutan of refugees
residing in Nepal, the group said in a press release Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Bhutan Gorkha National Liberation Front (BGNLF) said that
it is organizing a movement inside Bhutan. "In our own version,
this would be the final movement for the BGNLF and hopefully for
the Bhutanese exile movement as a whole," it said.
</P>
<P>
It said the program would include a mass return of refugees to
Bhutan beginning on Thursday and 150 to 200 households from
different camps in Nepal are expected to join the program in the
first lot.
</P>
<P>
The main program will take place in Phuntsholing, a border town
in Bhutan and would soon spread over to other parts of Bhutan, the
group said.
</P>
<P>
"The foremost objective of the program is to achieve a peaceful
breakthrough of the ensuing crisis by creating an environment for
negotiations between the Royal Government and BGNLF," the group
said.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 Bhutanese refugees are staying in eight U.N.-run
camps in eastern Nepal after being forced to flee Bhutan in 1989
and early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
I.B. Pathak from the BGNLF alleged that they are the victims of
racial segregation. He said the organization was formed in
December 1994 to protect Bhutanese Gorkha communities or the
refugees living in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
He told Xinhua that the organization has been pushing for
constitutional protection of the Bhutanese Gorkha communities,
shared representation in the National Assembly of Bhutan and
repatriation of the refugees.
</P>
<P>
He said that under the program for Thursday, the refugees will
travel through India as Bhutanese passengers. He said under a
treaty signed in 1949 between Bhutan and India, "we can travel as
Bhutanese citizens."
</P>
<P>
Nepal and Bhutan had held seven rounds of ministerial talks
over the refugee issue but failed to reach any agreement. Bhutan
insisted that it would take back only those of genuine Bhutanese
origin.

<HEADLINE> Bombs Fall on Macedonian Border Village Near Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SKOPJE, June 8 (Xinhua) -- An unspecific number of bombs fell and
exploded early Wednesday morning in a Macedonian village on the border
between Macedonia and Kosovo, the southern Serbian province of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
People in the Jazince village were waken up by big bangs of
explosion at about 03:00 a.m. local time (0200 GMT). The explosions
caused only some property damage and no casualties.
</P>
<P>
A bomb created a rectangular hole on the roof of a house, in which
12 members of the family were sleeping when it hit the roof and
exploded. Behind the house is a small village school.
</P>
<P>
Two nearby cattle sheds were damaged by separate bombs.
</P>
<P>
Nobody knows for sure where the bombs had come from before the
investigation, which is under way, comes out with its findings.
</P>
<P>
A French TV reporter, when he set out with his team for the site,
said that the bombs were dropped by NATO warplanes "mistakenly" on the
village, 20 kilometers northeast of the northwestern Macedonian city
Tetovo.
</P>
<P>
But the Albanian villagers said that they believed the bombs came
from the Yugoslav side and asked the Macedonian government to launch a
protest.
</P>
<P>
The government was very cautious regarding the bombing incident.
</P>
<P>
Macedonian Foreign Ministry officials were quoted by the New
Macedonia newspaper as saying that the government was waiting for the
investigation to finish and then would decide to say about it.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that the bombs might not come from the Yugoslav
side.

<HEADLINE> More Children Facing Malnutrition in Central </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- More children in central Angola are
facing malnutrition due to prolonged civil war.
</P>
<P>
Many children, together with elderly people and women, are
living in dire difficulties in refugee camps. There are 172,500
refugees camping in central Huambo city and neighboring Caala
city.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the Central Hospital in Huambo,
the number of the children admitted in the past two months for
serious malnutrition has increased by 95 percent.
</P>
<P>
Head of the pediatrics in the hospital, Beatriz Hossi said
Tuesday that the number of the children admitted by the hospital
for malnutrition went up to 266 in early June from April's 136.
</P>
<P>
The doctor described these children as mainly under eight
years, saying most of them are fleeing war with their parents.
</P>
<P>
Hossi said that currently, the sick children can have two meals
everyday besides the special care.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations World Food Program is providing aid to the
hospital, he added.
</P>
<P>
Fierce fightings around Huambo have brought about insecurity
in the area, adversely affecting the agricultural production and
cutting off road traffic. As a result, serious food shortage is
seen stalking the place.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj
Aziz Tuesday said Pakistan has accepted the date proposed by India
for his visit to New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
Aziz told Xinhua that the purpose of his visit is to reduce
tension and de-escalate the situation on the Line of Control
(LoC).
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said he will leave for New Delhi on June
12.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Spokesman for the Pakistan Foreign Office Rafiq Altaf
welcomed the Indian decision to accept Pakistan's proposal for
sending its foreign minister to New Delhi for talks on Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome that, after all, the Indians have found it
convenient to respond to our initiative to send Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz to New Delhi," Altaf said.
</P>
<P>
India on Thursday accepted peace talks with Pakistan on Kashmir
and suggested that Aziz visit New Delhi on June 12.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif offered, in his telephone
talks with his Indian counterpart Atal Bihari Vajpayee on May 28,
to send Aziz to New Delhi for talks with Indian Foreign Minister
Jaswant Singh on the ways and means to defuse the situation in
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
India had accepted that proposal, but rejected Pakistan's
proposal of June 7 as the visit date, saying it is "not
convenient" for India.

LONDON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Northern Ireland Secretary Mo

not be disbanded.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the annual conference of the Northern Ireland
Police Federation in County Down, Mowlam made it clear that the
Independent Commission on Policing will, however, recommend some

</P>

"I hear calls for disbandment of the RUC and those who are

<P>
"It has to be said these are very narrow views and the prime
minister and I have made it clear that neither of these extreme
options is possible," BBC quoted Mowlam as saying.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Police Federation, Les Rodgers told the conference
that Sinn Fein had co-ordinated an "evil conspiracy" to destroy
the credibility of the RUC over the last year.
</P>
<P>
Attacking Sinn Fein and other critics of the RUC he said:
"Their sole purpose is to destroy the credibility of this force by
ensuring we have no future. I cannot believe their campaign can be

<HEADLINE> Belgium to Restore Chicken Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc
Dehaene said here on Tuesday that the ban on poultry slaughter
for dioxin harm prevention could be lifted from Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"From midnight tonight it will be possible to start
slaughtering and deliveries of Belgian chickens from three
quarters of the Belgian farms," the prime minister told a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Trying to calm the food scare which broke out ten days ago,
Dehaene said the same should apply to pork and beef 24 hours later
if a full list of firms, that used animal feed possibly
contaminated with cancer-causing dioxin, had been worked out.
</P>
<P>
"Every one admits it is not a general contamination, but a
restricted accident that we have to isolate," he said, adding that
"we are doing the impossible, are using every means so that before
the end of the week...the situation is normal again".
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said samples taken at three animal feed
firms in the country had been tested positive for dioxin. But
samples from six other firms showed negative since the firms
produced and sold animal feed with fat from a Belgian oils and
fats processing company believed to be at the heart of the food
scare.
</P>
<P>
Between 300 and 350 samples of possibly contaminated animal
feed and fats would also be tested for the presence of
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), the toxic man-made chemicals
which create dioxins when heated, he said, adding the results
could be obtained in two days.
</P>
<P>
The food scare, the biggest since the scandal over mad cow
disease in British beef in 1996, has caused strong impact on
Belgium's exports of chickens, eggs, pork, beef, their by-products
and butter, provoking countries in different regions of the world
to block Belgian food exports and leaving panic consumers in this
country scrambling for their food alternatives.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Army Forces to Be Smaller But Better: Defense  Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The only solution to make
Romanian army more efficient is to cut the effectives, said
National Defense Minister Victor Babiuc in an interview with
Cronica Romana daily of June 8.
</P>
<P>
The army needs better instruction and equipping in order to
guarantee national security, but that asks for much money, said
the minister. Since no funds can be added to the existing meagre
budget, the only solution is to cut the effectives, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
With reference to the Ministry's structure recently embraced by
the Government, Victor Babiuc said that the army started reforming
in 1990. Over 1993-1996, the Ministry was restructured, the staffs
were constituted and the army was put under civilian control.
</P>
<P>
A Western-style modular-system organization of the general
staff and of the staffs of arm categories was accomplished after
1996. All of this led to effectives only 180,000-strong, from
320,000 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The army's reorganization is a necessity in the current period
of transition, that makes itself felt in the entire Romanian
society. The shoe-string budget will go first to the combatting
forces, underscored the minister.
</P>
<P>
The army's reorganization is also required by Romania's need to
fulfil its strategic objective of Euro-Atlantic integration. The
NATO membership demands similarity up to a point between the
allied military forces, from the leading to the combatting bodies,
said Babiuc.
</P>
<P>
The army reform is to continue with the drafting of a national
preparation program for NATO admission, complying with the
Membership Action Plan, adopted by the Washington Summit. The
program is aimed at creating a force structure low in number,
but with high operational capacity, able to accomplish various
missions, from those specific to collective defense to
humanitarian ones, Babiuc said in the end.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Business Confidence Slips in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Business confidence in South
Africa slipped in May, after it improved in April, the South
African Chamber of Business (Sacob) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sacob's business confidence index (BCI) had shown a 0.8 point
decrease to 84.4 in May compared to a 0.7 point increase in April.
</P>
<P>
Sacob said the backward slide in the BCI was mainly due to
"jitters" within business circles about the recent national
elections, concerns about the stability of the United States
economy as well as the "stresses and strains" in Europe,
predominately involving the euro.
</P>
<P>
But the organization's new chief executive officer Kevin
Wakeford said he believed that the economy had now bottomed out.
</P>
<P>
He also had a strong message for President-in-waiting Thabo
Mbeki and his colleagues in the new session of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Sacob, he said, wanted a reaffirmation of the policies of the
growth, employment and redistribution strategy (Gear) at both
local and national levels. "We can only compete globally if we
achieve locally," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wakeford, who took over from Raymond Parsons, the retiring
director- general of Sacob, also called for "furious
privatization", greater facilitation of operation for small and
medium-sized businesses, a "free-up" of labor mobility, interest
rate cuts and more tax relief which would encourage individuals to
save.
</P>
<P>
The new CEO also urged Mbeki to ensure more cash was spent on
promoting trade, tourism and investment marketing.
</P>
<P>
Although Sacob believes the business cycle may be over the
worst, it added: "The real economy still has to reflect the
improvement in international and local financial conditions.
</P>
<P>
"The slack domestic demand in the economy as reflected by the
low level of credit extension to the private sector and real
retail and wholesale sales, does not only call for even lower
interest rates, but also needs an improvement in the real
disposable income of households.
</P>
<P>
"Much will depend on how the supply side of the economy
responds to a continued easing of monetary policy and improved
demand conditions. Exports are not performing at the rate that is
needed to lift the economy to higher sustainable growth levels and
much needs to be done to improve South Africa's foreign trade
performance, including the import market."
</P>
<P>
The Sacob manufacturing survey for May showed that short-term
conditions continued to remain uncertain.
</P>
<P>
Looking to the year ahead, 50 percent of respondents expected
to invest more in maintaining existing production, compared to 46
percent in April.
</P>
<P>
There was worse news on the labor front where only 33 percent
of respondents expected to employ more unskilled workers over the
next 12 months. Some 42 percent said they could employ more
skilled workers.

<HEADLINE> Romania: Poultry, Pork Start Being Sought For on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Romanian poultry and pork
producers have been assailed with export demands, since the
dioxine-poisened Belgian chickens scandal broke at the beginning
of the month, the Union of Poultry breeders of Romania informed
here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The reason is the fact that the EU consumers started worrying
with their own products and, as a result, the Romanian products
are highly demanded, as they are found to be healthier than the
western ones of the same kind, the union stressed.
</P>
<P>
Romanian poultry and pork makers feed their animals on the
classic sun flower oil instead of another artificial grease. Sun
flower oil is more appropriate for feeding chickens or hogs, as it
bestows the Romanian poultry and pork a particular unmistakable
flavor, although the former is more expensive than the chemical
grease obtained by out-of-control sources, the union believed.
</P>
<P>
Although the dioxine scandal triggered out a surge in demand of
Romanian specific exports, the home producers cannot be
competitive because of high output costs, the union said, adding
that the government must deblock the export incentives.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the union drew the attention that EU pork
banning in many importing countries will bring about a surplus of
low-quality products to be headed to the unprotected markets, such
as Romania's. The domestic producers also ask safeguarding
measures to be urgently taken against massive imports, which could
come forth as a result of EU markets' rejection.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Spend 47 Million Rand on Inauguration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Up to 47 million rand (7.7
million U.S. dollars) would be spent on the inauguration of South
Africa's next president -- an event expected to be attended by
4,500 invited guests, an official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Water Affairs and Forestry Minister Kader Asmal told reporters
in Pretoria that a large portion of this money had been set aside
for security arrangements for foreign dignitaries attending the
June 16 event, including at least 30 heads of state.
</P>
<P>
Asmal, who heads an inter-ministerial committee coordinating
the inauguration, said 96 government delegations had accepted the
invitation to date.
</P>
<P>
These included five members of royalty, 30 presidents -- 27 of
them from Africa -- six deputy presidents, 11 prime ministers, and
six governors- general.
</P>
<P>
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan would also attend,
as well as his counterparts from the Organization of African Unity
and the Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
Asmal declined to name any of the other dignitaries, saying
this would be premature due to security and other reasons.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to (tell you), because some of them are very
exciting names, but it would be premature to do so."
</P>
<P>
Asmal said the ceremony would cost about 47 million rand, of
which 10 million rand had been acquired by means of sponsorships.
</P>
<P>
"It is critically important that South Africa presents to the
country, the region and the world, a face of confidence, all-round
security and economic well-being."
</P>
<P>
The next president, tipped to be Thabo Mbeki, would be sworn in
by Constitutional Court President Arthur Chaskalson at the Union
Buildings in Pretoria on June 16.
</P>
<P>
The event would also boast a fly-past by the South African Air
Force, as well as "some surprises," Asmal said.
</P>
<P>
At about 12.45 p.m. (1045 GMT), the new president and his
predecessor, Nelson Mandela, would address the opening of people's
concert at the lawns of the Union Buildings.
</P>
<P>
On the evening of June 16, 1,300 guests would attend a
symphonic poem at the State Theater in Pretoria, featuring a
philharmonic orchestra, two choirs and two dance companies.
</P>
<P>
This would be followed by a banquet hosted by the president in
honor of Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Three sports events had been dedicated to the new and outgoing
presidents -- the international rugby match between South Africa
and Italy in Port Elizabeth this Saturday, a soccer game between
Bafana Bafana and Zimbabwe at the FNB stadium on inauguration day,
and the Comrades Marathon on the same day.

<HEADLINE> Romania Floats Two New Treasury Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Romania's Finance Ministry
decided to float two new treasury bonds in national currency lei
for the population, in an attempt to get new financial resources
for the budget.
</P>
<P>
Beginning Tuesday, the Finance Ministry issues a new treasury
bond, having a 90 day-settling day. The annual interest the state
offers is 78 percent and the nominal value of a treasury bond will
be one million lei(63 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The other treasury bond will be floated on Wednesday, and it
will have a 180 day-settling day and an annual interest of 75
percent. The nominal value of a treasury bond will be one million
lei as well.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance has collected about 2.100 billion lei
from the population from the beginning of the year and, it hopes
to reach 3,000 billion lei through the two new treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
A few days ago, the Central Bank's governor Mugur Isarescu said
that because of the increase in the inflation rate, there was a
possibility to diminish interests in the following months. He
explained that the banks' high interests had attempted to avoid
the orientation towards hard currency of the domestic market's
liquidities so that the exchange rate be not affected and, the
efforts for the payment of Romania's peak foreign debt be not
jeopardized.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Boeing Company
postponed the launch of a Delta 2 rocket carrying four satellites
for the Globalstar worldwide phone network because of storm
clouds, company officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The launch was called off less than an hour before the planned
liftoff from Cape Canaveral in Florida State Tuesday due to the
danger of a lightning strike during the rocket's flight. The
company rescheduled the launch for Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Globalstar is an international consortium led by Loral Space
and Communications. It suffered a major launch failure in 1998
when a Ukrainian Zenit rocket exploded during launch, destroying
12 of its satellites.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's launch will be the first unmanned rocket launch
from Cape Canaveral since a string of expensive failures in April
and May left three satellites in the wrong orbits.
</P>
<P>
Four satellites which will form part of Globalstar's planned
worldwide wireless phone network are to be placed into orbit by
the 12-story Delta 2.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia, Vietnam Vow to Solve Border Issues by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian and Vietnamese leaders
pledged Wednesday to solve their long-running border disputes
before the end of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh Cam made the remarks
after a three-hour meeting of the third Cambodia-Vietnam Joint
Commission for Economic, Cultural, Scientific and Technical
Cooperation in Phnom Penh which also focused on the issues of the
border and the Vietnamese immigrations.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was chaired by Cambodian Foreign Minister Hor Nam
Hong and his Vietnamese counterpart Nguyen Manh Cam when General
Secretary of the Vietnamese Communist Party Le Kha Phieu was
paying a two-day state visit to Cambodia on Wednesday and
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nguyen Manh Cam told reporters after the meeting that "we
proposed that the joint commission on border continue their work
of discussion to resolve the problem before the end of the year
2000."
</P>
<P>
On the issue of the Vietnamese immigrant, Hor Nam Hong said:
"The Cambodian government will offer the Vietnamese residents
protection and treat them equally like all other foreign residents
in Cambodia."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that there are at least 70,000 to 100,000
Vietnamese now living in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Phieu received a red-carpet welcome and was greeted by all
Cambodia's top leaders including King Norodom Sihanouk and Queen
Norodom Monineath upon his arrival in Cambodia on Wednesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday afternoon, Phieu called on the king and Queen, and
met with Senate President Chea Sim, National Assembly President
Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Prime Minister Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
The two sides expressed their satisfaction at the smooth
development of the relations between the two countries in recent
years. They also reaffirmed their determination to consolidate and
strengthen the traditional friendship and cooperation between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting with Phieu, Prime Minister Hun Sen proposed
to form a Cambodia and Vietnam joint commission for resolving the
border disputes, which includes the joint commissions at
provincial, district and commune levels.
</P>
<P>
Le Kha Phieu agreed with Hun Sen on the proposal and said that
the Vietnamese government and people wish that their common border
will become a peace and friendship one. He also urged that the
border issues will be solved through peaceful ways before the 21st
century.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Taliban Offensive Repulsed: Afghan Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan opposition Wednesday
claimed that its forces have repulsed a fresh Taliban offensive on
the strategic town of Darre Suf in the northern Samangan province.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the Northern Alliance group Harakat-e-Islami
Hussain Anwari said that the Taliban forces launched a major
offensive on Durre Suf Tuesday afternoon from the east of the
valley Guldara and Gulzar.
</P>
<P>
"By midnight, the Taliban forces had been repulsed and in the
process received a severe blow by the Alliance troops," Anwari
said.
</P>
<P>
He said Alliance commanders have confirmed that over 50 Taliban
troops were killed in the valley's latest battle and 40 others
were captured as prisoners of war.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Alliance forces succeeded in seizing a sizable
quantity of ammunitions, according to Anwari.
</P>
<P>
He said the Taliban ground troops were assisted in the
operation by their air force, which carried out 12 sorties over
the valley and the surrounding region.
</P>
<P>
The casualties for the Northern Alliance included two dead and
scores injured, said Anwari.
</P>
<P>
Anwari also claimed that an Alliance counter offensive yielded
positive results with their forces recapturing Qulamesh, Marajee
and Charqala to the east of Darre Suf.

<HEADLINE> East Timor to Hold Direct Balloting on August 7 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. president Jimmy Carter
Wednesday confirmed that the direct ballot in East Timor will be
held on August 7 instead of August 8 as stipulated in an agreement
signed by Indonesia, Portugal and the United Nations on May 5.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has proposed holding the vote on
August 7 as August 8 falls on Sunday, the day when the predominant
Catholic East Timorese go to church.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and the Portuguese government had insisted
that the ballot be held on August 8 as agreed upon earlier.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the ballot would run smoothly and peacefully," Carter
told reporters after a 40-minute unscheduled meeting with
President B.J. Habibie here Wednesday to discuss the preparations
for the direct ballot on a wide-ranging autonomy for East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the United
Nations, which still considers Portugal as the administering power
of the territory.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the Indonesian government announced it would
grant East Timor independence if the people in the territory
reject Indonesia's offer of a wide-ranging autonomy.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Urges Immediate End to NATO Air Strikes on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin on
Wednesday urged British and German leaders to immediately halt
NATO's air strikes against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation initiated by British Prime Minister
Tony Blair, Yeltsin said NATO should show good faith and
immediately halt its airstrikes against Yugoslavia, according to
the presidential press service.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin also held a telephone conversation with German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder on the Kosovo issue.
</P>
<P>
All three leaders expressed satisfaction that the foreign
ministers of the seven major industrialized nations and Russia had
succeeded in drafting a U.N. Security Council resolution on Kosovo,
the Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Both Blair and Gerhard praised Russia's efforts in
finding a resolution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin responded by saying that NATO should reciprocate by
ceasing the airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Russian Prime Minister Sergei
Stepashin on Wednesday described as "excellent" the results of the
Balkan talks in Cologne, Germany, which Russian Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov attended.
</P>
<P>
However, Stepashin said he is "concerned" about financing the
Russian contingent in Kosovo. "At first we deploy our contingent,
then the United Nations reimburses us for the cost," which is
estimated at an annual 150 million U.S. dollars, the premier said.
</P>
<P>
The compensation will be transferred by the end of the year but
the money is needed right now, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian-U.S. military talks on Russian contingent in
the future peacekeeping operation in Kosovo, originally scheduled
for Wednesday, was moved to Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. generals and Pentagon military experts will arrive in
Moscow either on Wednesday evening or on Thursday morning,"
Interfax reported, quoting sources with the Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The talks will be conducted in "a closed format" and "neither
the composition of the sides' delegations nor the venue for the
talks have been determined yet," the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Viktor Chernomyrdin, the Russian presidential envoy for
Yugoslavia, and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott may
join the talks.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov and U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright had reached an agreement pertaining to
these talks in Bonn, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Armed Forces to Support Next President: Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian armed forces will
support the president to be elected by the People's Consultative
Assembly (MPR) later this year, provided he/she is the best
son/daughter of the nation and is elected democratically.
</P>
<P>
Governor of the National Resilience Institute (Lemhanas) Let.
Gen. Agum Gumelar said the armed forces will accept whoever the
people want to become the next president.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the discussion "Evaluation of the General Election
and Indonesia After the Election" here Wednesday, Agum stressed
that the armed forces have tried hard to be neutral to all
political parties since the start of the election process and this
neutrality will continue until the general session of the MPR.
</P>
<P>
Agum however declined to comment on the possible fielding of
Defense Minister/Armed Forces Chief Gen. Wiranto as a presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
He warned that no money politics should be practiced during the
presidential election, "otherwise the new government would not
last long."
</P>
<P>
The next MPR, which will be formed following the June 7
election, will elect a new president in November.
</P>
<P>
The presidential election should be democratic, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the June 7 general election, Agum predicted that at least
five political parties will dominate the election -- the
Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle, Golkar Party, National
Mandate Party, the National Awakening Party and the United
Development Party.
</P>
<P>
He also predicted that there will be a coalition among the
defeated political parties.
</P>
<P>
Such a coalition among defeated parties should be aimed at
facing the nation's future, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It should not merely (criticize) the government but should
help it correct its mistakes," he said, noting that the coalition
and the government should not destroy each other.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former U.S. president Jimmy Carter Wednesday said
that the coming presidential election would be most crucial in the
annals of Indonesia's 1999 general election.
</P>
<P>
Carter said he was fully confident that, by the end of this
year, Indonesia will have a president who is acceptable to all the
people, thus reinvigorating national unity and cohesion.
</P>
<P>
Incumbent President B.J. Habibie, General Chairman of the
Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle Megawati Soekarnoputri,
leader of the country's largest Muslim organization Nahdlatul
Ulama Abdurrahman Wahid and General Chairman of the National
Mandate Party Amien Rais were already named by some parties as
contenders of the presidency.

<HEADLINE> Indonesians Urged to Avoid Spoiling Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Armed Forces chief
General Wiranto appealed to the people in the country on Wednesday
to be patient to wait for the result of vote counting and avoid
making statements that would only spoil the situation.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his appreciation to the people over the success and
security of the general elections on Monday, Wiranto said the
development of democracy had gone well.
</P>
<P>
Some political parties and observers have criticized the slow
vote counting by the election commission because only more than 1
percent of the total votes were made public on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Avoid unnecessary acts which would only deviate the good
development so far especially now when vote counting is just
underway," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the nation still has many things to do. "We still have
to form the House of Representatives(DPR), the People's
Consultative Assembly (MPR) and conduct the MPR session," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto refused to comment on the preliminary result of vote
counts so far that had given the Indonesian Democratic Party of
Struggle (PDI-P) a lead, saying it is the business of the General
Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
"I only care about national security affairs and my attention
now is on how to finish the general elections in several regions,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the General Election Commission, PDI-P took an
early lead in the vote counts in 14 provinces and the ruling
Golkar Party led in 12 other provinces.

<HEADLINE> France Spends Billions of Francs in NATO Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- France is spending billions of francs
to participate in the NATO operation against Yugoslavia and for
the future peacekeeping operation in Kosovo, said French
government on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
French Defense Minister Alain Richard said that the operation
in Yugoslavia and Kosovo is expected to cost France from 3.5
billion to 4 billion francs (540 million to 605 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The evaluation is based on the costs of French troops'
participating in the NATO air campaign over the past two months
and the dispatching to the Balkans of ground troops, including 7,
000 troops to be deployed in Kosovo as part of the Kosovo Peace
Force (KFOR).
</P>
<P>
The French government is also expected to spend 2 billion
francs (300 U.S. dollars) this year on the troops deployed in
Bosnia and Africa, said the defense minister.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The second summit on the
Security and Independence of the International Civil Service will
be held Wednesday morning at the United Nations Headquarters in New
York.
</P>
<P>
The event is organized by the United Nations Staff Council
Standing Committee on the Security and Independence of the
International Civil Service.
</P>
<P>
To address the increasing security problems faced by the United
Nations personnel around the world, the second summit will focus
on the urgent need for governments to demonstrate in practice
their commitment to protect the international civil servants
performing their duties in often highly difficult and dangerous
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Other issues include security training for staff and a
follow-up to the statement of principles issued from the first
summit of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the first-ever summit highlighted the increasingly
hazardous and very often life-threatening conditions in which
international staff have to operate, and offered possible
solutions.
</P>
<P>
Since the first summit a year ago, over 20 United Nations
personnel have been killed. Incidents of kidnapping, arrest,
detention, attack and injury have increased, while the fate of
some 50 staffers detained or missing throughout the world is
still unknown.

<HEADLINE> Tourism Authority of Thailand to Adopt New Accounting System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Tourism Authority of Thailand
(TAT) plans to adopt a new accounting system named "Satellite
Account" in mid-June to reflect the greater role of tourism and
related activities in the Thai economy, a TAT press release said
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Previously, tourism income was calculated mainly from major
industries like accommodation, catering, entertainment, recreation
and transportation.
</P>
<P>
The Satellite Account will cover 20 additional tourism-related
activities, for example, financial services, securities services,
rental car manufacturing and resort development.
</P>
<P>
The new system, which was proposed by the World Travel and
Tourism Council recently, is still a new concept in world tourism.
Only a small number of countries have implemented it, including
the United States, Canada, Australia, Singapore and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"The satellite accounting system will show how the Thai tourism
industry could generate more than 10 percent of the country's
gross domestic product," the new release quoted Pitak
Intrawityanunt, the minister of Prime Minister' Office who
oversees tourism industry, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The tourism industry now offers more than 1.3 million jobs for
the Thai people, the release said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Have Poll Results on June 21: Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The official results of the June 7
general election will be announced on June 21, Chairman of the
Indonesian Election Committee (PPI) Jakob Tobing told reporters
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that the announcement of provisional election
results by the General Election Commission (KPU) was not official.
</P>
<P>
He gave his guarantee that the election results to be announced
on June 21 will be free from any engineering or manipulation,
saying the committee has a protection mechanism.
</P>
<P>
"The best protection is that each result of the vote count
should be accompanied by an official report signed by the
representatives of all political parties contesting in the
election," he said.
</P>
<P>
The KPU originally planned to gather and announce at least 60
percent of the votes in 12 hours after voting ended at 14:00 local
time (07:00 GMT) on Monday. But as of 20:15 local time Tuesday,
less than one percent of the votes were counted.
</P>
<P>
Some observers said the slow process opened loopholes for
vote-rigging. However, KPU Chairman Rudini said the lateness was
"the consequence of slow but accurate reporting of ballot
counting" in regions.
</P>
<P>
According to Tobing, it will take time to produce accurate and
credible election results.
</P>
<P>
He said every data should first be verified by representatives
of the election contestants before being tabulated.
</P>
<P>
"So I ask the people to be patient," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chairman of the University Network for Free and Fair
Elections (UNFREL) Todong Mulya Lubis Wednesday called on all
election observers to exercise care in making observations.
</P>
<P>
He said all parties concerned should avoid making rash
conclusions about the election being free and fair because the
data available have been quite limited while the process itself
still has a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
An election can only be declared free and fair if the processes
of vote counting, data processing and public announcement of the
results are also free of manipulation, he added.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Rebels Urged to Accept Amnesty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He made the appeal at a function marking the 10th anniversary
of the Heroes' Day here Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"I call up those leaders who have connections with the bandits
to use the opportunity and come out," the president said in an
address to the whole nation.
</P>
<P>
"The criminals will be remembered if they repent their wrong
deeds and contribute to the recovery of Uganda," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Museveni pointed out that those rebels did not dare come out to
confront the government army and therefore have chosen soft
targets to tarnish the image of the government.
</P>
<P>
They would eventually be wiped out with the improvement of the
infrastructure in those areas and of the equipment of the army.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to the northern part of Uganda, the president
extended his amnesty to all rebels fighting the National
Resistance Movement government.
</P>
<P>
The banditry is widely regarded as a legacy of the colonial
rule of this east African country. The Lord's Resistance Army
spearheaded by Joseph Kony has been fighting the government for 13
years.
</P>
<P>
The issue of security is becoming one of the priorities for the
 government as the pending referendum is coming next year,
Museveni said.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Women Soccer Team Builds on Imported Talent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) - Believe or not, the official
language of the Mexican women's national soccer team was English.
Because ten of its 20 players were born and raised in the USA.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's team was barely six months old when it played three-
game series with a San Diego team of American women at the club or
collegiate level. Mexico took a shellacking -- 9-0, 8-2 and 11-0.
</P>
<P>
Stung by the results, Mexico's assistant coach, Henry Sosa, who
was born and raised in the USA, went on a recruiting spree. In the
past year he has picked up four players from the California squad
and five other American college stars.
</P>
<P>
While the Mexican public and media were pleased with the team'
s subsequent success in qualifying games, they questioned the need
to dump Mexican-born players in order to stack the national team
with American college players.
</P>
<P>
"People became very jealous and started making negative
comments: Why do we have a foreign assistant coach?" says Sosa,
who grew up in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican players also resented the imported talent. "The
Mexican players who were already here were weak, so they bonded
together and were very cliquish against the better Mexican-
American players, "Sosa says.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican-Americans have added credibility, strength, size
and speed to the team. They've also raised the intensity level.
Nevertheless, the U.S. players do not represent the future of the
Mexican national team," Sosa says.

province on Sunday. In the fighting, NPA Commander Jasig, Team
Leader Domingo Lansian and a soldier were killed.
</P>
<P>
It was the worst debacle the rebels suffered in one single
battle since the National Democratic Front (NDF), a political arm
of NPA, pulled out from the peace talks last week following the
ratification of the Philippines-U.S. Visiting Forces Agreement by
the Senate on May 27.
</P>
<P>
Nazareno said the NPA has increased its activities in far-flung
areas of the country and threatened to step up attacks against the
government forces.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the
Philippine National Police (PNP) have also activated their
cooperation plan to thwart the attacks by the NPA.

<HEADLINE> NATO-Yugoslavia Technical Talks Resume After Long Break </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUMANOVO Airport, Macedonia, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The military
technical talks between NATO and Yugoslav delegations resumed
around 14:30 p.m. (1330 GMT) Wednesday after a break of more than
four hours.
</P>
<P>
Robin Clifford, spokesman for NATO forces in Macedonia,
announced shortly before the talks that the talks were about to
resume in just a few minutes as the Yugoslav delegation had
returned from the break, during which they went to the nearby
border crossing to report to their authorities in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, another NATO spokesman, Frey Cate from the U.S. army,
said NATO was "cautiously optimistic" that the Yugoslav military
delegation will sign a military technical agreement.
</P>
<P>
The talks between the NATO delegation led by British Lt.
General Mike Jackson and the Yugoslav delegation led by Col.
General Svetozar Marjanovic resumed at 09:00 p.m. (2000 GMT) last
night at this sport airport used by NATO as an airbase.
</P>
<P>
The difficulties in the talks are "timing and sequence" of the
withdrawal of Serb forces from Kosovo, according to Cate.
</P>
<P>
NATO insists that Yugoslavia starts what NATO calls a
verifiable pullout before NATO stops the air campaign, which has
caused enormous loss of human lives and property damage over the
past two and half months in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia wants NATO to stop air strikes to enable withdrawal
take place in safety.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Says Declaration With China Boosts Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia-China ties have been
bolstered by the signing of a joint declaration on cooperation
between the two countries last week, Foreign Minister Datuk Seri
Syed Hamid Albar said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the framework of cooperation covered many areas
including economy, trade, science and technology, information,
defense and regional security.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid and Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan signed the
declaration during the former's five-day visit to China beginning
on May 30.
</P>
<P>
"It is a very important framework of cooperation for us in our
ties with China as we move into the 21st century," Syed Hamid told
a news conference at his office.
</P>
<P>
He said both countries reiterated their stand of solving any
problem or dispute that arises in their bilateral relationship
through negotiations and not by force.
</P>
<P>
China and Malaysia also agreed that any problem in the region
must be resolved by the affected countries themselves and not
through the involvement of third parties, said Syed Hamid.
</P>
<P>
He said more Malaysian high-ranking leaders and officials would
visit China in line with Malaysia's view that China has a key role
in determining the future of the region.
</P>
<P>
Syed Hamid proceeded from China to South Korea and then to
Japan.
</P>
<P>
"The visits were made in the spirit of ASEAN Plus Three (The
Association of Southeast Asian Nations plus China, South Korea and
Japan) and in line with our hope to set up the 'East Asia Economic
Caucus' which we feel is closer to becoming a reality," he said.

<HEADLINE> Bird Says Home Has No Edge for Pacers, Knicks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Indiana Pacers appear to be
in good shape in their Eastern Conference final series with New
York Knicks tonight at their own court, but coach Larry Bird is
reminding the Pacers that being home hasn't always been an
advantage for them this season.
</P>
<P>
Indiana was 18-7 at Market Square Arena during the regular
season. In addition, the Pacers lost Game 1 of this series at home
and struggled in Game 2 before winning.
</P>
<P>
"You never rely on home-court," Bird said. "I'll tell these
guys we don't play that well here. But we have to win this game.
We have to find a way to win it."
</P>
<P>
With each team already having won on the other's home floor in
this series, the Knicks are optimistic they can rebound from a
lackluster performance in their Game 4 loss in New York.
</P>
<P>
The Pacers have recaptured home-court advantage and are coming
off their most complete effort of the series, a 90-78 victory
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe, in this series, there is a home-court
advantage," Knicks guard Allan Houston said.
</P>
<P>
The Knicks had their poorest offensive performance of the
series in Game 4. They say it's their defense and rebounding that
must improve if they are going to win Game 5.
</P>
<P>
"We're a defensive, rebounding team first and foremost," Knicks
coach Jeff Van Gundy says, "and we didn't do either Monday night."
</P>
<P>
"It's more than just playing intense," said Houston. "We have
to play together and feed off our defense. I think that's how we'
re going to get it back."

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Observes Mourning Day for Slain Judges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Flags flew at half-mast across
Lebanon Wednesday as a stunned nation observed a day of mourning
for four judges killed in a courtroom shooting in the country's
southern port city of Sidon.
</P>
<P>
Schools were closed and somber music rang out from Lebanon's
radio and television stations since morning in tribute for the
four slain judges in what was described as the first crime of its
kind in the world's living memory.
</P>
<P>
In addition, judicial functions were suspended for three days
in protest against the crime that was committed by two unknown
gunmen who made good their escape.
</P>
<P>
The massacre occurred at midday Tuesday when two gunmen opened
fire through the windows of Sidon's courtroom toward a four-man
tribunal that was trying a money counterfeit case of two
Palestinians charged also with drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
A judge and a prosecutor were killed instantly while the
presiding judge and another judge died later in hospital. Two
lawyers and two policemen were wounded in the shooting.
</P>
<P>
The motive for the attack has not been known. State Prosecutor
Adnan Addoum said preliminary investigations ruled out any link
between the attackers and the defendants who were tried in the
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
The horrific crime drew sharp condemnations across the
country. And President Emile Lahoud and Prime Minister Salim Hoss
ordered authorities concerned to bring the culprits to justice
as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia PDI-P Takes Early Lead in 14 Provinces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Democratic Party of
Struggle (PDI-P) took an early lead in 14 provinces and the ruling
Golkar Party led in 12 other provinces in the preliminary results
of the parliamentary election held on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to data issued by the official Antara News Agency, as
of 17:00 local time (10:00 GMT) Wednesday, the Megawati
Soekarnoputri-led PDI-P led with 8,388,745 votes, while Golkar
Party received 4,800,152 votes.
</P>
<P>
PDI-P grabbed a majority in Jakarta, West Java, Central Java,
East Java, Yogyakarta, North Sumatera, South Sumatera, Bengkulu,
Lampung, Bali, East Kalimantan, Central Kalimantan, Maluku and
East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Golkar Party took a lead in West Sumatera, Riau, Jambi, South
Kalimantan, West Kalimantan, North Sulawesi, South Sulawesi,
Southeast Sulawesi, North Sulawesi, Irian Jaya, East Nusa Tenggara
and West Nusa Tenggara.
</P>
<P>
In the troubled province of Aceh, the United Development Party
(PPP) booked the biggest slice of votes, leaving closest rivals
behind.
</P>
<P>
Home Affairs Minister Syarwan Hamid Wednesday reiterated that
the public should support whoever wins the general election,
because it will not be easy to lead a country without the support
of its people.
</P>
<P>
"I think parties realize that without people's support, nobody
can run the government well, on the contrary it could bring the
nation into trouble," Hamid said after meeting with Chairman of
the General Election Commission Rudini.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the slow vote counting process, Hamid said people
should wait for the final result.
</P>
<P>
Rudini said the important thing now is to give an understanding
to people that vote counting will take time and people should
eliminate any possibility of fraud during the vote counting.
</P>
<P>
"It (the counting process) will rely much on the carefulness of
officials to avoid any fraud or mistake in entering the data," he
added.
</P>
<P>
A telecommunication traffic glut and unskilled election workers
have been blamed for the slowcoming of ballot counting reports
across the country.
</P>
<P>
Over 112 million Indonesians cast their votes on Monday in the
country's first real attempt at democracy in decades.
</P>
<P>
Forty-eight political parties contested the polls, and are now
fighting for 462 seats in the House of Representatives (DPR).
Another 38 seats are reserved for the military.
</P>
<P>
The 500-strong DPR will then join hands with 200 government
appointees as the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR), the
highest decision-making body which will elect a new president in
November.

<HEADLINE> Weizman Meets Meretz Leader on Coalition Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
Wednesday met with Meretz leader Yossi Sarid on the issue of
forming a coalition government to be headed by Prime
Minister-elect Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
No details of the meeting were available. However, reliable
sources here said that the meeting was an apparent attempt by the
president to ask Meretz to drop its veto on Shas's joining the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
Sarid told reporters after the meeting that Weizman did not put
pressure on Meretz to change its position on Shas.
</P>
<P>
So long as Aryeh Deri, who was convicted of fraud, remains as
the leader of Shas, Meretz will not sit in the same government
that includes Shas, Sarid said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Weizman denied charges that he was involved in
politics by intervening in the formation of the coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
The president has the right to meet Knesset (parliament)
members to express his opinion about the coalition issue and the
presidency was elected by the Knesset too, Weizman told reporters
after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Weizman said Tuesday that it is quite probable that he would
try to intervene in the stalled coalition talks. Last week, he met
with Shas spiritual leader Rabbi Ovadia Yosef and asked him to let
Deri step down as the Shas leader so that Shas can join the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
After that, several politicians, particularly those from
Likud, accused Weizman of intervening in politics.
</P>
<P>
Meretz strongly opposes Shas to join Barak's coalition, saying
that it could not work with Shas leader Deri who was sentenced to
four years in prison on charges of fraud and bribe-taking.
</P>
<P>
Barak has so far held two rounds of talks with Sarid on this
issue, but Sarid still insisted on his position.
</P>
<P>
Barak intends to include Shas into his government in a bid to
form a broad-based coalition. During his meeting with One
Israel's parliament members on Sunday, a majority of his fellow
deputies expressed their support for Barak to do so.
</P>
<P>
Shas won 17 Knesset seats in the May 17 elections, thus making
it the third largest party in the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
The coalition talks are still going on and Barak said he will
announce the coalition setup within 10 days.

<HEADLINE> China Expects To Increase Hybrid Rice Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists say they expect
to use a new strain of rice more extensively within 3 years and to
raise per hectare yields by 20 to 30 percent to 12,000 kilograms,
according to Yuan Longping, the director of the China National
Hybrid Rice Engineering Research Center.
</P>
<P>
Agronomists are saying that the new strain is the third
breakthrough in China. The first two increased paddy yields by
about 20 percent. Scientists in other countries have not been so
successful in developing new strains, Yuan says, but Chinese
scientists have solved almost all technical problems after more
than a decade of experiments and now lead the world in rice-
breeding technology.
</P>
<P>
Experiments in Jiangsu and Hunan provinces last year proved
successful and per hectare yield exceeded 12,000 kilograms.
Another 26 experimental plots with 66.7 hectares each have been
set aside this year and if even two of them have per hectare
yields above 12,000 kilograms it will be declared a success, Yuan
says, and adds that he expects the new rice to be widely used
within three years.
</P>
<P>
This could increase output by 20 billion kilograms if it is
used on 13.3 million hectares annually. China now has 16 million
hectares in hybrid rice, or almost half its total rice growing
area.
</P>
<P>
Yuan is here attending an international symposium on
agricultural modernization in China's coastal areas.

<HEADLINE> Obasanjo Stresses Environment Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- President Olusegun Obasanjo has vowed
 to ensure that all funds released for ecological problems in
Nigeria are not diverted to other use during his administration.
</P>
<P>
Speaking through his representative, Vice-President Atiku
Abubakar, at the World Environment Day celebration in Abuja
Tuesday, Obasanjo said that funds released for ecological problem
will no longer be "treated as windfalls that could be diverted to
any conceivable use."
</P>
<P>
The Post Express newspaper Wednesday quoted the president as
saying: "My administration will move with deliberate speed to
demonstrate genuine commitment to environmental protection and
development at the highest level of government."
</P>
<P>
"We will move beyond mere signing and ratification to effective
 implementation of conventions and treaties so that nobody will
doubt our resolve to act responsibly with other members of the
international community to make the world a livable place for the
present and future generations," Obasanjo said.
</P>
<P>
The president also pledged to ensure appropriate funding and
capacity strengthening of the Federal Environmental Protection
Agency (FEPA) to enable it to implement its mandate effectively.
</P>
<P>
Other measures to be used in bringing about a healthy
environment, he said, include the coordination of activities of
all relevant agencies and the review of all existing legislations.
</P>
<P>
He added that environmental considerations will be factored
into major policies and development programs.
</P>
<P>
He further explained that despite the achievements of the
environmental protection agency over the years, environmental
issues are still pursued in a manner that is "half-hearted and
haphazard."
</P>
<P>
With the growth of the oil industry and population, Nigeria has
seen an increasingly worsening environment, especially in the
Niger delta region.

NEW DELHI, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Air Force (IAF)
aircraft bombing in the Kargil sector of Kashmir has entered its
15th day Wednesday in assisting the Indian army to flush out
"infiltrators supported by Pakistan."
</P>
<P>
The aerial strikes on Wednesday focused on positions occupied
by the "Pakistan infiltrators" in the high mountainous ranges in
Kargil and Indian and Pakistan troops exchanged fire of artillery
guns in the entire sector, Defense Ministry sources said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
India launched a big-scale military operation in early May in
the Kargil sector and the IAF joined the operation from May 26 to
evict out the alleged "infiltrators" from across the border.
</P>
<P>
The air strikes were successful and would continue till the
objective of evicting the intruders from Indian territory was
achieved, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan on Tuesday dismissed "as totally false" Indian
accusation that its army regulars had infiltrated into Kargil and
Drass across the Line of Control (LoC) and suggested that neutral

</P>
<P>
Among the retired are the Chairman of the Armed Forces and

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.'s Seagate Technology
started a new round in the price wars of hard disk manufacturers
with its Barracuda ATA here today.
</P>
<P>
The Barracuda ATA hard disk is 30 percent stronger than other
products on the market in performance but sells at a similar price.
It also has higher shock resistance.
</P>
<P>
The company plans to use it to squeeze mainstream hard disks
out of the market, according to Y.S. Chia, Seagate's Hong Kong/
China sales director, who says that the new hard disk will pose a
serious threat to products from Quantum and Maxtor, which are
major competitors.
</P>
<P>
Personal computers have a major upgrading every six months in
China and only Seagate, IBM, and Fujitsu can produce top-end hard
disks.
</P>
<P>
Chia says that if computer manufacturers use Barracuda for
their computers' hard drive, they will have no time to choose and
test products from other providers. He predicts that after it
enters the Chinese market, the memory capacity of the hard disk of
personal computers in China will be raised to 20-28 Gb by the
latter half of the year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Information Industry, sales of
personal computers in China will reach 6 million this year and be
worth 50 billion yuan.

<P>
NEW DELHI, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The outlook for investments in
India would continue to be bleak in the current fiscal year
1999-2000, despite signs of recovery shown by the economy during
the first two months of the year, the Center for Monitoring Indian
Economy (CMIE) sources said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Political instability following the loss of confidence of the

The local currency rupee's weakening in the wake of Kargil air
strikes was an "unfavorable development," it further said.
</P>
<P>
The industrial sector in the country has signaled a recovery
during the initial months of the fiscal as major industries, which
have been languishing for a long period, posted handsome gains,

<HEADLINE> Half of Philippines' Major Rivers Polluted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Half of the Philippines' 384 major
rivers and waterways are polluted, a lawmaker of the country's
House of Representatives said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nereus Acosta, member of the House Committee on Ecology, said
the pollution came from the waste loads of domestic and industrial
discharges from factories, residences and mine tailings.
</P>
<P>
The House committee strongly batted for the passage of the
proposed Clean Water Act to protect the country's gulfs, lakes,
rivers and creeks.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Manny Villar, who endorsed the immediate approval
of the bill, said there is a need to enact a law that will provide
for a water quality management system to protect and regenerate
clean water.
</P>
<P>
"Our bodies of water need as much attention as our air. If
Congress enacted a measure creating a Clean Air Act, why should we
not enact an equally important law, the Clean Water Act," the
speaker said.
</P>
<P>
Representative Vicente Sandoval, chair of the House committee,
said the capability of the water system of the country needs to be
revived specifically for agriculture and domestic use.
</P>
<P>
"An increasing number of gulfs, rivers and other bodies of
water in the country continue to suffer due to heavy siltation and
sedimentation caused by mine tailings and industrial waste,"
Sandoval noted.
</P>
<P>
"This definitely reduces the capability of our water for
agriculture and domestic use," he added.
</P>
<P>
The bill mandates the Department of Environment and Natural
Resources to establish national water quality standards and
control techniques for implementation by local government units.
</P>
<P>
The proposed bill penalizes violators of this act by
imprisonment not less than two years but not more than six years.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Clarifies Govt's Priorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
clarified priority issues for his government at the function
marking the 10th Heroes' Day here Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The most important thing is to get rid of poverty and there is
consensus within the government in this aspect, Museveni said at
the four-hour function at the Kololo Airstrip to pay tribute to
all those who had contributed significantly to the country.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the government should have different
priorities in different areas.
</P>
<P>
"Efforts have been made and money has been spent to recover
Uganda economically," he said.
</P>
<P>
For those living in the Karimoja region, he noted, the most
urgent thing they face is lack of water. So the government should
try to solve the problem of water for those nomad people.
</P>
<P>
As to the northern part of Uganda, he said that people living
there need to increase their household incomes.
</P>
<P>
The central government has spent 68 million U.S. dollars and
110 million dollars to increase the homestead incomes in the
Luweero district and the northern part of the country
respectively, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that Ugandans now enjoy unprecedented
freedom.
</P>
<P>
Before addressing the whole nation, Museveni laid wreaths at
the tombs of two national heroes buried at the airstrip.
</P>
<P>
This Heroes' Day is being celebrated at a time when the east
African country is in the middle of two major battles -- one
against the rampant poverty and the other against corrupt and
fraudulent public officials.
</P>
<P>
The theme for this year's Heroes' Day is "Economic Empowerment
and Clean Leadership."
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people including all government ministers and
other dignitaries attended the celebration.
</P>
<P>
At the function characterized by colorful performances by
different tribes, religious leaders also called upon people to
alleviate poverty and empower themselves both economically and
educationally.

<HEADLINE> NATO "Cautiously Optimistic" About Outcome of Military Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUMANOVO Airport, Macedonia, June 9 (Xinhua) -- NATO on
Wednesday cautiously expressed "optimism" that the Yugoslav
military delegation will sign a military technical agreement, a
NATO spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Technical talks between the NATO delegation led by British Lt.
General Mike Jackson and the Yugoslav delegation led by Col.
General Svetozar Marjanovic resumed at 09:00 p.m. (2000 GMT) at
this airport used by NATO as an airbase.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, some members of the Yugoslav delegation left
the huge tent, where the talks are going on, and crossed the
border just a few kilometers away to report to the authorities in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting for them to come back and we are cautiously
optimistic about the signing of a technical agreement," said Trey
Cate, the spokesman from the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
The difficulties in the talks are the "timing and sequence" of
the withdrawal of Serb forces from Kosovo, he said.
</P>
<P>
NATO insists that Yugoslavia start what NATO calls a verifiable
pullout before NATO stops the air campaign, which has caused
enormous loss of human lives and property damage over the past 11
weeks in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
However, Yugoslavia wants NATO to stop air strikes first to
enable safe withdrawal.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Products Ban Offers Chance to Thai Exporters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Thai exporters are expected to
benefit from a ban on Belgian meat, poultry and dairy products
imposed by many countries and regions around the world due to a
scare of dioxin contamination, the Thai News Agency (TNA) said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Thai food exporters, especially those exporting poultry, will
have new opportunities to expand their markets to the European
Union (EU) countries, TNA said.
</P>
<P>
The EU recently recognized the manufacturing standards of 22
meat-processing plants in Thailand after a group of experts came
here to inspect them.
</P>
<P>
"Belgium is expected to spend six months solving the
contamination problem. So, Thai exporters will have enough time to
explore and boost their exports to the EU market," TNA quoted a
Commerce Ministry official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Thailand would closely monitor other imported Belgian foods to
see if they are contaminated with the cancer-causing dioxin.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has joined many other countries in banning imports of
beef, pork, chicken, egg and milk-based products, including
chocolates and biscuits, from Belgium following reports that
dioxin was found in samples of the products.
</P>
<P>
Belgian chocolates, biscuits and other banned products have
been removed from the shelves of local supermarkets since Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's import of meat and dairy products from Belgium was
at 27.1 million baht (732,700 U.S. dollars) from January to early
June this year, but the products were reportedly all sold before
the ban was imposed by the Ministry of Public Health.

<HEADLINE> 47,000 "Terrorists" Detained in Bangladesh-Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's law-enforcing agencies
have detained 47,000 "terrorists" and recovered about 1,500 pieces
of arms since a nationwide combing operation against terrorism
started in late April, Home Minister Mohammad Nasim told
parliament on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Renewing his call to terrorists to surrender their arms, Nasim
said: "We shall rehabilitate them and give (them) opportunity to
start new life in society."
</P>
<P>
"We will not compromise with terrorists and terrorists would
have to surrender their arms," he said while presenting an account
of the on-going operation against "armed terrorists" across the
country, particularly in the southwestern region.
</P>
<P>
The southwestern region has reportedly become a haven for
terrorists, with fierce rivalry resulting in many deaths and
rising crimes.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, 210 "terrorists", including leaders of five outlawed
parties, surrendered to the government in Jessore district, 146
kilometers southwest of the capital city, in response to a
government call to return to normal life.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the operation, peace has been restored in the
southwestern region and people have regained their courage and
confidence, said the home minister.
</P>
<P>
Curbing terrorism is really a difficult task, Nasim said, but
adding that "we shall be able to curb terrorism from society and
guarantee peace and tranquillity for people" if "we all can be
united on this point."
</P>
<P>
During the combing operation, the government has set up 156
police camps at sensitive places, and members of the paramilitary
Bangladesh Rifles and Ansars (village and border militia) are
actively participating in the operation which has gained the
support of the people, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The government launched the combing operation on April 22
following bomb explosions early this year in two separate places
that killed several political leaders and activists and injured
many others.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican government has been
urged to carry out large scale economic and social plans to
improve the people's living standard.
</P>
<P>
Participants at the three-day national conference of cadres of
the ruling Mozambican National Liberation Front (Frelimo), which
ended Tuesday morning called on the government to take measures to
reduce the negative impact on the economic structure and
privatization from the governmental end.
</P>
<P>
A document issued after the meeting said that government
institutions at all levels should advocate clear and transparency
system in their approval, management and supervision of the
infrastructural plans, Wednesday's Noticias newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The government should take cautious moves to offer social
insurance and scholarship to the public, the document said.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party demands that the government adhere to the
correct practice and overcome its mistakes, in mapping out the
national 2000-2004 five-year plan.
</P>
<P>
The government is suggested to pay enough attention to the
establishment of commercial service outlet system, to ensure the
supply of food, regulate the informal trade practice, and have
close supervision on the privatization drive to the interests of
the public.
</P>
<P>
The cadres meeting urged the government to give priority to the
 development of small-scale economy, the extension of the current
telephone systems and the construction of roads and railways in
the country in the new five-year plan.
</P>
<P>
Unified fuel price and improvement of rural and urban water and
power supply are also urged at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, attended by about 600 representatives from all
over the country, is regarded as a preparation to the up-coming
elections.

Any violation of China's Criminal Law can be penalized with
detention or life in prison or even death, the Ministry points out
and says that units that handle explosives should report the loss
or theft of explosives or any explosion that occurs to police
immediately and anyone found guilty of this will be dealt with in
accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry says that organizations or individuals engaging in
these illegal activities should turn themselves in immediately so
that they can receive a lesser sentence. It also provides rewards
for those who give police information about such crimes.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 9 (Xinhua) --The Australian dollar languished
Wednesday for the second day in a row.
</P>
<P>
The unit finished at 65.75 US cents, from 66.03 U.S. cents
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar's move lower was largely on the back of
another slump in the gold price, a key export for Australia. The
precious metal for current delivery in New York fell 3.30 U.S.
dollars to 262.80 U.S. dollars an ounce.
</P>
<P>
At the close of local trading the Australian dollar was buying
62.76 euro cents from 63.93 Tuesday and 78.49 Japanese yen from

<HEADLINE> Jackson Withdraw from European Cup 110m Hurdles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- World record-holder Colin Jackson
said on Wednesday that he is not to run the 110m hurdles for
Britian at the European Cup in Paris next week because he will be
attending a friend's wedding.
</P>
<P>
Britain have won the men's title the last two times and Jackson
's absence will hurt prospects of a third successive victory.
</P>
<P>
He has opted to attend the wedding of close friend Christian
Mayer, an Austrian World Cup skier, in Milan on the same day.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old will be replaced by Tony Jarrett, the
Commonwealth champion and a winner in Bratislava on Tuesday, but
British selectors have opted to keep the hurdles spot open until
the full team is named on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Jackson, the 1993 world champion, has represented Britain in
seven previous European Cups, winning four times and placing
second on three occasions.
</P>
<P>
Last year, he also filled in for his former training partner,
Linford Christie, and placed third in the 100 meters.
</P>
<P>
Jackson began his 1999 season in great form on Sunday, winning
in Stuttgart in 13.14sec, second fastest in the world this year.
</P>
<P>
Already included in the British team are Olympic high jump
bronze medallist Steve Smith and European champions Jonathan
Edwards (triple jump) and Steve Backley (javelin).
</P>
<P>
European 400 meters champion Iwan Thomas is replaced by the
silver medallist behind him in Budapest last August, Mark
Richardson.
</P>
<P>
The 100 meters selection has gone to world junior record-holder
Dwain Chambers ahead of Budapest gold medallist Darren Campbell.

<HEADLINE> Promising Structural Plastics Market in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The growth in structural plastics
demand in China in recent years has caused shortfalls in supplies
on the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
The demand of structural plastics, or plastics used for
construction purposes, which include nylon, polyformaldehyde and
polycarbonate products, has risen 25 percent annually on average.
</P>
<P>
The structural plastics sector has grown 10 to 15 percent
annually, making it a new growth point in the chemical industry.
But it is still at an early stage, with an annual production
capacity of 150,000 tons, which is way below demand.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, China has imported 1.5 million tons of structural
plastics, making it the biggest structural plastics importer in
the world. In recent years, many famous multinationals have set up
solely-funded or joint-venture structural plastic companies in
China. And analysts say that Chinese companies should step up
research and development centers to get a bigger share of the
domestic market.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Declares State of Emergency in Warri </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government Tuesday
declared a state of emergency when death toll in the conflict had
hit 300 in Warri, one of Nigeria's important oil city, after
militant youths torched 30 houses in Warri before government
soldiers generally took control of the situation there.
</P>
<P>
The tomb of Palm Grove Motel, a known Nigerian nationalist, was
also set to blaze along with about 30 houses in Warri by armed
youths before the coming soldiers could clear them away, Vanguard
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The youths also sacked a avenue police station, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The state government has further expanded the curfew imposed
Monday night, and movement of people and vehicles has been
restricted to only four hours daily from 6:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m
local time.
</P>
<P>
For much of Tuesday, the streets were deserted, save military
trucks moving military men to trouble spots.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers, who were patrolling and frisking suspects on the
streets, had been empowered to shoot at sight of rioters.
</P>
<P>
Sporadic gunshots were heard, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
President Olusegun Obasanjo had pledged a visit, through his
aid, to the crisis-torn city this week to assess damages and seek
"lasting peace" in the region.
</P>
<P>
After the president's visit, major government decisions to
bring lasting peace to the area will be announced, said one of the
president's special assistant Monday.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of violence in Warri and surrounding areas has
 compelled about 300,000 people to leave their homes.
</P>
<P>
The crisis began weeks ago when militant Ijaw youths torched
the entire Itsekiri village of Aruton in Warri region, killing
about 100 people.
</P>
<P>
The Itsekiris then fought back killing many Ijaws and Urhobos,
who were suspected to have harbored Ijaws after the first attack.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaitis Begin Voting for New Municipal Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti voters began voting
Wednesday morning to choose a new Municipal Council, a civil body
with various administrative powers, in the country's second most
important elections after the parliamentary polls.
</P>
<P>
Polling stations opened to the public from 08:00 local time
(05:00 GMT) to 20:00 (17:00 GMT). Results are expected at about
midnight in the day.
</P>
<P>
Over 108,000 eligible male voters are electing 10 members for
the 16-member partially elected council. The remaining six
members are appointed by the emir at the recommendation of the
government.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-eight candidates are vying for the 10 seats in the
country's 10 constituencies.
</P>
<P>
According to officials at polling stations, the initial
turnout is low, with senior citizens making the majority. However,
they said turnout is expected to pick up in the afternoon as most
civil servants are likely to flock to the stations to cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
The council, which consists of five sub-committees, enjoys
wide authorities in monitoring the works of Kuwait Municipality
that range from urban planning and development, overseeing
implementation of important national projects, to issuing
commercial licenses, monitoring food imports and cleaning city
garbage.
</P>
<P>
The four-year term council will nominate its chairman and
his deputy, with the chairman nominee still being subject to
approval by the emir, the paramount leader of the country.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's polls were the eighth since Kuwait gained
independence from Britain. The first municipal election was held
in June, 1964.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientists Find Plant Growth Stimulus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli scientists discovered a
gene which can quicken the growth of trees and vegetables by 30
percent to 50 percent, the Jerusalem Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of the gene can help the rapid restoration of
depleted rain forests and groves of trees grown for paper and wood
production around the world, said Dr. Oded Shoseyov of Hebrew
University, who heads the research team.
</P>
<P>
After being inserted into plants, the gene, known as CBD
(Cellulose Binding Domain), produces a protein that acts as a
kind of "biological glue" which binds to cellulose, the most
abundant material in the biosphere.
</P>
<P>
Genetic engineering makes it possible to isolate a gene or a
portion thereof from one organism and to introduce it into other
organisms. In this case, the CBD gene was taken from a bacterial
source.
</P>
<P>
Shoseyov's team has already used this genetic engineering to
accelerate the growth of cotton, potatoes, tomatoes, and corn, in
addition to poplars and other deciduous trees.
</P>
<P>
Due to strong opposition in Europe to genetically manipulated
food, there will be no large-scale application of this technology
on the growth of vegetable plants and fruit trees in the short
run, Shoseyov said.
</P>
<P>
But it can be widely used to speed up the growth of those trees
grown for wood and paper production and ecological purposes, he
said.

<HEADLINE> EU Says Indonesian General Election Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- After observing the balloting
process in many parts of Indonesia, the European Union (EU)
concluded on Wednesday that the conduct of Indonesia's June 7
general election was sufficiently free and transparent.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion was announced by Heinrich Seemann, in his
capacity as representative of the EU ambassador to Indonesia, and
Chief Observer/Executive Coordinator of the EU Observer Unit John
Gwyn Morgan, at a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
Seemann, who is also German ambassador to Indonesia, said he
would fully support and accept the final election result,
regardless of the parties which would win the first multiparty
polls in the post-New Order era (when former president Soeharto
was in power).
</P>
<P>
Morgan said the election will guarantee a voting result which
will reflect the democratic will of the Indonesian people.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that EU observers reported several incidents of
confrontations between various groups belonging to different
parties, but they did not develop into major events that could
seriously disrupt the campaign process.
</P>
<P>
"The small incidents during the campaign days of political
parties have no impact on the stages of the general election
process in this country," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the vote counting process, Morgan said it has been conducted
mostly satisfactorily. In this stage, the EU observation team
visited 66 polling stations to observe the closing and counting of
the ballots.
</P>
<P>
"With regard to the transparency and publicity of the counting,
these aspects have been very highly respected. The Electoral
Monitoring Organizations and the political party agents were
allowed to record the final voting results in most cases, and the
results were publicly displayed," he said.
</P>
<P>
The EU reportedly contributed 7.7 million U.S. dollars for the
electoral process, channeled through the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP).
</P>
<P>
In observing the June 7 polls, at least 30 long-term observers,
who had arrived in Jakarta on May 12 and had a four-day intensive
training course, were deployed in 13 provinces.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a group of some 90 short-term observers arrived on
May 29 to be deployed for some 15 days on and around polling day,
except in the provinces of Aceh, Irian Jaya, East Timor and West
Kalimantan for security reasons.

<P>
PARIS, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Western countries and Russia struck an agreement on Tuesday
on a U.N. resolution on Kosovo, which would open the way to peace
after 11 weeks of NATO bombings in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The agreement notably approves the deployment in Kosovo of an
international force under the auspices of the United Nations but
having NATO as its pillar.
</P>
<P>
-- In an article contributed to Liberation, Indian-British
writer Salman Rushdie warned against the danger of a nuclear
destruction of Kashmir, which is often called ``Paradise on earth,
'' because of escalation of confrontation between India and
Pakistan, the world's two new nuclear powers.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The United Nations Security Council began on Tuesday closed-
door discussion on the compromise agreement reached by Russia and
Western countries for ending the Kosovo conflict. While the
Security Council is expected to adopt a resolution on Kosovo soon,
Western diplomats estimated that a stop of bombing by NATO could
be realized as early as Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
-- A report by the French government said that 500 children
belonging to a religious cult called "the autarkic communities" in
France are living under constant bullying of the adults, and
suffering from under-feeding and lack of sleep. The members of the
cult are totally cut off from the outside world and are
indoctrinated by cult leaders.

<HEADLINE> More Toxic Contaminated Sites Identified at Former U.S. Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- At least 46 more sites at the former
U.S. air base in Clark in northern Philippines have been
identified to be contaminated by toxic wastes, the People's Task
Force for bases Clean-up (PTFBC) said.
</P>
<P>
PTFBC national coordinator Myrla Baldonado made public a study
on the issue during a forum in Clark.
</P>
<P>
The newly discovered toxic contaminated areas were in addition
to the 14 sites earlier identified by the task force inside the
4,400-hectare Clark economic zone.
</P>
<P>
The study showed that 14 sites inside the economic zone are
contaminated with hyrdocarbons, benzyne and other cancer-causing
elements.
</P>
<P>
A human rights group is still conducting an investigation into
the cases of 29 victims who complained that they contracted
various diseases as a result of their probable exposure to
hazardous elements while living at the Clark zone, Baldonado said.
</P>
<P>
The United States returned Clark Air Base and other military
bases to the Philippines in the early 1990s after the Philippine
Senate voted against the extension of the Philippines-U.S.
Military Bases Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Different studies showed that American troops in Clark Air Base
and other bases did in fact leave behind significant amounts of
toxic waste and contaminated sites.

<HEADLINE> Newspapers Not Hurt by Internet Australia: Media Baron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Widespread predictions of doom
for newspapers in the wake of booming Internet and pay television
use in Australia were groundless, said Malcolm Noad, general
manager of the global media empire News Limited group, on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to a meeting of the Australian Marketing Institute
in the south Australian port city of Adelaide, Noad said that
despite a dramatic rise in Internet use and availability of pay-TV
in Australia during the past decade, newspaper circulation and
readership had increased.
</P>
<P>
"Weekday circulation has been steady to rising over the last
few years; Monday to Friday we sell an average of 2.4 million
papers per day, 3.2 million on Saturday, 3.5 million on Sunday,"
Noad said.
</P>
<P>
He said the average Australian over 14 years old spent four
hours and 26 minutes per week reading a newspaper, up 11 minutes
from three years ago.
</P>
<P>
About 23 percent of Australian adult population accessed the
Internet in the 12 months to February, 1998, the Australian Bureau
of Statistics said earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
Noad said this was despite Internet use increasing dramatically
from a few "computer boffins" a decade ago to access now being
available in about one million Australian homes, with the average
person spending 25 minutes per week on the net.
</P>
<P>
"Where are people finding the time to sit back on the
Internet?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
"They are spending one hour less on watching TV and
half-an-hour less on listening to the radio," he said.
</P>
<P>
Noad said the key to newspapers succeeding in an increasingly
competitive media market was to create a highly recognizable and
trustworthy brand name.
</P>
<P>
"(News Corporation chairman) Rupert Murdoch summed up our
strategy for dealing with the challenge of choice - 'Faced with
the chaos of choice on the one hand and the need to plug quickly
into what's happening on the other, people will turn quickly to
familiar names'," he said.
</P>
<P>
Noad said News Limited used promotions, competitions and
loyalty-building products such as lifestyle magazines to boost
readership, but sports coverage was the key product.

<HEADLINE> China's Imperial Pines Suffering From Insects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Some 15,000 old pines and a
great number of younger pines at the Western Imperial Tombs of the
Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), about 120 km from Beijing, have been
suffering from a severe attack of caterpillars since May 27.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, pine trees have lost their needles
and have damage to their trunks. Pines near Emperor Jiaqing's
mausoleum have been the worst hit, and some caterpillars have even
crawled onto the walls of the ancient buildings, turning them from
red into black.
</P>
<P>
The Western Tombs forest is northern China's largest area of
old pines, with many of them dating back 100 years. About 20,000
ancient pines at the area are placed under special protection.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Academy of Agricultural Sciences botanists blame the
caterpillar infestation on the warmer winter and killing of
magpies that feed on caterpillars by some farmers.
</P>
<P>
Hebei Province, where the tombs are located, has organized
people to fight the insects.
</P>
<P>
The tombs cover a 20-hectare area and have a large number of
burial spots. Four Qing Dynasty emperors and hundreds of imperial
concubines are buried there. The ashes of Pu Yi, the last emperor
of the Qing Dynasty were moved to the area in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Northern Chinese Basin Gives Clue to Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Creation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Linxia Basin in China's Gansu
Province is an ideal place to study the evolution of the Qinghai-
Tibet Plateau, a Chinese paleontologist said here today.
</P>
<P>
The basin is on the northeastern part of the plateau at 1,990
to 2,500 meters above sea level. Fossils of 180,000 animals were
found at 40 sites there from 1970 to 1984 and research has
revealed fossils dating back more than 1 million to 10 million
years, providing new information about the plateau's evolution,
according to Qiu Zhanxiang, a vertebrate paleontologist and
paleoanthropologist.
</P>
<P>
If the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau did not exist, the western part of
China would not be arid and the Yangtze River, which originates in
Qinghai, would not run eastward, says Xie Guangpu, another
scientist.
</P>
<P>
The evolution of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau affected the climate
in East Asia and Southeast Asia and even that of northern Africa,
Xie says. Some foreign scientists also say that it has something
to do with the three global chills that have occurred since the
Cenozoic Period.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Banks Uncertain about Preparation for Y2K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Although having taken intensive
steps to convert and upgrade their computer systems, Israel's
major banks are not sure if they are ready to deal with the
millennium bug, according to a report available here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The five largest banks in Israel have so far invested some 260
million shekels (about 63.6 million U.S. dollars) in the
conversion of their computer systems in preparation for problems
related to the millennium bug, the supervisor of banks said in
the report.
</P>
<P>
The banks have also approached major clients, who represent
some 70 to 80 percent of total credit, asking them to asses their
readiness for the Y2K problem, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But only a small number of clients have returned the
questionnaires, making it difficult to estimate the extent of
their preparedness and its impact on the banks, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
The millennium bug is a computer software fault that could
cause computers and the devices they operate to stop working or
spew out flawed data starting on January 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Israel is among the best-prepared countries for this problem,
according to expert assessment.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Israel has instructed banks to close all branches
on December 31 this year and January 1 next year to complete all
the necessary transition.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said although there is no guarantee that all
the problems can be solved, the Y2K bug will have no essential
impact on the operation of the banking industry.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Denmark will provide Tanzania
with a grant of 55 billion Tanzanian shillings (about 77 million
U.S. dollars) to support the health sector in the next five years,
local media reports said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The grant, the largest single health sector program of the

</P>
<P>
The Danish health program started in 1996, aimed at improving
the health and well-being of all Tanzanians with a focus on those
most at risk.
</P>
<P>
The immediate objective for the support is to improve the
access for especially the poorest to an efficient, effective and
sustainable district health service of good quality.
</P>
<P>
Mollel promised that Tanzania will monitor and regulate an
effective co- ordination from central to district level to make
the HSPS Phase II successful.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 4 Iranian Opposition Members Killed in Car Bomb in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Four Members of the Iranian armed
opposition in Iraq -- Mujahedeen -- were killed and 23 others
injured in a car bomb attack in northeast of Baghdad on Wednesday
morning, the group's spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Farid Soleimani, spokesman for Mujahedeen, told Xinhua that
when a civilian bus carrying Mujahedeen members was passing by the
Hamad Shibab hospital in northeast of Baghdad, a nearby pick-up
truck full of explosives hit the bus and exploded.
</P>
<P>
He said the car bomb attack killed four instantly and injured
23 others, some of whom are in critical conditions, adding that
all the wounded have been rushed to the Hamad Shibab hospital
nearby.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman held the Iranian government responsible for the
attack. "Obviously, it is the regime in Iran that is responsible
for this terrorist attack," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mujahedeen called on the international bodies as well as the
United Nations and its secretary-general to condemn this terrorist
act, said the spokesman, saying that the group would reserve its
right to respond to this attack.
</P>
<P>
The Mujahedeen Khalq Organization founded in 1965 with about
20,000 to 50,000 members, is an outlawed Iranian opposition group
based in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> LR Opens First Office in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Lloyd's Register of Shipping (LR),
a leading British international classification society, opened its
first office in Limassol, Cyprus' southern coastal town, the local
Financial Mirror newspaper reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The LR is committed to the East Mediterranean maritime
industry, said LR Chairman Patrick O'Ferrall at a luncheon.
</P>
<P>
He said the company is engaged in enhancing the safety of life
and property both at sea and on land, in reinvesting surplus
income into training, research, development and technical
education.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus currently ranks the sixth in the list of maritime
nations, with a fleet of more than 23 million gross tonnage, of
which over 20 percent is classified by LR.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus recently told several inspectors from an unnamed
classification society to stay away from its ships because it
alleged that they were not doing their job properly.
</P>
<P>
This led to the classification of substandard ships under the
Cyprus flag and the subsequent detention of more Cypriot-flagged
ships by port state controls. More detentions in turn led to the
tarnishing of the island's open flag reputation.
</P>
<P>
LR will also provide other services in Cyprus, such as
industrial services, quality and environmental management systems
certification, certification of offshore installations and
training services.
</P>
<P>
LR has over 280 offices in more than 100 countries worldwide.

Customs duties in the first five months this year, International

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Economy Slows Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar's economic growth
has slowed down due to decrease in export earnings, tourist
arrivals and foreign aids.
</P>
<P>
The Minister of State in Zanzibar President's Office, Ali Juma
Shamuhuna, said the isles' economic growth rate this year arrived
at three percent, compared with four last year.
</P>
<P>
During the 1998/99 fiscal year, which is to end this month,
exports of cloves plunged to 204 tons from 2,500 tons last year.
Production of sea weed and other crops was also low, The African
newspaper Wednesday quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the number of tourists to Zanzibar fell to
86,455 from 86,945 last year, Shamuhuna told the opening session
of the House of Representatives in Zanzibar Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Although the drop of the number was tiny, most of the tourists,
 primarily from west Europe, Asia and South Africa, failed to make
long journeys due to economic problems in their own countries, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said Zanzibar plans to promote tourism so that it becomes
the largest foreign exchange earner replacing exports of cloves.
</P>
<P>
The minister, however, said situation in the new fiscal year
starting July 1 will be much better, forecasting an economic
growth of between four and five percent due to greater investment.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last month, he said, 123 projects worth 124.7
million U.S. dollars had been approved, which will provide jobs to
more than 4,700 people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zanzibar is expected to receive more foreign aids
after the ruling party Chama Cha Mapinduzi and opposition Civic
United Front agreed to resolve their political conflicts.

<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey showed that some 61
percent of Chinese girls at the age of puberty feel their mothers
treat them more like a parent than a friend.
</P>
<P>
However, 42 percent of mothers cite their daughters as their
best friends, according to a May survey jointly conducted by the
Chinese Women's Daily, World Women's Review and the magazine "
Young Boys and Girls".
</P>
<P>
More than two-thirds of responding mothers said relationships
with their daughters are much better than in the previous
generation.
</P>
<P>
Some 40 percent of mothers and their daughters "seldom" discuss
sex and feelings, with 83 percent saying their daughters seek
advice when faced with problems.
</P>
<P>
About 67 percent of mothers admitted they have wrongfully
violated the privacy of their daughters, with 25 percent citing
frequent interference.
</P>
<P>
The survey concludes that friendships with daughters are most
often a wish rather than an actual fact. Nonetheless, friendships
between Chinese mothers and daughters have obviously improved over
previous decades.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Not to Save Falling Shilling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Central Bank of Kenya has announced
 that it would not intervene to stabilize the value of Kenyan
shilling from further depreciation, but will let the market
determine the exchange rate against foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
In its weekly economic update, the bank's chief economist
Maurice Kanga,

acknowledged that the value of the shilling has been steadily
falling, touching a low of 73.48 shillings to one U.S. dollar
Tuesday from 60 shillings in early this year.
</P>
<P>
"We wish to re-confirm that the policy of letting the market
determine the level of exchange rate through the relationship of
demand and supply, will remain unchanged," Kanga said.
</P>
<P>
The remarks ended speculations that the central bank would step
in to save the battered shilling which fell to a historic low
last week, seriously eating into the profits of importers.
</P>
<P>
Kanga attributed the shilling's weakening to the shortage in
the supply of foreign exchange compared with the private sector's
demand for dollars and the government's dues to its debt service.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey shows that parents
in Beijing, the Chinese capital, and Shanghai, the nation's
largest economic and financial center, hold differing views
concerning how to raise children.
</P>
<P>
Beijing children have time for outdoor activities than their
counterparts in Shanghai, with parents in the latter city paying
more attention to improving the intelligence levels of their
children.
</P>
<P>
The survey, which covered more than 5,000 parents with children
between the ages of three and seven, was conducted in Beijing,
Shanghai, Chongqing and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
Some 74 percent of respondents in Beijing frequently provide
outdoor activities for their children, compared to only 54 percent
in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Children in Beijing also spend more time with their parents.
Some 75 percent of Beijing respondents said they frequently play
games with their children, with 82 percent saying they often read
and tell stories to their offspring.
</P>
<P>
The figures differed greatly for Shanghai, with only 15 percent
and 20 percent of Shanghai citing similar participation for
related activities.
</P>
<P>
However, some 46 percent of parents in Shanghai purchase
insurance for their children, with the figure for Beijing standing
at only 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai parents also pay greater attention to the intelligence
levels and learning abilities of their children.
</P>
<P>
Chinese parents adopt a more realistic attitude towards their
children compared with parents 10 years ago. Nonetheless, they are
also concerned about the future success of their offspring.
</P>
<P>
More than 83 percent of the respondents cited the health of
their children as the most important priority, compared to 10
years ago when 46.5 percent of parents cited health and some 44.5
percent placed priority on intelligence.

ABU DHABI -- It's not an easy task to help 1.6 million Kosovo
refugees return and rebuild their homes in the war-ravaged
Yugoslav province, an official of the United Nations in charge of
refugee affairs said.
</P>
<P>
The rehabilitation work will require resources estimated at 5
billion U.S. dollars per year, which over a period of five years
will amount to 25 to 30 billion dollars, Nasr Ishak, senior
liaison officer of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR),
was quoted Wednesday by the Dubai-based Khaleej Times as saying. (

<HEADLINE> Worms Destroying Farm Land in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Army worm outbreaks in Ethiopia
had reportedly infested large areas of cropland and pasture last
May, the weekly English newspaper "the Reporter" said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted the United Nations Development Program
Emergencies Unit for Ethiopia as saying that some 162,498 hectares
of cropland and 102, 102 hectares of pasture were infested in
various regions of Ethiopia up to May 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
But, the unit said, "no serious crop damage had been reported."
</P>
<P>
The African army worm breeds in the cool and costal highland of
Kenya and Tanzania, moving northward by wind to interior highlands
where the outbreak can occur, the unit said, adding that the
larval stage of the nocturnal moth can consume rangeland grass or
wheat, barley, tef, maize, sorghum or finger-millet "fast than 400
heads of cattle per hectare and vast areas can be decimated
overnight".
</P>
<P>
The first army worm outbreaks were reported in the Southern
Region on April 15, followed by the Oromia and the Somali national
regional states, the UN agency said.
</P>
<P>
According to the UN agency, besides Ethiopia, army worm
outbreaks were also reported this year in Rwanda, Burundi, Kenya,
Uganda and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The emergencies unit warned that if weather conditions remain
favorable, further infestations could occur in northern Ethiopia
and Eritrea, saying that reinfestation of Ethiopia from Somalia
could not be ruled out since controlling the outbreak in Somalia
might be difficult.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Investment Grows In East China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 9 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province
approved an additional 40 Taiwan-funded enterprises during the
first quarter of the year, with total investments rising four-fold
on an annual basis to over 80 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The 2,720 Taiwan-funded enterprises in place by the end of
March involved total investments of 5.89 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang currently ranks fourth in the country with 4.3 billion
US dollars in contracted investment from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Some 90 Taiwan-funded enterprises involve investments of over
10 million US dollars each, with investments in 14 related
ventures standing at 30 million US dollars each. An additional six
ventures involve investments of over 100 million US dollars each.
</P>
<P>
Local Taiwan-funded businesses focus on production-oriented
sectors, including the communications, energy, raw materials,
agriculture, finance, commerce and hi-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
Most Taiwan-funded enterprises are performing smoothly and
enjoy "fruitful" economic returns due to local efforts to
safeguard the interests of Taiwan investors.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that more Taiwan-invested projects involving
over 100 million US dollars will be signed during the 1999
Zhejiang Investment and Trade Fair which opened Tuesday in the
coastal city of Ningbo.

The official, who was on a visit to the United Arab Emirates

amount would be 100 percent adequate because of the magnitude of
the refugee crisis.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that the UNHCR was currently working on signing
two memorandums of understanding - the first with the UAE
government to formalize the establishment of a permanent office
in the country, and the second with the Zayed Charitable &AMP;
Humanitarian Foundation for greater aid support.
</P>
<P>
He said the UNHCR was keen on establishing an office in
the UAE because people here seemed keenly inclined toward
charitable work.

<P>
HARARE, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Armed robbers have stolen property
and cash worth over 10 million Zimbabwean dollars (263,000 U.S.
dollars) in 20 incidents in Harare, Zimbabwean capital, alone
during the past three weeks, the daily Herald reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Police Commissioner Faustino Mazango said Tuesday
that although robberies are occurring throughout the country, the
recent increase in the number of armed robberies in central Harare
is a cause for grave concern.
</P>
<P>
He said the situation was worrying because criminals were now
becoming more daring. And the situation could be improved if
legislation could be changed to ensure that bail conditions were
made more stringent for robbers.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman superintendent Wayne Bvudzijena blamed the
robberies on poor security within organizations.
</P>
<P>
He said most of the incidents were also as a result of
information having being supplied by insiders to criminals.
</P>
<P>
It is said that police and the business community would soon
hold meetings aimed at improving the sector's security.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan MPs Want to Stop Sale of Closed Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan Parliament is to write
to the Bank of Uganda and the Ministry of Finance to request them
to stop the sale of branches and agencies of Cooperative Bank
closed on May 19, 999.
</P>
<P>
Isaac Musumba, chairman of the parliamentary committee on the
national economy, was quoted by Wednesday's New Vision daily as
saying Tuesday that the Bank of Uganda and Ministry of Finance
should stay further action on the closed bank until MPs consult
them.
</P>
<P>
The committee held a meeting with the officials of the Uganda
Cooperative Alliance, the umbrella organization and spokesbody of
the Cooperative Movement, shareholders, board of directors and
former staff of the bank, to justify a petition to parliament on
why the bank should not have been closed, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The bank was formerly under the Cooperative Movement but was
being changed from a society to a registered company, it added.
</P>
<P>
The bank was closed for its inability to meet the minimum
capital requirements, insolvency and mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
The central bank also invited bids from selected banks to take
on deposit liabilities of the bank and some of all its branches.
</P>
<P>
Musumba said a parliamentary sub-committee was set up to look
into the central bank's decision to close the 25-year-old
commercial bank.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
successfully released more than 4,000 elongated loach, an
endangered fish found in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Elongated loach, the largest species in the loach family, weigh
as much as 3,000 grams. The species is famous for the beauty of
its yellow body with brown stripes.
</P>
<P>
The loach has been on the brink of extinction in recent years
due to over fishing and environmental deterioration, according to
Liang Yinquan, a researchfellow with the Institute of Reservoir
Fisheries under the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).
</P>
<P>
He said that the loach is listed in the Red Paper on China's
Endangered Animals published by China's Endangered Species
Scientific Committee and the State Environmental Protection
Administration (SEPA).
</P>
<P>
Various scientific research institutes have extended great
effort to collect, domesticate and breed the loach in order to
save the endangered species.
</P>
<P>
Some 4,000 of 6,000 elongated loach fry jointly released by the
Ministry of Water Resources and the Institute of Reservoir
Fisheries have survived.
</P>
<P>
Liang said the success of artificial propagation has saved the
loach from extinction and provided scientific basis for further
study on the precious species.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Imports Paraffin to Ease Acute Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
started importing illuminating paraffin from South Africa and
Mozambique to ease the acute shortage that has hit the country,
the daily Herald reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people who depend on paraffin for lighting and
cooking have gone for nearly two weeks without the commodity owing
to a nationwide shortage.
</P>
<P>
In an interview Tuesday, Acting Secretary of the Transport and
Energy Ministry Nelson Kudenga said consumers should expect the
situation to be back to normal within the next three days.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the shortage to recent price hikes in fuel,
saying some consumers had hoarded the commodity in anticipation of
a price adjustment.
</P>
<P>
Petrol prices rose 27 percent last Thursday and diesel went up
32 percent to cope with the devaluation of the Zimbabwean dollar
and the increased cost of fuel at its source.
</P>
<P>
Kudenga said that "there has been increased use of paraffin by
the public, as we enter winter and the situation has reached a
stage where the stock levels of illuminating paraffin are modest."
</P>
<P>
He also dispelled rumors that jet fuel was in short supply,
saying there was enough supply of other fuels.

<HEADLINE> China to Improve Quality of New Residential Quarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- China is encouraging the
development of more high quality residential quarters nationwide
and has set high standards for building materials, design,
landscaping and auxiliary facilities.
</P>
<P>
A senior official with the Ministry of Construction notes that
the massive nationwide housing construction program over the past
five years has included the completion of more than 5,000 large
residential quarters with floor space of over 50,000 sq.m. each.
</P>
<P>
Over 100,000 small to medium-sized residential quarters have
been constructed nationwide.
</P>
<P>
From an overall point of view, however, many of the new
residential quarters have experienced problems related to housing
construction, design, landscaping and auxiliary facilities.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Construction is preparing to launch a
nationwide campaign to improve the situation. The campaign will
include the construction of model and experimental residential
quarters which will provide a reference point for housing
construction companies. Some 400 pilot urban residential projects
have been completed throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
China completed residential quarters covering 300 million sq.m,
during 1998. The goal of the campaign is to provide comfortable
housing for Chinese citizens. Plans call for completing apartments
with a combined floor space of 240 million sq.m. each year over
the next few years.
</P>
<P>
The official says pilot residential quarters have provided
effective models for housing construction.
</P>
<P>
Provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions are being
urged to attain the goal of ensuring at least 25 percent of
residential housing reach standards for pilot residential quarters
by the year of 2000.

<HEADLINE> N.Z. Credit Ratings Predicted to Be Downgraded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's foreign currency
credit ratings could be downgraded next year, the Dominion
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Wellington-based newspaper said although the international
rating agency Standard and Poor's has affirmed New Zealand's
ratings, the country has been flagged for a possible downgrade.
</P>
<P>
Standard and Poor's Tuesday reaffirmed New Zealand's key AA+
long-term currency rating, the AAA local currency rating and A1+
short-term foreign currency rating, but said all had a negative
outlook, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
It quoted the agency as saying "The negative outlook on the
foreign currency rating reflects the likelihood of further
budgetary and balance of payments pressures in the next few
years."
</P>
<P>
The next balance of payments figures, out next week, are
expected to show a continued worsening in the New Zealand
position, with an annual deficit that may reach 6.3 billion NZ
dollars (3.4 billion U.S. dollars), equal to more than six percent
of the country's gross domestic product, a worrying level by
international standards, the Dominion said.
</P>
<P>
The dismal balance of payments figures are a significant factor
in the recent weakening of the New Zealand dollar against the
Australian currency, falling below 81 cents of the Australian
dollar Tuesday. It has reached the lowest level against the
Australian currency for almost five years, down almost nine
percent since the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
"The falling New Zealand dollar reflected the poor current
account deficit that worries the ratings agencies," the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
A lower credit rating can mean higher borrowing costs for New
Zealand companies when they borrow overseas, because a company's
rating can be no higher than the country rating.

</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert declared his candidacy for the
Likud leadership Tuesday. But it appeared that most Likud
ministers and legislators favor interim leader Ariel Sharon as
the party head. Sharon's confidants said he is by far the

suggesting he has 50 percent of support, compared with 17 percent
for Olmert.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>

Sarid to meet with him Wednesday in an apparent attempt to step
up the pressure on Meretz to join the new government and drop its
veto of the inclusion of the ultra-religious Shas party in the
coalition.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel and the United States have expressed concern over
the arrest of 13 Jews by Iran and denied charges that they have
been spying for the two countries. Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon
met with United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan Tuesday and
asked him to work for the prisoners' release.

<P>
NAIROBI, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is worried
about the landmines planted along the Kenyan-Ethiopian border by
criminals, a Kenyan official has said at a meeting in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The official Kenya Times Wednesday quoted North Eastern
Provincial Commissioner Maurice Makhanu as saying that criminal
activities such as banditry and cattle rustling have recently
spilled over into Kenya, causing

loss of lives and property.
</P>
<P>
Kenya will never be a sanctuary for the Oromo Liberation Front
movement (OLF), which currently engaged in armed atrocities
against the Ethiopian government, Makhanu said Tuesday in the
18th Ethiopian-Kenyan joint border commissioners-administrators
committee meeting held in Ethiopia's capital.
</P>
<P>
Whenever the Kenya government is aware of the group's illegal
presence on Kenyan territory, swift measures would be taken to
flush them out, said Makhanu, head of the Kenyan delegation to
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government will remain committed to strengthening
bilateral relations with Ethiopia and will not condone atrocities
against sovereign states by insurgents, Makhanu noted.

<P>
BEIJING, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Jia Hongqiang, a Chinese soldier
hospitalized in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region,
never dreamed that a medical professor in Shanghai would diagnose
his illness and suggest treatment procedures.
</P>
<P>
Experts noted that People's Liberation Army (PLA) has made
marked progress in developing long-distance medical consulting
services in recent years. Related services will become an
important aspect of PLA medical services in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The PLA's comprehensive long-distance medical consulting
service network consists of six medical service centers and more
than 100 medical stations across the country.
</P>
<P>
"Long-distance medical consulting services have had a profound
impact on traditional military medical science and logistics in
recent years, according to one senior PLA officer.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the PLA has used long-distance medical
consulting services in combat exercises and rescue operations
during disasters. The effective service has ensured treatment for
seriously injured people.
</P>
<P>
A soldier injured in last year's anti-flood campaign
represents a typical example. The long-distance medical consulting
service network provided medical personnel on the spot with
treatment suggestions from six experts across the country.
</P>
<P>
A report issued by the Health Department of the PLA's General
Logistics Department shows that Chinese army operates a database
listing more than 300 medical experts readily available to provide
long-distance medical advice.
</P>
<P>
China has recently promulgated an interim regulation governing
the management of long-distance medical services for the army.

LUSAKA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Rampaging elephants have destroyed
maize fields in Itezhi-Tezhi District in Zambia's Southern
Province and villagers have appealed to the government to deal
with the animals.
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia newspaper Wednesday quoted the Movement for

 "we appeal to the government to crop the animals because we are
finding it difficult to chase them as they are very dangerous and
they can not respond to noise made through drumming."
</P>

Villagers had now stopped moving during the night because the
animals started attacking them and pulled down their maize barns,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Many villagers who had their fields completely destroyed have
resorted to other means of survival, he added.

<P>
Chunga said the villagers had alerted wildlife scouts who had

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, June 9 (Xinhua)-- China is currently using seven
aircraft to spray over 1,200 tons of chemicals to eradicate
locusts which threaten the country's crops.
</P>
<P>
The government has allocated 23 million yuan to carry out
related programs in Hebei, Henan and Shandong provinces, as well
as six provinces in north China, according to the Ministry of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Each province has assigned special cadres and work teams for
the locust eradication and prevent infestations in other areas.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged drought since last winter has created conditions
leading to the multiplication of the locust population. The
ministry estimates that locusts have created havoc on over 866,000
ha, up 50 percent on normal years.
</P>
<P>
The current locust infestation has basically affected
wastelands and has not yet spread to farmland.
</P>
<P>
China has reduced areas affected by locust infestations from
400 million ha in the 1950s to around 133 million ha in recent
years.

OTTAWA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd
Axworthy on Tuesday welcomed the agreement reached by the G8
foreign ministers on a draft U.N. Security Council resolution on
peace in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was brokered by Russian special envoy Viktor
Chernomyrdin and Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari last week.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy hailed the agreement as an important diplomatic
turning point in the Kosovo crisis and a major step toward a
lasting peace in Kosovo. He called for a quick adoption of the
resolution by the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"Canada will work with our Security Council partners in New
York to build upon this very positive development for peace in
Kosovo," the Canadian foreign minister said in a release issued
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest development, the U.N. Security Council
began to meet on the draft resolution on Kosovo at 12:00 EST (1700
GMT) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution demands a verifiable withdrawal of
Yugoslav troops from Kosovo and opens the door to a suspension of
NATO's bombing across Yugoslavia. It authorizes international

<HEADLINE> U.S. Market for Electronic Funds Transfer Software Expands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Financial institutions in the
United States have made great efforts to deploy transaction
processing technology to assist in lowering costs and offering
better services to customers, said a research report released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the research conducted by market analysis firm
Frost &AMP; Sullivan, the total market for electronic funds transfer
software reached 100 million U.S. dollars in 1998, up 21 percent
from a year ago. The market is expected to generate a revenue of
148 million dollars by 2005.
</P>
<P>
The market for automatic teller machine (ATM) processing
software accounted for 41 million dollars in 1998. Factors driving
growth in the market are the continued growth of the Internet,
integrated architecture and more functionality in ATMs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the growth in E-commerce spurred sales of point of
sale (POS) transaction processing software, reaching 45 million
dollars last year. The market witnessed a rising debit card
transactions as well as Internet-based payments. Although debit
cards have yet to be adopted on a mainstream level in the United
States, the report said, the growth of E-commerce will be
sufficient to generate new sales of POS software during the next
five to six years.
</P>
<P>
Internet banking software is another aspect of the growing
market, with revenues totaling 14 million dollars in 1998. Early
adopters so far are large banks, but some community banks are
beginning to follow suit. The report said that as more features
are added to the core functions of Internet banking software, such
as mutual fund transactions and loan applications, the market will
grow briskly in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
Continued support for standards and interoperability will serve
the market well in light of the growing trend toward integration
with legacy systems of complete flexibility. Future growth may
come from the availability of browser-based ATMs which will
greatly reduce costs, simplify software upgrades and become a
strong driving force behind this continuously growing market, the
report said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Floats Tender to Sell State-owned Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's Privatization Board has
floated tender notices for selling five state-owned enterprises
(SOEs) to the private sector with a closing date for submitting
bids on June 16, The New Nation daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises are Fish Export Limited and Star Jute Mills in
Khulna, 140 kilometers southwest of here, Bangladesh Textile Mills
and Chittaranjan Cotton Mills in Narayanganj, on the southwestern
outskirts of the capital city, and Kaliachapra Sugar Mills in
Kishoreganj, 88 kilometers southeast of Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
A board spokesperson said more SOEs in the textile and
engineering sectors would be on sale after the sellout of these
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"Interest of the private entrepreneurs in these enterprises
seems to be very strong," Kazi Zafarullah, chairman of the
privatization board, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The selling of these enterprises offered private investors a
unique opportunity to get in on the ground of the country's
privatization process, while the development of the private sector
offered the best solution to many of the problems faced by the
country's loss-making state enterprises, he said.
</P>
<P>
There are about 300 SOEs under state-run corporations in the
country, with a total output value accounting for about 6 percent
of the country's gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Bangladeshi government decided to privatize 51
SOEs in 1999 and to sell the state's shares in 19 other
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Only 17 SOEs have been privatized in the country since 1993
when the Privatization Board was set up to privatize loss-making
SOEs, reports said.

<HEADLINE> Funds, Measures Sought to Boost Thai Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Commerce Ministry has
proposed that the Export and Import Bank of Thailand (EXIM) set
aside 150 million baht (4.05 million U.S. dollars) for exporters
trading with new market partners as partial compensation for their
interest burden, The Nation reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, exporters could be compensated five percent
of the interest burden they incur on the value of their exports
over and above last year's level.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Bank of Thailand has supported moves in boosting
exports by providing export credit of two billion baht (54 million
dollars) to the EXIM, which will directly lend this amount to
exporters.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the EXIM has also extended its insurance services to
cover small export bills and payment agreements under letters of
credit.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry has also agreed in principle to allow
exporters to new markets to double their tax deductions by
including expenses for marketing campaign.
</P>
<P>
While these fiscal and monetary measures are to be put in
place, the Commerce Ministry has set aside 120 million baht (3.2
million dollars) of its budget to support expenses related to
activities aimed at boosting new export market.
</P>
<P>
Thailand aims to boost its exports to seven new markets,
namely, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, Eastern Europe,
Western Europe, South Asia and China.
</P>
<P>
Thailand predicted that the country's exports could increase
four percent this year to 54 billion dollars. However, exports in
the first four months dropped two percent from the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand has lowered its export growth projection
to 2.1 percent, but still believed that the economy will grow one
percent as targeted.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Approves Rubber Price Accord With Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet has approved a
proposal by the Ministry of Agriculture and Agricultural
Cooperatives on jointly shoring up world rubber prices with
Malaysia, a Government House press release available here
Wednesday said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry reached agreement with Malaysia's Ministry of
Primary Industry last month, aimed at effectively intervening in
the rubber market by sharing information and managing a joint
stockpile, as well as cooperating on technical and processing
aspects.
</P>
<P>
The two ministries are expected to work out a timetable for the
intervention and design rubber prices based on the prices of the
four major markets in Singapore, Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur and Hat Yai
in southern Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Both sides also agreed to set up mechanisms for working
together by a Thailand-Malaysia Ministerial Committee on Rubber
and the two sub-committees, known as the Sub-Committee on Price
and Trade and the Sub-Committee on Technical Cooperation between
Thailand and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The agreement between Thailand and Malaysia, the world's two
largest rubber exporters confirmed their decisions to withdraw
from the International Rubber Organization, which will take effect
in October and early next year respectively, citing the world
rubber body's failure to manage buffer stocks and prop up
nose-diving rubber prices in the world market.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Approves Bill for Agriculture Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House on Tuesday passed a
measure of 61 billion U.S. dollars for financing farm and food
programs in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Despite Democratic objections, the bill was passed by a near
party-line vote of 246-183, winning the first approval in the 13
annual spending bills for the next fiscal year to be read.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, the money spent for agriculture programs next
year would be 1.6 billion dollars more than in this year and six
billion dollars less than President Bill Clinton had requested.
</P>
<P>
The bill would increase spending for agriculture research and
food inspections, but reduce rural development, crop insurance and
Agriculture Department construction programs.
</P>
<P>
In this year, a total amount of about 6.5 billion dollars was
used as emergency spending in response to low commodity prices and
diminished overseas demand for U.S. agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
The Senate has yet to write the version of the bill.

WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank on Tuesday
announced the approval of a loan of 100 million U.S. dollars and a
grant totaling 35 million dollars under the Global Environment
Facility for the Renewable Energy Development Project in China.
</P>
<P>
The project will use wind-generated electricity to increase the
power supply to communities already receiving electricity and use
photovoltaic or solar-generated electricity to supply schools,
households, and small businesses in the poorest parts of
northwestern rural China, the bank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The project consists of two parts. The first part involves the
use of solar-powered energy. Individual homes, shops and schools
in isolated rural areas will be equipped with solar panels that
will generate electricity that could be stored and used during
evening and night time hours.
</P>
<P>
The second part of the project will increase the supply of
electricity to local communities in four selected regions at the
provincial level -- Inner Mongolia, Hebei, Fujian and Shanghai --
and reduce greenhouse gas emissions through the construction and
operation of windfarms at five strategically chosen sites.
</P>
<P>
China has vast wind resources concentrated in the north of the
country stretching from Xinjiang in the west to Inner Mongolia in
the east, as well as along the coastal region lying on the East
and South China Seas.
</P>
<P>
The production of electricity from renewable energy provides a
clean energy alternative to the coal-fire power plants
traditionally used to generate electricity in some parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be at the bank's standard interest rate for LIBOR-
based, U.S. dollar single-currency loans, with a maturity of 20
years, including a five-year grace period.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Announces Age-Check Plan for R-rated Movies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Tuesday won pledges from theater owners to check the age of young
people seeking to view R-rated movies.
</P>
<P>
"From now on, parents will know that the R-rating means -- what
is supposed to mean -- restricted," Clinton said of the agreement
with the National Association of Theater Owners, which represents
about 65 percent of U.S. theaters.
</P>
<P>
"They're subject to too much violence through media and
cultural contacts," he said.
</P>
<P>
The pledge is the first major industry response to Clinton's
drive against youth violence, which begun in the wake of the
Colorado school shooting killing 15 people on April 20.
</P>
<P>
In response to Clinton's request to enforce the rating system
more strictly, the National Association of Theater Owners said it
would begin requiring youths unaccompanied by adults to produce a
photo ID before being admitted to R-rated films.
</P>
<P>
Clinton announced the association's pledge in a ceremony here
on Tuesday jointly with William Kartozian, the association's
president, and Barrie Lawson Loeks, its chairman.
</P>
<P>
"We feel this will go a long way in carrying out our
responsibilities to the parents of America," Kartozian said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also called on the movie industry to re-evaluate its
entire ratings system to determine whether it is allowing children
to be exposed to too much gratuitous violence.
</P>
<P>
The movie-rating system, which rates movies based on sexual or
violent content, was adopted by the Motion Picture Association of
America in 1968.
</P>
<P>
The system requires that viewers of R-rated movies be at least
17 years old or accompanied by a parent or guardian. Still, many
young people sneak into the theaters because of a lack of
vigilance at the ticket booth.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Reclaim More Vacant Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is planning to reclaim a
total of 291,600 hectares more of vacant, virgin, fallow and wet
lands in the country's Mon and Kayin states following the
reclamation made in six states and divisions since the beginning
of this year.
</P>
<P>
Study is being made on the two states if these lands are
suitable for growing perennial and seasonal crops, according to
the Myanmar Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation.
</P>
<P>
A total of 467,370 hectares of such lands have been reclaimed
in Myanmar's Ayeyawaddy, Yangon, Bago, Magway and Tanintharyi
divisions and Shan state to cultivate crops to boost the country's
agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
The move is also part of Myanmar's efforts to recover from the
effects of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
In the reclamation activities, private entrepreneurs are
allowed to export half the agricultural products to earn hard
currency for importing farm machinery, fertilizer and pesticide.
</P>
<P>
The government is also extending 30-year land grants to
growers, which are extendible with land lease free of charge.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's paddy production dropped steadily over the past few
years, falling from 19 million tons in fiscal 1995-96 to 17.66
million tons in 1996-97 and again to 17.3 million tons in 1997-98.
In the meantime, rice export dropped from 354,000 tons to 93,100
tons and then to 28,300 tons correspondingly.
</P>
<P>
The figures of paddy production and rice export for fiscal
1998-99, which ended in March, remain to be published.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's agriculture accounts for 36 percent of the gross
domestic product and 35 percent of the export value.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Civil rights leader Jesse
Jackson warned on Tuesday that Kosovo could be another South Korea
for U.S. troops. He also criticized the Clinton administration for
not telling the Americans the real cost of the war against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Jackson made the remarks when speaking to reporters before
addressing the graduating class of Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here quoted him as saying that the Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA) would see U.S. ground troops as an
interference with its quest for independence and the Serbs would
see them as an occupation force.
</P>
<P>
"Thus, they will be in the cross-fire of a very expensive,
volatile situation," Jackson noted. "We will be there for as long
as we have been in South Korea."
</P>
<P>
"Every bomb dropped costs one million U.S. dollars. Every
Tomahawk missile costs 1.6 million U.S. dollars. We'll spend 25
plus billion U.S. dollars for this war," he said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, he said, the United States will also have to
spend twice that amount in reconstruction and "an indeterminate
amount in troop presence and occupation in a danger zone in that
country."
</P>
<P>
"That's far beyond what the American people have been told to
date," the civil rights leader said.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker Vows to Appeal Against Clinton Over Kosovo War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. lawmaker Tom Campbell vowed
Tuesday to go to the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court after
his Kosovo lawsuit against President Bill Clinton was dismissed by
a federal judge.
</P>
<P>
The California Republican, who led the lawmakers charging the
president with illegality in launching air war against Yugoslavia,
said the dismissal was "an absurdity if the Constitution's war
declaration authority is to have any meaning."
</P>
<P>
"The effect of today's ruling is to prevent any member of
Congress from contesting a war that the president initiates and
carries forward in the absence of a declaration of Congress,"
Campbell said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
In their lawsuit, 31 lawmakers, including four Democrats, noted
that a 213-213 vote on April 28 fell short of authorizing U.S.
participation in the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. Another vote that
day rejected a resolution declaring a state of war between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers claimed that Clinton ignored both votes by
continuing with the bombing, which has lasted for more than 70
days.
</P>
<P>
The 31 lawmakers, who said that Clinton violated the 1973 War
Powers Act when he authorized U.S. involvement in the NATO
airstrikes, sought a court ruling forcing Clinton to withdraw
troops from the region or to seek a declaration of war from
Congress.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam War-era legislation requires a president to receive
congressional approval for the "introduction into hostilities" of
the U.S. forces for more than 60 days.
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman ruled on Tuesday that the
lawmakers lacked the legal standing to sue the president.
</P>
<P>
"Plaintiffs have failed to establish a sufficiently genuine
impasse between the legislative and executive branches to give
them standing," Friedman wrote in his opinion.

<HEADLINE> EU to Attend Rio Summit, Not to Start Talks With Mercosur </HEADLINE>

<P>
MADRID, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will attend
the Rio Summit at the end of the month but will not start talks
with the Southern Common Market (Mercosur) and Chile about the
establishment of a free-trade zone, a senior official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Spain advocated starting talks no later than January 1, 2000,
but French President Jacques Chirac vetoed last Friday at the EU
summit in Germany article 89 of the resolution about the start of
the EU talks with Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
Despite Spain's efforts, the EU will not negotiate with
Mercosur for an agreement on the free-trade zone before the year
2003 or 2004, said Spanish Secretary of State for International
Cooperation Fernando Villalonga.
</P>
<P>
He said that Spain will make efforts to prevent the EU from
ignoring the trade opportunities with Latin American countries
although the organization's contribution to the development of
Eastern Europe and the Balkans is necessary.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- The stock market and the rupiah
jumped Tuesday as the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle
(PDI-P) remained on top, enjoying the lion's share of votes in the
ongoing ballot counts.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta Stock Exchange skyrocketed Tuesday, breaking the
significant 700-point level to close at 689.95, representing a

</P>
<P>
The bullish rupiah surged both in offshore and Jakarta trade.

week.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said the financial markets rose on euphoria over
peaceful elections and "acceptable" provisional votes.
</P>
<P>
By 06:15 local time Wednesday (2315 GMT Tuesday), the main

Over 112 million Indonesians cast votes Monday in the country's
first multi-party election in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Forty-eight political parties contested the polls, fighting for

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 9 (Xinhua) -- China will speed up the
technological innovation drive of state-owned enterprises by
promoting application of information technology (IT), according to
a high-ranking official.
</P>
<P>
Technological innovation has been deemed as the key for deficit-
ridden state-owned enterprises to adapt to market demand and get
out of their plight, Zhang Zhigang, vice-minister of the State
Economic and Trade Commission, said.
</P>
<P>
"China has been prioritizing multimedia and networking
technology and products in arranging technological innovation
projects nationwide," Zhang was quoted by today's China Daily as
saying.
</P>
<P>
For the past three years, China has earmarked 3.15 billion yuan
(379.5 million U.S. dollars) to complete 792 electronics and
communications development projects, according to figures provided
by the commission.
</P>
<P>
The projects were incorporated in the technological innovation
efforts in the country's major state firms, focusing on
development of multimedia platforms and the key technology
pertaining to networking among heterogeneous computers and
networks, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The government should render policy support and IT suppliers
provide better service to help enterprises intensify use and
development of information technology, in a bid to increase their
economic performance and competitiveness, he said.
</P>
<P>
As part of the efforts in the move, China will hold an
international exhibition on application of networking and
multimedia technology in Beijing between June 17 and 21, according
to the vice minister.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Passes Pentagon Spending Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate on Tuesday
approved a 265-billion-U.S.-dollar spending bill of the Defense
Department for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon spending bill for the fiscal year which begins
October 1 includes funds to cover a 4.8 percent across-the-board
pay raise for the military. The figure is 1.4 billion dollars
higher than the budget submitted by President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
However, the bill contains no money for either a peacekeeping
operation or a continued military campaign in Kosovo. That was
expected to be submitted by the administration in a later bill.
</P>
<P>
The Senate passed on a voice vote an amendment by Republican
Senator Don Nickles that would block U.S. funds for any future
rebuilding of Serbia, outside of Kosovo, so long as Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic "remains in power." The measure was
supported by Republican and Democratic leaders alike.
</P>
<P>
"Rebuilding should primarily be done with European money,"
Republican Senator Ted Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has said that he does not intend to commit U.S. money
for rebuilding Serbia outside what may be spent in Kosovo. But
Republican senators said they want to see it written into law.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's PDI-P Maintains Lead in Early Election Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- With only three percent of some 100
million votes counted by 07:00 a.m. local time (00:00 GMT)
Wednesday, the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P)
remained the front-runner by bagging 1,057,810 votes.
</P>
<P>
The party led by opposition leader Megawati Soekarnoputri was
followed by National Awakening Party (PKB) with 646,402 votes.
</P>
<P>
According to the General Elections Commission (KPU), the next
top five were ruling Golkar Party with 413,530 votes, United
Development Party (PPP) with 230,104 votes, National Mandate Party
(PAN) with 161,797 votes, Crescent Star Party (PBB) with 33,934
votes, and Justice and Unity Party (PKP) with 21,766 votes.
</P>
<P>
Confusion reigned not only in the central media center at
Aryaduta Hotel in Central Jakarta which is linked up with the
commission's special counting center, but also among various
groups of people as reports of different results came in and the
slow pace in which reports from polling places reached the
commission.
</P>
<P>
To aggravate the matter, many other institutions including
political parties, did their own vote counts which some media
quoted without mentioning the sources. Golkar Party, for instance,
had its own vote counting activity which proceeded faster than the
commission's.
</P>
<P>
Official Antara News Agency, quoting its own sources, said at
11:35 p.m. local time (1635 GMT) Tuesday that PDI-P had won
4,476,382 votes with Golkar Party trailing in second place with
2,650,722 votes. Next were PKB with 1,590,770 votes, PPP with
1,132,572 votes and PAN with 839,815 votes.
</P>
<P>
Some observers expressed fears of vote-rigging so that
opposition leader Abdurrahman Wahid threatened to consider setting
up an alternative emergency government if evidence of foul play is
found.
</P>
<P>
Wahid, general chairman of the country's largest Muslim
Organization Nahdlatul Ulama, Tuesday said he conveyed his stance
to Indonesian Military Commander General Wiranto and Megawati.
</P>
<P>
Golkar Party leader Marzuki Darusman was gracious about the
possibility of losing. He said his party has been in power for
more than three decades, so it should be ready to accept defeat.
</P>
<P>
"Golkar (must also be ready) to hand over power to parties
winning the elections," he said, adding the party could instead
take the position of opposition.
</P>
<P>
Golkar Party General Chairman Akbar Tanjung questioned the wide
gap between the votes earned by PDI-P and Golkar Party as recorded
in the commission's vote count.
</P>
<P>
"With due respect to the general election commission, I must
ask for clarification why this is so. I am not being suspicious...
as our own vote counting, too, shows that PDI-P has obtained more
than Golkar Party... but the gap is simply too far," he added.
</P>
<P>
The June 7 parliamentary election is the country's eighth since
1945. The last general election was held in 1997 under former
president Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
Monday's election is designed to choose 462 members of the
500-seat House of Representatives. The remaining 38 members have
been allotted for the military whose members do not vote.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 9 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's garment and textile
industry attained an export value of 429 million U.S. dollars in
the first four months of 1999, a 28 percent year-on-year increase.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of Vietnam News Agency Tuesday, the
garment and textile industry's export turnover in May was
estimated at 110 million dollars, bringing its total export
earnings to 540 million dollars in the first five months of this
year, up 10.6 percent from the corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
Noteworthy was that garment and textile exports to the
non-quota markets accounted for 70 percent of the total export
volume with the remainder to the EU market.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's earnings from jacket exports to the EU market made up
50 percent of its total export value in the first five months of
this year. However, the quantity of Vietnamese-made jackets to EU
dropped by 1 million items and accounted for only 60-65 percent of
the volume recorded in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Trade Ministry's Import-Export Department
attributed the situation to EU changes in the requirements of
jacket designs and the slow sales of these products in the market.

Director of the Anti-Narcotics Bureau Senior Superintendent of
Police C.L. Ratnayake was quoted by the sources as saying that Sri

<HEADLINE> American States Approve New Anti-drug Evaluation Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-four member countries of
the Organization of American States (OAS) Tuesday agreed to
support a new mechanism of multilateral anti-drug evaluation.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Guatemala, where the OAS meeting was being held,
said the new mechanism, subject to approval by the OAS General
Assembly in Uruguay in October, would replace in the near future
the annual U.S. anti-drug certification scheme.
</P>
<P>
Guatemalan Foreign Minister Eduardo Stein, who was presiding
over the 29th OAS ordinary working session, said that all OAS
countries agreed to discard the U.S. scheme.
</P>
<P>
If endorsed, the new mechanism will be applied in the first
quarter of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
During the session, Colombian Foreign Minister Guillermo
Fernandez said that Colombia "cannot be held solely responsible"
for producing drug while "the consumption goes up higher all the
time."
</P>
<P>
At the end of the session, delegates also agreed in principle
on the re-election of former Colombian President Cesar Gavaria as
president of the OAS for another five-year term.

<HEADLINE> European Banks Okay Debt Reprieve for Philippine Airlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- European creditors of debt-laden
Philippine Airlines (PAL) have agreed to restructure more than 900
million U.S. dollars of the airline's debt, the Manila Times
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, representatives of the European
Export Credit Agencies (ECAs) which account for about 38 percent
of PAL's total debt are now in Manila to formally sign an
agreement to reschedule the ailing flag carrier's debt payments.
</P>
<P>
The visit came just four days after PAL chairman Lucio Tan beat
a creditor-imposed deadline to infuse 200 million U.S. dollars in
fresh equity into PAL or face liquidation.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted PAL sources as saying that the agreement with
ECAs is expected to pave the way for similar deals with PAL's
other creditors, particularly the U.S. Export-Import Bank.
</P>
<P>
The ECAs, collectively PAL's largest creditor, own the lease to
PAL's fleet of 12 wide-body Airbus aircraft which the airline uses
on its long-haul flights.
</P>
<P>
The agreement with the ECAs will allow PAL to restructure the
terms of its obligations with the 17 French, British and German
banks represented in the consortium.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the International Air Transport Association
are also in Manila to discuss the restructuring of their remaining
claims with PAL.
</P>
<P>
PAL president Alvelino Zapanta is currently touring the
airline's various facilities and stations to get the employees
support in turning around the cash-strapped carrier, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
PAL, Asia's oldest airline, suspended payments on 2.3 billion
U.S. dollars in debts a year ago because of mounting losses and
labor problems.

said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Expected to pit the champions of the six continental

some clubs, especially the Europeans, have expressed concern over
placing the tournament in the middle of their league seasons.

<P>
The European Champions Cup winner will be the invitee from
Europe, but if it refuses, the runner-up may go instead.

<HEADLINE> No Political Motive in Vote-Counting Delay: Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- There was no motive or interest of
certain political groups in the delay of the vote-counting by
Indonesia's General Election Commission (KPU), Chairman of the KPU
Rudini said.
</P>
<P>
The delay was merely caused by the lack of skill of local
election committee members in handling sophisticated computers,
Rudini was quoted by Antara News Agency Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Regarding such problems, Rudini said he was pessimistic that
the final results of the elections would be known according to
schedule.
</P>
<P>
"I think we will complete the counting of votes by the end of
June," Rudini added.
</P>
<P>
Jeffrey Winters, a foreign observer, feared fraud may be behind
the delay in the sending of election results from various parts of
the country to the Indonesian Election Committee (PPI).
</P>
<P>
Only one percent of the total votes could be made public more
than 24 hours after the vote counting at each polling station was
completed. In Jakarta which is relatively close to the PPI office,
many votes have not been received even in more than 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
"This can influence the degree of the people's confidence in
the ongoing process," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (PDI-P)
Tuesday urged the KPU to immediately announce nationwide vote
counts in order to prevent illegal practices such as vote
engineering and manipulation.
</P>
<P>
"If the vote counts are too long, I fear we will lose the
momentum and there will be vote engineering," the party's
treasurer Laksamana Sukardi said.
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that the slow vote counts are acceptable in
view of the limited facilities and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of Golkar Party Akbar Tanjung also criticized the KPU
for being too slow in counting votes.
</P>
<P>
The slow vote counts may have a psychological effect on the
political parties, including Golkar Party, contesting the June 7
polls.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he called on the KPU to speed up the vote counts
besides explaining the matter to the people.
</P>
<P>
Akbar said the party has a reliable mechanism of counting votes
from the provinces, districts, subdistricts and even villages.
</P>
<P>
"We also count votes from the lowest level. We get vote counts
which are far bigger (than KPU's)," he added.

<HEADLINE> Global Chip Market to Gain Double Digit Annual Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The global semiconductor market is
expected to gain double digit annual growth in the next four years,
the U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Led by the growth of the Internet and E-Commerce throughout the
world, global semiconductor sales are forecast to rise from 140.8
billion U.S. dollars in 1999, to 162.5 billion in 2000, 191.0
billion in 2001 and 215.7 billion in 2002.
</P>
<P>
They represent growth rates of 12.1 percent, 15.4 percent, 17.6
percent and 12.9 percent respectively, the SIA said in its latest
report.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. would account for one third of the world market, to be
followed by Asia-Pacific excluding Japan, which would shed the
effects of the Asian economic crisis contributing to the 4.4
percent decline of that market in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Europe will be behind Asia-Pacific and has bounced back as a
significant player, but Japan is still impacted by the protracted
domestic recession, the SIA added.

<HEADLINE> IDB to Help Reconstruct Rural Nicaragua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American Development Bank
(IDB) proposed Tuesday to help the reconstruction of Nicaragua hit
by Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
Martin Stabile, the IDB representative in Nicaragua, said that
reconstruction is necessary to reduce ecological vulnerability by
reducing poverty in rural areas, which suffered most in hurricanes
last October and November.
</P>
<P>
Apart from hurricanes, small producers in rural Nicaragua are
also affected by drought, flooding and landslides. "Over the past
25 years," stressed Stabile, "not a single small producer has ever
received the tools nor knowledge needed to improve their fruit and
coffee varieties."
</P>
<P>
He also said that the only way-out is to search for regional
solutions, such as the preservation of the biological corridor in
the Central American region.
</P>
<P>
The ecological problem can be traced back to the 1970s, when
cotton growing became a rush in western Nicaragua, said Jaime
Incer Barquero, a local ecologist. The problem was aggravated by
the excessive use of insecticides and pesticides, he added.

<HEADLINE> Car Sales in Philippines up 25 Percent in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 9 (Xinhua) -- In what is considered an indication
of economic upturn, passenger car sales in the Philippines rose by
a hefty 25 percent in May to 2,394 from 1,922 the month before,
statistics from the Chamber of Automotive Manufacturers of the
Philippines Inc. (Campi) show.
</P>
<P>
The sales figure in April was the lowest in eight years while
the figure in May was 19 percent lower than in the same month last
year.
</P>
<P>
Total sales for the first five months, however, dropped by 36.3
percent from 17,149 units in the same period in 1998 to 10,918
units.
</P>
<P>
Sales, which have been dampened by the lack of bank financing
and tight credit checking, were further depressed by the
assemblers' latest announcement of its new round of price
adjustments last month.
</P>
<P>
An industry source said new car buyers were keeping their
purses tight until assemblers give them better deals in purchasing
new cars.
</P>
<P>
Data from Campi also show that major car assemblers, except for
Honda Cars Philippines Inc., are taking the brunt of the sales
slowdown while South Korean models Daewoo and Hyundai and European
Luxury brands Opel and BMW are bucking the downtrend.
</P>
<P>
The passenger car market is expected to post sales of 35,000
units this year from 34,688 in 1998, but some car dealers said it
would be difficult to hit the projection.

<HEADLINE> Becker Advances into Second Round at London Grass Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Four-times champion Boris Becker
opened his farewell London grasscourt championships campaign in
style on Tuesday, defeating Petr Korda of Czech Republic 6-4, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
The German player, 31, needed one break in each set to dismiss
Korda on the Queen's Club center court to set up a second-round
clash with defending champion and 15th-seed Scott Draper in the
750,000 U.S. dollar traditional Wimbledon warm-up event.
</P>
<P>
"I felt really comfortable. It was my first grasscourt match
for some time and I was surprised by my timing and movement,"
Becker said.
</P>
<P>
The German, champion at Wimbledon in 1985, 1986 and 1989, is
playing just three more tournaments before retiring -- here at
Queen's, Wimbledon and Stuttgart in July.
</P>
<P>
He won the first of his 49 career titles at Queen's in 1985
aged 17, just before becoming the youngest Wimbledon men's singles
champion.
</P>
<P>
"This is the only tournament I have won four times... it is the
first tournament I ever won... maybe I am a little old-fashioned
or a little romantic but it was important for me to come back here
one last time."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, French 16th seed Fabrice Santoro went out 6-3, 7-6 to
Australian qualifier Peter Tramacchi and former world number one
Jim Courier beat Denmark's Kenneth Carlsen 6-2, 4-6, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
Cedric Pioline, the 11th seed, struggled to move past Italian
Mose Navarra 7-6, 3-6, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
British wildcard Chris Wilkinson justified his place in the
draw by beating Japan's Takao Suzuki 4-6, 7-6, 6-1 while British
qualifier Martin Lee had to save a match-point before beating
Sweden's Michael Tillstrom 6-7, 7-6, 6-4.

<HEADLINE> Hingis Fined for Unsporting Conduct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- World No. 1 Martina Hingis has been
fined over 800 pounds for unsporting conduct following her French
Open final defeat to Steffi Graf.
</P>
<P>
The fine has been handed out by the International Tennis
Federation after the 18-year-old's antics during the second and
third set of the match.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman said the fine was for Hingis' breaking tennis
etiquette by crossing the netline to argue a call with the umpire
and lineswoman.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss teenager also received a warning after smashing her
racket and then incurred a penalty point for crossing the line.
</P>
<P>
Hingis also took an extended bathroom break in the third set to
change her appearance and served underarm when facing match point.
</P>
<P>
A beaten Hingis left the court in tears at the end of the match
after being booed by the Roland Garros crowd.
</P>
<P>
The ITF could not confirm a report in the Daily Telegraph
newspaper that Hingis was also involved in an alleged "physical
incident" with a women's WTA Tour official after the match and
before the prize giving.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph reported that the alleged "physical
incident"is thought to have involved a clearly distressed Hingis
and a member of the WTA press staff, between the end of the match
and the presentation ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Petit Sparks Drug Controversy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- England premier league soccer club
Arsenal star Emmanuel Petit has been urged to blow the whistle on
the Premiership's drug-users - after making shock claims over the
use of illegal substances in English football.
</P>
<P>
The French World Cup-winner believes some top players are
turning to drugs to help them cope with the increased demands of
the modern game.
</P>
<P>
And he fears the increased number of matches will only escalate
the problem of drugs in the sport.
</P>
<P>
"If the present number of games continues, something is going
to have to give," Petit told the Mirror.
</P>
<P>
"We will all have to take drugs to survive. Some footballers
already do. I know that. But I am not giving any names, " he added.
</P>
<P>
His claim has drawn an attention from soccer officials.
English Football Association (FA) spokesman Steve Double said:"If
he has any evidence, we would like to hear from him."
</P>
<P>
"We will not be calling him before the FA at this stage, not
while we are in Bulgaria with England. We will not have time to
analyze it properly.
</P>
<P>
"But if he has evidence, we would like to hear it. However, the
recent test results do not back that up," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Gordon Taylor of the Professional Footballers' Association has
also urged Petit to name names.
</P>
<P>
"It is a very contentious remark and it doesn't do a lot of
good for the game," said Taylor.
</P>
<P>
But he had some sympathy for the midfielder's complaints about
the workload in the top flight: "It is well known the French
players have been complaining about the number of matches. They
have been playing for the last 12 months without a break.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to achieve with FIFA an agreement for a football
calendar with a proper period without club or international games
so players get a proper physical and mental rest."
</P>
<P>
Petit claims there is a conspiracy of silence within football
about the extent of the drug problem, as those who know the matter
are unwilling to cause a storm by speaking out on the issue.
</P>
<P>
"Soccer went through years of corruption. I don't want it to go
through years of drug scandals," Petit said.
</P>
<P>
"When people talk about a World Cup every two years and 12
European Cup ties even before the quarter-finals, I warn that
players might be forced to take drugs to get through such a tight
schedule.
</P>
<P>
"All the players are talking about it. They are fully aware of
the situation.
</P>
<P>
"But once they are faced with the press or their manager,
nobody is prepared to talk. But players and members of UEFA and
FIFA will have to get together and sort it out," he added.

<HEADLINE> Italy's Lazio Sells Vieri to Inter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Italy's Lazio soccer club has sold
Italy striker Christian Vieri to Inter of Milan for 80 billion
lire ( 45 million U.S. Dollars) in one of the most expensive
transfer deals in Italian soccer history.
</P>
<P>
Inter Chairman Massimo Moratti confirmed Tuesday night that
Inter will cede Argentine midfielder Diego Simeone to Lazio as
part of the 80-billion lire (about 44 million dollars) it has
agreed to pay for Vieri.
</P>
<P>
Lazio Chairman Sergio Cragnotti moved quickly to solve his
center-forward problems Tuesday night by contacting Valencia's
Argentine striker Claudio Lopez, Lazio club sources said.
</P>
<P>
Vieri, 25, came to Lazio at the start of last season from
Atletico Madrid, who sold him for 48 billion lire. Despite
suffering injury at the start of the season, by the end he had
tallied 13 goals in Italian league games.
</P>
<P>
He also helped Lazio win the European Cup Winners' Cup and
achieve second place in the Italian league championship.
</P>
<P>
Moratti said next season he would play alongside Brazilian
forward Ronaldo, making the most expensive attacking pair in
Italian soccer.
</P>
<P>
Inter Chairman Massimo Moratti, who resigned in despair at his
team's performance this season, only to recently re-instate
himself waving fresh fistfuls of cash, said that Vieri's fee
includes the price of Argentine mid-fielder Diego Simeone, who
moves to Lazio. Simeone is valued at around 20 billion lire.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some sources cast doubt on the deal Tuesday night
saying Juventus was making a rival bid for Vieri. They said Vieri
had not yet signed.
</P>
<P>
As for Lopez, Lazio sources said the bargaining would start
getting down to brass tacks in the next few hours.
</P>
<P>
Cragnotti is reportedly ready to put up 44 billion lire for the
free-scoring Argentine.

BUENOS AIRES, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Argentine health

poultry and pork meat that were imported by a company last year

<HEADLINE> Asia Pacific on Path to Recovery: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Asian economic crisis is
over and the weighted averaged real growth for the Pacific Rim is
expected to rise to 2.6 percent in 1999 from 1 percent in 1998,
according to a report released here by the Pacific Economic
Cooperation Council (PECC) on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The PECC's eleventh annual Pacific Economic Outlook also
predicted that the economic growth in the region will further
increase to 2.9 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
"The forecasts indicates that 1999 is a recovery year for the
region, with domestic consumption leading the rebound," report
coordinator professor Lawrence Krause of the University of
California at San Diego said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
The weighted average growth of exports is forecast to be 4.6
percent in 1999. "This is almost twice the rate achieved in 1998
and significantly above the growth of real output. Hence, exports
are likely to again provide a stimulus to growth," the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the report said that only Korea is expected to
have a "V" shaped recovery while most of the other economies that
either contracted or had slow growth in 1998 will have only a
modest pickup in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The weighted average consumer price index (CPI) for 1999 is
forecast to drop almost in half to 2.2 percent provided that
exchange rate stability will be maintained," the report said. The
CPI for the region ticked up to 3.8 percent in 1998 from 3.4
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore-based PECC, founded in 1980, is a nongovernmental
organization devoted to promoting economic cooperation in the
Pacific Rim.
</P>
<P>
It now comprises 23 Member Committees representing the
economies of Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia,
Hong Kong (China), Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New
Zealand, Peru, Philippines, Russia, Singapore, Chinese Taipei,
Thailand, United States, and Vietnam as well as Pacific Island
Nations and Associate Member France (Pacific Territories).

<HEADLINE> Romania Gets 108-Million-Dollar Loan From Foreign Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Romanian National Bank completed
negotiations with foreign banks operating in the country, over a
short-term loan of 108 million U.S. dollars, the central bank
announced Tuesday in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The loan is granted for one year, with a grace period of
another one year, at a annual interest rate of 9.65 percent.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between the central bank and 14 foreign banks
operating in Romanian market started several months ago. The loan
is part of the program of Romanian authorities to collect foreign
currency, in order to finance the external debt and complete
foreign currency resources.
</P>
<P>
The foreign debt's service for 1999 stands at 2.8 billion U.S.
dollars, the highest in the last five years. Foreign currency
reserves of the central bank stood at about one billion U.S.
dollars by the end of May, while the gold reserves were estimated
at 0.9 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Economic slump in recent years has seriously weakened Romania's
credibility in the world financial market and affected the
country's fund-raising ability, Romanian authorities are expecting
that with loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund and
World Bank approved, the foreign market will be more favouring to
Romania and the interest in Romanian bonds will increase.
</P>
<P>
Romania is trying to get short-term loans of about 600 million
U.S. dollars this year from the world's major commercial banks.

<HEADLINE> Impact of PCs, Internet to Be Explored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 8 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. university announced
Tuesday the first comprehensive study ever conducted of the
sweeping changes produced by the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The study will focus on how computers, information technology
and their users are shaping society and how the Internet is
changing the world, said the University of California, Los Angeles
(UCLA) in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Understanding how people use the Internet is even more
important than understanding the impact of television," said the
statement. "While television is primarily about our leisure time,
the Internet is already transforming work, school and play.
Virtually every business, political and social activity will be
affected by the Internet, and most activities will be dramatically
transformed."
</P>
<P>
Funded by America Online, Microsoft and other companies, the
study will survey computer users as well as non-users in the
United States, Singapore and Italy, and will expand to additional
15 countries in Europe, Asia, Latin America and Africa over the
next three to five years. The UCLA Center for Communication Policy
which has conceived the study will conduct the U.S. survey and
coordinate the international partner projects.
</P>
<P>
Results of the first study will be released late this year. As
part of the release of the second study in 2000, the university
will host an international conference for policymakers and
industry leaders.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON June 8 (Xinhua) - London and Paris markets closed higher
Tuesday, however they were knocked off their session highs when
Wall Street fell 0.6 percent in early trade.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index closed at 6431.5, up just 19.5 points.
The modest 0.3 percent gain was the seventh straight upward
movement for the index.
</P>
<P>
Telecom and drug stocks contributed much of the rise. Vodafone
was up 1.25 percent of strong annual results and Glaxo rose 3.6
percent on bargain hunting and a recommendation from brokers
Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
France's CAC 40 endured a similarly uneventful session, but did
at least manage to finish in the black. A tiny 3 point gain left
the index at 4407.58.
</P>
<P>
The focus was on Vivendi's purchase of Pathe as a back-door
French entry into Rupert Murdoch's BSKyB, which rose 3.3 percent
here.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Xetra DAX ended 0.3 percent lower having been up
around 0.4 percent for most of the afternoon before Wall Street
opened weakly and dimmed sentiment.

<HEADLINE> Italian PM Urge EU to Forge Pact on Balkan's Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) and the Balkan
countries must forge a pact to boost the war-rocked Balkan area,
Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema said here Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at which he said Italy could be
"proud" of how it had conducted itself during a crisis that was
drawing to an end, D'Alema voiced agreement with recent proposals
for a sort of postwar reconstruction pact advanced by European
Commission-designate Romano Prodi.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema stressed that the Serb people had paid a "very high
price" in the war and "we have to help them."
</P>
<P>
On the prospects of swift moves to peace now that the G-8 has
drafted a United Nations Security Council Resolution and there are
prospects of military sides resuming logistical talks on a
pull-out of Serbian troops, D'Alema said it was "reasonable" to
think that the "various phases would take place simultaneously,"
allowing the bombing to stop.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Fall Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street Stocks fell sharply
Tuesday as fears for higher interest rates spread among investors.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 143.74 at
10,765.64, trimming the total gain of 331.49 points in the past
three consecutive sessions.
</P>
<P>
The market sank lower after William Poole, president of the
Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis said that he believed inflation
has returned to the economy. The remarks tumbled bond prices,
pushing the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond to 6 percent, the
level at which bonds are perceived as a favorable alternative to
stocks.
</P>
<P>
The federal Reserve warned last month that it would raise
interest rates to cool off the economy if inflation is building up
in the economy. But in recent days, new economic data suggested
the nation's unprecedented growth may be continuing without rising
inflation, pushing the stocks higher as investors eased concerns
about inflation and higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index was led down by Procter &AMP; Gamble and DuPont.
Major airline stocks fell after several carriers cut ticket prices
by as much as 25 percent for off-peak summer travel and shares of
the nation's biggest computer makers, including IBM, were also
held down.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index fell 17.19 at 1,317.33 and the technology heavy Nasdaq
index fell 49.71 at 2.474.50.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index fell 6.17 at 630.77 and the American
Stock Exchange index fell 5.23 at 772.92. The Russell 2000 index
of smaller companies fell 3.13 at 443.76.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-5 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,826 up, 1,147 down and 605
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 680.63 million shares from 653.39
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Pipe Bombs Found in N. Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC)
found 14 pipe bombs on Tuesday in a raid on a loyalist housing
estate in Lurgan, Co Armagh, southwest of Northern Ireland, police
said.
</P>
<P>
One man was later arrested in connection with the pipe bombs
and explosives which were discovered in a communal clothes-drying
area.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two families had to be evacuated as Army bomb disposal
experts were called to the Mourneview housing estate.
</P>
<P>
The discovery follows several other recent sectarian pipe bomb
incidents.
</P>
<P>
A Catholic school in Ballymena had to be evacuated on Monday
after the discovery of a similar bomb by canteen staff.
</P>
<P>
An RUC officer at the scene described the incident as an attack
on the entire Catholic community of Ballymena.
</P>
<P>
In separate incidents over a four-day period, eight pipe bomb
attacks on Catholic homes have been reported.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's find will provide fresh evidence for Northern Ireland
Secretary Mo Mowlam as she reassesses the status of the loyalist
ceasefire, particularly the cessation by the Loyalist Volunteer
Force.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sees Signs of Serb Withdrawal from Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 8 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon said Tuesday that
U.S. intelligence has detected signs that Serb forces in Kosovo
are making preparations to withdraw from the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
"There are a number of indications that the Serbs plan to
withdraw," Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon told reporters during
a briefing.
</P>
<P>
The signs include the mobilization of Serb vehicles in Kosovo
that would be used to transport soldiers out, Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
"We've seen, also, signs that they are mobilizing vehicles and
other means to transport people out, but we have not yet seen
signs that Serb troops or special police forces or paramilitaries
are moving out, but we have certainly seen preparations for moving
out," Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed that no withdrawals have begun and that no
troops were assembling for withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
"We are just beginning to see signs of preparations for
withdrawal. We have not yet seen any withdrawal," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that once the military officials from both side reach
agreement on the withdrawal and there are some signs that the Serb
troops are withdrawing, NATO will decide to stop the bombing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the spokesman said that some 1,900 Marines from the
26th Marine Expeditionary Unit now aboard ships in the Aegean Sea
would serve as the vanguard of U.S. peacekeepers for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Bacon said, the Army would send 1,700 soldiers,
including an aviation unit to include at least eight Apache attack
helicopters.

<HEADLINE> Italy Aims at Balkan Economic Reconstruction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 8 (Xinhua) -- Italy plans to follow up its
"particularly energetic" pursuit of a high-profile role in the
Kosovo crisis by strengthening its economic and social relations
in the Balkans, Italian Foreign Trade Minister Piero Fassino said
in Italian south city of Bari Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Opening "Adriatic Antenna", a special office here to channel
these efforts, Fassino pointed out that the commitment required
for reconstruction in Kosovo would be big.
</P>
<P>
"It's a big commitment, a big effort, a big investment and, of
course, a big chance," he added in reference to the major
financial, technological and other resources that the EU expects
to pour into the Balkan region to stabilize it politically after
the war.
</P>
<P>
Adriatic Antenna is at the Italian Foreign Trade Institute's
(ICE) office in Bari, and, according to institute's general
manager, Gioacchino Gabbuti, a twin office to be called
"Mediterranean Antenna" will be created in Naples.
</P>
<P>
According to ICE officials, the aim in Bari will be to support
Italian businesses, especially small and medium ones, in their
dealings with the Balkans area.
</P>
<P>
"The small and medium companies of the Italian south must
understand the need for association," he said, saying that the two
offices would supply the tools for approaching their target
markets, while making those markets aware of what the Italian
south can offer.
</P>
<P>
Gabbuti said Italian southern businesses must concentrate on
quality to win the new markets, as well as looking at the longer
term and more solid prospects.
