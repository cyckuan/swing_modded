<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Al Martin hit a two-run homer and Woody
Williams pitched a strong 7 1-3 innings and drove in a run to lead
the San Diego Padres to a 5-3 win Saturday night over the Houston
Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Martin gave the Padres a 2-1 lead with a two-run shot to center
off Jose Lima (1-2) in San Diego's four-run third inning. Williams
drew a walk on four pitches to precede Martin's at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Damien Jackson followed with a solo home run, and San Diego
added another run on two-out infield singles by Phil Nevin and Eric
Owens and Bret Boone's RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Williams (2-1), who gave up four homers in his last start,
allowed two runs on five hits. Williams also added an RBI double in
the sixth inning to put the Padres ahead 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   Williams left in the eighth after giving up a leadoff single to
Tony Eusebio and making a throwing error on a ground ball by
pinch-hitter Billy Spiers. Reliever Carlos Almanzar came on to
strike out Craig Biggio and get Roger Cedeno on a groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Hoffman pitched the ninth, allowing an RBI double by Ken
Caminiti, for his second save.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell, who hit a grand slam Friday night, had a solo home
run off Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Lima, a 21-game winner last season, gave up five runs on nine
hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros took a 1-0 lead in the second when Richard Hidalgo
led off with a walk, stole second and scored on Tony Eusebio's
single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Houston's Moises Alou was scratched from the starting
lineup. Alou left Friday's game in the sixth inning with a tight
right calf. ... Padres CF Ruben Rivera was placed on the 15-day
disabled list, retroactive to April 12, with tendinitis in his left
wrist. Rivera, the eighth Padre to be placed on the DL, was
replaced by OF Mike Darr, who was recalled from Triple A Las Vegas.
... San Diego defeated Houston for just the second time in 11
games. ... Caminiti played for the first time since straining his
left hamstring Sunday. Caminiti, making his first appearance
against the Padres since signing with Houston after the 1998
season, appeared to still be hampered by the injury. With runners
at first and second in the first inning, Caminiti hit a slow
chopper to 2B Bret Boone, who flipped the ball to SS Damien
Jackson. Despite holding onto the ball as he jumped to avoid the
hard-sliding Jeff Bagwell, Jackson landed on his feet and still
threw out Caminiti, who appeared to be running at half speed. ...
San Diego RF Tony Gwynn (sore left knee) sat out his fifth straight
game.

<HEADLINE> Galaxy 2, Burn 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Paul Caligiuri and Clint Mathis scored
goals as the Los Angeles Galaxy beat the Dallas Burn 2-1 on
Saturday night to remain undefeated in Major League Soccer play.
</P>
<P>
   Caligiuri outmaneuvered Dallas midfielder Chad Deering to
deflect Mauricio Cienfuegos' free kick past goalkeeper Matt Jordan
in the 17th minute. It was the defender's first goal since April
24, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Caligiuri got the start, his first since the season opener March
20, because Ezra Hendrickson missed the match to play for St.
Vincent &AMP; the Grenadines in a World Cup qualifier against St.
Kitts.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis volleyed in Cobi Jones' cross in the 67th minute for his
third goal of the season as Los Angeles improved to 3-0-2. It
remained one point ahead of Kansas City (3-0-1), the only other
undefeated team in the Western Division.
</P>
<P>
   Ariel Graziani scored for Dallas (3-2) in the 83rd minute. The
scoring sequence began with Deering's corner kick, which Jason
Kreis headed downward. Galaxy defender Robin Fraser failed to clear
the ball away. Eric Dade and Oscar Pareja both took pokes at the
ball, with Graziani putting it past goalkeeper Kevin Hartman for
his fourth goal.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis apparently scored a second goal, but referee Richard
Heron ruled the three minutes of stoppage time had been completed.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles led 13-12 in shots with both teams taking five shots
on goal before 16,244 at the Rose Bowl. Hartman made four saves and
Jordan three.

Elian's Father Called a Traitor

<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Demonstrators in Little Havana called Elian Gonzalez's father a
traitor and a coward on Saturday while Juan Miguel Gonzalez, in an interview
with CBS, denied accusations he was abusive and said he was being falsely
characterized. The protesters' chants came a day after affidavits filed by the
boy's Miami relatives alleged the father abused his ex-wife and 6-year-old son.
The Justice Department has said it has found no evidence that the father was
abusive. ''They are lies, totally,'' Juan Miguel Gonzalez told CBS' 60 Minutes

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Anti-globalization protesters swarmed through the heart of
the capital late Saturday and came face to face with lines of helmeted police in
a tense show of will sparked by animosity toward international lending
institutions. Police estimated 600 people were arrested for parading without a
permit, and similar charges, and led peacefully to waiting buses. Police pulled
the fake red nose off one protester made up as a clown as he filed into the bus.
Riot-ready police made some 50 blocks off-limits around the World Bank
headquarters, barring everyone from getting past metal barriers.

   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- A farmer was shot and killed and four others were
abducted Saturday by squatters occupying white-owned land, farmers said Sunday,
a killing that could deepen the crisis over Zimbabwe's tense land standoff.
David Stevens was abducted from his occupied property near Macheke, 75 miles
east of Harare, and driven into the bush where he was shot dead, said Commercial
Farmers Union officials. Four of Stevens' neighbors who went to his assistance
after he was confronted by squatters Saturday were abducted and their
whereabouts were not immediately known, the union said.

Congo Blast Rescue Mission Continues

<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) -- Red Cross workers desperately searched for survivors
Saturday, a day after a mysterious chain of explosions at a hangar at Kinshasa's
international airport reportedly killed between 40 and 50 people. Official radio
put the death toll at 10, but reports from Belgium said between 40 and 50 people
had been killed -- including victims hit by debris up to several miles away. The
death toll could rise much higher, with customs officials saying more than 100
people could still be trapped in the hangar. Explanations of what caused the
blasts Friday at Kinshasa's N'Djili international airport ranged from a short
circuit to a soldier's dropping ammunition while unloading a plane full of
weapons.

<HEADLINE> Report: 737 Rudder Controls Examined  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Federal Aviation Administration engineering
board will recommend redesign of the Boeing 737 rudder control
systems, The Washington Post reported.
</P>
<P>
   Citing government and aviation industry officials, the Post
reported in Sunday's editions that the recommendation will be made
in response to tests that indicated the system could fail in
several ways that, however unlikely, could cause the rudder to move
unexpectedly.
</P>
<P>
   It said one previously unsuspected failure could involve a small
buildup of ice in one control link.
</P>
<P>
   The Post said both the FAA and Boeing Co. stressed that the
possible failures are so unlikely that no immediate mechanical
fixes are necessary but that, pending redesign or modification of
the rudder, they are following the board's suggestion to come up
with new pilot emergency procedures, new mechanical inspections and
new training for pilots and mechanics to alert them to the early
signs of rudder problems.
</P>
<P>
   The paper noted that the 737 is the most numerous jetliner in
commercial service, with 3,630 built so far, and that they have
compiled one of the best safety records in aviation after 99.7
million flight hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really haven't found anything that would cause us to do any
remedial action,'' Thomas McSweeny, the FAA associate administrator
for regulation and certification, told the Post. ''We don't want to
push the science (and) create unintended consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Erickson, the agency's director of aircraft
certification service, told the paper the FAA is working closely
with Boeing on new emergency procedures and that Boeing is already
working on a rudder redesign.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing spokesman Craig Martin said the company was cooperating
with the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   ''We provided an airplane for them to use for flight testing, a
rudder-test rig. We've been very supportive of their activities,''
Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there are modifications that are appropriate ... then
Boeing and the FAA and our customers will work together to do what
needs to be done,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Nets To Fire Coaches, GM  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The owners of the New Jersey Nets have
decided to fire head coach Don Casey, general manager John Nash and
team president Michael Rowe, the Newark Star-Ledger reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper based its report on discussions with two
YankeeNets owners, who were not named, and a third person familiar
with the team's decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   Principal owner Lewis Katz disputed that a decision had been
reached on Casey or anyone else in the front office, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the owners, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
YankeeNets fear a losing team will hurt the television network they
want to launch next year and eventually use to broadcast Yankees,
Nets and New Jersey Devils games.
</P>
<P>
   They also said the YankeeNets are determined to have a winning
team in place by 2003, the year they open the new arena they're
expected to build in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, who lost 15 of their first 17 games, take a nine-game
losing streak into their final two games of the season Tuesday at
Atlanta and Wednesday at home against Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the second coach the Nets have fired in as many
seasons. John Calipari was let go last season.
</P>
<P>
   Nash, a longtime NBA executive, has been with the Nets since
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Rowe spent eight years as an executive with the Meadowlands
Sports Complex before joining the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   After beginning the season dismally, the Nets climbed to within
two games of the eighth and final spot in the Eastern Conference on
March 12 with an overtime victory over Milwaukee. But plagued by
season-ending knee injuries to Stephon Marbury and Kerry Kittles,
the Nets have lost 12 of their past 14 games to fall out of
contention.
</P>
<P>
   In his first full season as Nets coach, the 62-year-old Casey
has guided the team to a 31-49 record.
</P>
<P>
   A loss in either of their final two games will give the Nets 50
or more losses for the 12th time in their 24-year NBA history.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Gore Appear Together in LA  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT LINDLAW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Al Gore touted Internet access as an antidote
to inner-city woes Saturday before collecting millions of dollars
for Democrats at a star-studded Beverly Hills dinner with President
Clinton -- their first joint appearance in more than four months.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton praised the man who seeks to succeed him as ''the most
qualified person in my lifetime, I believe, to seek this job.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore too showered his boss with compliments and said he wanted
to carry on his legacy. ''As I'm out there running now, the wind at
my back is that people think we're heading in the right
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president attended the opening of the first ''cyber
cafe'' in the South-Central Los Angeles area, praising it as a step
in closing the so-called digital divide.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will help connect the citizens of central Los Angeles with
the worlds of knowledge and discovery and commerce that too often
seem worlds away,'' Gore told hundreds of listeners at a
brainstorming session on revitalizing poor neighborhoods. He was
introduced as ''an honorary black man'' to the crowd, made up
mostly of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you don't as a child gain access to this technology and a
familiarity with working with it, you're going to be less able to
excel at the endeavors that rely on that technology later on,'' he
said. Poor young people are far less likely to have that technology
at home than other children, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was primarily young people surfing the World Wide Web when
Gore visited the Inner-City Cyber Cafe, and he looked over their
shoulders while they did so.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of fun, isn't it?'' Gore asked 9-year-old Cameron
Gardine, who surfed apparently oblivious to the news microphones
dangling over his head.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're not on the Net, if you're not computer-literate,
you're almost non-existent in this society,'' said Lester Gardiner,
manager of the cafe.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore focused on the plight of urban areas Saturday
morning, Clinton was in California's Sequoia National Forest
setting aside 328,000 acres of federal forests containing majestic
giant sequoia trees.
</P>
<P>
   The two men came together later in Beverly Hills for a
Democratic National Committee fund-raiser that netted at least $2.8
million.
</P>
<P>
   Music mogul and Democratic superdonor David Geffen was hosting
the event with DreamWorks SKG co-founders Steven Spielberg and
Jeffrey Katzenberg. Singers Sarah McLachlan and Sheryl Crow
attended, as did Jay Leno actors Kevin Spacey, Whoopi Goldberg,
Jimmy Smits, Kim Delaney, Rene Russo, Edward James Olmos and
Antonio Banderas.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians and the stars mingled on the balcony of
Greystone Mansion, a gothic castle overlooking downtown Los Angeles
and, for a night, a knot of protesters. It is reputed to be the
largest home ever built in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Gore used a Hollywood analogy as he urged the donors to stay the
political course. Handing the White House to Republicans would be
akin to entertainment industry executives choosing the team that
made the box office disaster ''Howard the Duck'' over the one that
made the multi-Oscar-winning ''American Beauty,'' the vice
president said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton deadpanned that Gore's comments had highlighted a rift
between them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I loved 'American Beauty.' I love Kevin Spacey. But I actually
liked 'Howard the Duck,''' he said, drawing laughs from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The president gave Gore credit for a litany of administration
achievements, including a new nuclear arms reduction pact,
cleaner-burning vehicles, smaller federal government and a
wide-scale wiring of schools to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''Things could be a lot better, but only if we build on the
platform that we are standing on now,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson said,
''Once again, tonight Bill Clinton and Al Gore will stage a reprise
of their Hollywood dinner act, putting their hands into the pockets
of those who manufacture the movies, music videos and compact discs
that twist our children's minds, coarsen their conversation, and
darken their thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time Clinton and Gore appeared together in public was
Dec. 9, when they attended a firefighters' memorial in
Massachusetts and then a DNC fund-raiser in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   One night earlier, the DNC fund-raiser Gore headlined near San
Jose raised $2.6 million, shattering the DNC's previous Silicon
Valley record of $1.5 million. At the same event, Gore renewed his
call for a ban on unlimited ''soft money'' -- the very kind of money
he was raising Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he was untroubled by the stock market's plunge on
Friday. Many political analysts believe a downturn in the economy
could damage his White House campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''Markets go up and markets go down,'' Gore said. ''You've got
to keep focus on the fundamentals, and the fundamentals of our
economy are sound; we will continue to do well over time as long as
we keep our eyes on the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore made his remarks as he was touring the Internet cafe, when
a reporter shouted a question to him.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, it appeared the event might become a full-blown
news conference, which Gore has not conducted in nearly two months.
Republicans dispatched a man in a duck suit to the Saturday morning
event to highlight that point.
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as the vice president concluded his remarks on the
stock market, a Gore aide hastily ushered the news media out of the
cafe.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spent much of Saturday taping TV commercials and reviewing
reports on the Democratic National Convention, to be held here this
August.

<P>
   The protesters' chants came a day after affidavits filed by the
boy's Miami relatives alleged the father abused his ex-wife and
6-year-old son. The Justice Department has said it has found no
evidence that the father was abusive.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are lies, totally,'' Juan Miguel Gonzalez told CBS' 60
Minutes in an interview to be aired Sunday. ''They have tried in
every way to set me as a bad father, as a bad husband.''
</P>
<P>
   The 4{-month custody struggle was in the hands of the federal
appeals court in Atlanta, which issued a temporary injunction
Thursday blocking Elian from leaving the country. The Justice
Department also agreed that day to hold off on reuniting Elian with
his father for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   The government wants the appeals court to suspend the injunction
and order the 6-year-old's great-uncle to hand him over. The
relatives want the court to let them meet with Elian's father
without being required to let Elian go.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department also pointedly reminded the great-uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez, that he lost legal custody of Elian on Thursday
when he defied the government's demand that he take the boy to the
airport for a flight to Washington. Elian's father has been waiting
there since April 6.
</P>
<P>
   A Newsweek poll released Saturday found that a majority of
Americans now felt the family was not cooperating enough with
government and court efforts to resolve the case. A majority also
disapproved of the Clinton administration's handling of the case
</P>
<P>
   Both disapproval numbers were up from a week earlier. But the
same amount -- 53 percent -- thought Elian should be returned to his
father in Cuba. The poll was conducted among 752 adults on April
13-14 and the results have a 4 percentage point error margin.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, President Clinton, speaking in the Sequoia
National Forest in California, said: ''We have to let the court
cases be decided, but I think the main thing is I hope all the
people who came to the United States because we have freedom and
rule of law will observe the rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after Clinton's comments, a lawyer for the family
stepped outside the home and told the crowd of 400 that the family
would not try to stop the government from taking the boy, but it
would not help.
</P>
<P>
   ''The family respects the rule of law. The family recognizes and
accepts the legal right of the INS to pick up Elian,'' said Manny
Diaz. ''The door will be open. ... The family will not interfere.
The family will not resist.''
</P>
<P>
   Early Sunday, one demonstrator exhorted others to begin bringing
their own video cameras to record what happens when the government
moves in. Bienvenido Comas, 27, of Miami, said protest organizers
fear that if any violence erupts, it would be blamed on them.
</P>
<P>
   ''We fear there could be another Waco,'' he said. ''The threat
is there, and we have to take precautions.''
</P>
<P>
   While there was no indication Saturday of precisely when the
government would seek to reunite Elian with his father, many
protesters in Little Havana said they feared the moment would come
Monday -- the anniversary of the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion.
</P>
<P>
   On April 17, 1961, a force of CIA-trained Cuban exiles tried to
invade Cuba and overthrow the government of Fidel Castro. Cuban
forces easily repelled the invasion at the swampy, mosquito-ridden
inlet on the country's southern coast, killing 200 rebels and
capturing almost 1,200.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba's victory became the defining moment for Miami's Cuban
exiles, who accused President John F. Kennedy of betraying them by
failing to back up the invasion force with aerial cover.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important that they not win this one,'' said Maria
Miller, who said her brother fought in the invasion.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the day, amid shouts of coward and traitor, the crowd
began chanting: ''Elian shouldn't leave. The one who should leave
is his father.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been in Miami since he was rescued by fishermen who
found him clinging to an inner tube in the Florida Straits on
Thanksgiving. His mother and 10 other people fleeing Cuba drowned
when their boat sank.
</P>
<P>
   His Miami relatives have cared for him since then and have been
fighting in court for an asylum hearing. The Clinton administration
has ordered Elian be reunited with his father, saying only he can
speak for the boy on immigration matters. The relatives are
appealing a federal judge's ruling that upheld the government's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for Elian's father, Gregory Craig, on Saturday
harshly criticized repeated the allegations of abuse. He called the
tactic a desperate effort to influence the court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Elian's hometown of Cardenas, Cuba, have repeatedly
told The Associated Press that Elian's parents, though divorced,
had a very good relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Craig also noted that in March, Elian's cousin Marisleysis
called Juan Miguel Gonzalez ''a loving and good father'' and said
she was looking forward to seeing Elian's face when they were
reunited.

<HEADLINE> Nuggets 115, Clippers 114, OT  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Nick Van Exel scored a career-high 44 points
and Antonio McDyess scored four of his 30 points in the final 1:15
of overtime as the Denver Nuggets handed the Los Angeles Clippers
their 16th straight loss, 115-114 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The defeat was the Clippers' 66th -- mathematically clinching the
NBA's worst record for the fourth time in the last 14 years -- and
officially stamping them as the second-worst Clippers team of all
time. The 1986-87 edition lost 70 games, and the franchise lost 65
games five other times.
</P>
<P>
   With leading scorer Maurice Taylor missing his third consecutive
game with a sore left ankle, the Clippers lost for the 44th time in
48 games and the ninth straight time at Staples Center. It is the
longest home losing streak since the Buffalo Braves franchise moved
to San Diego in 1978 and changed its name to the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Anderson led Los Angeles with 31 points and Tyron Nesby
had 25.
</P>
<P>
   McDyess also had a career-high 21 rebounds for Denver, giving
him his first 20-20 game in the NBA. The Nuggets have only three
victories in their last 47 road games against Pacific Division
teams -- all of them against the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   The extra five-minute period ended a string of 87 consecutive
games without overtime for the Clippers, who were the only team in
the league that hadn't played an overtime game this season.
</P>
<P>
   Van Exel finished with eight assists to increase his season
total to 695 and break Michael Adams' single-season club record by
two.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers took their last lead, 108-107, on a 3-pointer by
Anderson with 1:28 left in overtime. The Nuggets remained the lead
for good 13 seconds later on McDyess' 16-footer.
</P>
<P>
   McDyess then converted a missed layup by Vasn Exel into a dunk,
and Van Exel's two free throws extended the margin to 113-108 with
25 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers got a 3-pointer from Nesby and two free throws from
Anderson to trim the deficit to a point with 10 seconds left. Van
Exel then made his first free throw but missed the second, giving
Los Angeles another chance.
</P>
<P>
   McDyess fouled rookie Lamar Odom on his way to the basket with
five-tenths of a second left. Odom -- who missed a game-winning
17-foot jumper at the end of regulation -- sank the first free
throw. But his second bounced off the rim.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The only NBA teams to have lost more games in a season than
the 1986-87 Clippers were the 1997-98 Nuggets (71), the 1992-93
Dallas Mavericks (71) and the 1972-73 Philadelphia 76ers (73). ...
McDyess, whom the Clippers drafted in June 1995 and immediately
traded to Denver, is the Nuggets' leading scorer with a 19-point
average. The last time anyone played at least 75 games for the
Clippers and averaged more than 19 points was 1993-94, when Ron
Harper averaged 20.1. ... In the 74 games Clippers rookie Lamar
Odom has played, only once has he gone an entire contest without
committing a turnover. It was the second game of the season, when
he played 45 flawless minutes at Portland in a 121-98 loss.

<HEADLINE> Jones Wins Sydney Triathlon  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN PYE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- World champion Michellie Jones won a
drama-packed Sydney Triathlon over the Olympic 2000 course in
Sydney Harbour on Sunday to guarantee a spot in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's race, longshot Peter Robertson completed an
Australian double, blitzing the field by almost 30 seconds despite
running backward and swapping high fives with fans in the final
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old Robertson, ranked No. 112 in the world,
dominated on the final leg to finish in one hour, 49 minutes and
32.02 seconds and secure his place in the Sept. 17 men's Olympic
triathlon.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a dream come true,'' he said. ''We all had to come out
here and win today if we wanted to get an automatic start at the
Olympics ... that's what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany's Stefan Vuckovic placed second in 1:49:58.22 and
Ukrainian Volodymyr Polikarpenko was third ahead of Eric van der
Lindin of the Netherlands and Ben Bright of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter Kemper was the first U.S. finisher, placing 11th in
1:50:43.32. His Olympic aspirations hinge on where the U.S. places
in the international standings, which determines the number of
places for individuals at the Games.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. women are No. 2 in the world behind Australia and have
three spots at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   After leading the women's race, top-ranked American Barbara
Lindquist crashed on the cycle leg but had recovered to challenge
for the lead before being crippled by lactic acid in the final
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   More than three minutes after Jones crossed to win in
2:02:30.79, Lindquist crawled across the finish line in 12th place.
</P>
<P>
   Lindquist led after the 1,500-meter swim leg and was battling
for No. 1 with her Australian training partner Nicole Hackett
before both crashed in slippery conditions as rain tumbled down
during the 40-kilometer cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who was in second place going into the 10-kilometer run,
finished almost 10 seconds clear of Brigitte McMahon, who placed
second just ahead of her Swiss compatriot, Magali Messmer, in
third.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just so emotional, to qualify for the Olympics ... to do
it on home soil is just so sweet,'' said the 30-year-old world No.
1.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very slick on a couple of sections, girls were just
going down,'' she said of the rain-marred cycle leg. ''I just tried
to stay relaxed -- I was happy to get off my bike and start running.
</P>
<P>
   ''We all wanted to get across the finish line in one piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Gutierrez placed seventh and, as the first American
across the line, secured a spot on the U.S. Olympic team for the
Sept. 16 women's triathlon.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez completed the race in 2:04:46.23, edging compatriot
Susan Bartholomew into eighth place.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't believe it, I just didn't expect to qualify in Sydney
-- I thought I'd go OK here and have to qualify (for the Olympics)
in Dallas next month,'' Gutierrez said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just feel for Barb (Lindquist)-- she's so brave. I almost hit
her when she crashed, I don't know how I made it through (the
crash).''
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez vowed to help Lindquist qualify for the Olympics at
the U.S. selection trials in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Running with a blood-red graze on her left thigh, Lindquist was
still in contention until the last kilometer of the run, when she
slipped back a half dozen places.

permit, and similar charges, and led peacefully to waiting buses. Police pulled
the fake red nose off one protester made up as a clown as he filed into the bus.
Riot-ready police made some 50 blocks off-limits around the World Bank

Congo Blast Rescue Mission Continues

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) -- Red Cross workers desperately searched for survivors
Saturday, a day after a mysterious chain of explosions at a hangar at Kinshasa's
international airport reportedly killed between 40 and 50 people. Official radio
put the death toll at 10, but reports from Belgium said between 40 and 50 people
had been killed -- including victims hit by debris up to several miles away. The
death toll could rise much higher, with customs officials saying more than 100
people could still be trapped in the hangar. Explanations of what caused the
blasts Friday at Kinshasa's N'Djili international airport ranged from a short
circuit to a soldier's dropping ammunition while unloading a plane full of
weapons.

<HEADLINE> Two Boats Sink in Kentucky  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Several people were rescued after two
boats capsized and sank on the Ohio River and several other boats
collided near the shoreline Saturday night following a fireworks
show, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   One person was hospitalized in critical condition and at least
four others were treated for hypothermia, according to Coast Guard
telecommunications specialist James Potter.
</P>
<P>
   The boats capsized in separate incidents within a half-hour
after the conclusion of Thunder Over Louisville, an annual
fireworks show kicking off the Kentucky Derby Festival, said Chief
Warrant Officer Bill Mackenzie.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the estimated 600,000 spectators watched the event from
hundreds of boats anchored in the river.
</P>
<P>
   Six people on one boat were treated for minor injuries, Potter
said. Five people on a second boat also were rescued. One was taken
to University of Louisville Hospital and listed in critical
condition, while the other four were treated for hypothermia on the
shore, said Officer Robert Biven, a Jefferson County police
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Several other boats collided near the Louisville shoreline. Six
people were pulled from the water and three were taken to the
hospital, Louisville Police Department spokesman Rodney Estes said.
None of their injuries were serious, he said.

<HEADLINE> 600 World Bank Protesters Arrested  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Riot-ready police arrested hundreds of
demonstrators as anti-globalization protesters gathered in the
nation's capital for a mass march against international financial
policy.
</P>
<P>
   All day Saturday, busloads of protesters poured into the city
for a series of demonstrations that were to peak Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Police estimated 600 people were arrested for parading without a
permit, and similar charges, and led peacefully to waiting buses.
Helmet-wearing officers made some 50 blocks off-limits around the
World Bank headquarters, barring everyone from getting past metal
barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Arrests which began early in the day when police raided
protesters' headquarters continued into the into the cool, damp
night -- weather reminiscent of Seattle, scene last December of
similar demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Charles Ramsey said those arrested would be charged
with ''parading without a permit and refusal to disperse, among
other things.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who provide identification will be fined $50, he said.
Those who don't will be fined $300.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a right to be here and we also have a right to protest
and we also have a right to walk away,'' said protester Larry
Holmes, complaining that police had penned demonstrators in a
barricaded area to arrest them.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters complained that there was no warning before the
arrests began.
</P>
<P>
   ''No matter how many of us are arrested today, we are resolved
to carry our message to the streets tomorrow,'' said Ilyse Hogue of
the Mobilization for Global Justice, the key organizer of the
weekend demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators took over an abandoned row house in a poor part of
the city as neighbors shouted at police to do something, and
another group stripped down to their underwear in an anti-sweatshop
demonstration in trendy Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   But the largest group of protesters congregated as close as they
could get to the World Bank and its sister lending institution, the
International Monetary Fund, upset that police had shut down their
protest headquarters early in the day, declaring it to be unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   In a light rain, with police sirens sounding almost constantly
downtown, tourists who normally stroll to the gates of the White
House to snap pictures were held behind barriers across the street.
</P>
<P>
   A protest outside a Gap clothing store in Georgetown turned into
an impromptu striptease when police took a man wearing a grass
skirt with nothing underneath into custody and made him put on
underwear.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted a dozen or so other men and women in the crowd of
200 to strip down to their skivvies.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters accuse the World Bank and IMF of destroying the
environment with dams and similar projects, allowing sweatshops and
imposing harsh debt-repayment programs.

<HEADLINE> Poor Taxpayers Face More Audits  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM KATES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- It used to be wealthy Americans who had
the most to fear from the Internal Revenue Service. But lately, the
nation's poorest taxpayers have faced a greater likelihood of being
audited, according to a report released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Though the IRS' overall audit rate last year dropped to just
under 1 percent, the focus has shifted from the rich to the poor,
according to Syracuse University's Transactional Records Access
Clearinghouse, which analyzes government data.
</P>
<P>
   Among taxpayers making $100,000 or more, 1.15 percent were
audited in 1999, down from 1.66 a year earlier, TRAC reported. The
rate for those making $25,000 or less was 1.36 percent, up from
1.14 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, IRS auditors have focused on wealthier taxpayers
because they have more to hide from the government and better
opportunities for hiding it. In the early 1990s, taxpayers with
incomes of $100,000 or more were audited at about five times the
rate of those earning less than $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''The data is accurate because we provided it to them,'' said
IRS spokesman Don Roberts. ''The interpretations, however, may not
be fully reflective of what additional data might show.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in 1988, the IRS was clamping down on tax shelter
cheaters so the audit rate for those with incomes over $100,000
jumped to 11.41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 and 1998, the IRS received additional funding to reduce
noncompliance in the earned income tax credit program, or EITC, a
special tax benefit for low-income Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a reason for more examinations, and it's not because
of their income levels. It is because of items they are claiming on
their returns,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   Often, noncompliance in the EITC program involves confusion and
misunderstanding about the eligibility rules rather than deceit and
criminal intent, said Wayne Thomas, the IRS' deputy chief
operations officer.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the same dependent may be claimed by two different
individuals, requiring the IRS to audit both returns to determine
who is entitled to the credit.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the IRS has stepped up its examinations of
nonfilers, he said. Because their incomes are unknown, the
nonfilers are considered part of the lowest income classification.
</P>
<P>
   If the EITC and nonfiler cases are excluded, the audit rate for
low-income Americans is actually 0.17 percent, Thomas said. When
the same is done in the higher income bracket, the rate is 1.08
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''You see the pattern is pretty much what you would expect. The
rate is about seven or eight times greater for the more wealthy,''
Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   The revised overall audit rate for the more than 122.5 million
individual returns filed in 1999 would be 0.34 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if this is actually a new, kinder IRS. There are
a lot of dynamics involved here,'' said David Burnham, co-director
for TRAC.
</P>
<P>
   TRAC identified the substantial decline in the size of the IRS
staff as a factor in the changing audit practices. After a buildup
during the Reagan administration, years of budget cuts reduced IRS
staffing from a high of 123,198 employees in 1988 to 97,810 last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The more cynical explanation is that the IRS still has enough
significant legal and financial resources left at its disposal that
it is easier to go after a hundred low-income taxpayers that would
just as soon pay the bill than 10 high-income taxpayers with
attorneys,'' said Pete Sepp, a spokesman for the National Taxpayers
Union.
</P>
<P>
   As millions of Americans rush to beat the tax deadline Monday,
they can take consolation in knowing there have been dramatic
declines in the tax agency's three primary enforcement collection
practices: levy, lien and seizure.
</P>
<P>
   After peaking at 3.7 million levies in 1997, IRS agents issued
504,403 levies in 1999 -- an 86 percent drop. Levies are made
against the assets of delinquent taxpayers that are under the
control of a third party, such as bank accounts or wages.
</P>
<P>
   The number of seizures dropped from a yearly average of between
10,000 and 11,000 during the 1990s to only 161 seizures last year,
a 98 percent drop.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in liens was more gradual. Liens, a legal claim
attached to property, peaked at 1.5 million in 1991 and 1992. By
last year, they dropped to 167,867, a fall of 88 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said the plunge in levies and seizures was partly the
result of administrative changes required by the IRS Restructuring
and Reform Act of 1998, changes enacted following intense
Congressional criticism of past IRS collection practices.

<HEADLINE> Injuries Up Among Active Boomers  </HEADLINE>
By IRA DREYFUSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Older but apparently not much wiser, baby
boomers who keep active with exercise and sports are racking up
injuries, federal statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   There was a 33 percent increase in sports-related injuries that
sent adult ages 35 to 54 to hospital emergency rooms from 1991 to
1998, which was the latest year reported in Consumer Product Safety
Commission data.
</P>
<P>
   More than 365,000 injuries from 16 popular sports were treated
in emergency rooms in 1998, CPSC said. The estimate rises to more
than 1 million when the agency includes cases of medically treated
injuries in these sports that were not seen in the ER.
</P>
<P>
   CPSC Chairman Ann Brown doubts things are getting safer. ''We
can predict that over 1 million baby boomers will be injured
playing sports this year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The CPSC, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons and the
American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine have launched a
public education campaign, including brochures and a Web site,
www.boomer-itis.org.
</P>
<P>
   Treating sports injuries suffered by a mega-generation that
represents about 30 percent of the population leads to a huge
medical bill -- more than $18.7 billion in 1998, the CPSC said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the increase in injuries does not necessarily mean
boomers are getting more dangerous. The rise is due primarily to
the growing number of people between 35 and 54, CPSC data said. In
1998, there were 14 million more people in the age range than there
were in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors wish the boomers would wise up, by using protective
equipment more, and giving their aging bodies more time to recover.
</P>
<P>
   The CPSC gives bicycle helmets as an example. Proportionately
more young people than boomers wear helmets, the CPSC said -- 69
percent of under-18-year-olds, compared with 43 percent of boomers.
Apparently as a result, boomers died of head injuries from biking
at almost twice the rate of the younger group.
</P>
<P>
   The largest increase in injuries was in general exercise and
running, CPSC said. In 1991, there were less than 10,000 emergency
room cases among boomers, but by 1998, the number had more than
tripled, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say boomers must learn more caution. ''Our tissues
become somewhat less compliant, and tendons tend to degenerate,''
said Dr. Robert A. Stanton, a 53-year-old orthopedic surgeon
affiliated with Yale Medical School. After 50, people also lose
about 10 percent of their muscle mass every decade, he said.
However, regular exercisers -- those who have been working out for
decades -- may retard the atrophy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even for those who start late, caution can reduce the risk of
overuse injuries while gaining the known benefits of exercise,
which range from weight control to healthier hearts. Boomers have
to give their bodies time to recover -- by, for instance, not
crowding all their exercise into the weekend, Stanton said.
</P>
<P>
   Even some hard-charging boomers realize this.
</P>
<P>
   ''I pay a little more attention to stretching, but there's a lot
of denial of the aging and the arthritis,'' said Mark A. Liszt, 52,
a recreational basketball player and chief executive officer of
Metropolitan Provisions, a commercial food service in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   When he plays basketball with people his age or older, it's a
slower game with more encouragement and appreciation of how the
other players are doing, Liszt said. ''If a guy makes a great move,
you let them go,'' he said. ''You pat them on the butt and say,
'Great shot!'''
</P>
<P>
   But when he plays against younger people, including
30-year-olds, it's a different ball game, Liszt said: ''You try to
play to their level and reflexes.''

<HEADLINE> Latest dispute over gambling leaves A.C. casinos on the sidelines  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Atlantic City's casino industry finds itself
in an odd position in the latest national political dispute over
gambling: on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the debate is over a form of gambling -- betting
on the outcome of sporting events -- offered only in Nevada. And New
Jersey's chance to approve sports betting came and went years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act,
sponsored by New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, banned sports wagering
in the 47 states where it was not then legal.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada got an exemption. So did Oregon, which allows betting on
pro football through a lottery. Delaware got an exemption because
voters approved a 1976 referendum, but the state never adopted
sports betting.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey, meanwhile, was given a one-year window to decide
whether to sanction sports gambling in Atlantic City. Some
lawmakers in Trenton saw in sports betting a chance to close a
deficit in the casino revenue fund, which financed programs for the
elderly and disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation was introduced to permit sports betting only on
professional teams, and only at Atlantic City casinos. Needed in
both houses of the legislature was a three-fifths vote of approval,
which would have set up a statewide referendum on changing the
state constitution to permit sports betting.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of sports betting, including Bradley and Bergen County
Executive Pat Schuber, fought the legislation by forming the New
Jersey Coalition to Ban State-Sponsored Sports Betting.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed the legislation, but it stalled in the
Assembly. Casino proponents made a last-ditch plea to the state
Casino Control Commission, but the state Supreme Court ruled that
the commission did not have the authority to authorize sports
betting.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace Barr, chairman of the Casino Association of New Jersey,
said Atlantic City casinos still would like to offer sports betting
but realize that the chance to do so ''effective died'' when the
Legislature failed to act in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the House at the time of the debate, Sen. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J., urged state lawmakers to approve sports betting
when they had the chance. He later pledged to try to overturn the
1992 federal law that bars new states from approving sports
betting. But there have been no efforts in Congress to overturn the
ban.
</P>
<P>
   To the contrary, Congress is now weighing an effort to tighten
the ban on sports betting by outlawing bets on college sports, even
in Nevada where it currently is legal. On Thursday, the Senate
Commerce Committee endorsed the proposal, advancing the legislation
to the full Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., the chairman of the Commerce
Committee and a leading force behind the legislation, has said
repeatedly that it's time to close the ''Las Vegas loophole'' that
exempted Nevada from the 1992 sports betting ban.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., reminded the committee that
Nevada was not the only state to get the chance to offer sports
betting. New Jersey was given the opportunity but declined, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bryan lost his battle to derail the legislation on
amateur sports betting, leaving him to accuse his colleagues of
''trying to give Nevada the shaft.''

<HEADLINE> Electronic Nose Can Check Ripeness  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS GOSIER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORONO, Maine (AP) -- The rotting bananas in sealed jars in John
Vetelino's lab mark his first step toward developing an
''electronic nose'' he hopes will sniff out fruit and vegetables at
their peak of ripeness.
</P>
<P>
   By zeroing in on a telltale gas of the ripening process,
Vetelino and a team of scientists are working to create an
inexpensive, handheld device that will eliminate the guesswork for
consumers who rely on color and texture, and hope for the best.
</P>
<P>
   A professor of electrical engineering at the University of
Maine, Vetelino has worked on sensors to detect smokestack
pollutants and chemical and biological agents. His new project --
analyzing the gas emissions of bananas -- is clearly intended to
benefit the most scrutinizing buyers of fruit and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Vetelino speaks from experience when he recounts the frustration
of buying fruit, only to be disappointed by that first bite.
</P>
<P>
   ''It'll look completely ripe, but there will be no taste to it
at all. It's just blah,'' he said. ''You pay good dollars, and then
all of a sudden it's like you're biting into some cardboard. I've
gone right back to the supermarket and returned what I've bought.''
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists have focused on gas emissions to measure fruit
quality, but Vetelino says his team is the first to focus solely on
ethylene, a gas that scientists say is universally associated with
ripening fruits and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   The specialists on Vetelino's team include physicists
responsible for creating a metal film that reacts to gases when
electrically charged, and food scientists who know fruits and
vegetables inside and out.
</P>
<P>
   The lab's equipment includes gas chromatographs used to measure
the concentration of ethylene, gas flow controllers used to
regulate the flow of the ethylene, and a sprawling set of vacuum
chambers used to make the metal film.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there are bananas, chosen specifically because
their changing colors allow the ripening process to be followed
visually.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to science to measure ripeness is not entirely new.
</P>
<P>
   Past techniques have ranged from an electronic melon thumper
that records the vibrations to devices that use magnetic resonance
imaging borrowed from medical applications to measure a fruit's
sugar content.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most recent is a handheld device by Cyrano Sciences
of Pasadena, Calif., that resembles the network of receptors inside
the human nose by using 32 sensors to detect the pattern of gases
given off by ripening fruit. The initial cost of about $8,000 makes
it one of the least expensive devices available to food packaging
companies and other industries, the company says.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Maine team hopes to further reduce the cost by
focusing on just one gas, instead of 32, said Al Bushway, a food
scientist who is working with Vetelino's team.
</P>
<P>
   A scientist from Cyrano says the focus on ethylene is not a bad
idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you had to pick one particular chemical, it's not a bad one
to pick,'' said Bruce Hermann, a chemist who directs applications
engineering for Cyrano.
</P>
<P>
   But focusing on just one gas could have limitations, scientists
say.
</P>
<P>
   ''In some fruits, there's a burst of ethylene as it ripens. In
other fruits it goes up and down, so you can't tell what's going
on,'' said James Simon, a Purdue University scientist who has
developed different types of fruit ripeness sensors.
</P>
<P>
   And some in the food products industry are skeptical about the
value of ethylene measurements.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is useful, and it does have some application, as long as
that is not the only piece of the decision,'' said Peter Goulet,
director of produce merchandising for Hannaford Bros., a regional
grocery chain.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, fruit doesn't always have the best taste at the
exact point of peak ripeness, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bushway, the University of Maine food scientist, said ethylene
is still worth measuring, since its concentrations can vary greatly
during the ripening of certain fruits, such as bananas, tomatoes
and apples.
</P>
<P>
   Vetelino, who would like to eventually market his device to
retail consumers, has a larger goal in mind anyway. He wants to
develop an entire class of more discriminating sensors.
</P>
<P>
   ''The 'pie in the sky' is to develop a sensor that would respond
to one gas at the exclusion of all others,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To meet that challenge, Vetelino and his team are charging a
semiconductor film with an electric current that he says is more
likely to react in different ways with different gas molecules.
They are also looking for the right amount of heat and the right
amount of gold and other metals to add to the film to break down
the ethylene molecules so they can react with the electric current.
</P>
<P>
   Finding the combination that gives a consistent reading for
ethylene would open the door to other gas-specific sensors,
Vetelino said.
</P>
<P>
   Those could be used for medical diagnoses or to improve on the
chemical and biological agent sensors used in the Persian Gulf War,
he said. Those sensors were sometimes set off by bug spray.
</P>
<P>
   ''Realistically, it might be a while before we're able to
achieve that,'' Vetelino said, ''but we're hoping this (new)
technology will give us a big quantum step forward.''

<HEADLINE> Lab Tests Stress From Temblors  </HEADLINE>
By TOM GARDNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Surrounded by buckled steel girders and
cracked concrete columns, two powerful machines simulate the
destructive forces of an earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   The research taking place on the campus of the University of
Nevada, Reno is intended to help scientists, architects and
engineers save lives by designing buildings and bridges that are
more resistant to a temblor's fury.
</P>
<P>
   The just-expanded James E. Rogers and Louis Wiener Jr. Large
Scale Structures Laboratory puts Nevada in the forefront of
research into ways to avoid the widespread destruction of a major
quake.
</P>
<P>
   ''Having that capability makes this place a very unique
facility,'' said Ian Buckle, director of the Center for Civil
Engineering Earthquake Research.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we can simulate an earthquake in a laboratory under our
conditions on our time scale, we can make progress much faster,''
said Buckle, who was lured to the university last year from his
post as deputy vice chancellor of research in Auckland, New
Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Nevada is the third most seismically active state in the nation,
behind California and Alaska, according to UNR seismology professor
James N. Brune. But since Nevada's quakes are widely scattered
throughout the vast state, he said, its residents are one-tenth as
likely to experience a temblor as people concentrated in
metropolitan areas such as Los Angeles or the San Francisco Bay
area.
</P>
<P>
   Damage caused by any earthquake depends directly on the type of
soil. In a 1989 California quake centered under a remote peak of
Loma Prieta in the Santa Cruz Mountains, the areas that were built
on fill were much harder hit than those on natural soil and rock.
The quake registered a magnitude 7.1 and took out a span of the San
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge 60 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The state-of-the-art laboratory in Nevada is built on a
3-foot-thick slab of concrete and adheres to the Uniform Building
Code for seismic design used in Nevada and most other Western
states.
</P>
<P>
   Buckle, an expert in seismic engineering design, is confident
''it could survive a large quake nearby.''
</P>
<P>
   Half the size of a football field, the lab uses hydraulic power
to simulate the destructive ground movement of a major quake. Two
14-foot-square tables can shake 100 tons of mock-up bridge or
building sections with a movement of plus or minus 12 inches,
making them among the largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   One experiment is testing different types of bridge columns to
find one which seems least likely to fail in an earthquake. Another
seeks ways to keep girder welds from cracking under stress.
</P>
<P>
   The lab also is conducting highway research for the Nevada
Department of Transportation. And it has a five-year contract with
the California Department of Transportation to determine how to
prevent earthquake damage to bridges around San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The 2,800-foot addition brings the lab's size to 8,400 square
feet, making it the second-largest such lab in the nation behind
one at the University of California at San Diego, which is about
twice as big, Buckle said.
</P>
<P>
   Another addition and a third shake table already are in the
works just eight years after the original building here was
completed.
</P>
<P>
   UNR President Joe Crowley said the lab has elevated the school
into the higher reaches of research that will make it more
appealing to people such as Buckle and to the students -- and
research dollars -- universities must attract.
</P>
<P>
   The shake tables were purchased with Federal Emergency
Management Agency funds, but the $1.5 million expansion to
accommodate the second table was provided by a combination of
state, university and private funds.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, president and chief executive officer of Sunbelt
Communications Corp., which owns eight television stations in the
West and a news-talk radio station in Reno, provided $750,000 to
match the $400,000 from the Legislature and the $350,000 put up by
UNR.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said the lab, which shares the name of his late law
partner and fellow pioneer broadcaster, is ''a very valuable
concept not only to this state but all over the West and the
world.''

<HEADLINE> Move To Save Tree Graffiti  </HEADLINE>
By JOLYN OKIMOTO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. (AP) -- Robert Auza doesn't remember exactly
where or when he sliced his name into the soft white bark of an
aspen tree. He and his cousins were just boys then, exploring the
hills during a lazy summer while his grandfather herded sheep.
</P>
<P>
   The trees remember, though. They've kept a record.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only reason I know they're still out there is people say,
'I saw your name or your grandfather's name,''' said Auza, now a
31-year-old Forest Service firefighter.
</P>
<P>
   Auza's markings are among thousands of bark carvings done by
sheepherders and their families on aspen stands in northern Arizona
over the decades -- some dating back to the 1880s.
</P>
<P>
   And now the U.S. Forest Service is fighting the clock to
document the tree graffiti, ranging from rough self portraits to
churches and nude women, before they are wiped out by old age,
pestilence, fire or vandalism. Some trees in the area have already
exceeded an aspen's typical lifespan of 90 to 120 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are a living record of people who don't necessarily show
up in written history records,'' said Linda Farnsworth, a Forest
Service archaeologist.
</P>
<P>
   The carvings, gray and raised on white bark, document the
changing demographics of sheepherders, part of what had been one of
Arizona's major industries from the late 1800s to mid-1900s. Many
of Flagstaff's early herders were Basque, coming from France and
Spain to work, while carvings indicate that later herders came from
Mexico, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we'll get to all of them, ever,'' she said. ''In
a way, it's sort of a salvage operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1996, Farnsworth and volunteers in an Elder Hostel program
have documented about 2,000 tree carvings. A weeklong program
trains people to sketch and photograph carvings and to log their
location and tree condition, Farnsworth said.
</P>
<P>
   ''By the second or third day they are completely addicted,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   To make the best use of time, the Forest Service is targeting
areas used heavily for recreation, out of fear of vandalism, and
trying to get a geographic sampling of the trees, Farnsworth said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the aspens tower 60 feet to 80 feet, carvings remain at
the level they were done. That is because the trunk grows in
diameter, with most of the growth at the ends of the branches and
at the top, said Jim Rolf, a forest regeneration expert with the
Forest Service. The carvings can leave a tree more vulnerable to
infection, but usually do little harm.
</P>
<P>
   Aspen lack heavy resins of pine trees so they form corky gray
cells to try to heal the scars from carvings, Rolf said. ''Some
people were able to carve really well and it stayed really
legible.''
</P>
<P>
   Auza's grandfather, Frank, was one such carver.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Auza, a Basque from Spain who arrived around 1915, is an
easy name to find among the trees. One carving of his name, dated
July 14, 1927, marks a tree that contains nails, which Farnsworth
said are remnants of tree furniture used by herders.
</P>
<P>
   Other herders went beyond leaving their names. Andres Diez, for
example, left his face -- on several trees.
</P>
<P>
   ''He liked to carve himself, we think,'' Farnsworth said, noting
a profile of a Diez dated 1935. One tree has two faces -- one
apparently a woman wearing a hat -- leaving Farnsworth to wonder if
Diez brought a date to the hills.
</P>
<P>
   Other carvings focus on things herders might have missed in
their often solitary lives, such as the church, wine and women.
</P>
<P>
   ''Long live the church,'' reads one carving, in French, next to
an ornate carving of a church that wraps around one tree.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Etcheberry carved his name, home country of France and a
toast -- with a wine decanter and glass -- on July 21, 1932.
</P>
<P>
   Decades later in 1976, Raul Ornellas of Mexico added a life-size
nude woman to the memory of the trees.
</P>
<P>
   Farnsworth said she used to worry about what the elderly
volunteers would think about the sometimes risque carvings. ''I
kind of thought they might be offended by stuff like this, but I've
never found anyone that is,'' she said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Farnsworth said she and volunteers have become familiar with the
names in certain groves.
</P>
<P>
   ''You say things like, 'Oh yeah, here's Frank,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Auza said he never knew he would be part of history.

<HEADLINE> Tenor Andersen Debuts at Met  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE SILVERMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- To say Danish tenor Stig Andersen held his own
in his Metropolitan Opera debut as Wagner's ''Siegfried'' might
sound like faint praise. In this case, it amounts to a rave.
</P>
<P>
   So remarkable was the singing surrounding Andersen at Saturday's
matinee -- and so grueling is the title role -- that this newcomer
fully earned the standing ovation he and the rest of the cast
received from the sold-out house at the end of the nearly
5{-hour-long performance.
</P>
<P>
   This third installment of Wagner's four-part Ring cycle places
superhuman demands on its youthful superhero. Only a few tenors in
history -- most notably Andersen's legendary countryman Lauritz
Melchior -- have met every test.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen's voice is modest in size and lyric rather than heroic
in scope, with a soft-grained texture that is not ideal for cutting
through Wagner's heaviest orchestrations, especially in an
auditorium as vast as the Met's. That said, it's a surprisingly
sturdy instrument that sounded just as fresh at the end as it did
when the curtain first rose. And he sang every note in the score
rather than barking or merely hinting at some as most tenors
eventually are forced to do.
</P>
<P>
   When Andersen had to summon volume, as for the sword-forging
scene that ends Act 1, he sometimes disappointed. But he excelled
in the opera's many quieter moments of introspection when Siegfried
reflects on his loneliness and hopes of love.
</P>
<P>
   His acting was terrific. There he was bounding restlessly around
the stage in Act 1, pouting, having tantrums -- acting much like a
typical teen-ager. By Act 3, as the maturing hero who has slain the
dragon Fafner and is about to discover his love, Bruennhilde,
Andersen was convincing in both his eagerness and his painful
shyness.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tribute to both his vocal stamina and stage presence that
he wasn't overwhelmed in the closing scene by Jane Eaglen, whose
voice rose effortlessly to every challenge Wagner threw her way.
Bruennhilde's vocal line lies higher in this opera than in the rest
of the Ring, and Eaglen's high C's were as solid as the rock on
which she lies sleeping until Siegfried awakens her with a kiss.
Surely no one has performed the role this thrillingly since Swedish
soprano Birgit Nilsson in her prime.
</P>
<P>
   Until its grand finale, ''Siegfried'' is dominated by male
voices. As the god Wotan -- reduced to traveling the earth in human
form as the Wanderer -- the veteran bass-baritone James Morris
seemed to defy time and the aging process. There were none of the
patches of dryness and unsteadiness that troubled him two weeks ago
in ''Die Walkuere,'' the second Ring opera. His magnificent
dark-hued voice seemed as flexible and potent as when he first sang
the role here over a decade ago, and his interpretation has grown
more psychologically acute, with a weariness and dignity that are
deeply moving.
</P>
<P>
   Tenor Graham Clark was scarcely less astonishing as the
grotesque dwarf Mime, who nurtured the orphan Siegfried, not out of
love, but greed, with plans to use the boy to steal the Nibelungen
treasure and then kill him. Clark's rasping, high-pitched tenor
contrasted perfectly with Andersen's. He remains the perfect
embodiment of the character, trembling in abject cowardice one
moment, cavorting with gleeful malice the next.
</P>
<P>
   There were also important contributions from the rest of the
cast: baritone Ekkehard Wlaschiha as Mime's brother Alberich; bass
Eric Halfvarson as the dragon Fafner; soprano Heidi Grant Murphy as
the Forest Bird; and contralto Birgitta Svenden as the seeress
Erda.
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra under James Levine's direction played the fearsome
score with breathtaking virtuosity, including a flawless horn solo
by Howard T. Howard.
</P>
<P>
   The deliberately old-fashioned, naturalistic production by Otto
Schenck and Guenther Schneider-Siemssen is holding up well, and Gil
Wechsler's lighting of the Act 2 forest scene is particularly
lovely. The props department had a bad day, though. The spear that
Wotan carried onstage at the opening of Act 3 came apart
prematurely. (Siegfried is supposed to break it midway through the
act.) Morris found a moment to move discreetly to the wings, where
he was handed a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen and Eaglen will be back next Saturday afternoon for the
Ring's final episode, ''Goetterdaemmerung,'' which, like
''Siegfried,'' will be broadcast live on radio stations around the
world.

<HEADLINE> Doc: Ritalin Led to Boy's Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- A medical examiner says long-term use of
Ritalin, a drug used to treat hyperactive children, may have led to
a 14-year-old boy's death.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Smith collapsed at his home on March 21 while playing
with a skateboard and was pronounced dead at a hospital a short
time later. Oakland County Medical Examiner Ljubisa Dragovic
concluded that the boy died of a heart attack likely caused by 10
years of taking Ritalin for attention deficit hyperactivity
disorder.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a gradual development,'' Dragovic said Sunday in The
Oakland Press. ''There were changes that occurred in the small
blood vessels that supply the heart muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's family told Dragovic the teen-ager occasionally
complained of chest discomfort and racing heart, signs that
something was wrong, the medical examiner said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a heart condition, which could have been diagnosed
just like that,'' Dragovic said. ''You just don't see this in the
younger population.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dragovic's naming of Ritalin as a suspect in the boy's death
is being questioned by some experts who say the drug has been shown
to be extremely safe. Ritalin is a popular brand name for the
stimulant methylphenidate, believed to increase a child's alertness
by stimulating the central nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph Biederman, professor of psychology at Harvard
University and a longtime researcher of stimulants, said Dragovic's
conclusion was unfounded.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a free country and people can have whatever opinion they
want,'' Biederman said. ''But Ritalin has a long history of safety
unparalleled by any other drug.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardiac side effects to Ritalin are rare and don't include
death, said Dr. David Rosenberg, a child psychiatrist with
Children's Hospital of Michigan in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been reported increases in blood pressure and pulse
that aren't clinically significant,'' Rosenberg said. ''But I would
want to avoid it in someone with an underlying heart condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Biederman, who also is chief of pediatric pharmacology at
Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, said it is not unusual
for people to take Ritalin their entire lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is given to millions of children. I don't know why this boy
died, but we have no known knowledge of people dropping dead on
Ritalin,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dragovic, who said he also is researching allegedly similar
types of deaths in Ritalin users, including one in Ohio and another
in Texas, said he will report his findings as required to the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is something that we have to share with the public and
the professional people, too, that there is a great risk,''
Dragovic said. ''There are millions receiving Ritalin and so few
tests. Statistically it is not significant, but it is for that boy
and his family.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Visit Navajo Community  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS ROBERTS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- At Mesa Elementary School in far
northwest New Mexico, Navajo children line up to use the few
computers connected to the Internet. Their time online must be
short for everyone to get a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Internet's not really available to me,'' said sixth-grader
Altie Altieyazzie.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was scheduled to visit the youngster's
community of Shiprock on Monday as part of his New Markets
Initiative to encourage economic development in depressed areas, a
tour that focuses on the so-called ''digital divide'' that is
leaving minority communities like Altie's behind.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Shiprock hope Clinton's presence will spotlight
conditions on the Navajo reservation that have kept most of its
8,000 residents from participating in the Internet information age.
Poverty and the extremely rural nature of the sprawling reservation
mean many homes don't have telephone connections, let alone
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a lot of needs, on any Native American reservation,
and the Navajo Reservation is the same,'' said sixth-grade teacher
Fannie L. Atcitty. ''We're still behind, which is affecting our
schools, our students.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Mesa Elementary estimate that fewer than half of
the families with children who attend the school have phone lines
to their homes, a problem for emergencies as well as Internet
access.
</P>
<P>
   Altie, 12, said his family has a phone but no computer. ''For
some people it's probably too expensive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The students have access to the school's computers on some days
after classes, but many have long bus rides home and can't stay,
said Principal Glojean Todacheene.
</P>
<P>
   The limited time they get in school on the computers doesn't
allow them to get comfortable enough to be considered computer
literate, Atcitty said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every child should be computer literate,'' she said, ''but
it's not really happening here.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been some progress over the past few months.
</P>
<P>
   Tachyon Inc., a California-based company that provides wireless
Internet service, gave the Lake Valley Navajo School a $30,000
satellite system last week to connect the school's computers to the
Internet. School officials tried accessing the Internet by
telephone line, but the connection was so poor it took as long as
40 minutes to find a Web site. The Bureau of Indian Affairs hopes
to eventually get satellite systems to all remote schools in the
Navajo Nation.
</P>
<P>
   A donation earlier this year from the Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation, started by the founder of Microsoft, created a program
to provide grants for computers and software for American Indian
tribes in New Mexico, Arizona, Colorado and Utah.
</P>
<P>
   A computer that is expected to be delivered to the Navajo
Nation's Hogback chapter in August will be used by everyone from
elementary school students to business people, said Anita Hayes,
community services coordinator for the chapter, about four miles
east of Shiprock.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes said the Internet connection will provide information on
jobs, education and other opportunities to members, and she hopes
Clinton's visit will make it easier to get grants for more
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of reasons to have this access,'' she said,
though not everyone is racing toward the Internet age.
</P>
<P>
   ''Among the elderly, it's foreign to them,'' Hayes said.
''They're not saying too much about it. They're just observing,
watching the children.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plans Monday including speaking at Shiprock Boys/Girls
Club, then joining an evening Webcast at Dine Tribal College in
Shiprock that will involve high school student online at Lake
Valley Navajo School, about 55 miles away.

<HEADLINE> Gore Lukewarm, but Clinton Gushes  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- Al Gore is no Bill Clinton when it
comes to working a crowd and making political testimonials.
</P>
<P>
   Searching for something nice to say about his boss, Gore came up
with this Saturday night:
</P>
<P>
   ''Of all the good things I could say about President Bill
Clinton ... I could tell you about the many, many times when I have
seen him -- especially in the early years -- nearly buckle under the
pressure of this office,'' Gore said. ''But never do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also recalled ''all the criticisms of Bill Clinton that
I've heard'' and concluded that ''the one that rings the most
hollow is that he has pushed small ideas, little proposals. They
just haven't been paying attention.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a pair of strikingly backhanded compliments that caught
attention on a star-studded night in Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   When it came his turn to speak, Clinton took a more effusive
approach about Gore. He said the man who hopes to succeed him as
president is ''the most qualified person in my lifetime to seek
this job.'' The president said Gore's election would validate the
direction of Clinton's own presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Gore came together at a glitzy gathering of
Hollywood stars for a $2.8 million Democratic fundraiser. It was
their first joint appearance in more than four months and it
brought out actors Kevin Spacey, Whoopi Goldberg, Jimmy Smits, Kim
Delaney, Rene Russo, Edward James Olmos and Antonio Banderas.
Singers Sarah McLachlan and Sheryl Crow were there; so was Jay
Leno.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was the leadoff speaker and immediately plunged into a
heavy reminiscence of his disillusionment with politics as a young
man after Vietnam, Watergate and the assassinations of Martin
Luther King and Robert Kennedy. After years as a reporter, he said,
he decided to jump into the political arena to see if he could make
a difference.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president said he and Clinton had faced down special
interests, turned huge budget deficits into big surpluses and
transformed a recession-scarred economy into the strongest boom in
America's history.
</P>
<P>
   Following Gore to the stage, Clinton put the audience in his
pocket with a quick joke.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he had asked Gore if there was anything special he
should say. ''He said, nothing special, just get up there and say,
'Washington, Lincoln, Roosevelt, Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   From his seat, Gore reminded Clinton that he had amended that
remark. ''He said, 'Oh yeah, put Clinton in there somewhere,'' the
president said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has suffered in comparison with Clinton before. The vice
president comes off as stiff in public and wooden in public
speaking, a dramatic contrast with Clinton, who ranks with Ronald
Reagan as a great communicator.
</P>
<P>
   In light-hearted moments, Clinton poked fun at Gore. Earlier
this month, Clinton quipped about how the Constitution prevents
presidents from serving more than two terms and suggested this
political slogan: ''Al Gore -- because there's a 22nd Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Running for president, Gore has found it necessary to separate
himself from Clinton on everything from policy matters -- such as
the Elian Gonzalez case -- to the president's behavior in the Monica
Lewinsky scandal. But with Clinton's popularity still high and his
standing among Democrats undiminished, Gore can't stray too far.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Gore has distanced himself at times, Clinton has never
slapped back at his vice president. Perhaps that's because Clinton
feels that Gore's election would vindicate his own trouble-filled
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ''You will never get a chance in your lifetime to vote for
someone as well qualified again,'' Clinton said. ''You will never
get a chance in your lifetime to ratify a direction and to
accelerate the pace of change that is clearly working.''
</P>
<P>
   Lavishing Gore with praise, Clinton said, ''In the entire
history of the United States, no one who has ever served in that
position has had remotely as much positive impact on America as
vice president as Al Gore has. Not even close.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledged that ''we are friends and I am biased.''

<HEADLINE> State, counties get first annual tobacco settlement payment  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The state, New York City and counties
outside the city will get $441 million Monday under the settlement
with tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   But the checks will be about 12 percent smaller than projected
last year when the payment schedule under the cigarette settlement
was outlined by tobacco companies and government officials.
</P>
<P>
   The reduction is due to a drop in cigarette consumption. One of
the provisions in the settlement insisted upon by tobacco companies
called for payments to be reduced if fewer cigarettes are being
sold.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the payments, the settlement with the tobacco
companies also called for manufacturers to cease certain marketing
techniques and advertising, especially if it is aimed at young
people.
</P>
<P>
   ''We view this as good news that the state is getting less money
because that means fewer cigarettes are being smoked and we assume
fewer kids are starting,'' Blair Horner of the New York Public
Interest Research Group said.
</P>
<P>
   The payment made by tobacco manufacturers on Dec. 31, 1999, was
about 13 percent lower than initially projected, also because of
the drop-off in cigarette consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say a price increase of about 45 cents a pack instituted
by tobacco companies when the settlement was reached with the
states is behind the falloff in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Since the consumption figures are based on national numbers, the
expected reduction in cigarette sales due to New York's near
doubling of its cigarette tax from 56 cents a pack to $1.11 a pack
as of April 1 will have little effect on national sales.
</P>
<P>
   The payments expected Monday will bring to $1.03 billion the
amount paid to governments in New York by tobacco companies in
three installments since Dec. 14, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The money is designed to reimburse taxpayers for what they have
spent over the years on tobacco-related illnesses through
public-funded programs like Medicaid. Localities can use the money
for any purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have now received over $1 billion in just four months, with
billions more to come in the years ahead,'' state Attorney General
Eliot Spitzer said. ''Our long, hard fight against Big Tobacco is
now finally paying off for the citizens of New York.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, New York state is scheduled to receive $25 billion over
the first 25 years of the tobacco settlement, with the state and
local governments sharing the money almost evenly.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco companies will make payments each January and April
through 2003, then a single payment each April for the next 20
years.

<HEADLINE> Report: Dead Harvested for Products  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) -- Donated human remains are processed
into medical products that generate hundreds of millions of dollars
for U.S. companies despite laws barring profit from body parts, The
Orange County Register reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Although grieving families are told that the donations are a
gift of life, the newspaper found that material harvested from the
dead fuels an industry that is expected to have $1 billion in
revenues by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought I was donating to a nonprofit. I didn't know I was
lining someone's pocket,'' said Sandra Shadwick, whose brother's
remains were given to a Los Angeles tissue bank. ''It makes me
angry. It makes me appalled. If it's not illegal, it ought to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Organ Transplant Act of 1984 banned profits from
the sale of tissue, but companies and nonprofit tissue banks are
allowed to charge reasonable fees to handle and process the parts.
The law does not define a reasonable charge.
</P>
<P>
   ''The law has never been tested in court. Nobody has ever
decided what is selling and what isn't,'' said Jeanne Mowe,
executive director of the American Association of Tissue Banks.
</P>
<P>
   Nonprofit tissue banks may obtain body parts useful for up to
100 patients from a single cadaver. The parts are then sold to
companies that make products used by doctors and dentists, and the
banks and businesses share revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors urged to donate usually are told about vital organs,
such as hearts or kidneys, but most of the products derived from
the dead are far from lifesaving: Cadaver skin may be used to puff
up the lips of models, enlarge penises or smooth out wrinkles, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   A single body can provide material that is worth up to $34,000
for nonprofit tissue banks, including skin, tendons, heart valves,
veins and corneas that are then made available to doctors and
hospitals for up to $110,000.
</P>
<P>
   With bone taken from the same body, a cadaver can be worth
$220,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''People who donate have no idea tissue is being processed into
products that per gram or per ounce are in the price range of
diamonds,'' said Arthur Caplan, a professor at the University of
Pennsylvania's Center for Bioethics.
</P>
<P>
   Lives are enhanced by donations: Tendons help athletes, cadaver
skin helps solve bladder problems and corneas help the blind to
see, said Michael Jeffries, chief financial officer for Osteotech
Inc., a leader in the bone business.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a profit,'' he said. ''It's not an evil thing because
the profit is put to good use.''
</P>
<P>
   The two largest for-profit tissue companies had $142.3 million
in sales last year and each pays its chief executive more than
$460,000 annually, the newspaper said. The four largest nonprofit
tissue banks will make $261 million in sales this year, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of organ and tissue donors increased 172 percent
nationwide over the past five years, according to the American
Association of Tissue Banks.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Vice President Al Gore announced $5 million in grants
to organ and tissue agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did not know that the amount of money involved was as large
as you have pointed out,'' Gore told the Register in a recent
telephone interview.

<HEADLINE> $45,000 reward as probe resumes into series of killings involvinggays  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- New Jersey investigators have reopened a
probe into a series of killings involving gay men, hoping a new
reward and advancements in technology can help them find the
so-called ''Last Call Killer.''
</P>
<P>
   A $45,000 reward has been offered, and investigators now believe
that advancements in crime-solving technology could lead to a break
in the case, The Star-Ledger of Newark reported in Sunday's
editions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sure it's a cold case, but we have a lot of new angles to
play,'' said New Jersey State Police Detective Matthew Kuehn, who
chairs a task force investigating the killings. ''We could get
lucky. We owe it to the victims' families to try.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1991 and 1993, five East Coast men were murdered and
dismembered, their remains found stuffed in plastic bags along
rural highways in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The killings began in May 1991, when the body of wealthy
Philadelphia socialite Peter Anderson, 54, was found stuffed in
several plastic bags at a Pennsylvania Turnpike rest stop.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1992, the head of Thomas Mulcahy, a 57-year-old computer
executive, turned up in a bag found at a rest area on Route 72 in
Woodland Township, Burlington County. A week after that, the limbs
and torso of Guillermo Mendez, 56, of Schenectady, N.Y., were found
in garbage bags in Rotterdam, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in May 1993, a bag containing the head of gay prostitute
Anthony Marrero, 43, was discovered in a ripped bag found in rural
Manchester Township, Ocean County. Two months after that, Michael
Sakara, 56, of New York, walked out of a Greenwich Village bar on
July 30, 1993 and was never seen alive again. One-and-a-half days
later, his head and arms were found in a garbage can along the
Hudson River, 30 miles north of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Kuehn says the investigation, which was reopened last week, will
focus mainly on the Sakara, Mulcahy and Marrero killings, because
they were so similar. He believes that the improvement of
sophisticated DNA analysis and the invention of ''vacuum metal
deposition,'' a new way of retrieving fingerprints, could lead to
the killer or killers.
</P>
<P>
   ''DNA procedures are much more discriminating than they were
back in 1993,'' said Linda Jankowsky, DNA technical director for
the State Police. ''We are now putting all our old samples online,
and the national DNA computer bank is expected to be up and running
by the end of the year. If we find a match, it will be your
murderer, or his identical twin.''
</P>
<P>
   Working out of a back room at the State Police barracks at
Interchange 14 of the New Jersey Turnpike, investigators are
working a cold trail. But they're hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know this is a long shot, but we're hoping there are people
out there who might have been afraid to come forward with
information last time, or didn't realize they might have known
something,'' said Kuehn.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Locke, director of client services for the New York gay and
lesbian Anti-Violence Project, believes investigators just may get
lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm really glad they reopened the case,'' Locke said. ''I know
some people held back last time -- maybe they were in the closet or
didn't trust the police -- so maybe new information will come out.
Unless the killer is in jail or dead, that horror is still being
re-enacted on some victim, somewhere.''

<HEADLINE> Prize-Winning Photographer Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Washington Post photographer who has won
three Pulitzer Prizes was arrested Saturday while covering the
police roundup of hundreds of protesters demonstrating against
meetings of the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested Carol Guzy along with about 600 protesters who
they said had been parading without a permit.
</P>
<P>
   Guzy said she had moved away from other photographers while
covering the demonstration and, although she wore credentials, was
seized by an officer and then arrested after she complained, the
Post reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   After holding Guzy in a bus and then in a cell, police later
dropped the charges and released her, the Post said.
</P>
<P>
   Guzy and Post staff photographers Michael Williamson and Lucian
Perkins shared this year's Pulitzer Prize for feature photography
for their work on the Kosovo conflict.

<HEADLINE> Speech About Oprah Is Not So Free  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Oprah Winfrey may think free speech rocks, but
the talk show host apparently isn't fond of her employees speaking
their minds when she's the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Employees of the parent company of Winfrey's production studio,
Harpo Inc., are barred from talking or writing about Winfrey's
personal or business affairs and those of her company -- for the
rest of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   A former producer, Elizabeth Coady, challenged the legality of
the confidentiality agreement but the agreement was upheld by
Illinois courts, the Chicago Tribune reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no sense of justice inside, which is so ironic in
light of the public image of someone who touts herself as an
advocate for business ethics and spirituality,'' said Coady, who
wanted to write a book about the four years she worked on Winfrey's
show before quitting in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A representative for Harpo told the Tribune the company does not
''discuss internal company policy in the media.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Winfrey proclaimed her support of the First
Amendment after she defeated a $12 million lawsuit brought by a
group of Texas cattlemen who said she had made false statements
that hurt their business.
</P>
<P>
   ''Free speech not only lives, it rocks,'' she said in 1998 after
she was cleared by a U.S. District Court jury.

<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- John Travolta is warning his fans not to expect
him to be a hero in his newest movie.
</P>
<P>
   ''I play a pretty bad guy,'' Travolta told 10,000 people at a

<P>
   That's when ''Battlefield Earth'' opens. Travolta plays a
9-foot-1, 543-pound alien intent on destroying Earth.

<HEADLINE> Quotes From World Finance Figures  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Quotes from people involved in the weekend's
anti-globalization
protests in Washington and the financial meetings that triggered
them:
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''These are among the most organized demonstrators we have seen
in anyone's memory. Very sophisticated. If you're good at what you
do, I respect that. Our goal was to let the meetings take place,
which they are, and to let the demonstrators demonstrate.'' --
Washington Police Chief Charles Ramsey.
</P>
<P>
   ''Overall, (police) maintained their composure quite a bit. They
have brutalized a few people without provocation, but the incidents
have definitely been few and far between.'' -- Protest organizer Han
Shan of Baltimore, who said of the protesters: ''I've seen a whole
lot less property damage than after a Bulls game in Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You'll do it because I tell you to do it, and I'm a police
officer.'' -- Unidentified policeman responding to a protester's
complaints about being pushed down the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're really jammed in close together, but spirits are high.''
-- Luke Boyette, a member of Students United Against Sweatshops from
the University of Kentucky, awaiting arrest Saturday night for
parading without a permit.
</P>
<P>
   ''As we march and rally and demonstrate today and tomorrow, it
is important that we send a message that is forceful and clear and
powerful. And that message is that we will not allow the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund to continue to conduct their
business with closed minds in a closed process that happens behind
closed doors.'' -- Richard Trumka, secretary-treasurer of the
AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am very pleased, very inspired, quite amazed at all the
people who have come out to speak, truth to power.'' -- Njoke Njeho
of Kenya, from the Coalition for Mobilization for Global Justice.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not come to negotiate with the bank and the fund. We
have come to Washington to shut down these two institutions.'' --
Walden Bello, a professor of public administration and sociology at
the University of the Philippines and leading critic of the IMF and
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are treating it as business as usual. The meetings are
going on, and staff are performing the usual tasks.'' -- IMF
spokesman Graham Newman.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've kept the city safe from puppets.'' -- A protester
shouting at police after they shut down the protesters'
headquarters Saturday and seized their materials, including items
used to make parade puppets.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we've tried to do from the very beginning, all the way
back in January, was try to prevent a replication of what happened
out in Seattle. I think the vast majority of these demonstrators
want to demonstrate peacefully.'' -- Washington Mayor Anthony
Williams on CBS' Face The Nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''What happened last night with the arrests of the students and
the activists was shameful to this nation. This is the power of a
corporate state, ... the betrayal of working people.'' -- George
Becker, president of the United Steelworkers of America.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's important for older people to join (the
movement). It's our responsibility. We're handing over a world
that's in a hellish state, and we have to try to do something about
it before we check out.'' -- Barbara Seifred, 69, of Montreal, a
member of the Raging Grannies, who do a satirical show on peace and
environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there is a great misunderstanding. We have some
improvements to make. In spite of that, I think their achievements
are very important.'' -- French Finance Minister Laurent Fabius,
speaking of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. He
tried unsuccessfully for several hours to get from a hotel to the
IMF meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Blaming the World Bank for poverty is a bit like blaming the
Red Cross for starting World Wars I and II.'' -- Mike Moore, head of
the World Trade Organization, to reporters outside the
International Monetary Fund meeting rooms. Moore, who was also in
Seattle, is attending the IMF session as an observer.
</P>
<P>
   ''The multinational corporations are dictating to Americans.'' --
Ray Delarwelle, a 48-year-old steelworker from Bellville, Ohio.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Fate in the Hand of Judges  </HEADLINE>
By MARK STEVENSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- With Elian Gonzalez's fate before federal judges,
protesters prayed for divine help Sunday as Easter week began,
waving palm fronds and posters of the Cuban boy and Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Rosaries and other tokens of religious devotion draped the fence
at the home where the 6-year-old shipwreck survivor has been living
with his Miami relatives. Priests joined the crowd of at least 150
to offer a religious service.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are many people who tell us that we should give up this
fight,'' said Martin Anorga, an evangelical pastor. ''But we will
follow in the path that the Lord has shown us, despite those who
want to get in our way.''
</P>
<P>
   He called on God to ''reduce to ashes'' the Castro government.
</P>
<P>
   The wait continued Sunday for a response from a federal appeals
court in Atlanta, which issued a temporary injunction Thursday
blocking Elian from leaving the country. That order defused a tense
standoff when the boy's great-uncle refused the government's demand
to hand over the boy.
</P>
<P>
   The government wants the appeals court to suspend the injunction
and order Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez to release him so he
can return with his father to Cuba. The relatives want the court to
let them meet with Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, without
being required to let Elian go. The father has been waiting in the
Washington area since April 6.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has said only Juan Miguel Gonzalez
can speak for his son on immigration matters.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, the nun and university president who
presided over an earlier meeting with the boy's Cuban grandmothers,
told ABC's ''This Week'' that the family will meet with the father
but is concerned about Cuban influence.
</P>
<P>
   ''The family is prepared to go anywhere at this point where
adult members can speak, come to grips, if they have to yell and
scream, and perhaps end with a reconciliation and healing,''
O'Laughlin said Sunday. ''Holy Week could be the time to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   At the house, the days of tense waiting showed. One protester
urged others to bring in a video camera to document what happens if
the government moves in to take the boy. A few showed up later with
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Many worried that their cause to keep the boy would fail on
Monday -- the 39th anniversary of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, an aborted
invasion of Cuba by CIA-trained exiles that left much bitterness
among the Cuban-American community.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were betrayed by the government, by (President) Kennedy,
and if they turned the child back over, it will be a second
betrayal,'' said Josefa Gonzalez, who left Cuba in 1962 when she
was 4.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's relatives have cared for him since November, when he was
found clinging to an inner tube in the Florida Straits. His mother
and 10 other people fleeing Cuba drowned when their boat sank.
</P>
<P>
   The great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, last week released an ''open
letter'' to the government asking for a reprieve in the custody
battle during Easter week, recalling cease-fires in conflicts in
Kosovo and the Persian Gulf.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Reviving Despite U.N. Embargo  </HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- The pavilions at the industrial fair brim
with Iraqi-made goods: electrical appliances, carpets, textiles,
spare parts and foodstuffs all laid out at the first such show in a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   While the goods are affordable only to the elite, their presence
shows that sectors of the Iraqi economy are reviving for the first
time since the United Nations imposed trade sanctions after the
1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the fair and Iraqi businesspeople say the
country's industry is reaping the benefits of the U.N. oil-for-food
program, which began in 1996 and allowed the government to export
oil and use the revenue for food, medicine and other essential
commodities. This freed up hundreds of millions of government
dollars that are now being loaned at low interest to
industrialists.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said at least 226 new products were added in the last
year to the list of Iraqi-manufactured goods, including air
conditioners, electrical transformers and sprinkler irrigation
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Industries that were idle during the early and mid-1990s are now
operating again.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the projects and factories which were on stream before
sanctions are operating now, albeit at lower capacity,'' said Humam
al-Shamaa, a professor of economics at Baghdad University.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's three cement factories now churn out more than 6 million
tons a year, compared to less than 2 million tons two years ago.
Its Company for Manufacturing of Drugs and Medical Appliances is
back up to half the output of medical items it produced before
1990. Its fertilizer output has surged beyond local needs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our warehouses are full and we are waiting for the chance to
resume exports,'' said Mohammed al-Ani, the managing director of
the Iraqi Fertilizers Co.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the mini-boom is that the Iraqi market cannot
absorb the products of an industrial sector running at full speed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The purchasing power of earnings in Iraq is currently much
below the value of goods,'' al-Shamaa said. As a result, warehouses
at factories producing textiles, carpets, dairy, vegetable oils and
fertilizer are full of stock.
</P>
<P>
   At the weeklong fair which ends Monday, thousands have come to
pore over the goods. More than a hundred Iraqi companies have
showed products, and many goods have been discounted by more than
50 percent. In high demand: rugs, clothes, textiles, detergents,
air conditioners and foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, shoppers pulled trolleys full of goods, among them
woolen carpets they had bought for $90. The sum seems massive when
compared with the average $2.50 monthly salary of a civil servant,
but it still is affordable to those in trade and some other
professions.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's industry ground to a halt soon after the United Nations
imposed sweeping trade sanctions to punish the government for its
1990 invasion of Kuwait. But exemptions under the 1996 oil-for-food
program enabled the government to export oil.
</P>
<P>
   The exports have eased the strain on government coffers, which
previously spent nearly $100 million a month on food imports. The
Central Bank can now lend hard currency at low interest to
businesspeople who use the cash to import raw materials.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq does not have direct access to revenues from the
U.N.-monitored oil exports. Its hard currency is believed to come
from tens of thousands of tourists who visit Shiite religious
sites, illegal oil exports and the smuggling of other commodities
across its porous borders.
</P>
<P>
   Some industrialists blame the oil-for-food program for the low
performance of certain industries.
</P>
<P>
   Tariq Abullah, chairman of Iraq's dairy factories, said that
under the program, Iraqis receive imported full-cream milk powder
free of charge. ''I am working at only 10 percent capacity and
still cannot market all products,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, vegetable oil companies are finding it hard to sell
their product even though they are operating at only one-tenth
capacity. The oil program provides rations of vegetable oils, soaps
and detergents free of charge.

<HEADLINE> Rumors Exhaust Cuban Protesters  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT TANNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- The rumors come and go with more ferocity than a
Florida thunderstorm, whipping the crowd from frenzied worry to
exhilaration. And back again.
</P>
<P>
   Fear spreads fast outside the house where the 6-year-old Cuban
boy lives with his relatives. Listen: The custody of Elian Gonzalez
has been transferred! The federal agents are coming!
</P>
<P>
   Then suddenly the latest rumor is gone, proved false. And the
wait begins again.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like a roller coaster,'' says Iris Robaina, who comes
every morning at 7 a.m. to pray and sing with a group of women
dressed in black who clutch rosaries and crosses. ''Sometimes
you're high, and then it goes down.''
</P>
<P>
   After 4{ months of waiting and hoping, the rumors pump up the
protesters even as they leave them drained afterward. Exciting,
even addictive, the rush is a powerful combination of patriotism,
love, revenge, community. Something to believe in.
</P>
<P>
   ''It feels great. You are fighting for what you believe,'' said
Pilar Rodriguez, who left work Thursday to rush to the vigil when
she heard on the radio that federal agents were coming. She spent
all day among the crowd, praying, talking, hoping.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was exhausted. That is continual stress,'' she said,
suddenly stiffening and shaking off her fears.
</P>
<P>
   The weather this weekend was muggy, heavy, ripe for more rumors.
The boy's fate depended on a ruling from a federal appeals court in
Georgia. The federal government said last week it would hold off
any action for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   Los rumores spread quickly from the crowd trampling the scrub
grass along Northwest Second Street, down the block, across Little
Havana. The group of protesters can swell in minutes from a few
dozen to hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   One tip gets passed in a whisper; another comes over Spanish
language radio; a third arrives in a phone call down the street.
</P>
<P>
   Early Sunday, one protester urged others to bring video cameras
to document government agents when they sweep in to take the boy.
Within hours, several cameras were on hand.
</P>
<P>
   The rumors take their toll. Some break down crying, said Ada
Mejia, a 27-year-old mother who has come every day after work and
each weekend day. Some just get angry.
</P>
<P>
   Many blame the false rumors on their enemies -- on Castro and the
spies they are convinced are spread throughout the crowd, or on the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's all done by communists who live in this community and
work for Cuba,'' said Raoul Fernandez, 42, who came over in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   After four months, the wait remains a see-saw between exhaustion
and exhilaration.
</P>
<P>
   ''Can I walk away and not come back? I can't do it,'' said
Carlos Matos, who lives in California but came home to spend
several days here waiting with his father. ''It's like turning my
back on my own people.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Age-challenged drivers on the rise in New Jersey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N. J. (AP) -- The number of elderly New Jerseyans
stricken with Alzheimer's Disease and other forms of dementia is on
the rise, and that makes many of them hazards on the highways.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some states, New Jersey has no system for checking the
skill level of older drivers, leaving it to doctors or police
officers to intervene, The Star-Ledger of Newark reported in
Sunday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a huge number of people with dementia who are driving,
and we have a huge number of doctors who are afraid to do anything
about it,'' said Paul Bryman, medical director of the Geriatric
Evaluation and Management Service, of Lakewood.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers can't always detect the signs of dementia in a
motorist, and doctors and family members are often reluctant to
raise the issue. Doctors aren't required to report patients whose
dementia is interfering with their driving ability.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to advise people whether or not they should continue
driving, but we don't want to be an enforcement agency,'' said
ophthalmologist Walter Kahn, president of the Medical Society of
New Jersey. ''The patient will consider us as adversaries and not
seek proper help. It will dissuade them from coming into the
office.''
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey has an estimated 152,000 people who suffer from
Alzheimer's Disease. Within the next 15 years, that number will
grow to 215,880, according to the Alzheimer's Association. The
state has about 380,000 drivers who are 75 years old or more.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very clear that there are people on the road who are
impaired and shouldn't be driving,'' said Mildred Potenza, of the
Comprehensive Services on Aging Institute for Alzheimer's Disease,
at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. ''The
process of notifying the motor vehicle bureau sometimes takes a
long time. Cases fall through the cracks.''
</P>
<P>
   When they do, people sometimes get hurt.
</P>
<P>
   According to the state Division of Motor Vehicles, about 400
drivers are killed in car accidents annually in New Jersey.
One-fourth of them are 65 or older, but no data is available on how
many suffered from Alzheimer's Disease or other mental problems.
</P>
<P>
   DMV officials say it is up to doctors or police officers to
report people whose driving skills have deteriorated -- with age --
to the point where they are dangerous. They can do so by filing a
report with the DMV's Medical Review Unit.
</P>
<P>
   Once a report is filed, the DMV sends a letter to the person
suspending his or her license and offering a hearing to contest the
finding.
</P>
<P>
   ''Owning a driver's license is a very important thing to most
people,'' said DMV spokeswoman Dana Sullivan. ''We have to proceed
with some sensitivity and humaneness in the process and give people
a chance to respond.''

<HEADLINE> Artist-Author Gorey Dies at 75  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HYANNIS, Mass. (AP) -- Edward Gorey, whose bizarre stories and
black-and-white illustrations reflected an elegantly morbid sense
of humor in books, on the stage and for television, has died.
</P>
<P>
   Gorey, whose costume design for the Broadway production of
''Dracula'' won a Tony Award in 1978, died Saturday at age 75,
according to Cape Cod Hospital. He had suffered a heart attack
earlier in the week, The New York Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Gorey wrote at least 90 books and illustrated 60 others. Most
showed vaguely Edwardian characters in bleak settings, reacting in
prim distress to strange situations such as the intrusion of a
penguinlike, sneaker-wearing creature (''The Doubtful Guest,''
published in 1957).
</P>
<P>
   A set published in 1963 under the title ''The Vinegar Works;
Three Volumes of Moral Instruction,'' featured a grisly alphabet
book, ''The Gashlycrumb Tinies,'' in which ''A is for Amy who fell
down the stairs'' and ''X is for Xerxes, devoured by mice.''
</P>
<P>
   The book was included in ''Amphigorey,'' an anthology of 15
stories published in 1972 by Putnam, that brought Gorey's work to a
wider audience. It was followed in 1974 by ''Amphigorey Too'' and
''Amphigorey Also'' in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ''To take my work seriously would be the height of folly,''
Gorey told The Associated Press in 1994. He said most of his
material was aimed at ''reasonably small children,'' whom he did
not believe were scared by the sinister subject matter.
</P>
<P>
   Gorey was born in Chicago in February 1925 and attended Harvard
University, where his roommate was poet Frank O'Hara. Out of
college, he began illustrating book covers for Doubleday and
working on his own novels, none of which he finished.
</P>
<P>
   He turned eventually to the smaller books on which he built his
career, often using rhyme to tell weird tales with dark humor.
</P>
<P>
   He designed sets and costumes for a number of theater
productions, and staged his own ''Gorey Stories'' in New York in
1978.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Gorey moved to Cape Cod, where he led a small
theater troupe that performed his works in plays and puppet shows.
At the same time, his characters made the leap to television in the
opening and closing titles of the PBS series ''Mystery!''

<HEADLINE> Lockheed, Strikers Make No Progress  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Lockheed Martin representatives and
striking machinists reached no resolution in their first meeting
with federal mediators.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides met for about 10 hours on Saturday. Some 2,500
members of Local 776 of the International Association of Machinists
went on strike at 12:01 a.m. April 10.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Smith, business representative for the union, said no
progress was made during the discussions. He said no further
contract talks were scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were disappointed that no progress could be made,''
Lockheed Martin executives said in a written statement. ''We feel
deep concern for the welfare of our employees and had hoped to make
progress toward a responsible agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The giant defense contractor has proposed a 10 percent pay raise
over three years and changes in insurance benefits. But union
members also want reassurances about job security, cost-of-living
adjustments and equality with plants doing the same work.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin executives, in a letter last week to all 10,500
workers at the Fort Worth plant, set a midnight Sunday deadline for
approval of its last contract proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not planning on voting on the same thing our members
rejected last week,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The strike has hampered production at the Fort Worth plant,
which makes the F-16 fighter jet, part of the fuselage for the F-22
fighter and parts for the Japanese F-2 fighter.
</P>
<P>
   The union continues to picket open gates at the plant around the
clock. The pickets have been peaceful.

<HEADLINE> City Residents Target Speeders  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL TOLME, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) -- Hey, lead foot! The folks on Fillmore
Street are watching you.
</P>
<P>
   Fed up with motorists who zoom past 25 mph speed limit signs,
residents of the city's Lyon Park section are out in force, and the
police have armed them with radar guns.
</P>
<P>
   They gather along the road to clock speeders and collect license
plate numbers, which they send to police. Scofflaws then get a
letter-- which has no legal standing -- suggesting they ease off the
gas.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a feeling of lawlessness on the roads,'' Taylor
Caswell, 31, said on a recent morning as he aimed the radar at a
sedan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thirty-five, 36, 37 ... I've got a winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Caswell got involved because he feared for the safety of his
2-year-old daughter, Elisabeth. He has clocked Arlington County
vehicles breaking the speed limit, been yelled at by angry
motorists and seen soccer moms repeatedly roar past with their
children.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lady in a red minivan who drops her kids off at the
elementary school,'' he said. ''She will be getting three letters
from the county.''
</P>
<P>
   Arlington, just across the Potomac River from Washington D.C.,
is hardly the only town with traffic problems.
</P>
<P>
   But it gets some of the effects of the nation's capital, which
has some of the country's worst gridlock. Only Los Angeles drivers
spend more time stuck in traffic, according to a national study
issued in November by the Texas Transportation Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Commuters looking for shortcuts cut through strip mall parking
lots, make illegal U-turns and speed through neighborhoods to avoid
red lights and heavily traveled roads.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would be out walking with my daughter and these cars would
just zoom by,'' Caswell said. ''That's when I knew something had to
be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Police are happy to have the civilian help, said Capt. Thomas
Hoffman, who runs the Community Speed Monitoring Problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't afford to station an officer in every neighborhood,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other Arlington neighborhoods have inquired about starting their
own speed monitoring groups, Hoffman said. Similar programs exist
in Phoenix, Sturgis, Mich., and in Maryland's Montgomery County and
Rockville.
</P>
<P>
   Some motorists get belligerent. One stopped to berate Caswell
and his crew, accusing them of being elitists with nice homes who
disdain outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   But the woman in the red minivan appears to have gotten the
message.
</P>
<P>
   As Caswell spoke with a reporter, the minivan appeared. He took
aim. She slowed to 25 mph -- and waved.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's on to me,'' Caswell said.

<HEADLINE> Israel Govt Minister May Be Charged  </HEADLINE>
By SARI BASHI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Dealing Israel's scandal-rocked government
another blow, police recommended Sunday that Yitzhak Mordechai, a
senior minister and former prime ministerial candidate, be
prosecuted for sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation was not likely to harm Prime Minister Ehud
Barak's coalition, in which Mordechai serves as transportation
minister. It may, however, further erode public trust in
government, already shaken by a series of police investigations of
senior officials.
</P>
<P>
   Female lawmakers said the investigation would encourage other
women who have been harassed or assaulted to complain to police.
</P>
<P>
   Wrapping up a five-week investigation, police said they had
evidence that Mordechai had forced himself on three women who
apparently worked for him when he served first as an army general
and then as a government minister.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations of ''debased acts carried out with force'' -- in
effect, sexual assault -- are more serious than the sexual
harassment accusations originally made last month by a 23-year-old
subordinate at Mordechai's Transport Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Police handed the recommendations to prosecutors, who must now
decide whether to indict.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Mordechai continued to maintain his innocence
and said he hopes prosecutors will choose to dismiss the
accusations. If they don't, he said, he will fight the allegations
in court.
</P>
<P>
   ''The police recommendations are only the beginning of the road,
not its end,'' Mordechai said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would ask the parliament to suspend the immunity he
enjoys as a legislator should prosecutors decide to indict. At the
time the allegations surfaced, Mordechai suspended himself from his
duties pending the investigation's outcome.
</P>
<P>
   The initial accusations launched a flood of similar claims from
women who had worked with Mordechai throughout his career.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they have credible evidence that one woman,
reportedly a prospective employee, was assaulted by Mordechai in
his home in 1996 during his term as defense minister. They said
there is evidence that another woman, reportedly a soldier under
Mordechai's command, was assaulted in his home in 1992, while he
headed the northern command.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai, 55, a career officer before entering politics, is
currently head of the small Center Party. He ran for prime minister
last spring and showed promise in early polls. But on the eve of
the elections, when it was clear the vote was split between
challenger Barak and then-Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, he
pulled out and endorsed Barak, who won easily.
</P>
<P>
   Feminists said the case against Mordechai exposed a
male-dominated culture here that has bred tolerance for widespread
sexual harassment of women in the workplace. Colette Avital, a
lawmaker in Barak's Labor Party, said she has been sexually
harassed in the army and in other places of work.
</P>
<P>
   ''The norms have changed,'' she said. ''Women are no longer
accepting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor lawmaker Yael Dayan said Mordechai should resign.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai is only one of a panoply of top Israeli officials
embroiled in scandals. Last month, police recommended indicting
Netanyahu for corruption and obstruction of justice charges in a
bribery and misappropriation scandal.
</P>
<P>
   This month, they recommended closing a file alleging fraud and
breach of public trust against President Ezer Weizman but said they
had found evidence of wrongdoing. Barak's campaign financing is
under police scrutiny, and the spiritual leader of the
ultra-religious Shas party, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, is being
investigated for incitement after comparing a Cabinet minister to
Satan, among other epithets.

<HEADLINE> Saudis Invite Amnesty for Probe  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Saudi Arabia has invited Amnesty
International to come to the kingdom and investigate its human
rights record, the official Saudi Press Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia welcomes ''anyone who wants to be acquainted with
the facts,'' the agency quoted Saudi Interior Minister Prince Nayef
as saying. Officials with Amnesty were not immediately available to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The London-based human rights group released a report earlier
this month that it said documented patterns of human rights
violations in Saudi Arabia. The allegations included torture of
detainees in many Saudi police stations and prisons and the
conviction of defendants in secret trials.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty International had asked Saudi Arabia to let it send a
delegation there for a visit.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Foreign Minister Saud Al-Faisal said Saudi Arabia
cannot be expected to change its Islamic laws just because of
criticism from human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not going to change our laws,'' Al-Faisal was quoted as
saying by Spanish newspaper El Pais on Sunday. ''Our laws are of
universal application and the Islamic Sharia law represents not
only the beliefs of the Saudi citizens but of 1.2 billion'' Muslims
worldwide, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also rejected Amnesty's allegations as ''misleading and based
on erroneous information.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't believe we are violating human rights,'' he was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia announced earlier this month that it was setting up
agencies to raise awareness and protect human rights, but said the
move had nothing to do with external pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative kingdom, where women are not allowed to drive
and must be covered head-to-toe in public, follows a strict
interpretation of Islamic law. Courts routinely order hands
amputated for theft and public execution for murder, rape, sodomy
and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights organizations have criticized those penalties. They
say defendants do not receive fair trials and often do not have
access to lawyers.

<HEADLINE> Search Called Off for Blast Victims  </HEADLINE>
By KAMANGA MUTOND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) -- Religious dirges played on state radio
Sunday as many rescuers abandoned the search for as many as 100
more victims in a deadly string of blasts at an airport.
</P>
<P>
   Kinshasa Gov. Theophile Bemba Fundu set the official death toll
at 44 people, killed when the hangar collapsed Friday at Kinshasa's
N'Djili international airport. Hospital officials said 216 were
seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   Bargain hunters gathered Sunday behind airport walls and
buildings to buy salvaged computers, televisions and clothing
looted from the customs hangar by soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard the soldiers were selling so I came to the airport
right away,'' said Julien Ndolo, a resident of the nearby Kingasani
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the blast remained murky. Explanations ranged
from a short circuit to a soldier dropping ammunition while
unloading a plane full of weapons. The explosions of fuel and army
munitions shattered windows, toppled buildings and flung deadly
debris several miles away into residential neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Airport officials feared that as many as 100 people may be
buried in the rubble of the hangar. The building was used by
customs and tax officials to handle incoming cargo from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Congolese Red Cross workers and volunteers dragged an occasional
body from beneath piles of concrete and steel in the hangar Sunday
morning, but by afternoon, all but a handful of the rescuers had
given up the search, saying they were hampered by lack of tools,
water and food. Those who continued were mainly friends and family
members of those still missing.
</P>
<P>
   One man was rescued late Saturday evening after being buried
alive beneath the hangar for more than 30 hours, Red Cross worker
Jean-Jacques Malutama said. The man had broken ribs and legs and
could not speak, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is difficult work. We are pulling out rubble by hand and we
did not eat yesterday so it would be difficult to continue this
evening,'' Malutama said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Mvuezolo Nsimb, an airport porter, vowed to carry on
digging. A small cluster of female family members hoping for news
about missing loved ones looked on worriedly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of my friends are missing. I cannot abandon them,'' Nsimb
said.
</P>
<P>
   Congolese health authorities said international relief
organizations had offered medical aid and that Belgium was sending
a plane with medical specialists. Hospitals issued an urgent appeal
for blood donors to treat the injured.
</P>
<P>
   Kinshasa was in a state of mourning Sunday. Programs on state
radio were replaced with somber religious music and hospital
officials said some children had been admitted with psychological
trauma as a result of the blasts.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers, police and firemen based at the airport, many of whom
witnessed the blast, were still reeling Sunday morning from the
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was infernal and apocalyptic. Everyone is searching their
heart for answers,'' said Elie Zambeli Rubega, the airport's chief
firefighter.
</P>
<P>
   The explosions initially set off panic in Kinshasa, where people
living near the airport fled for the city center, fearing an
escalation of Congo's 20-month civil war. The blasts took place on
the first day of a cease-fire signed by the warring sides a week
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by Sunday afternoon, workers were cleaning airport halls and
runways.
</P>
<P>
   All international flights over the weekend to and from Kinshasa
were canceled, airline officials said. Yet critical air traffic
equipment was undamaged, Fundu said, and authorities were stepping
up cleanup efforts to restore flights.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Dad Thanks Churchgoers  </HEADLINE>
PAULINE JELINEK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- On his second Sunday in America, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez went to church and a parade of people on weekly news shows
debated whether he should get his son back.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez addressed 1,000 Baptist churchgoers at a Palm Sunday
service in Washington, thanking them for their support in his
struggle to take his 6-year-old son Elian back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ''My family, the people of Cuba -- my son Elian especially -- we
really appreciate the support you have offered us,'' Gonzalez said
in Spanish through a translator from the Cuban diplomatic mission
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile on television, former U.S. presidents and others for
and against the reunion appeared on a half-dozen Sunday news shows
to talk about the drawn-out battle.
</P>
<P>
   At the Shiloh Baptist Church in Washington, the congregation
stopped singing and gave a standing ovation when Gonzalez arrived
late to the service with his wife, Nersy Carmenante, and their
infant son, Hianny.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our prayers are with you,'' the Rev. Wallace Charles Smith,
church pastor, told them. ''We want you to have Elian back.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing at the podium, Gonzalez said: ''I will hold you in my
heart eternally.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he took a front-row seat with his family, and a choir
member sat behind them translating the rest of a nearly hour-long
service.
</P>
<P>
   The family, which arrived in America on April 6 to try to take
custody of Elian, returned to the house where they have been
staying in the suburb of Bethesda, Md. About 20 protesters arrived
shortly to sing and pray outside the house, urging Gonzalez not to
take Elian back to communist Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   On NBC's ''Meet the Press,'' former Presidents Gerald Ford and
Jimmy Carter said they support attempts to reunite the father and
son.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the boy should have been returned four months ago,''
Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   On Fox News Sunday, Sen. John McCain said there shouldn't be ''a
huge rush to return this boy.''
</P>
<P>
   And on ''Meet the Press'' and CBS's ''Face the Nation, Jose
Garcia-Pedrosa, lawyer for relatives in Miami who refuse to
relinquish the boy, repeated charges that Juan Miguel abused the
boy and his former wife -- the mother who drowned bringing Elian to
the United States. The U.S. government has said the charges are
unsubstantiated.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no law that says this child has to be with his father
or be returned to Cuba,'' Garcia-Pedrosa said on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   White House Chief of Staff John Podesta said on CNN's ''Late
Edition'' that the key to a peaceful resolution of the bitter
dispute is ''in the hands of the Miami relatives.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We remain hopeful that the relatives will ultimately decide
that it is in the best interests of Elian to follow the law and to
reunite him with his father,'' Podesta said, ''and to stop the
propaganda war, the trashing of the father ... and to get back to
do the right thing.''

<HEADLINE> Mass. Firms Fight Domestic Abuse  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- A group of Massachusetts companies are tackling a
problem that businesses have been reluctant to confront -- domestic
violence.
</P>
<P>
   The group, Employers Against Domestic Violence, realized that
it's not just a domestic problem: domestic violence costs American
businesses up to $5 billion each year in absenteeism, lower
productivity, higher turnover and health care costs, according to
the Bureau of National Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Employers Against Domestic Violence began three years ago as a
series of lunchtime discussions among several Boston companies
about how to protect employees from abusive husbands and
boyfriends.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the group is a formal nonprofit with 28 private
corporations among its members, as well as government, police and
advocacy groups. It has helped similar organizations get started in
cities such as New York and Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Colleen Mackesey was trying to keep her two
children away from a husband she says was abusive and had
threatened to kill the entire family.
</P>
<P>
   Her employer, Massachusetts General Hospital, sent security
officers to accompany her to court and to watch her home. The
company, run by Partners Healthcare System, also promised to help
her flee the state if necessary and provided therapy on company
time.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Ukrainians Vote on Kuchma's Power  </HEADLINE>
By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) -- Ukrainian voters turned out in large
numbers Sunday for a referendum on whether to give President Leonid
Kuchma more powers to control and disband parliament, which he
accuses of blocking reform.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout reached at least 67 percent by evening, said Mykhailo
Riabets, chairman of the Central Election Commission. Participation
surpassed the 50 percent required to make the referendum valid long
before polls closed at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Initial results were expected Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The independent Ukrainian Voters' Committee reported some
violations, including heavy media support for the president, and
pressure by officials and managers on their subordinates to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Kuchma initiated the referendum in January after years of
feuding with the 450-seat parliament, or Verkhovna Rada, once
dominated by Communists and other hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
   Although a new pro-government majority has been formed in
parliament, Kuchma says it is not stable enough to help Ukraine
overcome its post-Soviet economic decline.
</P>
<P>
   ''The question is whether we will be able to strengthen the
growth trend that has been secured in our economy for the first
time in a decade, or continue to mark time and waste our efforts in
arguments and confrontation,'' Kuchma said in an appeal to voters.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum asked voters three questions. First, it asked
whether they want a smaller, 300-seat parliament with two houses --
one of nationally elected lawmakers and the other composed of
municipal and regional officials, who are appointed.
</P>
<P>
   It also asked voters to strip lawmakers of immunity from
prosecution, and to give Kuchma the right to disband parliament if
lawmakers fail to form a stable pro-government majority within a
month or do not pass a budget within three months.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reforms are only possible if we have an effectively working
parliament, a majority and a constructive government stance,''
Prime Minister Viktor Yushchenko argued Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Voters seemed divided on how the plebiscite could affect their
lives, and some said they did not expect much result. Others hoped
for a better future.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the referendum will bring more order to this country.
The lawmakers will not be an obstacle any more,'' said Iryna
Klimova, a 34-year-old Kiev teacher.
</P>
<P>
   The referendum is just a first step. If approved by a simple
majority of those voting Sunday, each question must then be passed
in parliament as a constitutional amendment, a complex procedure
that might be completed in September at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts predict that voters will back the referendum's
initiatives, but say parliament is unlikely to pass the amendments
-- which would throw Ukraine into a deep political crisis.

<HEADLINE> Jordan King Visits Israel April 23  </HEADLINE>
By JAMAL HALABY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Jordan's King Abdullah II will make his
first visit to Israel as head of state on April 23, government
officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The king will hold talks Sunday with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak either in Israel's Red Sea city of Eilat or at a nearby
airport shared by the two countries, a cabinet official told The
Associated Press on condition of anonymity. Another government
official said the visit will last only a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli leaders have criticized Abdullah for touring more than
30 nations since ascending the throne in February 1999 without
making a stop in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah, 38, has followed the legacy of his late father, King
Hussein, in taking an active role in Middle East peacemaking. But
he has kept Israel at arm's length while building ties with Arab
nations. Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah postponed a long-awaited visit to Israel in February
amid Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon and mounting Arab criticism of
Israel over the attacks and the deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the strikes, public protests broke out in
Lebanon, Kuwait and Jordan, signaling Arab frustration with the
peace policy of Barak, who took office last year pledging swift
moves toward peace with the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The Jordanian cabinet official said the king also planned to
visit the Palestinian territories this week, but that no date has
been set.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah flew to Egypt early Sunday for a brief meeting with
President Hosni Mubarak about Israel's pending withdrawal from
southern Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Elian Case Reveals Gap in Miami  </HEADLINE>
By IAN JAMES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Shining shoes on a downtown street corner, Lazaro
Hernandez hears the opinions of a city divided over whether a
6-year-old boy should be returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   And he is convinced many non-Cubans just don't understand why he
feels so strongly that Elian Gonzalez should stay in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been at this corner for seven years, and the only ones
who don't understand the problem of Cuba, the only ones who don't
understand it -- or who don't want to understand it -- are the
Anglos, the Americans,'' he said. ''Why? Because they've never
lived in a communist system.''
</P>
<P>
   When Miami looks at Elian, part of the city sees a boy whose
freedom is at stake, and another part sees a boy wrongfully kept
from his father.
</P>
<P>
   For many Cuban-Americans, the rest of the city simply doesn't
understand. Despite years of living and working together, the
others don't grasp their passion, their pain or what happened to
their island and their people.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of this gap are abundant. Recent polling shows that most
Cuban-Americans in Miami-Dade County say the boy should remain in
Florida with his relatives. Other Hispanics are more evenly split,
but a large majority of the area's white and black non-Hispanics
say the boy should be returned to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Decrying ''those ignorant Anglos'' who don't understand Elian's
case or Cuba's history, popular radio commentator Armando
Perez-Roura of the Spanish-language station Radio Mambi took aim at
his opponents last week.
</P>
<P>
   In the crowd keeping vigil outside the home of Elian's
relatives, some people swore that news of the case was being
reported differently on Spanish- and English-language TV channels.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many Anglos are in favor of them sending that kid back there
to Cuba, without understanding what is happening in Cuba,'' said
Hernandez, pausing from his work. He said the boy would not be free
if returned to ''that hell'' -- the island Hernandez left in the
Mariel boat lift of 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby South Beach, where tourists outnumber Cubans, there is
no sign of the flag-waving fervor that has gripped the neighborhood
of Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Reanee Jones, visiting the beach with her husband Alphonso and
two small children, said she believes the boy should be reunited
with his father. But at her insurance office job, she doesn't
discuss it with her Cuban-American co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think in my office some people are afraid to speak their
views,'' said Jones, who was born in North Carolina. ''You don't
want to step on any toes, so sometimes you keep your thoughts to
yourself, just to keep the peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The story is similar at Lil' Anthony's Downtown Pizzeria.
Valerie Drummond, who owns a share of the restaurant, said she
thinks the boy should be with his father. But she doesn't bring up
the subject with her Cuban-American friends.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know a lot of people have different views, and I don't want
to offend anybody,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some other non-Hispanic whites say they hold similar views but
are unwilling to share them publicly for fear of offending friends
or facing retribution from Cuban-Americans who hold powerful
positions in the community.
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been under the temporary custody of a great-uncle in
Miami since his rescue at sea in November after his mother and 10
others died when their boat sank off the Florida coast. The boy's
father, visiting the United States, has been waiting in Bethesda,
Md., since April 6 to reclaim his son.
</P>
<P>
   People who don't stand up for keeping Elian in the United States
sadden Jennifer Guerra, an 18-year-old demonstrator who missed
college classes this week to keep watch outside the home of Elian's
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''American people, they don't understand,'' said Guerra, who was
born in the United States to a Cuban father and an Ecuadorian
mother.
</P>
<P>
   ''These people would have to go inside my heart to feel the pain
that I and my family feel,'' she said, her eyes wet with tears.
Guerra said two of her cousins died on a raft trying to reach the
United States, and she has a 23-year-old half-sister in Cuba she
never met.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish my breath was so long that I could scream and say what
all those people are feeling,'' she said, motioning to the crowd
standing outside the house, ''so everyone would know what we're
going through. Because they don't know.''

<HEADLINE> Report: GM Crops Planted in France  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- A French newspaper on Sunday reported that 425
plots had been secretly planted with genetically modified crops in
France, a country where opposition to foods from such crops has
been strong.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal du Dimanche said the crops were planted over the
past four years without informing the communities or villages
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ''Four hundred and twenty-five communities have or have had
experimental plots over the last four years,'' the paper said. It
said the Ministry of Agriculture had illegally kept such locations
secret.
</P>
<P>
   A ministry official said Sunday that lists of such plots were
available in local town halls. He said Agriculture Minister Jean
Glavany was due to receive a report on how to reconcile the need
for security with the desire for transparency in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   The peril of releasing such information was highlighted last
week when activists led by Jose Bove, a farmer who champions
traditional farming methods, destroyed a plot of genetically
modified rape in the Ariege region, in southern France.
</P>
<P>
   Green groups and other opponents say foods made from genetically
modified crops can be unhealthy and could harm the food chain if
they escape from farms into the wild.
</P>
<P>
   The Ministry of Agriculture official said the majority of plots
in France were operated by the National Institute for Agronomical
Research, which is part of the ministry. The official spoke on
customary condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal du Dimanche said that at the end of 1999, 123 plots
of genetically modified corn were being farmed, as well as 135
plots of beet and 78 plots of rape.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper report came just days after the European
Parliament rejected tougher conditions for growing and marketing
genetically modified foods in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The parliament on Wednesday rejected the introduction of
''environmental liability rules'' that would have held makers of
genetically modified food responsible for damaging the environment
or public health.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Cohn-Bendit, a Green Party member of the parliament, told
the Journal du Dimanche that the vote was a significant step
backward.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have suffered a heavy defeat. I want to believe that we
have not lost the war,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He warned the ''powerful agro-food lobbies'' not to
underestimate the power of the concerned consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ''The boycott option is a sensitive one which should not be used
lightly. But, if a decision is taken in the EU countries, the
financial repercussions for the companies involved will be
enormous,'' said Cohn-Bendit, known as Danny the Red since his days
as a student leader in Paris in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   The parliament's vote is not final. The issues now go back to
the EU governments for another round of debate there.

<HEADLINE> Italians Vote for Regional Leaders  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- After a campaign heavy on personal attacks and light
on discussion of issues, Italians voted Sunday in regional
elections doubling as a test of Premier Massimo D'Alema's
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   The vote also is seen as a measuring stick for media magnate
Silvio Berlusconi's conservative opposition. With parliamentary
elections due by spring 2001, how each bloc fares in the voting for
presidents and legislatures in 15 regions could influence which
politicians will be pushed as candidates for the premiership.
</P>
<P>
   Initial exit poll findings were expected late Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sunny skies in central and southern Italy seemed to favor a
strong turnout for the Palm Sunday vote. Many people went to the
polls from church, bearing palm fronds or olive branches.
</P>
<P>
   Some 42 million Italians -- about 75 percent of the population --
were eligible to vote.
</P>
<P>
   This year's campaign was the first held under new rules that
sharply restrict political TV ads. Berlusconi claimed the change
unfairly targeted him because of his media realm. The new rules
call for televised debates, many of which ended up being little
more than exchanges of insults by party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has been one of the ugliest electoral campaigns in the
already bungled history of our republic,'' D'Alema commented as the
campaign wound down.
</P>
<P>
   Electoral rallies and forums were dominated by often bitter
exchanges between D'Alema, a former Communist who has headed a
center-left coalition government since October 1998, and
Berlusconi, whose center-right alliance includes former
neo-fascists.
</P>
<P>
   The media focus on how the national coalitions will fare in the
election eclipsed the scarce debate on the business of regional
governments, such as public health administration and
transportation services.
</P>
<P>
   The vote is the first time Italians have had a chance to
directly elect regional presidents. Direct mayoral elections, which
began in 1993, helped create a new class of influential politicians
accountable first to the voters, not to party machines.
</P>
<P>
   Five of Italy's 20 regions chose to schedule voting on other
dates.

   MOOSE, Wyo. (AP) -- A skier broke his ankle during a solo trip
into the back country of Grand Teton National Park and then slid
and crawled five miles over three days to reach help.
</P>
<P>
   Vito Seskunas, 53, of Baltimore, was listed in stable condition
Sunday in the intensive care unit of St. John's Hospital in Jackson
after surgery, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Seskunas said he was injured Tuesday, the first day of a planned
five-day trip, while skiing a steep ravine in Death Canyon several
miles west of Moose, park spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   He set up a tent and stayed in place that night, but on
Wednesday he decided to crawl out, knowing he would not be reported
missing for several days.
</P>
<P>
   He abandoned most of his food and water because he couldn't
carry very much. At night, he took shelter under fir trees, lying
on top of branches he piled on the snow.
</P>
<P>
   In some places he was able to use his ski poles like crutches,
but he said he covered most of the distance by sliding on his
backside.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, another skier encountered him and called park
rangers.

<HEADLINE> American Samoa Has 100th Anniversary  </HEADLINE>
By BEN DiPIETRO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- The people of American Samoa are American
Samoans, not Samoan-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   That's more than semantics -- that's Fa'a Samoa, or the Samoan
way.
</P>
<P>
   ''American Samoans are a special breed of ethnic Americans. We
do not want to be called Samoan-Americans because that is not our
identity,'' said Territorial House member Muavaefaatasi Ae Ae Jr.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the difference is to know why this small Pacific
Island territory 6,966 miles from Washington has rejected all
attempts to change its political affiliation with the United States
or to seek independence.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still have the protection of the U.S. government although
we have the right to control our own affairs,'' he said. American
Samoans have twice had options to change that connection and both
times voted to maintain the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, American Samoans will mark the 100th anniversary of
that partnership with Flag Day parades, celebrations and
commemorations involving the Navy and Marines.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is best that we remain the way it is right now, a great
partnership with the United States,'' said Gov. Tauese Sunia, a
Democrat and ranking chief elected in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-island group 2,300 miles south of Hawaii is an
unincorporated and unorganized territory with about 64,000
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Unincorporated means not all provisions of the U.S. Constitution
apply to residents, such as voting in presidential elections and
having a full voice in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Unorganized means Congress has not created an organic act to
organize the territorial government like a constitution would.
Instead, the U.S. Department of Interior allowed residents to draft
their own constitution.
</P>
<P>
   That unique status fosters the continuation of traditional
Samoan customs, such as communal ownership of lands and the
appointment of senators to the Legislature, or Fono, by councils of
island chiefs instead of voters.
</P>
<P>
   But it also occasionally runs headlong into U.S.-influenced
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Eni Faleomavaega, American Samoa's nonvoting delegate to the
U.S. House of Representatives, said some of the territory's unique
Samoan traditions could erode under the territory's current
political system since local courts rely heavily on the U.S.
Constitution when issuing decisions.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the issuance of titles of nobility to Samoan citizens,
the inability of foreigners to own land and the selection process
for local senators as examples.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of the cultural norms and practices are
unconstitutional,'' said Faleomavaega, a Democrat first elected in
1989. He said he foresees problems in the future with the current
status but can offer no perfect alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the traditions date back to the first Western exposure
in 1722, when Dutchman Jacob Roggeveen first explored the islands.
Missionaries brought Christianity to the region in 1838, and the
people of the islands remain highly religious.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1800s, the United States competed with Great Britain
and Germany for control of the area until a hurricane in the 1890s
destroyed warships from the three nations, leading to the Berlin
Treaty of 1899 that gave the United States control of the Samoan
islands.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the hurricane of the 1890s that changed the course of
history,'' said Territorial House Speaker Aina Saoluaga Nua.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. flag officially was raised April 17, 1900, after 20
Samoan chiefs ceded the islands of Tutuila and Aunu'u to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Department appointed the first governor, Peter
Coleman, in 1956. In 1977, islanders voted him in as the first
elected governor.
</P>
<P>
   In what has been less than a quarter-century of self-governance,
American Samoa has had regular financial problems and political
scandals involving alleged corruption and mismanagement -- most
recently, an inability to pay $5 million in payroll deductions and
owing more than $10 million to local and off-island vendors.
</P>
<P>
   A new government report also shows the average resident now has
a lower standard of living than 20 years ago. About 90 percent of
the local economy is based on canned fish exports and federal
revenues, and the rest is primarily tourism and clothing exports.
And the increasing population threatens the islands' economic
future.
</P>
<P>
   A gubernatorial task force recently urged measures to combat
population growth, which some estimate will peak at more than
100,000 by 2040 and stress the infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Faleomavaega believes it will take more time for the territory
to develop a new generation of political leaders who can maintain
the balance between being American and being Samoan.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the consensus remains strong among chiefs and elders
to keep changes in the islands' relationship with United Status at
status quo.

<HEADLINE> Putin's Britain Trip an Image Boost  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in
Britain on Sunday for his first visit to the West since last
month's election victory put him firmly in charge of the former
Cold War superpower.
</P>
<P>
   Putin was expected to use the trip to strengthen his nation's
ties with Europe and boost his international image, tarnished by
strong Western criticism of the ongoing Russian offensive against
separatist rebels in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   During his 24-hour stay in London, he meets Monday with Prime
Minister Tony Blair, British business leaders and Queen Elizabeth
II before departing for Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators have pledged to be out in force to protest alleged
widescale human rights violations by Russian forces in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   In an Internet broadcast Friday, Blair said there was ''real
concern'' over what is happening in the breakaway republic, which
he would repeat ''clearly and frankly'' to Putin.
</P>
<P>
   But while Chechnya will be a key part of the discussions, Blair
wants to use the visit to build a better working relationship with
Moscow on behalf of Britain and the entire 15-nation European
Union.
</P>
<P>
   ''The EU is Russia's largest trading partner and we are
increasingly interdependent,'' said Alastair Campbell, Blair's
spokesman. ''It is on our interest that we cooperate more on issues
such as drugs, crime, terrorism, weapons of destruction and the
Balkans.''
</P>
<P>
   Since former Russian President Boris Yeltsin's surprise decision
to step down on Dec. 31 and hand power over to Putin, the new
leader has shown a strong interest in cultivating ties with
Britain. Blair was the first Western leader invited to meet Putin
in Russia, and Putin said it is no accident that he chose London
for his first official trip to the West.
</P>
<P>
   Putin said when he met Blair in St. Petersburg in March, the
British leader demonstrated ''a willingness to cooperate with
Russia,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should respond likewise,'' Putin told reporters in the
Kremlin before his trip, which began with a stop in Belarus on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, who was accompanied by his wife, Lyudmila, is due to end
his visit Monday at Windsor Castle, where the couple will have a
private audience with the queen, a distant relative of Russia's
last monarch, Czar Nicholas II.

<HEADLINE> Nations Vote on Elephant Ivory Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- After Japan and Norway lost a bid for
approval of limited whaling, four southern African countries now
face a similar showdown on the sale of elephant ivory.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates to the U.N. conference on trade in endangered species
in the Kenyan capital will cast their first vote Monday on whether
to approve a plan by South Africa, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Botswana
for a limited sale of ivory.
</P>
<P>
   Kenya and India have proposed a total ban on ivory trade,
claiming a one-time sale of elephant tusks approved at the last
conference in 1997 led to increased poaching.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's vote in committee could be reversed by a ballot of all
2,000 delegates when they convene in later this week. Monday's vote
will be a significant first test of the leanings of the 151
countries represented at the 11th conference of the Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 decision permitted Zimbabwe, Namibia and Botswana a
one-time sale of 54 tons of ivory to Japan, which was banned from
exporting it. The sale took place last year.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the three countries plus South Africa are pressing
for a quota on ivory sales so they can sell their ivory stockpiles
whenever they deem fit. They also want to trade live elephants and
their hides.
</P>
<P>
   India has objected to the limited trade, saying its remaining
population of elephants have a 100-to-1 female-male ratio and
poaching would seriously affect the viability of the herd because
only male Asian elephants have tusks.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1997 relaxation of the ban, poaching has increased in
India, with an average of 100 male elephants killed each year,
according to Saresh Sharma, the head of India's delegation to the
10-day conference.
</P>
<P>
   The Born Free Foundation said in a report released before the
conference that Indian authorities confiscated 3,000 pounds of
illegal ivory in 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
   The Kenya Wildlife Service also says poaching has increased in
Kenya since 1997. The agency confiscated 4,400 pounds of illegal
ivory in 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
   Elephant experts in Kenya claim that African herds have dwindled
from 1.3 million in 1997, when hunting was banned, to the current
650,000, mainly as a result of widespread poaching before a total
ban on ivory trade was imposed in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In a major setback Saturday, Japan and Norway, who had argued
that whaling is part of their culture, lost bids to win
international approval for limited trade in gray and minke whales.
</P>
<P>
   The International Whaling Commission has banned all commercial
whale catches, but both Norway and Japan bypass the moratorium by
exploiting loopholes in the International Convention for the
Regulation of Whaling that permit them to hunt whales for local
consumption and scientific purposes.

<HEADLINE> Congo Blast Death Toll Hits 101   </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) -- The death toll from a string of airport
blasts rose to 101, the government said, as most rescuers ended the
search Sunday for bodies in the wreckage of a hangar that collapsed
in the explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Kinshasa Gov. Theophile Bemba Fundu announced the new casualty
figures. Religious dirges played on state radio and the government
called a period of national mourning after Friday's blasts at
Kinshasa's N'Djili international airport.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital authorities said 216 people were injured. About 80 of
these remained in critical condition on Sunday, Fundu said.
</P>
<P>
   By the afternoon, all but a handful of Red Cross workers and
other rescue volunteers were giving up the search through the
collapsed hangar, used by customs and tax officials to handle
incoming cargo from Europe. The rescue workers said they were
hampered by lack of tools, water and food.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some friends and family members of those still missing
persisted in the search.
</P>
<P>
   One man was rescued late Saturday evening after being buried
alive beneath the hangar for more than 30 hours, a Red Cross
worker, Jean-Jacques Malutama said. The man had broken ribs and
legs and could not speak, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know if there is anyone else alive inside,'' Malutama
said. ''It is difficult work. We are pulling out rubble by hand and
we did not eat yesterday so it would be difficult to continue this
evening.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the blast remained murky. Explanations ranged
from a short circuit to a soldier dropping ammunition while
unloading a plane full of weapons. The explosions of fuel and army
munitions shattered windows, toppled buildings and flung deadly
debris several miles away into residential neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Mvuezolo Nsimb, an airport porter, vowed to carry on digging. A
small cluster of female family members hoping for news about
missing loved ones looked on worriedly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of my friends are missing. I cannot abandon them,'' Nsimb
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue officials had said Saturday that they feared 100 people
were still trapped in the wreckage. It was not known how many
people were still missing Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Congolese health authorities said international relief
organizations had offered medical aid and Belgium was sending a
plane with medical specialists. Yet hospitals issued an urgent
appeal for blood donors to treat the injured.
</P>
<P>
   President Laurent Kabila declared a national ''time of
bereavement,'' Fundu said without giving details. He also announced
an aid package worth $750,000 and said victims' hospital and
funeral expenses would be paid for by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Bargain hunters gathered Sunday behind airport walls and
buildings to buy salvaged computers, televisions and clothing
looted from the customs hangar by soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard the soldiers were selling so I came to the airport
right away,'' said Julien Ndolo, a resident of the nearby Kingasani
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers, police and firemen based at the airport, many of whom
witnessed the blast, were still reeling Sunday morning from the
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was infernal and apocalyptic. Everyone is searching their
heart for answers,'' said Elie Zambeli Rubega, the airport's chief
firefighter.
</P>
<P>
   The explosions initially set off panic in Kinshasa, where people
living near the airport fled for the city center, fearing an
escalation of Congo's 20-month civil war. The blasts took place on
the first day of a cease-fire signed by the warring sides a week
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by Sunday afternoon, workers were cleaning airport halls and
runways.
</P>
<P>
   All international flights over the weekend to and from Kinshasa
were canceled, airline officials said. Yet critical air traffic
equipment was undamaged, Fundu said, and authorities were stepping
up cleanup efforts to restore flights.

<HEADLINE> Airplane's Stairway Jams  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND ISLAND, Neb. (AP) -- Heavy machinery had to be called in
when passengers and crew members were stuck on a chartered airplane
for four hours, unable to disembark because the aircraft's stairway
was jammed.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Pacific plane, a Boeing 737, was supposed to take 113
passengers on a gambling trip to Nevada on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   However, the plane couldn't take off from Central Nebraska
Regional Airport because its stairway retracted only part way and
jammed, airport officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers and six crew members spent the next four hours
waiting for repairs.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, airport workers drove a front-end loader up to the
plane and lowered everyone to the ground with the machine's snow
bucket.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after their unconventional disembarkation, the stairway
was fixed, everyone got back on and the plane took off.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just something to expect when you travel,'' said
passenger Ralph Peshek of Hastings.
</P>
<P>
   The airport has considered buying a stairway that can be rolled
up to an airplane.

<HEADLINE> Elian Fate in Federal Judges' Hands  </HEADLINE>
By MARK STEVENSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- With Elian Gonzalez's fate before federal judges,
protesters prayed for divine help Sunday as Easter week began,
waving palm fronds and posters of the Cuban boy and Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Rosaries and other tokens of religious devotion draped the fence
at the home where the 6-year-old shipwreck survivor has been living
with his Miami relatives. Priests joined the crowd of at least 150
to offer a religious service.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are many people who tell us that we should give up this
fight,'' said Martin Anorga, an evangelical pastor. ''But we will
follow in the path that the Lord has shown us, despite those who
want to get in our way.''
</P>
<P>
   He called on God to ''reduce to ashes'' the Castro government.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the boy at the center of the debate played in the sun
and raced with other children. His father, waiting in a suburb of
Washington since April 6 for a resolution to the case, attended
church.
</P>
<P>
   The wait continued Sunday for a response from a federal appeals
court in Atlanta, which issued a temporary injunction Thursday
blocking Elian from leaving the country. That order defused a tense
standoff when the boy's great-uncle refused the government's demand
to hand over the boy.
</P>
<P>
   The government wants the appeals court to suspend the injunction
and order Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez to release him so he
can return with his father to Cuba. The relatives want the court to
let them meet with Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, without
being required to let Elian go.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has said only Juan Miguel Gonzalez
can speak for his son on immigration matters.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin, the nun and university president who
presided over an earlier meeting with the boy's Cuban grandmothers,
told ABC's ''This Week'' that the family will meet with the father
but is concerned about Cuban influence.
</P>
<P>
   ''The family is prepared to go anywhere at this point where
adult members can speak, come to grips, if they have to yell and
scream, and perhaps end with a reconciliation and healing,''
O'Laughlin said Sunday. ''Holy Week could be the time to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   At the house, the days of tense waiting showed. One protester
urged others to bring in a video camera to document what happens if
the government moves in to take the boy. A few showed up later with
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Many worried that their cause to keep the boy would fail on
Monday -- the 39th anniversary of the Bay of Pigs fiasco, an aborted
invasion of Cuba by CIA-trained exiles that left much bitterness
among the Cuban-American community.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were betrayed by the government, by (President) Kennedy,
and if they turned the child back over, it will be a second
betrayal,'' said Josefa Gonzalez, who left Cuba in 1962 when she
was 4.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's relatives have cared for him since November, when he was
found clinging to an inner tube in the Florida Straits. His mother
and 10 other people fleeing Cuba drowned when their boat sank.
</P>
<P>
   The great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, last week released an ''open
letter'' to the government asking for a reprieve in the custody
battle during Easter week, recalling cease-fires in conflicts in
Kosovo and the Persian Gulf.

<HEADLINE> Elian Gonzalez Legal Saga  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The custody dispute over 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez
has been
before various courts almost since his November rescue, with his
Miami relatives challenging the Immigration and Naturalization
Service's decision to return him to his father in Cuba.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Florida Family Court judge said she had no jurisdiction in
rejecting the relatives' request to intercede and prevent the INS
from taking the boy. Even the U.S. Supreme Court has been involved,
turning down without comment an unusual appeal from a stranger who
asked that the boy be immediately returned to his father.
</P>
<P>
   The other legal angles:
</P>
<P>
   The key case is before the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta. The court has scheduled oral arguments for May 11 on an
appeal by the Miami relatives of a federal judge's ruling that
upheld the government decision to return Elian to his father.
</P>
<P>
   However, the court is weighing a request that could have
immediate impact on the case. One of its judges, J.L. Edmondson,
last week issued an emergency order barring Elian from being taken
out of the United States until the 11th Circuit case is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The government has asked the court to lift that order, and a
three-judge panel is expected to decide soon whether it will do so.
</P>
<P>
   If the order is lifted, then the government could act
immediately to reunite the son and father.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate proceeding before a federal judge in Washington,
the Miami relatives asked for an emergency order that would prevent
Elian from leaving the United States unless U.S. officials can
certify that Cuba won't violate the boy's human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The request is based on U.S. participation in agreements
including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the
Convention Against Torture. The relatives argue that Elian would
risk persecution in Cuba for having sought asylum in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Henry H. Kennedy Jr. has scheduled further
court proceedings for Wednesday on the family's request. The judge
also told the lawyers they could seek an earlier hearing if needed.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers opposed the request, saying in court
papers that Lazaro Gonzalez lacked legal standing because Elian's
father was entitled to speak for him.

<HEADLINE> N.Y Doctor Arraigned in Attack  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A doctor authorities say was trying to forcibly
abort a woman's pregnancy with a bizarre syringe attack was
arraigned Sunday on charges of assault, abortion and criminal
possession of a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stephen Pack, 44, a resident of the posh Westchester County
community of Chappaqua, reportedly had been romantically involved
with the woman, a nurse. He was held on $100,000 bond after
arraignment before Criminal Court Judge Robert Seewald on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old woman suffered five stab wounds to the leg and
one to the buttocks in the attack outside Montefiore Hospital in
the Bronx on Friday. She was admitted to the hospital in stable
condition.
</P>
<P>
   According to a complaint filed by the Bronx district attorney's
office, Pack shouted ''I'm giving you an abortion!'' as he
struggled with the woman and forced her to the ground near the
hospital's parking garage He was arrested minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Rubin, Pack's attorney, said that after the attack, Pack
did not try to flee or discard the needle. Instead, he walked into
North Bronx Central Hospital, next door to Montefiore, where ''he
deposited the syringe in a copper receptacle that is used for that
purpose, and told people what he'd done,'' then waited for
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said the doctor had been ''showing certain symptoms of
depression'' recently.
</P>
<P>
   He said the charge of abortion in the second degree is an
obscure and seldom-used statute covering an illegal attempt by a
pregnant woman or by another party to force a miscarriage. ''It's
the first time I've ever seen it,'' Rubin said of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Pack is married and the syringe attack apparently was his
attempt to abort the 6- to 8-week-old fetus by injecting the woman
with a fluid, believed to be methotrexate, a drug used to induce
labor or an abortion, the complaint said.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Post reported that the woman was undergoing
treatment to counteract the drug. While her life was not in danger,
the effect on the fetus was unknown, the Post said. Rubin said he
understood she was stable and under observation.

<HEADLINE> Israel Delays Release of Prisoners  </HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel postponed on Sunday the promised release
of 13 Lebanese prisoners who are being held as bargaining chips for
a lost Israeli pilot after the pilot's family appealed the move.
</P>
<P>
   Israel also said it would continue to hold two other prominent
Lebanese who were also kidnapped to serve as bargaining chips for
lost pilot Ron Arad.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 were scheduled to be freed Monday following last week's
Supreme Court ruling that the state had no right to detain
foreigners who did not pose a threat to Israeli security.
</P>
<P>
   However, prison spokeswoman Orit Messer-Harel said in a
statement late Sunday that the prison release would not take place
as planned, pending a Supreme Court petition against the release
from Arad's family.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court was scheduled to hear the petition from Arad's
family Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 13 have been detained for over a decade, after being
kidnapped and held as pawns in efforts to secure the release of
navigator Arad, who was captured alive in Lebanon in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Arad's family has accused Israel of abandoning efforts to rescue
him by agreeing to the prisoner release. Messer-Harel said that no
release would take place until the after the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Arad has not been seen alive in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the government says it will not free its two most
prominent Lebanese prisoners, both of them associated with
guerrilla groups.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Ministry spokesman Ido Baum said Sunday the government
will ask for the extension of the ''administrative detention'' --
meaning imprisonment without trial -- of Mustafa Dirani, a former
guerrilla leader and Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid, considered by Israel
to be the spiritual leader of the Hezbollah guerrillas fighting
Israeli forces in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Zvi Rish, the lawyer who petitioned the Supreme Court on behalf
of the prisoners, said he would return to court to force the army
to release Dirani, who was kidnapped in 1986, and Sheik Obeid, who
was abducted from south Lebanon in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Dirani was the security chief of the Amal guerrilla group, also
battling Israel in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Administrative detention must be approved by a judge and
reviewed every six months. Baum said in a news release that keeping
Dirani and Obeid in jail would not violate the Supreme Court ruling
nor international law, because they are ''enemies'' of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah is fighting to oust Israeli forces from the strip of
land in south Lebanon which they have occupied for 18 years to
protect Israel's northern border from guerrilla attacks. Israel
promises to withdraw from Lebanon by July.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court on Monday will also hear a petition from 15
Lebanese prisoners who are being held at Khiam prison in south
Lebanon. The Israeli army maintains that the prison is the
responsibility of an Israeli-backed Lebanese militia, the South
Lebanese Army.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoners' Israeli lawyers, however, argue that because
Israel is the occupying power in the area, it is responsible for
the prisoners' being held without trial.

<HEADLINE> Farmer vows to press on with Baron probe despite setback  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- New Jersey Attorney General John J. Farmer
Jr. vows to continue probing a Hamilton Township social club's
gambling operation, despite a stinging rebuke from a judge who
found prosecutorial misconduct and despair from the township mayor
who suspects a whitewash.
</P>
<P>
   State Superior Court Judge Charles Delehey last week tossed out
indictments charging 14 members of the Baron Athletic Association
with conspiracy and racketeering after finding that a deputy
attorney general led grand jurors astray.
</P>
<P>
   The judge ruled that Deputy Attorney General Samuel Reale Jr.
deflected jurors' questions about whether, in addition to the 14
virtually unknown defendants, the state was investigating ''bigger
fish'' -- local politicians and police officers who also frequented
the social club.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, Reale sidestepped jurors' pointed questions about
other suspects by offering an answer ''so clever that, if it were
not so misleading, would have been admirable,'' the judge wrote in
his damning 25-page opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The two-year probe has polarized Hamilton, a booming bedroom
community of the state capital. It centered on the Baron, a
tight-knit Italian club with a 60-year heritage where business
people rub shoulders with local pols.
</P>
<P>
   The state charged that Baron generated at least $6.6 million in
illegal gambling income between 1981 and 1998, and sold 294,049
illegal lottery tickets between 1984 and 1989 alone.
</P>
<P>
   State Police raided the club in January 1998 after receiving a
tip and seized 22 slot machines and illegal video poker games,
several gambling tables and evidence of an unlawful lottery and
unlicensed tavern.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday, Farmer said he took offense at Deheley's
assertion that his staff purposefully bungled the inquiry. In
dismissing the indictment, the judge ignored the state's strategy
of pressuring the smaller Baron players first, in order to capture
more prominent suspects later.
</P>
<P>
   ''First thing you do is prosecute the core criminal misconduct,
then determine who knew anything but didn't do anything about it,''
the Attorney General said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're confident that our appeal will be successful and am sure
that (the judge's) charges are unfounded, particularly those
pointed at the deputy handling the case. I think they were
inappropriate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Gilmore, the new Democratic mayor of a town long dominated
by the GOP, has a more sinister theory as to why the
Republican-controlled Whitman Administration didn't launch a more
far-reaching investigation sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ''I suspect it's because of their unwillingness to pursue a case
that involves so many people of prominence. That's what is so
offensive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lead Baron defense attorney Kevin Hart dismissed Gilmore's
allegation. The state didn't pursue additional suspects because
there is no case, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem may have been, they turned a molehill into a
mountain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Schragger, a former Mercer County prosecutor who won
several high profile gambling cases in the 1970s, said he also
doubts the Whitman Administration looked the other way at massive
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I doubt there was an intentional cover-up by anyone in the
state,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he also questioned Farmer's strategy of breaking the probe
into two parts instead of investigating all Baron members
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   ''If that was their strategy, it obviously failed,'' Schragger
said.
</P>
<P>
   The day after the stunning dismissals, Gov. Christie Whitman
defended the Attorney General's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do have faith in the legal ability of the Attorney General's
office, and I stand behind them in what they do. I don't try to
second-guess them,'' she told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge's ruling marked a significant setback for an
Attorney General's Office already reeling from the recent loss in a
high profile case involving Michael Francis, a former Whitman
fundraiser. Francis in January was cleared of all charges involving
mob-tainted business ties when a judge ruled the state presented
''not a scintilla of evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Both investigations were launched by Farmer's predecessor,
Associate Supreme Court Justice Peter Verniero.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said critics are not looking at the whole picture.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have shown an extraordinary ability to be effective. We
have had some major organized crime busts. There has been a lot of
very good, hard work done by the Attorney General's office that's
been very successful.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're dealing with a number and variety of cases the
amount the Attorney General deals with, you don't win everything,''
the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore said Whitman's explanation is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ''That grossly understates what happened here,'' he said. ''The
Attorney General didn't just lose a case, he betrayed the trust we
all place in that office.''

<HEADLINE> Okla. Attack Memorial Opening Soon  </HEADLINE>
By THOMAS MULLEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- With the opening of the Oklahoma City
National Memorial still days away, hundreds of people spent a
cloudless Sunday afternoon gazing over its grassy, meticulous
grounds, the site of the worst terrorist attack on American soil.
</P>
<P>
   Some tried in vain to connect the quiet landscape, dominated by
trees and a black reflecting pool, with the gritty images of smoke
and horror they saw on their televisions April 19, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not the way I pictured it,'' said Kristin Welbaum, a
visitor from Minneapolis. ''It's been so cleaned up and made into
such a monument that you don't get a feel for the devastation until
you look across to the Journal Record Building,'' she said,
pointing to the still scarred building near the former Alfred P.
Murrah Federal Building.
</P>
<P>
   For others, like Monica and Harold Swink of Oklahoma City, the
memorial offered a welcome reprieve from memories still filled with
pain.
</P>
<P>
   ''We came down a couple times right after they stopped searching
for victims and it's not hard to remember that,'' said Monica
Swink. ''It's one of those things that will be burned in your mind
forever. And that's why it's so nice to have this calmness.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the explosion struck the nine-story Murrah building, there
is now a grassy hill with nine rows of empty bronze-and-stone
chairs -- one for each of the 168 people killed in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of workers scrubbed and swept the site in preparation
for its Wednesday dedication. Designers Hans and Torrey Butzer,
whose concept for the project was picked from among 624 entries,
led tours and explained how they matched the memorial's features
with hints of its tragic roots.
</P>
<P>
   A display featuring the names of bombing survivors is mounted on
a cracked and damaged portion of the former federal building's
foundation. A message spray-painted on the outside of the Journal
Record Building still calls for justice, five years after it was
crafted by a rescue worker in the days after the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The Survivor Tree, badly damaged in the bombing and once
surrounded with the fiery wreckage of cars, is now featured as the
promontory of the site, surrounded by the words: ''The spirit of
this city and this nation will not be defeated; our deeply rooted
faith sustains us.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Johnson, chairman of the memorial trust, stood out over the
site and proclaimed it a place of lasting serenity for those
scarred by the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very optimistic that those who still feel anger resulting
from the tragedy here five years ago will find a place of solitude,
a place where they can reflect on what has happened and reflect on
the positive things that can come out of this,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Protest Atmosphere Tense, Party-Like  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Alli Starr of San Francisco looked at the line
of police officers, their billy clubs at the ready, facing off with
a group of angry protesters on Pennsylvania Avenue. And she danced.
</P>
<P>
   Following the lead of nearby drummers, the 32-year-old woman and
her three friends gyrated smoothly in a circle, flowing hand
movements in time with the beat. The nearby crowd slowly forgot the
police and began to dance and clap as well.
</P>
<P>
   A tense situation soon turned into a street party.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the protesters in Washington used their own brands of
music Sunday, from saxophones to guitars to harmonicas, as well as
dancing to get their points across.
</P>
<P>
   Starr and her friends, the Emma Said Dance Project of San
Francisco, used dance to help keep the protest crowds calm and
focused on what they were supposed to be doing.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was our solidarity dance,'' she said, catching her
breath. ''A quartet of women dancing in solidarity with people
around the globe and with people in the inner city of this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Every group seemed to have at least an amateur drummer, beating
on a bucket or a nearby street sign.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Call it Andres Thomas Conteris' Tienanmen moment.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-year-old activist from Washington stopped a
military-style truck as it moved through a tense crowd standoff
Saturday night, standing in front of the truck with his hand held
high.
</P>
<P>
   His pose was reminiscent of the famous picture of a student
blocking a tank near Tienanmen Square in the 1989 showdown between
Chinese protesters and troops in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Conteris, with the Center for Economic Justice in Washington,
successfully blocked the truck for several minutes before he was
wrestled away by police.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're seeing an escalation of the violence by police, but
we're remaining nonviolent,'' Conteris said, after police let him
go. ''I put my body in the way of those trucks. What's happening
tonight is a symbolic show of force, but we will not be deterred.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Gene Stilp of Harrisburg, Pa., stood on a platform on an
anti-nuclear float dressed in a tuxedo. He said he was dressed to
the hilt because ''if you have to go to the bathroom, the best
place to go is the Mayflower Hotel (in downtown Washington). And if
you're in a tuxedo they let you right in.''
</P>
<P>
   The energy consultant said he successfully walked into the hotel
''bleary-eyed, like I'd been partying all night.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Judy Sperber of Washington, who pushed a stroller with her
2-year-old daughter Jadie, said she wanted the child ''to be part
of this.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope she'll learn why you have to question stuff.'' The
youngster wore a T-shirt that said ''Question authority.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred people marched Sunday down the K Street business
and lobbying corridor a block from Pennsylvania Avenue. They beat
on plastic buckets and drums, spray-painted slogans on an empty
police bus and dragged heavy metal garbage cans into the street.
</P>
<P>
   The police presence was light, and some people got stuck in
their cars, as protesters swarmed around them and lifted their
banners over the vehicles as they passed by.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Late in the afternoon, as hundreds of protesters listened to
speeches under a warm spring sun on the Ellipse behind the White
House, two dozen mounted police, holding shields and wearing
helmets, sat on their horses under a shade tree at the fringe of
the good-natured crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Farther away, a contingent of protesters marched boisterously
down Constitution Avenue. The officers and their horses watched in
silence.

<HEADLINE> Results Unclear in Italy Elections  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- After a campaign heavy on personal attacks and light
on discussion of issues, Italians voted Sunday in regional
elections doubling as a test of Premier Massimo D'Alema's
popularity.
</P>
<P>
   The vote also is seen as a measuring stick for media magnate
Silvio Berlusconi's conservative opposition. With parliamentary
elections due by spring 2001, how each bloc fares in the voting for
presidents and legislatures in 15 regions could influence which
politicians will be pushed as candidates for the premiership.
</P>
<P>
   Early exit polls showed conflicting results. A major Italian
pollster, Abacus, released data taken over the weekend showing
D'Alema's center-left bloc winning in six regions while Berlusconi
was ahead in four. But a rival polling firm, SWG, issued exit polls
in some of the same regions showing completely different results.
</P>
<P>
   Sunny skies in central and southern Italy seemed to favor a
strong turnout for the Palm Sunday vote. Many people went to the
polls from church, bearing palm fronds or olive branches.
</P>
<P>
   Some 42 million Italians -- about 75 percent of the population --
were eligible to vote.
</P>
<P>
   This year's campaign was the first held under new rules that
sharply restrict political TV ads. Berlusconi claimed the change
unfairly targeted him because of his media realm. The new rules
call for televised debates, many of which ended up being little
more than exchanges of insults by party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has been one of the ugliest electoral campaigns in the
already bungled history of our republic,'' D'Alema commented as the
campaign wound down.
</P>
<P>
   Electoral rallies and forums were dominated by often bitter
exchanges between D'Alema, a former Communist who has headed a
center-left coalition government since October 1998, and
Berlusconi, whose center-right alliance includes former
neo-fascists.
</P>
<P>
   The media focus on how the national coalitions will fare in the
election eclipsed the scarce debate on the business of regional
governments, such as public health administration and
transportation services.
</P>
<P>
   The vote is the first time Italians have had a chance to
directly elect regional presidents. Direct mayoral elections, which
began in 1993, helped create a new class of influential politicians
accountable first to the voters, not to party machines.
</P>
<P>
   Five of Italy's 20 regions chose to schedule voting on other
dates.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. Landmark Goes Residential  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Looking for a primo Manhattan pad to go with
your high-flying Internet startup?
</P>
<P>
   Just $6 million or more could buy an entire upper floor of an
Old Economy landmark -- the neo-Gothic, 60-story Woolworth Building,
once the world's tallest building.
</P>
<P>
   Developer-owner Steven Witkoff is making residences of the top
30 floors of the building Frank W. Woolworth erected in 1913. It
was headquarters of his five-and-dime chain for 85 years and held
the tallest skyscraper claim until the Chrysler Building was built
in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   Across from City Hall and blocks from the financial district,
the building has an ornate terra cotta exterior designed by Cass
Gilbert. The white-marble lobby features Tiffany stained-glass
panels and colored-glass mosaics embedded in its vaulted ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   Architects are planning the redesign of the upper floors now,
and real estate firms have toured the space.
</P>
<P>
   Guesses on the prices put the penthouse at $12 million and lower
floors at half that. The three-story penthouse in the building's
spire will have access via a private glass elevator to Frank
Woolworth's own wraparound terrace.
</P>
<P>
   Even lower floors will have views of the Brooklyn Bridge, New
York Harbor, midtown Manhattan and the Hudson River. Other
amenities could include a wine cellar, cigar lounge, business
center, private dining room and a health club complete with
Woolworth's private pool.
</P>
<P>
   ''There will be tremendous ego gratification to saying that you
live on top of the Woolworth Building,'' said Pam Liebman, CEO of
the upmarket real estate firm the Corcoran Group. ''There's nothing
else in the city like it.''

<HEADLINE> Reporter Observes Elian Phone Call  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Young Elian Gonzalez was seemingly reluctant when
he took a telephone call from his father and fidgeted during the
conversation, but then blew kisses into the telephone when ending
the call, a newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami family keeping 6-year-old Elian from the federal
government and his father invited a reporter from The Miami Herald
into their home Saturday to observe Elian's reaction when his
father called, the Herald said.
</P>
<P>
   The invitation was apparently made to support the family's claim
that no one is keeping Elian from speaking to his father, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez, who flew from Havana to Washington last week
demanding that he be reunited with his son.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Herald:
</P>
<P>
   The family expected the call at 2 p.m., but someone from the
Cuban Interests Section in Washington called at that time to say
the father's call would be at 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   It came at 5:40 p.m. Elian made a facial expression that seemed
to indicate reluctance, with his eyebrows raised and mouth curled.
</P>
<P>
   His cousin and caregiver, Marisleysis Gonzalez, said, ''It's
your daddy,'' and he repeated the expression. Then he took the
cordless phone and talked to his father for about 20 minutes. He
spoke softly and could be heard saying ''yes'' repeatedly in
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   During the call, he paced, walked in circles, and fidgeted. At
the end, he blew kisses into the phone. Then he went into his room.
</P>
<P>
   His relatives told the reporter he was crying.
</P>
<P>
   Lazaro Gonzalez, the uncle who is leading the effort to keep
Elian from going back to Cuba, told the reporter, ''I'm doing this
because I want you to see we're not liars.''
</P>
<P>
   The Herald reported that the family had earlier rejected a CBS
request to let a ''60 Minutes'' crew tape Elian talking to his
father while CBS anchor Dan Rather was with the father. The
relatives said they were advised against the ''60 Minutes'' request
by their priest and a psychologist, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   CBS on Sunday denied the report. The family had offered to let
the crew tape the boy talking by phone with his father and the
network rejected it, spokesman Kevin Tedesco said.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Craig, attorney for Juan Miguel Gonzalez, confirmed his
client spoke with Elian on Saturday and said he thought it was the
third conversation between father and son since his client arrived
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney said the last time Juan Miguel Gonzalez spoke with
his son was a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been trying regularly, more than once a day,'' Craig
said.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Bernstein, an attorney for Elian's Miami relatives, said
the relatives have not interfered with attempts by the boy's father
to speak with his son.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been times when there has been difficulty with
phone conversations,'' Bernstein said Sunday on NBC's ''Today''
show. ''Sometimes Elian doesn't want to speak with his father but
we have encouraged an open dialogue.''

<HEADLINE> Bosnia Massacre Mourned Years Later  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDAR S. DRAGICEVIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AHMICI, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- Croats and Muslims both prayed
for victims on Sunday -- their own, slaughtered by the other side in
the brutal war that tore this region apart.
</P>
<P>
   For Muslims, the day was the seventh anniversary of the Ahmici
massacre, a horrific wave of killing described by a judge as ''one
of the most vicious illustrations of man's inhumanity to man.'' For
Croats, it became a chance to mourn their own dead from the years
of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Since the war ended, Croats and Muslims have learned to coexist
in the half of Bosnia they run. But there was no love lost between
the sides on the anniversary of the massacre.
</P>
<P>
   A road separates mostly Muslim Ahmici from the neighboring Croat
community of Vitez. On Sunday, Vitez residents hoisted a 16-foot
cross facing Ahmici to commemorate Croats who died in the city,
which was besieged by Muslim forces in 1993-1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Croatian anthem blared as the cross was erected, along with
a sign reading: ''In 316 days of the Muslim siege of Vitez, 653
Croats were killed.''
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony didn't sit well with some of those across the road,
where Muslims were mourning their own dead.
</P>
<P>
   ''Putting it up at this place and on this day is pure
provocation and fascism,'' said one Muslim, Ahmic, who refused to
give his full name.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after the Croat ceremony, the voice of a Muslim
priest rang out over the Lasva Valley, calling for prayer for the
more than 100 Muslims who died here.
</P>
<P>
   The massacre occurred on April 16, 1993, when Ahmici's Muslims
were awakened by Croatian militiamen storming into their homes.
Entire families were gunned down and homes were set ablaze. Many of
those who survived the bullets were burned alive.
</P>
<P>
   Before the attack, 356 Muslims and 87 Croats lived in the
village. Immediately afterward, no Muslims remained. Croat homes
were left untouched.
</P>
<P>
   Muslims and Croats battled in a war within the Bosnian war,
which saw both ethnic groups fight the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   International officials assigned most blame for the Muslim-Croat
fighting to radical Bosnian Croats, abetted by Croatia's late
president, Franjo Tudjman, in their goal of wresting a piece of
Bosnia away from the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-five Muslim families have since returned to their homes
in Ahmici, reconstructed with international donations, and are
living alongside the few dozen remaining Croats.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even little children here know what happened that day,'' said
one Muslim, Sulejman Ahmic, who said he lost 18 members of his
family in the slaughter. ''We will never forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indicative of the gravity of the crimes at Ahmici has been the
international response they provoked.
</P>
<P>
   Croat Gen. Tihomir Blaskic was sentenced to 45 years in prison
earlier this year by the U.N. war crimes tribunal for the massacre
and other Bosnian war crimes -- the most severe punishment handed
out by the tribunal to date. Five other Croats began serving prison
sentences of up to 25 years at the start of this year for
participating in the slaughter.

<HEADLINE> Labor Strife Rises Among Nurses  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF DONN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) -- Striking nurses brandish signs and
banners denouncing corporate greed. They scream ''scab!'' through
bullhorns and watch idly as ambulances whiz by.
</P>
<P>
   That scene unfolded recently outside Vincent Hospital in this
central Massachusetts city. And it could become an increasingly
common sight in a profession where cost cutting has greatly
aggravated a shortage of nurses and fanned their labor militancy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are finding negotiations more and more difficult. We are
finding that more and more nurses want to unionize,'' said Michelle
Nawar, a spokeswoman for the American Nurses Association.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Massachusetts, nurses have hit the picket lines in
recent years in California, Vermont and Maryland. Near New York
City, about 400 nurses at Nyack Hospital have been on strike for 16
weeks over pay and staffing levels.
</P>
<P>
   Labor strife is still limited. Federal law had banned nursing
strikes until 1974. Only 17 percent of registered nurses have
unionized so far, according to industry economists.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1997, 67 percent of unionization campaigns succeeded
among nurses, said Judith Shindul-Rothschild, a Boston College
nursing professor and labor economist. That was 10 percent higher
than a decade earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now they are striking, and they are striking in record
numbers,'' said Shindul-Rothschild. ''Clearly, there is a growing
militancy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Wade, a vice president of the American Hospital
Association, says hospitals are in their own frustrating squeeze as
government and private health plans impose tremendous cost-cutting
pressures.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have a lot of options for revenue to hire more
nurses,'' he said. ''Everyone who reimburses us for what we do is
standing in line and wanting to pay us less.''
</P>
<P>
   In Worcester, most of St. Vincent's 535 nurses have been on
strike since March 31 in a dispute largely over mandatory overtime.
The strikers say Tenet Healthcare System, which owns St. Vincent
and about 120 other hospitals, wants to avoid hiring more nurses.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital managers say the mandatory overtime provision ensures
they can staff the hospital in any contingency.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Pro-Nazi Organizer Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- The organizer of an illegal gathering of
pro-Nazi groups from around the world was arrested Sunday on a
check-bouncing charge, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Alexis Lopez was detained on the night before the
scheduled opening of the banned gathering was ''a mere
coincidence,'' said the government's chief spokesman, Claudio
Huepe.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are many people with similar problems who are
detained,'' Huepe said.
</P>
<P>
   The government has banned the scheduled meeting of the small
pro-Nazi New Society Movement and had barred a number of people
from entering Chile to attend.
</P>
<P>
   But Lopez had insisted it would take place anyway in a secret
location outside Santiago. He claimed delegates from Bolivia,
Argentina, Brazil and other South American countries were already
here.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Lopez, who spoke on condition she not be named, said
he has real financial problems and that the check issue isn't a
ruse. However, she told Radio Cooperativa of Santiago that the real
reason for Lopez's arrest was to block the meeting, which was
scheduled to start Monday and last five days.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government knows that without Alexis it can't start, so
arresting him was the only way to prevent it,'' she added. ''You
don't send three police cars to detain a person accused of writing
bad checks.''
</P>
<P>
   President Ricardo Lagos last month said his government would not
allow the gathering to take place in Chile. Nazi ideology violates
the Chilean constitutional clause prohibiting all kinds of
discrimination, the government said.

Robert Emmett
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Robert Emmett, the actor and writer who wrote
the satirical 1960's television show ''That Was the Week That
Was,'' died April 8 after surgery for acute appendicitis. He was
78.
</P>
<P>
   Born Robert McMenamin in Monterey, Calif., he changed his name
to Emmett, his father's first name, as his own surname for stage.
After graduating from the University of California at Berkeley and
serving in the Navy, he pursued an acting career in New York, where
appeared in numerous Broadway and off Broadway productions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, he also began writing for television and, in 1967, the
stage. He wrote segments for dramatic shows and specials from stars
like Barbra Streisand, Julie Andrews and Harry Belafonte. As head
writer for ''That Was the Week That Was,'' he was nominated for an
Emmy for outstanding writing in 1964 and 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in his final performance, he appeared opposite his
wife, actress Kim Hunter, in ''On Golden Pond'' at the New Jersey
Repertory Theater in Long Branch.
Edmund Engelman
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Edmund Engelman, the surreptitious photographer
who took pictures of Sigmund Freud's famous couch, died Tuesday. He
was 92.
</P>
<P>
   A civil engineer by training, Engelman was asked by a friend to
take pictures of the birthplace of psychoanalysis. He succeeded in
1938, days before Freud and his family left Vienna for London after
the Nazi takeover of Austria.
</P>
<P>
   Freud had lived in nondescript four-story apartment house at
Berggasse 19 since 1891. Engelman took a series of about 150
pictures of his offices and living quarters, using natural light
for fear of alerting the Gestapo.
</P>
<P>
   Engelman escaped Vienna months later, reaching the United States
in 1939. He retrieved the negatives from Freud's daughter Anna in
London after World War II, and they became the material for a book,
''Berggasse 19.''
</P>
<P>
   Engelman also took photos of Freud, his wife, Martha, and his
daughter. They are on view at the Freud museums in Vienna and
London. The Austrian government awarded Engelman its Cross of Honor
for Science and Art, first-class, in 1998.
Edward Gorey
</P>
<P>
   HYANNIS, Mass. (AP) -- Edward Gorey, whose bizarre stories and
black-and-white illustrations reflected an elegantly morbid sense
of humor in books, on the stage and for television, died Saturday
at age 75. He suffered a heart attack earlier in the week, The New
York Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Gorey's costume design for the Broadway production of
''Dracula'' won a Tony Award in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote at least 90 books and illustrated 60 others. Most
showed vaguely Edwardian characters in bleak settings, reacting in
prim distress to strange situations such as the intrusion of a
penguinlike, sneaker-wearing creature (''The Doubtful Guest,''
published in 1957).
</P>
<P>
   A set published in 1963 under the title ''The Vinegar Works;
Three Volumes of Moral Instruction,'' featured a grisly alphabet
book, ''The Gashlycrumb Tinies,'' in which ''A is for Amy who fell
down the stairs'' and ''X is for Xerxes, devoured by mice.''
</P>
<P>
   The book was included in ''Amphigorey,'' an anthology of 15
stories published in 1972 by Putnam, that brought Gorey's work to a
wider audience. It was followed in 1974 by ''Amphigorey Too'' and
''Amphigorey Also'' in 1983.
Rafik Haj-Ihiyeh
</P>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Rafik Haj-Ihiyeh, a colorful leader of Israel's
minority Arabs, died Sunday of a heart attack, according to an
aide. He was 51.
</P>
<P>
   Haj-Ihiyeh was the mayor of Taibeh, an Israeli Arab city north
of Tel Aviv, from 1989 until 1998. He then served a year in the
Israeli parliament, representing the Labor party, until last year's
election.
</P>
<P>
   A powerful speaker with a deep voice, Haj-Ihiyeh drew fire for
strong statements denouncing discrimination against Israeli Arabs,
who make up about one-sixth of Israel's population. He often
angered leaders of his own party and was not chosen to run for
another term in parliament.
Edward B.C. Keefer
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Dr. Edward B.C. Keefer, a surgeon who set up the
first transplant bank for human blood vessels and who was the first
to fit a horse with an artificial leg, died April 3. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Establishing a forerunner of today's organ banks, Keefer set up
a bank of arteries taken from donors at the time of their death.
The transplant bank was no longer needed after scientists learned
how to make artificial blood vessels from Dacron.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring to his horse farm on Long Island, Keefer ventured
into a new field, saving injured thoroughbred horses that would
otherwise have been destroyed. In 1973, this interest led him to
make an artificial leg for Spanish Riddle, a stablemate of
Secretariat. The horse was a successful stud stallion for the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Keefer set up a foundation called the Equine Preservation
Society, and an article in Thoroughbred Times called him ''Racing's
Miracle Worker.''
</P>
<P>
   As with the blood vessel bank, the foundation and its work
became obsolescent as techniques invented by Keefer came into
widespread use by veterinarians.
Arnold Kuethe
</P>
<P>
   ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- Arnold Kuethe, a retired University of
Michigan aerodynamics researcher who won a $2.65 million
patent-infringement lawsuit against Learjet, died Wednesday. He was
94.
</P>
<P>
   Kuethe's research focused on aerodynamic turbulence in the flow
of gases around various structures. He wrote a book titled
''Foundations of Aerodynamics,'' now in its fifth printing.
</P>
<P>
   He supervised research in supersonic flow at Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, and was a consultant to various
government and industrial laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, he won a lawsuit against Learjet, the aircraft maker he
accused of not paying him royalties for a device that prevented its
corporate jets from being grounded.
Sasha Von Scherler
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Sasha Von Scherler, an actress who appeared in
more than 100 productions in the city, died Saturday of lung
disease. She was 65.
</P>
<P>
   Von Scherler first set foot on stage in an amateur production in
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   She later attended the Yale School of Drama and made her
professional debut at the Cherry Lane Theater in 1956, in George
Bernard Shaw's ''Admirable Bashville.'' It was the first of a long
line of plays over the next two decades.
</P>
<P>
   She played Mrs. Brown in Eugene O'Neill's ''Great God Brown'' in
1959, Olivia in Joseph Papp's ''Twelfth Night'' in Central Park in
1969, and Avonia Bunn on three separate productions of ''Trelawney
of the Wells.''
</P>
<P>
   To help support her acting, Von Scherler appeared in several
soap operas, and in 1995 she appeared in ''Party Girl,'' a film
written and director by her daughter.

<HEADLINE> Russians Cut Back Chechen Attacks  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Russian forces cut back their attacks on
Chechen rebels Sunday to replenish supplies and hold exercises in
preparation for more mobile, guerrilla-style warfare, the military
command said.
</P>
<P>
   Small-scale fighting continued, with Russian artillery pounding
rebel bases outside the villages of Eshel-Khatoi and Benoi-Vedeno
in the southern mountains, where the war has focused for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Cloudy weather kept most of the Russian air force's planes
grounded. But even its all-weather Su-24 bombers had flown just
nine missions since Saturday, the North Caucasus military command
told the Interfax news agency. Russian bombers had been flying
dozens of sorties over Chechnya daily.
</P>
<P>
   During the lull, Russian troops were preparing for
guerrilla-style ambushes and fighting in rugged regions where they
cannot take large machinery along, the command's press service
said.
</P>
<P>
   After moving into Chechnya in September, Russian troops seized
about two-thirds of the republic in steady advances across the
northern flatlands. But the Russians have bogged down in the
southern mountains, the last major area still under rebel control.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting continued Sunday in the Nozhai-Yurt and Vedeno regions
in the southeast, according to a top Russian commander. ITAR-Tass
and Interfax quoted Gennady Troshev as saying the rebels are
''trying any method to conduct terrorist acts'' and attract new
fighters from the civilian population.
</P>
<P>
   Small rebel groups are hiding out and regrouping in the western
districts of Shatoi, Achkhoi-Martan and Urus-Martan, the command
said. It said the rebels are constantly on the move in the
mountains, trying to infiltrate villages where they can replenish
their ammunition and food supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-Moscow Chechen leader Bislan Gantamirov said fighting
continued Sunday in the Nozhai-Yurt and Vedeno regions in the
southeast.
</P>
<P>
   ''The military operation in Chechnya has not been completed.
Combat operations are continuing in foothill villages and in the
mountains,'' he said in the Chechen capital, Grozny. The remarks
were shown on Russia's ORT television.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, Russian prosecutors released 14 people from a
detention camp at Chernokozovo, said Moscow's top prosecutor for
Chechnya, Vladimir Kravchenko. The suspects fought with rebel bands
but committed no grave crimes, he said, according to the ITAR-Tass
news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups allege inmates at Chernokozovo are routinely
tortured and detained for no reason, but Russia denies the claim.
</P>
<P>
   Russia entered Chechnya after militants based there invaded the
neighboring region of Dagestan. Russia also blamed a series of
apartment bombings last September on Chechens.

<HEADLINE> Locals Curious About D.C. Protests  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite the mounds of trash and the faint
aroma of pepper spray in the air, many Washingtonians on Sunday
watched thousands of people protesting world financial policies
with a mixture of amusement and support.
</P>
<P>
   With downtown Washington virtually empty because of the weekend,
the protesters, the police and the media had the streets mostly to
themselves. However, quite a few Washingtonians wandered down to
the city center just to watch the excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Margery Sher, 52, wanted to figure out what the protesters were
complaining about.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not quite sure what the World Bank and the IMF are doing
wrong, according to these protesters,'' she said. ''I thought they
were trying to help poor countries, but I'm sure there are many
issues to improve on.''
</P>
<P>
   The true test comes Monday when the downtown area reopens for
business. Police over the weekend started shutting down some of the
city's subway stations in the downtown area, in addition to
cordoning off a massive block of streets around the World Bank-IMF
building.
</P>
<P>
   But Sher thinks people won't be upset. ''At least I won't. I
don't mind the inconvenience. It's part of the price you pay for
living in Washington,'' she said. ''I think it's great that people
can protest. There's not many countries where you can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she added as an afterthought, ''As long as they don't get
violent.''
</P>
<P>
   One elderly man began arguing with one of the young female
protesters who was with a crowd that had broken some windows and
damaged some cars near George Washington University. ''What gives
you the right to destroy other people's property to make your
point?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't care about property,'' she shouted back. ''A human
life is worth more than property.''
</P>
<P>
   ''That's because this property doesn't belong to you,'' the man
answered.
</P>
<P>
   For a 55-year-old businessman who first refused to give his
name, and then offered the name ''Jim Smith,'' the protests brought
back memories of his youth in Washington. ''It's just like the
60s,'' he said. ''I bet it's a lot of dope smoking in this crowd
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Billie Black, a 65-year-old Texas native, and her friends stood
out in the protest crowd because they were in their Sunday finest,
but it turned out that they were only trying to navigate their way
around the crowds near George Washington University. But she wasn't
perturbed at all.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's fine,'' Black said in her thick Texas drawl. ''I
think it's great to see all these kids out here trying to do
something for a change.''
</P>
<P>
   George Washington University student David Scott, 27, and his
friends watched some black garbed-protesters shout at some police
officers after being hit with a stream of pepper spray. After
police quieted the confrontation, the protesters sat in patches of
shade in a nearby park.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this kids have good intentions and they want to
protest something,'' Scott said. ''But I do think they haven't
studied enough free trade to know what they're talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We got them to chant, ''Tastes great. Less filling'' a few
minutes ago,'' one of his friends chuckled.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm also inconvenienced because they had to shut down GW
because of this,'' Scott interjected. ''And the protesters smell.''

<HEADLINE> S. African Surgeon General Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- Lt. Gen. Davidson Themba
Masuku, the first black surgeon general of the South African
military, has died at age 60 after an 18-month battle with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Masuku joined the anti-apartheid struggle in 1965 and receiving
military training at African National Congress camps in Tanzania
and medical training at Kiev Medical School and Patrice Lumumba
University in Moscow. He then worked as a doctor at ANC camps in
Angola, where conditions in the war-torn country were brutal.
</P>
<P>
   A civil war was being fought there at the time between the
Marxist Angolan government and right-wing rebels backed by
apartheid South Africa and the United States. The ANC camps were
under constant threat of attack, the Sunday Times, a Johannesburg
newspaper, recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Masuku rose through the ranks to become a member of the ANC's
health committee and was made head of health services for Spear of
the Nation, the ANC's armed wing.
</P>
<P>
   He was appointed surgeon general of the integrated South African
armed forces after apartheid ended in 1994, and made the military's
health services more accessible to civilians. Under Masuku's
leadership, cooperation between military and civilian health
departments increased, resulting in effective inoculation programs
against measles and polio, the Sunday Times said.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of mourners, including Defense Minister Mosiouoa
Lekota and South African National Defense Forces chief Siphiwe
Nyanda, gathered Saturday in Pretoria for Masuku's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Masuku is survived by his wife Annie and three children.

IMF Pledges Relief for Poor Nations
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund concluded a protest-marred
opening session today with a statement repeating past pledges to seek greater
debt relief for the world's poorest countries. The communique, which did not
introduce any major new ideas, also called for reforming the IMF so that it can
better prevent future financial crises. The IMF's current efforts on debt relief
and other matters have been criticized as inadequate by anti-globalization
activists, including those in the streets outside who failed in their efforts to
shut down the opening meetings but did make getting to the sessions difficult.

   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's father lashed out at his Miami relatives
today, accusing them of ''child abuse'' for turning his son against him and
insisting that the 6-year-old boy wants to return to Cuba. With the boy's fate
still before federal judges, Juan Miguel Gonzalez told CBS that he didn't
believe a video taped at the relatives' home in which his son said he didn't
want to go. Meanwhile, at the home of Lazaro Gonzalez, where the shipwreck
victim has lived for nearly five months, protesters prayed for divine help as
Easter week began, waving palm fronds and posters of the Cuban boy and Jesus.
Priests joined the crowd of at least 150 to offer a religious service.

Zimbabwe President Backs Takeovers

   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- President Robert Mugabe on Sunday defended the
takeovers of white-owned farms by armed squatters whom he portrayed as heroes
fighting inequality in land ownership. Mugabe, returning from an economic summit
in Cuba, reaffirmed his support for the farm occupations, reputedly led by
veterans of Zimbabwe's independence war that ended 20 years ago. Mugabe says the
occupations are a justified protest against the unequal distribution of land in
a former British colony where 4,000 white farmers own one-third of the
productive farmland.

Clinton To Visit Navajo Community

<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- President Clinton is scheduled to visit the
northwest New Mexico Navaho community of Shiprock tomorrow in a tour focusing on
the so-called ''digital divide'' that is leaving minority communities behind.
Many in Shiprock hope Clinton's presence will spotlight conditions on the Navajo
reservation that have kept most of its 8,000 residents from participating in the
Internet information age. Poverty and the extremely rural nature of the
sprawling reservation mean many homes don't have telephone connections, let
alone computers.

Back-Country Injured, Survives
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MOOSE, Wyo. (AP) -- A skier broke his ankle during a solo trip into the back
country of Grand Teton National Park and then slid and crawled five miles over
three days to reach help. Vito Seskunas, 53, of Baltimore, was listed in stable
condition today in the intensive care unit of St. John's Hospital in Jackson
after surgery, officials said. Seskunas said he was injured Tuesday, the first
day of a planned five-day trip, while skiing a steep ravine in Death Canyon
several miles west of Moose, a park spokesman said. He set up a tent and stayed
in place that night, but on Wednesday he decided to crawl out, knowing he would
not be reported missing for several days.

Indians Top Rangers 2-1

   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Jim Thome's one-out homer into the Indians' bullpen
followed Manny Ramirez's shot in the ninth inning as Cleveland rallied today to
beat the Texas Rangers 2-1. The two drives -- the 201st career homers for both
players -- came off John Wetteland (0-1) and helped Chuck Finley win his home
debut for the Indians, who were held to two hits through eight innings. Despite
striking out 13 and pitching a five-hitter, Finley (1-0) looked like he was
going to be a hard-luck loser when he walked off the mound to a standing ovation
in the ninth.

Trail Blazers Crown Kings 102-95

   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Rasheed Wallace picked up yet another technical foul
before teaming with Bonzi Wells to power a dominant fourth-quarter run as the
Portland Trail Blazers defeated the Sacramento Kings for the 11th straight time,
102-95 today. Wallace scored 18 points and Scottie Pippen added 15 points and
nine assists for the Blazers, who held the Kings to two field goals -- a dunk by
Scot Pollard and a 20-foot jumper by Jason Williams -- in the first 10:39 of the
fourth. The Kings' lead over Seattle for the No. 7 playoff spot in the West
slipped to just a half-game. The SuperSonics played at Houston later in the day.

<HEADLINE> Fisherman rescued after car plunges off dock  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) -- Curtis Moore says he's ''blessed to
be alive'' after mistakenly driving his car off a dock while
fishing Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, 49, of Franklin Township in Somerset County, was fishing
in the Raritan River at 5:30 a.m. when he tried to move his car so
its headlights would shine on his fishing pole in the early morning
darkness.
</P>
<P>
   He said he thought the car, parked on a dock near the water, was
in reverse, but it was actually in drive. When he pressed the
accelerator, the car shot forward into the river.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who can't swim, struggled to get out of the car and
finally made his way to a pole, which he clung to for about 20
minutes until he was rescued by a passing fisherman.

<HEADLINE> Putin Arrives in Britain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin arrived in
Britain on Sunday for his first visit to the West since last
month's election victory put him firmly in charge of the former
Cold War superpower.
</P>
<P>
   Putin was expected to use the trip to strengthen his nation's
ties with Europe and boost his international image, tarnished by
strong Western criticism of the ongoing Russian offensive against
separatist rebels in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   During his 24-hour stay in London, he meets Monday with Prime
Minister Tony Blair, British business leaders and Queen Elizabeth
II before departing for Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators have pledged to be out in force to protest alleged
widescale human rights violations by Russian forces in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   In an Internet broadcast Friday, Blair said there was ''real
concern'' over what is happening in the breakaway republic, which
he would repeat ''clearly and frankly'' to Putin.
</P>
<P>
   But while Chechnya will be a key part of the discussions, Blair
wants to use the visit to build a better working relationship with
Moscow on behalf of Britain and the entire 15-nation European
Union.
</P>
<P>
   ''The EU is Russia's largest trading partner and we are
increasingly interdependent,'' said Alastair Campbell, Blair's
spokesman. ''It is on our interest that we cooperate more on issues
such as drugs, crime, terrorism, weapons of destruction and the
Balkans.''
</P>
<P>
   Since former Russian President Boris Yeltsin's surprise decision
to step down on Dec. 31 and hand power over to Putin, the new
leader has shown a strong interest in cultivating ties with
Britain. Blair was the first Western leader invited to meet Putin
in Russia, and Putin said it is no accident that he chose London
for his first official trip to the West.
</P>
<P>
   Putin said when he met Blair in St. Petersburg in March, the
British leader demonstrated ''a willingness to cooperate with
Russia,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should respond likewise,'' Putin told reporters in the
Kremlin before his trip, which began with a stop in Belarus on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   During his stop in Minsk, Putin and authoritarian President
Alexander Lukashenko discussed creating common tax policies,
customs systems and tariff regulations. They also talked about
Belarusian proposals to form a 300,000-strong joint troop force to
guard Belarus' western border.
</P>
<P>
   Belarus and Russia signed a union treaty in December, but many
questions remain about how it will be administered. Reformers in
Russia oppose any union with impoverished Belarus, whose president
has cracked down on dissent and freedoms won after the 1991 Soviet
collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Putin ends his London visit Monday at Windsor Castle, where he
has a private audience with the queen, a distant relative of
Russia's last monarch, Czar Nicholas II.

<HEADLINE> Coke Protesters Rally in N.C.  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN BACHMAN, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- A group protesting Coca-Cola's treatment
of black employees said Sunday their trip to Coke's shareholders
meeting is an effort to stiffen the resolve of company leaders to
make the beverage giant more inclusive for blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Jones, a former Coke human resources manager who is
leading the trip, told members of Bethel A.M.E. Church here that
Coke's black employees hope to ''sit around the board table in
common sense and brotherhood'' with the company.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are tired of carrying the weight while others carry the
wealth,'' said Jones, predicting the five-day ''ride for corporate
justice'' will be ''a catalyst for a tremendous economic movement
in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Affirmative action and diversity are all just buzz words to
keep us from the table,'' he said. ''We've done everything they
asked us to do, and we're still not in.''
</P>
<P>
   The group left Atlanta on Saturday en route to Coke's annual
meeting Wednesday in Wilmington, Del. Rallies similar to the one
here, where four college students began a lunch counter sit-in
movement in February 1960, are planned Monday in Richmond, Va., and
Tuesday at the U.S. Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to that counter at the now-closed Greensboro
Woolworth's, Jones said blacks would stop buying Coke products
unless there are fundamental changes in the company.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will do our business over the counter and stop drinking
Coca-Cola,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trip coincides with settlement negotiations in a federal
lawsuit filed by eight current and former black employees who
accuse Coke of denying blacks fair pay, promotions, raises and
performance reviews.
</P>
<P>
   The company on Sunday repeated its denial of the discrimination
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''We continue to work toward an expeditious and equitable
resolution of the lawsuit,'' said spokesman Ben Deutsch.

<HEADLINE> Injured Back-Country Skier Found  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOOSE, Wyo. (AP) -- A skier broke his ankle during a solo trip
into the back country of Grand Teton National Park and then slid
and crawled five miles over three days to reach help.
</P>
<P>
   Vito Seskunas, 53, of Baltimore, was listed in stable condition
Sunday in the intensive care unit of St. John's Hospital in Jackson
after surgery, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Seskunas said he was injured Tuesday, the first day of a planned
five-day trip, while skiing a steep ravine in Death Canyon several
miles west of Moose, park spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   He set up a tent and stayed in place that night, but on
Wednesday he decided to crawl out, knowing he would not be reported
missing for several days.
</P>
<P>
   He abandoned most of his food and water because he couldn't
carry very much. At night, he took shelter under fir trees, lying
on top of branches he piled on the snow.
</P>
<P>
   In some places he was able to use his ski poles like crutches,
but he said he covered most of the distance by sliding on his
backside.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, two other skiers encountered him and called park
rangers.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Guards Threaten Reformers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- An elite military wing in Iran warned
pro-reform leaders and writers Sunday that any attempt to undermine
the country's Islamic ideology would be met with ''Islamic
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The strongly worded statement by the Islamic Revolutionary
Guards Corps conforms to an increasingly strident tone taken by
hard-liners against reformists who swept parliamentary elections in
February.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope the time doesn't come for this, but if it does,
Islamic violence will be employed without any hesitation to defend
truth and justice. Then, it will be too late for them to learn
lessons,'' the statement said, according to the official Tehran
radio.
</P>
<P>
   The IRGC is an elite military force separate from the regular
army. It has hundreds of thousands of men in arms and its own air
force and weapons industry. Like the rest of the armed forces, it
is controlled by hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-liners, who also control the broadcast network and the
judiciary, have found themselves struggling for survival against
the reformist movement, which became a significant force after
President Mohammad Khatami's 1997 election.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-liners in the ruling clergy have become increasingly
strident in their verbal attacks in recent weeks after reformists
swept February's parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday, a hard-line controlled election supervisory body,
the Guardians Council, said it will recount votes in Tehran, where
reformists won 29 of 30 seats.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the Guardians Council said it has asked the
pro-reformist Interior Ministry to hand it over all ballot boxes
from Tehran. It did not give a reason for the recounting or say how
many votes would be recounted.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami and his allies want to loosen the strict Islamic laws
and social restrictions that have been in place since the 1979
Islamic revolution brought the Shiite clergy's rule.
</P>
<P>
   The most visible sign of Khatami's reform program has been the
emergence of an outspoken press that has questioned the actions of
the hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami, however, has no control over the broadcast network,
whose chief is appointed by the hard-line supreme leader, Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei. The state-run television and radio gave prominent
coverage to the Guards' statement.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, newspapers reported that a colleague of a leading
Iranian reformist who was shot in March has been jailed on the
orders of the hard-line judge investigating the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad Hakimipour, a city councilman, was arrested Friday while
visiting his family in his native town of Zanjan, west of the
capital Tehran, Hakimipour's brother, Mahmoud, told the daily
Asr-e-Azadegan.
</P>
<P>
   He said Hakimipour was a close of friend of Saeed Hajjarian, who
was shot March 12. Hakimipour was with Hajjarian during the attack
and was the one who rushed him to the hospital, according to the
paper.
</P>
<P>
   The paper did not say why Hakimipour was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Hajjarian, a city councilman and confidant of reformist
President Mohammad Khatami, was gravely injured in the attack and
remains in intensive care at a Tehran hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The Tehran City Council will hold a meeting Sunday to decide on
a reaction to Hakimipour's arrest, Asr-e-Azadegan quoted council
member Morteza Lotfi as saying.

<HEADLINE> Reds 5, Dodgers 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Michael Tucker and Ed Taubensee homered and
Steve Parris bounced back from two sub-par efforts with six strong
innings as the Cincinnati Reds beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 5-3
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Green homered and doubled twice for the Dodgers. Gary
Sheffield homered in all three games of the series for Los Angeles,
but twice left the bases loaded in the finale.
</P>
<P>
   Parris (1-2) allowed a run and three hits. In his previous
outings, he surrendered a combined 10 earned runs over nine innings
against Chicago and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, who has a hit in all 12 Dodgers games this season,
hit his fifth home run leading off the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, Sheffield struck out with the bases loaded
against reliever Scott Williamson to end the inning. Sheffield has
struck out only four times in 42 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Green doubled twice for the other hits off Parris, then homered
against Manny Aybar leading off the eighth inning. Moments later
Chad Kreuter drew his fourth consecutive walk and scored on Jose
Vizcaino's triple, narrowing the gap to 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Graves got the last four outs for his second save.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati took a 1-0 lead in the second against Chan Ho Park
(2-1) when D.T. Cromer doubled and scored on an error by third
baseman Adrian Beltre.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds increased it to 3-0 in the fourth when Cromer was hit
by a pitch and Tucker homered.
</P>
<P>
   Taubensee led off the eighth against Jeff Williams with his
second homer of the season and second in two days. Aaron Boone
doubled home a run later in the inning against Matt Herges.
</P>
<P>
   Park was charged with three runs, two earned, and four hits in
seven innings. It was only the second loss for the right-hander in
his last nine regular-season decisions.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Sheffield has hit six grand slams in his career... Alex
Ochoa played for the first time since straining his right hamstring
last Monday at Colorado. He singled as a pinch-hitter for Parris
and was immediately replaced on the bases by pitcher Pete Harnisch.
... ... The Reds have made an error in nine straight games. It is
the first time Cincinnati has committed an error in more than eight
consecutive games since an 11-game stretch in 1974. ... Dante
Bichette, who struck out with runners at second and third as a
pinch-hitter for Williamson, is 0-for-15 with runners in scoring
position. Last season with Colorado, he hit .343 with 91 RBIs in
those situations. ... Dodgers reliever Antonio Osuna, who underwent
elbow surgery last September, is scheduled to pitch for San
Bernardino in a rehab outing on Monday before making his next one
with Triple-A Albuquerque. Manager Davey Johnson said he expects
the right-hander to be activated by May 1.

<HEADLINE> Day Ties Record For Keeneland Wins  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Jockey Pat Day tied Don Brumfield's record
for most career victories at Keeneland on Sunday with his 716th
win.
</P>
<P>
   Day guided Best Mate to victory in Sunday's second race. He had
seven more mounts but could not earn the record-setting win.
</P>
<P>
   Day, 46, will try to break Brumfield's record on Wednesday.
Keeneland's spring meet concludes on April 28.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's awesome,'' Day said. ''Milestones are special. At this
stage of my career, they are real special. I have so much
appreciation for the game that it means so much to me to do
something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Brumfield was one of the track's leading jockeys in the 1960s
and 1970s. He was the top winner at the track for four straight
spring meets from 1972-1976.

<HEADLINE> Detroit Murder Suspect Said Abused  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- The former sailor suspected of killing
prostitutes in ports around the world was abused by his father and
traumatized by the death of an infant brother, his family says.
</P>
<P>
   John Eric Armstrong was charged last week with five murders in
the Detroit area. Authorities worldwide are trying to match his
account of at least 11 other slayings while he was serving on the
Navy aircraft carrier USS Nimitz, where shipmates knew him as
''Opie.''
</P>
<P>
   Relatives find it difficult to imagine how a quiet child who
earned decent grades, played Nintendo and enjoyed fishing and
baseball could emerge as a suspected serial killer.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Eric we raised could not have done these things,'' his
mother, Linda Pringle, said in Sunday's Detroit News. ''This is
just not the person we know. ... We just did the best we could.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're having a real problem reconciling all of this,'' said
his stepfather, Ron Pringle.
</P>
<P>
   In youth, Armstrong, now 26, talked of becoming a police
officer. He preferred to be called Eric -- not John, the name of the
father who his mother said abused the boy before walking away from
the family.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's father ''was abusive to me as well -- and Eric saw
that,'' said Linda Pringle, a 49-year-old teacher's assistant in
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, family members remember Armstrong as a loving son who
only got counseling for a brief time after his young brother Mikey
died.
</P>
<P>
   At age 5, Armstrong rode his bike into speeding traffic. ''He
said he wanted to be with his baby brother,'' his mother said.
</P>
<P>
   After high school, he worked for several months at a grocery
store, then enlisted in the Navy in 1992 and left the next year.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nimitz, he worked as a barber and took required safety
education classes, including one that warned against soliciting
prostitutes. Aboard the Nimitz, he met Katie Rednoske, a Dearborn
High graduate who in 1998 became Armstrong's wife. She's now
pregnant with their second child.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone on the ship's talking about it,'' said Petty Officer
Stephen Olson, who arrived after Armstrong was discharged. ''For
God's sake, he was a barber.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong had no charges of misconduct and got two good-conduct
medals, military personnel records show. He was designated a
third-class petty officer in 1995, a rank he had at his discharge
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   After Armstrong left the Navy, he applied for a job with the
Virginia State Police and got far enough in the process that the
agency called a neighbor as a reference, the News said.
</P>
<P>
   On April 10, investigators found the bodies of three strangled
prostitutes in a railroad yard in southwest Detroit. Police
arrested Armstrong two days later and charged him in five deaths.
He is suspected of 11 other slayings: three in the Seattle area,
two in Hawaii, two in Hong Kong and one each in North Carolina,
Virginia, Thailand and Singapore.

<HEADLINE> Quigley One Stroke Back At Seniors  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LONG, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. (AP) -- Dana Quigley made 10 birdies and
a quadruple bogey Sunday in the second round of the PGA Seniors'
Championship to move within one stroke of Doug Tewell.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley was 9 under through one hole in the third round before
play was suspended for the seventh time in four days. Tom Kite and
Larry Nelson are 7 under, and Gibby Gilbert 6 under.
</P>
<P>
   More than 9 inches of rain has drenched the Champion Course at
the PGA National Resort &AMP; Spa. The weather will prevent the
tournament from completing 72 holes.
</P>
<P>
   PGA of America officials reduced the championship to 54 holes
following Sunday's delay, marking the first time the event has been
shortened since its expansion to 72 holes in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a tournament to remember, though, especially for
Quigley, who carded an 8 on No. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley, a former club pro from nearby West Palm Beach, was 9
under through 10 holes in the second round Sunday, one behind
Tewell when he approached No. 11.
</P>
<P>
   The 412-yard, par-4 11th has been the toughest hole at the 61st
annual Seniors' Championship, playing nearly half a stroke over
par. Quigley knows why.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley hit a 3-wood off the tee at No. 11, hooking it left and
getting a bad bounce off the cart path and into a hazard. With the
ball sitting up, he was able to play it out of the hazard with a
wedge.
</P>
<P>
   He bladed the shot across the fairway and into the rough on the
other side. From there, he tried to slice a 6-iron onto the green,
but the shot went dead straight and came up about 20 yards short of
the green.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley chunked his first chip shot and then needed two more to
get on the green, landing about 8 feet from the hole. He two-putted
from there.
</P>
<P>
   He rebounded, though, and birdied Nos. 12, 14, 15 and 16 to get
back to 9 under.
</P>
<P>
   The quadruple bogey was Quigley's second this year. He made one
on the 7th hole in the final round of the Tradition in Scottsdale,
Ariz., two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   It highlighted -- or lowlighted -- an exciting second round for
Quigley, who is playing in his 87th consecutive tournament.
</P>
<P>
   He had one his best days with the putter, which he attributed to
a new grip he picked up from watching Vijay Singh win the Masters.
He had 10 birdies, which -- if not for the quadruple bogey -- would
have been enough to break Arnold Palmer's course record of 63 set
in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Divots: The cut was 6-over 150. ... Two-time Seniors' Championship
winner Lee Trevino withdrew after finishing the second round at
3-over 147. In all, seven players have withdrawn from the 144-man
field. ... Hal Irwin, who won three consecutive Seniors'
Championships from 1996-98, said he will not be able to finish the
tournament. Irwin, 4 under through two holes in the third round,
has a commitment to a charity event in St. Louis. ... Japan's Seiji
Ebihara, a first-round co-leader at 4 under, fell to 1 over after
the second round. ... The back 9 played a lot tougher than the
front through two rounds, with six of the seven highest-scoring
holes on that side. ... The tournament, one of four majors on the
senior tour, is being sponsored by Advil.

<HEADLINE> Avalanche Looking To Sweep Phoenix  </HEADLINE>
By MEL REISNER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Forget the Whiteout. The Phoenix Coyotes are
trying to avoid a whitewash.
</P>
<P>
   Two games into the first round, the Coyotes are down 0-2 to the
Colorado Avalanche and face being swept in a playoff series for the
first time since 1987, when Edmonton ousted them in the second
round. Coincidence or not, that was the last postseason in which
they advanced past the first round.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid a ninth consecutive first-round exit, the Coyotes need
every friendly howl from their white-clad fans, who try to give a
snowy look to home ice in honor of a tradition that began when the
franchise was still in Winnipeg.
</P>
<P>
   Game 3 is Monday night at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix also needs to find a way to slow down speedy attackers
like Peter Forsberg, Joe Sakic, Milan Hejduk and rookie Alex
Tanguay, perform the nearly impossible by solving Colorado goalie
Patrick Roy and stop taking costly penalties.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado's 3-1 victory Saturday, the Avalanche had 10 power
plays and scored on three. Two of the goals came with a 5-on-3
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they're going to play like that, it's OK,'' Sakic said.
''We'll just have a lot of power-play opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche had two power-play goals during a four-goal first
period in Game 1, then coasted to a 6-3 victory that set the tone
for the series. In each game, the winning goal was scored in the
first period.
</P>
<P>
   ''Special teams are so important in the playoffs,'' Colorado
coach Bob Hartley said. ''We want to make sure we keep taking
advantage of our special teams. We have great skaters and lots of
skill, and right now we're executing very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche, who haven't lost in the first round since 1995,
also know what kind of grit it takes to advance.
</P>
<P>
   Forsberg, who separated a shoulder in the next-to-last game of
the regular season, returned eight days later in Game 2 and had an
assist -- as if his inspired leadership wasn't enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes went at him from the first shift, but he pronounced
himself fine afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't be playing if there was a chance of reinjuring
it,'' Forsberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix has its own star playing hurt -- captain Keith Tkachuk
missed 30 games because of injuries, including 22 of the last 27
trying to rest a sprained ankle, hasn't scored a point since Jan.
31 and has just one shot in the series. His attempt to return
hasn't worked as well as Forsberg's in a medical sense, either.
Tkachuk still limps noticeably, and his movement around the net
appears restricted.
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes scoring leader Jeremy Roenick has no points in the
postseason either. His frustration was evident at the end of the
second game, when he tangled with Roy after the goalie went behind
the net.
</P>
<P>
   Roenick declined comment on the officiating, citing the chance
of being fined, but left no question he felt it was one-sided.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ray Bourque is the Messiah. You can't touch him,'' Roenick
said about the great defenseman whose late-season arrival in
Colorado helped turn a middling power play into the weapon it has
been against Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Bob Francis agreed, then said he didn't want refereeing to
be an issue, just consistency.
</P>
<P>
   ''We talked about interference coming into the series, but we
didn't realize that everyone has one set of rules and Ray Bourque
has another set,'' Francis said. ''We're on a power play, and he
has an infraction and it wasn't called. We do the same thing and
it's called. I think the infraction has to be pretty severe to put
a team 5-on-3. They had two of them.''

<HEADLINE> Fire strikes college dormitory where three died in Jan. 19 blaze  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) -- An ignited glass of alcohol touched
off a fire Sunday at the same Seton Hall University dormitory where
three freshman died in a January fire.
</P>
<P>
   One student suffered minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The fire, which officials said started when a glass of alcohol
was ignited, occurred on the fourth floor of Boland Hall South
about 3:50 a.m. It burned a T-shirt and carpeting before a resident
assistant extinguished it, said college spokeswoman Lisa Grider.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters evacuated the building and reopened it at 4:20 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The unidentified student suffered burns to the forearm. He was
treated and released at the scene. The student who started the fire
wasn't charged, but it was unclear whether he or she would face
disciplinary action by the college.
</P>
<P>
   ''University personnel are meeting with students to determine
appropriate action,'' Grider said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Caltabilota Jr. of West Long Branch, John Giunta of
Vineland, and Aaron Karol of Green Brook, died in the Jan. 19 fire,
which occurred on the third floor of six-story Boland Hall.
</P>
<P>
   That fire broke out around 4:30 a.m. on the third floor of the
six-story dormitory, which houses about 640 people.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Remembers Tragedy  </HEADLINE>
By COLLEEN SLEVIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Lindsay Hamilton and Dan Arnold felt
tired standing near the starting line of the Columbine Memorial 5-K
Run and Walk early Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbine High juniors had a late night. They came straight
to the race the prom and the parties that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay was glad to have the prom to look forward to before the
beginning of the week marking the first year anniversary of the
Columbine school shootings, the nation's most deadly, and she
enjoyed the run.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's heartwarming. But it's also hard because it's starting
the week.''
</P>
<P>
   The race, which raised money for three $5,000 scholarships, was
the first anniversary event sponsored by the school, and 2,400
people participated in an event that began at Clement Park next to
the high school.
</P>
<P>
   Up the street at Trinity Christian Center, the site of the
funerals of four Columbine victims, people reflected Sunday on
holding on to hope despite last year's shootings, which left 12
students and a teacher dead. The two teen gunmen then killed
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor Billy Epperhart used the example of Jesus raising Lazarus
after he had been dead four days and placed in a tomb.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that God can stand at the tomb of this community and
say come forth,'' said Epperhart.
</P>
<P>
   The church is also only a few hundred feet from the sandwich
shop where two Columbine students were killed Feb. 14. Epperhart
acknowledged that the community is still raw, but he said people
should accept what happened and forgive those involved so that they
are not paralyzed by it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm telling you this community will not just be known for
tragedy but for recovery,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Nets Will Fire Coach Casey  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- If the New Jersey Nets are planning
to clean house after the season, owner Lewis Katz hasn't told coach
Don Casey yet.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lewis has said he'll sit down with me at the end of the
year,'' Casey said Sunday after a newspaper reported that he would
be fired shortly after the Nets (31-49) end the regular season
Wednesday. ''He said that to me at least three times. I have
nothing else to go by but that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Star Ledger of Newark reported in its Sunday editions that
team owners have decided to fire Casey, general manager John Nash
and president Michael Rowe.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper based its report on discussions with two
unidentified owners of YankeeNets, the sports-entertainment group
that oversees the joint merger of the Yankees and Nets, and a third
person familiar with the team's decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   ''No decisions have been made regarding any personnel associated
with the New Jersey Nets,'' Katz said in a statement released
through a spokesman. ''All matters relating to the team will be
taken up following the end of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey, who took over as coach on an interim basis after John
Calipari was fired on Mar. 15, 1999, signed a two-year $2.4 million
contract last June. Only the first year and $1.1 million of the
deal is guaranteed. The team has three weeks after the season ends
to tell him whether it will pick up the second year.
</P>
<P>
   Rowe, who left a job as a Meadowlands sports complex executive
to run the Nets in 1995, said he had heard nothing from owners
about his job future and didn't expect to until the end of the
season. He has 18 months left on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Nash, who joined the Nets in 1996, has two years left on his
contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets, who lost 15 of their first 17 games, were eliminated
from playoff contention on Apr. 7. They will take a nine-game
losing streak into their final two games of the season Tuesday at
Atlanta and Wednesday at home against Cleveland. A loss in either
game will give them their 12th 50-loss season in 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not the most perfect week, but there have been other
tough weeks,'' Casey said after practice Sunday. ''When you have
conjecture surrounding, it becomes difficult. But the nature of the
players and the team kind of keep you going, yet you have a job to
do. You don't roll over and say, 'They're after me.'''
</P>
<P>
   After beginning the season dismally, the Nets rallied behind
Keith Van Horn and Stephon Marbury to climb within two games of the
eighth and final spot in the Eastern Conference on March 12 with an
overtime victory over Milwaukee. But plagued by season-ending knee
injuries to Marbury and Kerry Kittles, they fell out of contention.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to talk as an end-all, but I thought we came into
a very turbulent situation, calmed it down and had a very strong
situation with Stephon and Keith,'' Casey said. ''We got them to
play. The meshing and melding of those two, certainly enabled us to
get out of a losing streak and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey is well liked by the players, and they stood by him
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Casey, you have to admire him,'' said veteran Kendall Gill.
''He's doing his job. We're looking at Atlanta. It's not like he's
giving up on anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Casey's just trying to do the best job he can,'' Van
Horn added. ''I'm sure he knows it's not anything he has control
over.''

<HEADLINE> Steelers Think New QB Fits Well  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Steelers didn't live up to
pre-draft predictions by choosing a quarterback to replace Kordell
Stewart. Instead, they drafted one who very much resembles him.
</P>
<P>
   Tee Martin, who replaced Peyton Manning as Tennessee's
quarterback and led the Vols to the 1998 national championship
before having an erratic senior season, went to the Steelers on the
fifth round Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The somewhat unexpected pick livened up what otherwise was a
routine day of Steelers drafting that, just like the day before,
began with a wide receiver -- this time, UCLA's Danny Farmer on the
fourth round.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Steelers passed up Marshall quarterback Chad
Pennington to take Michigan State's Plaxico Burress with the No. 8
pick. After weighing their immediate needs -- a quarterback who
might need a year or two against a receiver who might contribute
immediately -- they went with Burress.
</P>
<P>
   Still, after spending weeks choosing between the two, they still
tried to get Pennington, offering the New York Jets picks on the
second, third and fourth round for the 18th pick the Jets used on
Pennington. The Jets turned them down.
</P>
<P>
   So, after failing to land Pennington, the Steelers took Martin
as a consolation prize, even though many of his strengths and
deficiencies match Stewart's.
</P>
<P>
   Like Stewart, the 6-foot-1{, 227-pound Martin can run and throw;
he passed for 2,317 yards, 12 touchdowns and nine interceptions
last season and carried 81 times for 317 yards and nine touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   However, the player described by one scouting service as the
most physically gifted quarterback in the draft also has the rap of
not adjusting quickly to defenses, not throwing sideline routes
well and not seeing the entire field.
</P>
<P>
   He also has trouble looking off receivers, and his accuracy is
suspect, although he set the NCAA record for consecutive
completions.
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of similarities, no question,'' offensive
coordinator Kevin Gilbride said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin thinks they are good comparisons.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am happy to be mentioned in the same sentence as Kordell,''
Martin said. ''It is a great comparison. We both have the athletic
ability to run. We both can throw the ball. I know Kordell is his
own man. I just want to be myself and come in and fit in where I
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbride wouldn't speculate whether Martin's supposed lack of
arm strength caused him to slip to the fifth round in what was
considered a weak draft for quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know. You would have to climb into other people's
minds,'' Gilbride said. ''There's been speculation about accuracy;
this year he wasn't quite as productive as last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers will begin training camp with four quarterbacks:
Stewart, newly signed Kent Graham, Martin and Anthony Wright, a
second-year pro from South Carolina who didn't see game action last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be a challenge to give everybody enough work,''
Gilbride said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Opposition Regroups  </HEADLINE>
By SEAN YOONG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Malaysia's opposition struggled to
regroup Sunday after a police crackdown on a rally supporting
jailed ex-deputy premier Anwar Ibrahim landed dozens of activists
and key leaders in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Police on Saturday broke up the assembly in the capital's
Independence Square by beating, handcuffing and dragging away the
protesters.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Black 14th'' had been intended as a peaceful rally to mark
the first anniversary Saturday of Anwar's conviction. Instead it
turned into a melee.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're living in dark times,'' Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail,
told The Associated Press by telephone Sunday. ''We've lost the
democratic right to assemble peacefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Azizah, who heads the opposition National Justice Party, said
the recurring standoffs between protesters and police in the
Malaysian capital were ''alarming displays of police insolence.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders and local human rights groups have condemned
police for storming the National Mosque and firing water cannons at
hundreds of people on a balcony chanting, ''God is great.''
</P>
<P>
   Scores of police also fired tear gas and pursued demonstrators
down alleys in downtown Kuala Lumpur. The people had been shouting
for Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad to step down after nearly 19
years in power.
</P>
<P>
   By midnight Saturday, 48 people were in jail, facing criminal
charges for illegal assembly. Another 10 people had been arrested
earlier, including key leaders of the Justice Party.
</P>
<P>
   Local human rights group Suaram accused police of bringing Kuala
Lumpur to a standstill and intimidating scores of journalists who
covered the demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The city appears to have turned into a police state,'' said
Suaram spokesman S. Arutchelvan. ''The police and the government
should be blamed for disrupting the peace and harmony.''
</P>
<P>
   Anwar was sacked by Mahathir in September 1998, arrested and
charged with corruption. A High Court judge convicted him in April
last year and sentenced him to six years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-deputy prime minister is now on trial on charges of
sodomy, a crime in predominantly Muslim Malaysia, and faces another
20 years imprisonment if convicted. He insists Mahathir and other
government leaders framed him to quash his chances of becoming
prime minister.

Cuban Boy's Father Rips Relatives
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's father today accused his Miami relatives of
''child abuse'' for turning his son against him and insisting that the
6-year-old boy wants to return to Cuba. Juan Miguel Gonzalez told CBS that he
didn't believe a video taped at the relatives' home in which his son said he
didn't want to go. Both sides are waiting for a response from a federal appeals
court in Atlanta, which issued a temporary injunction Thursday blocking Elian
from leaving the country. That order defused a tense standoff when Lazaro
Gonzalez, the boy's great-uncle, refused the government's demand to hand over
the boy.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Bearing grievances about the plight of poor countries and
''decadence'' of the rich, thousands of marchers failed to stop world finance

confrontation occurred a few blocks from the White House. Officers, some on
motorcycles, charged into the crowd in a park, fired pepper spray and what they

   DJIBOUTI (AP) -- War, road conditions and, ironically, rain hold the keys to
success in the mammoth task of transporting desperately needed food to victims
of Ethiopia's drought. While the world appears to have recognized the crisis
that threatens the lives of 7.7 million Ethiopians, the job of providing enough
food to ward off starvation has barely begun. Ethiopia says 836,800 tons of
emergency food aid are needed to avert a catastrophe. Food must reach millions
of endangered villagers in Ethiopia's northern highlands by June, aid agencies
say, before the seasonal rains that blanket the region between July and
September make many roads impassable.

said his proposals don't go far enough. Barak said he would turn over West Bank
land that would give the Palestinians the territorial contiguity they need for
statehood. He also assured his hard-line Israeli critics that Jerusalem would
remain united under exclusive Israeli sovereignty but said Palestinian suburbs
just outside the city, claimed by both sides as their capital, would be handed

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under George W. Bush's leadership, the Republican Party

   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) -- An ignited glass of alcohol touched
off a fire Sunday at the same Seton Hall University dormitory where
three freshman died in a January fire.
</P>
<P>
   One student suffered minor injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The fire, which officials said started when a glass of alcohol
was ignited, occurred on the fourth floor of Boland Hall South
about 3:50 a.m. It burned a T-shirt and carpeting before a resident
assistant extinguished it, said college spokeswoman Lisa Grider.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters evacuated the building and reopened it at 4:20 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The unidentified student suffered burns to the forearm. He was
treated and released at the scene. The student who started the fire
wasn't charged, but it was unclear whether he or she would face
disciplinary action by the college.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Takes Gun Control to Kids  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the first anniversary of the Columbine
High School shootings looming, President Clinton is taking his
appeal for gun control directly to children in a magazine for young
people.
</P>
<P>
   ''The debate about reducing gun violence isn't about politics.
It's about saving lives,'' Clinton wrote in a brief article in the
April 21 edition of Time for Kids, the classroom version of Time
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   While urging Congress to pass legislation for background checks
and child-safety locks, the president returned to thoughts of
Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   ''Recent incidents remind us of the tragic consequences when
young people get their hands on guns,'' Clinton said in the article
released Sunday. Last April 20, two Columbine students killed 12
other students, a teacher and themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, wrote in rebuttal that gun control
punishes the wrong people and ''earns a failing grade'' as U.S.
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Do you think your whole class should be punished if one person
breaks the rules?'' Craig said. ''That wouldn't be fair, would it?
Yet that's gun control.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig, a board member of the National Rifle Association, said
that instead of new laws the government needs to go after
criminals, including children who bring guns to school.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde,
R-Ill., and White House Chief of Staff John Podesta debated gun
legislation issues Sunday on NBC's ''Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde said he was moving toward Clinton's position on the length
of waiting periods for background checks at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   However, White House chief of staff John Podesta said, ''I don't
think we can accept what Mr. Hyde has put on the table right now,
although I think he is in good faith trying to find common ground
on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Podesta said the administration was disturbed about a provision
in Hyde's proposal that would require the instant destruction of
gun buyers' background check records.
</P>
<P>
   But Hyde said people fear keeping the records could lead to a
national registration system.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is perfectly acceptable to say, keep the records of
the questionable ones, but get rid of the records of those who
pass,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Firms Said Shirking Nazi Slave Fund  </HEADLINE>
By TONY CZUCZKA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- The leader of Germany's Jewish community charged
Sunday that most firms who profited from Nazi-era slave and forced
laborers have not agreed to join a planned compensation fund for
the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is the real scandal in the whole story,'' Paul Spiegel
said in a Deutschlandfunk radio interview.
</P>
<P>
   He appealed for payments to start soon, noting that most of the
victims are old and ill. Even then, he said, the average former
slave laborer stands to get only $1,500 from the planned $4.9
billion fund that the German government and industry agreed to set
up last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is no more than symbolic recognition,'' said Spiegel, who
heads the Central Council of Jews in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the planned fund said over the weekend that
1,250 companies have joined, but they have raised only about half
of the $2.45 billion German industry has pledged as its share. The
government is allocating the other half of the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Spiegel said more than 2,000 other German companies who profited
from slave and forced labor during World War II are ''currently not
even thinking about joining.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry expects to have the money together by summer, spokesman
Wolfgang Gibowski said, adding that firms were not dragging their
feet. ''It will be very hard to get the money together, but somehow
we'll make it,'' he said on North German Radio.
</P>
<P>
   He said each firm was being asked to contribute 0.1 percent of
its most recent annual sales figure. ''That hurts companies that
have hundreds of millions or a billion in sales quite a bit,'' he
said. ''They could also do something else with that money.''
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has appealed to all German
businesses for money, even those that were founded after the war
and thus were not involved in Nazi-era labor.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament took up a bill Friday establishing the compensation
fund, which also is aimed at settling U.S. lawsuits and
forestalling future claims against German companies. The measure,
backed by all parties, was expected to be passed before the summer
break with the aim of beginning payments this year.
</P>
<P>
   At the site of a former Nazi concentration camp just north of
Berlin, some 500 survivors attended a ceremony Sunday marking its
liberation by Soviet troops 55 years ago at the end of World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   The Nazis held more than 200,000 people at Sachsenhausen between
1933 and 1945. About half died, including an estimated 10,000 Jews
and 18,000 Soviet soldiers who were executed.

<HEADLINE> Lakers 101, Timberwolves 95  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kobe Bryant was the wrong player for the
Minnesota Timberwolves to foul.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant made 11 free throws without a miss Sunday, including four
in the final 43.6 seconds, as the Los Angeles Lakers nipped the
Timberwolves 101-95.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, who had 25 points and 10 assists, snapped a 95-all tie
by making a pair of foul shots after rookie Wally Szczerbiak was
called for a blocking foul with seven seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota then got the ball to Terrell Brandon in the right
corner, but Bryant broke through a screen and defended the shot so
well that Brandon, after leaving his feet, changed his mind in
mid-air and tried to pass it.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice intercepted the ball and made two free throws with 4.2
seconds left, then made two more from the line after stealing the
ensuing inbounds pass.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant had given the Lakers a 95-93 lead with two free throws.
Joe Smith's jumper with 27.1 seconds left tied it at 95.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Lakers were 27-of-31 from the foul line while the
Timberwolves were 16-of-21.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal had 33 points, 14 rebounds and eight assists in
46 minutes to lead the Lakers, showing that the ankle he tweaked
earlier this month is just fine.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Harper added 15 points before suffering a bruised tailbone
in the final second of the third quarter. He didn't play after
that.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon led the Timberwolves with 18 points and nine assists.
Szczerbiak had 16 points and seven rebounds, and Kevin Garnett
added 15 points and 15 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The win was the third straight and 33rd in the last 35 games for
the Lakers (67-13), who can equal the best record in franchise
history and second-best in NBA history by winning season-ending
games at Dallas and San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking their first championship in 12 years, the Lakers
clinched the NBA's best record and homecourt advantage throughout
the postseason April 5. The playoffs begin next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Timberwolves (49-31), who have already set a franchise
record for wins in a season, lost for just the eighth time in 29
games. They trail the Spurs by two games for the fifth seed in the
West with two games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Timberwolves went on a 16-4 run early in the third quarter,
giving them a 61-57 lead. The Lakers led 74-73 entering the final
period.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team led by more than eight points in the game. The
Lakers were on top 49-43 at halftime thanks to a 9-4 spurt to
finish the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Lakers finished their home schedule with a 36-5 record
-- best in the NBA. The Indiana Pacers, 35-5 with one home game
left, could equal that mark. ... The Timberwolves (23-17) and
Lakers (31-8) are two of the five NBA teams with winning road
records. All five play in the Western Conference. ... The Lakers
swept the Timberwolves this season. They have won the last 12 games
between the teams in Los Angeles and 12 of the last 13 overall. ...
In a halftime ceremony, the Lakers and the History Channel jointly
announced the three greatest moments in franchise history according
to fan voting -- The drafting of Magic Johnson in 1979; the 33
straight wins by the 1971-72 team, and the 1988 championship that
made the Lakers the first team in 19 years to win back-to-back
titles.

<HEADLINE> Ryan's Team Debuts $25M Stadium  </HEADLINE>
By JIM VERTUNO, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROUND ROCK, Texas (AP) -- When Nolan Ryan first played in the
minor leagues, it was on a Virginia high school field in a too
small, hand-me-down uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Looking out Sunday over the $25 million Dell Diamond, home to
his new Houston Astros' Double-A franchise, Ryan couldn't help but
think about how much things have changed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Back in my days, the minor leagues were struggling to
survive,'' the Hall of Fame pitcher said.
</P>
<P>
   ''While some things stay the same, others have changed. We tried
to make this ballpark with two purposes, one for the player and the
other for the fans and not necessarily in that order,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Survival isn't even a concern for the Round Rock Express,
playing in suburban Austin.
</P>
<P>
   While Ryan played in front of only a handful of fans before
reaching the majors, a crowd of more than 10,000 saw the Express
lose their Texas League home opener to the El Paso Diablos 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Tailgaters arrived early and fans flooded in when the gates
opened two hours before the first pitch. What they found impressed
them.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm glad they did this first class,'' said 41-year-old Keith
Krienke, sipping a beer in the midday sun. He sat with about 2,000
other fans on the grassy ledge that runs along the edge of the
outfield. ''I just hope I don't get hit with a ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The stadium features a limestone facade, swimming pool and hot
tub off right field, chair backs for every seat and clear sight
lines to the field from every concession stand.
</P>
<P>
   ''The field is cool,'' said David Covington, 14, as he stood on
the berm watching pitchers warm up in the bullpen below.
</P>
<P>
   The Express players, who spent 10 days on the road to open the
season, were equally impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ''They thought to take care of everything we could possibly
need,'' said third baseman Morgan Ensberg. ''I like the grass berm
where people can sit and relax and fight each other for home run
balls. Players like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Express second baseman Keith Ginter sent fans scrambling with a
400-foot solo blast to left center that went over the grass and
bounced off the concrete walkway, the first home run in stadium
history.
</P>
<P>
   El Paso's Jack Cust answered with solo shot to center field in
the second.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a hitter's ballpark,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   Opening day ceremonies included a local television station
helicopter landing in center field to drop off the team mascot,
Spike, and an Air Force flyover with a T43-Alpha navigator plane
from the 562nd fighter training squadron from Randolph Air Force
Base.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan and former Round Rock Mayor Charlie Culpepper, who helped
push through an initiative to use $7.5 million in tax money for the
stadium, both threw ceremonial first pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Excitement has been building in this Austin suburb since 1998
when Ryan, his 28-year-old son Reid and Houston business man Don
Sanders first bought the former Jackson (Miss.) Generals and
announced plans to move them to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Austin was the largest metropolitan area in the
country without a professional baseball franchise. The last pro
team here was the Texas League's Austin Braves, who left after the
1967 season. Two previous attempts to bring teams to the Austin
area failed in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Once it was official, the Express sold 4,500 season tickets so
fast, team officials had to cut them off for fear of having no
tickets left for walkups. Two dozen luxury boxes worth up to
$27,500 sold in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I broke in, a lot of big league ballparks weren't this
nice,'' said Express manager Jackie Moore, a former skipper of the
Oakland Athletics. ''I don't know how you could do any better.''

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Withdrawal Concerns Israel  </HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Attacks on Israel after it withdraws from
Lebanon could lead to war between Israel and Syria, a senior
Israeli defense official warned Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   If Syria permits or encourages Lebanese guerrillas to continue
their attacks on Israeli troops along the border after the pullout,
promised by July, Israel will have to ''apply levers to put
pressure on the Syrians themselves, not just on their indirect
interests in Lebanon,'' Deputy Defense Minister Ephraim Sneh said.
</P>
<P>
   The result ''could be a military confrontation in Lebanon,''
Sneh told a gathering of his Labor party in a Tel Aviv suburb. ''In
this confrontation we will ... have to make our military
superiority clear once again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sneh spokesman Hillel Fartouk released Sneh's statements to The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has occupied a strip of land in south Lebanon for the
past 18 years to protect its northern border against guerrilla
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas are fighting to oust the
Israeli forces. Israel says Syria, the real power in Lebanon, uses
Israeli casualties there to pressure Israel to return the Golan
Heights, captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Israel's air force bombed Lebanese power stations,
bridges and other key targets in response to fatal Hezbollah
attacks. These are the indirect Syrian interests to which Sneh
referred -- over a million Syrian workers are employed in Lebanon,
and the destruction of the infrastructure was perceived by Israel
as a blow to Syria's economic interests.
</P>
<P>
   Sneh did not explain what he meant by ''levers to put pressure
on the Syrians themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli-Syrian peace talks broke down in January and do not
appear likely to resume anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Sneh said a military confrontation with Syria in which Israel
demonstrated superiority could lead to a renewal of peace talks
with different opening conditions -- apparently more advantageous
for Israel.

<HEADLINE> Hawks 104, Cavaliers 101  </HEADLINE>
By ED SHEARER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Alan Henderson scored 19 points, including eight
in a row when the Hawks went ahead to stay in the third quarter, as
Atlanta snapped a nine-game losing streak with a 104-101 victory
over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks almost blew a 10-point lead in the final two minutes.
Cleveland had a chance to tie it with 8.4 seconds remaining, but
Bob Sura missed the first of two free throws, then made the second
to cut the lead to 102-101.
</P>
<P>
   Sura then fouled Bimbo Coles on the inbounds pass and Coles hit
both free throws with 7.6 seconds to play for the final margin.
Sura's 3-point attempt from the top of the key hit high off the
backboard, and LaPhonso Ellis secured the rebound for the Hawks as
time expired.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Jackson added 17 for the Hawks, including four 3-pointers,
and Ellis, Dikembe Mutombo, Lorenzen Wright and Dion Glover added
12 points apiece. Mutombo, who fouled out with 1:47 remaining, had
18 rebounds -- four above his league-leading averaage.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the first time in 10 games that the Hawks topped the
100-point mark. This was only their third victory in 19 games.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Kemp led the Cavaliers with 20 points, Sura added 18 and
Lamond Murray had 16 points and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks overcame a 61-60 deficit when Henderson went on his
eight-point spurt to make it 68-61 with 3:58 left in the third.
Atlanta continued to stretch its lead and was up 91-76 on a basket
by Coles with 8:08 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Cavs then went on an 11-2 run in which Kemp had three
points. Atlanta built its lead to 102-92 on a basket by Roshown
McLeod with 1:56 to play before Kemp hit a basket and two free
throws and Earl Boykins added two baskets to cut it to 102-100 with
32 seconds left -- just before Sura missed his chance to tie it.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The victory improved Atlanta's home floor record to 20-20.
... The Hawks had a season-high 34-point third quarter. ...
Atlanta's nine-game losing streak was its worst since the 1990-91
season. ... It was the fifth loss in the last six road games for
Cleveland. ... It marked the 34th time in 89 games the Cavs have
hit the 100-point mark. ... Cleveland has had 24 back-to-back games
and has a 9-14 record on both the first night and the second.

<HEADLINE> Chargers Draft Division I-AA QB  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- With his second-to-last pick of what could be
his last draft, Bobby Beathard took his kind of player. A real
sleeper.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback JaJuan Seider of Division I-AA Florida A&AMP;M, who
transferred from West Virginia after sitting behind Marc Bulger for
three seasons, became a Charger on Sunday with a compensatory pick,
the 39th selection in the sixth round and the 205th pick overall.
</P>
<P>
   ''Seider is pretty special, in my opinion, and I think everybody
that's visited him and been with him and seen him feels the same,''
said Beathard, 63, who plans to decide in about a month whether to
retire or keep working under a contract that goes through the 2001
season. That will at least give him time to see the Chargers' eight
draft picks in the team's minicamp April 28-30.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers picked a quarterback because of continuing concerns
about Ryan Leaf, who is experiencing discomfort in his surgically
repaired right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Although Leaf is required to be at the team's headquarters
Monday to continue his rehabilitation, there are some in the
organization who wonder if he'll show up. Leaf hasn't been seen at
the complex in about a month, since fullback Fred McCrary sharply
criticized him for being overweight and out of shape.
</P>
<P>
   The Chargers want to have four quarterbacks at the minicamp. The
addition of Seider gives them three who can throw, with the other
two being Jim Harbaugh and Moses Moreno. The Chargers are still
debating whether to sign Todd Marinovich, who hasn't played in the
NFL since 1992 and is currently a backup with the Los Angeles
Avengers of the Arena Football League.
</P>
<P>
   Late Sunday afternoon, the Chargers agreed with free agent
quarterback Mike Burton of Division III Trinity University of San
Antonio, Texas, and wide receiver-returner Damon Gourdine of San
Diego State. Burton went to La Jolla High.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the quarterbacks in the draft, Beathard thought that only
Marshall's Chad Pennington, who went to the New York Jets with the
18th pick overall, had a better arm and quicker release than
Seider.
</P>
<P>
   Seider is 6 feet, one-half inch, and 225 pounds. He can run as
well as throw.
</P>
<P>
   ''It'll be fun for the coaches to work with him, fun to have him
in here and see how far he can go,'' Beathard said.
</P>
<P>
   Bulger was taken by New Orleans 37 picks before Seider went to
the Chargers. Seider was taken before two other quarterbacks, Tim
Rattay of Louisiana Tech (San Francisco) and Jarious Jackson of
Notre Dame (Denver).
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of teams didn't get a chance to see me because it was
like my first year really starting because I was backing up Marc
Bulger for so long,'' Seider said.
</P>
<P>
   Chargers scout Jeff Beathard -- Bobby's son -- saw Seider play in
the first round of the I-AA playoffs. He threw for three touchdowns
and ran for three more.
</P>
<P>
   Seider scored seven touchdowns in the first half of a 66-10
regular-season win over Morgan State before he was taken out.
</P>
<P>
   Seider was asked if he could beat out Leaf.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can challenge him, I mean, that'd be up to the coaches. ...

Elian Kin Backers Reject Dad's Claims
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Protesters today dismissed accusations by Elian Gonzalez's
father that the Miami relatives of the 6-year-old boy were turning his son
against him. With the boy's fate still in the hands of federal judges, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez told CBS that he didn't believe a video taped at the relatives'
home in which his son said he didn't want to return to Cuba. But supporters of
the boy's relatives derided Juan Miguel's comments as either selfish or the
manipulations of Fidel Castro. ''This means he doesn't have any heart,'' said
Sergio Perez, 49, a mechanic who lives a block away. ''He doesn't have any
feelings.''

IMF Repeats Debt Relief Pledge

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund concluded a protest-marred
opening session today with a statement repeating past pledges to seek greater
debt relief for the world's poorest countries. The communique, which did not
introduce any major new ideas, also called for reforming the IMF so that it can
better prevent future financial crises. The IMF's current efforts on debt relief
and other matters have been criticized as inadequate by anti-globalization
activists, including those in the streets outside who failed in their efforts to
shut down the opening meetings but did make getting to the sessions difficult.

Ethiopia Faces Obstacles in Famine Fight
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DJIBOUTI (AP) -- War, road conditions and, ironically, rain hold the keys to
success in the mammoth task of transporting desperately needed food to victims
of Ethiopia's drought. While the world appears to have recognized the crisis
that threatens the lives of 7.7 million Ethiopians, the job of providing enough
food to ward off starvation has barely begun. Ethiopia says 836,800 tons of
emergency food aid are needed to avert a catastrophe. Food must reach millions
of endangered villagers in Ethiopia's northern highlands by June, aid agencies
say, before the seasonal rains that blanket the region between July and
September make many roads impassable.

said his proposals don't go far enough. Barak said he would turn over West Bank
land that would give the Palestinians the territorial contiguity they need for
statehood. He also assured his hard-line Israeli critics that Jerusalem would
remain united under exclusive Israeli sovereignty but said Palestinian suburbs
just outside the city, claimed by both sides as their capital, would be handed

Clinton administration officials. The new regulations were to be announced
tomorrow by Vice President Gore. In a statement, he called the rules a
''significant step ... to ensure that Americans enjoy the safest drinking water
possible.'' The new requirements would not apply to private wells serving
individual homes, but only to public water systems serving at least 15 homes
that rely on wells and underground aquifers for at least part of their water

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kobe Bryant made 11 free throws without a miss today,
including four in the final 43.6 seconds, as the Los Angeles Lakers nipped the
Minnesota Timberwolves 101-95. Bryant, who had 25 points and 10 assists, snapped
a 95-all tie by making a pair of foul shots after rookie Wally Szczerbiak was
called for a blocking foul with seven seconds remaining. Minnesota then got the
ball to Terrell Brandon in the right corner, but Bryant broke through a screen
and defended the shot so well that Brandon, after leaving his feet, changed his

victory. ''It takes a toll on you.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Planing Phones for Indians  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- To speed computer access and improve
telecommunications for American Indians, President Clinton will
announce a plan Monday to provide basic telephone service for $1 a
month on reservations, the White House said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Communications Commission Chairman William Kennard,
scheduled to join the president to make the announcement in
Shiprock, N.M., said he expects the plan to benefit 300,000 Indian
households.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is disgraceful that we have a telephone system that is the
envy of the world, but basic telecommunications services are not
widely enjoyed by our land's oldest people,'' Kennard said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   To pay for the program, Kennard said he will propose adding $17
million to an existing program that underwrites phone service costs
for low-income people. That amounts to a 3.5 percent increase in
funding for the program. Long-distance phone companies, which pay
varied subsidies to states to assist low-income people, would
ultimately pay the additional costs.
</P>
<P>
   Poor American Indian households already qualify for a discount,
but Clinton administration officials said the cost is still too
high for many. Nearly one-third of all Indians live in poverty,
compared with 13 percent of the U.S. population.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Microsoft Corp. announced Sunday it is donating more
than $2.7 million in software and cash to help bridge the ''digital
divide'' and economic disparity between Indian tribes and wealthier
segments of society.
</P>
<P>
   The company said the gift, all but $200,000 it in software, will
be divided among eight tribal colleges, including Dine College in
Shiprock.
</P>
<P>
   Only 22 percent of Navajo Reservation households have a phone
according to the 1990 census. Nationwide, the figure is an
estimated 56 percent for Indian reservation households but 94
percent for the population as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will begin his day Monday in a pocket of Silicon Valley
where the Internet and other communications advances are also too
expensive for many people. Schools in East Palo Alto, Calif., have
just one computer for every 28 students, and more than 24 percent
of elementary- and middle-school students live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The president and high technology executives will announce new
grants and training programs to improve telecommunication services
in poor and minority communities.

<HEADLINE> Morocco Bans Two Newspapers  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLAS MARMIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RABAT, Morocco (AP) -- Morocco has banned the sale of a weekly
newspaper containing an interview with the head of the Polisario
Front, a guerrilla movement that fought Morocco for independence in
the Western Sahara.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement on Sunday, the Ministry of Communications said
the ban was due to the treatment of Morocco's territorial integrity
in the latest issue the French-language weekly Le Journal, which is
printed in France.
</P>
<P>
   Morocco lays claim to the Western Sahara, where the Polisario
Front fought a 15-year war for independence. A U.N.-sponsored
referendum aimed at resolving the dispute is stalled, mainly over
the issue of voter eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   The latest edition of the Arab-language weekly Assahifa, which
is owned by the same group as Le Journal and which also contained
extracts of the interview, was also banned.
</P>
<P>
   The number of newspaper seizures and bans has increased since
the beginning of the year, despite assurances that censorship is a
thing of the past and despite moves by King Mohammed VI toward
change since succeeding his late father Hassan II.
</P>
<P>
   The director of Le Journal, Aboubakr Jamai, said the decision
marked a return to the past.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are seeing the return of methods we had thought were in the
past. We are supposed to be in a lawful state while the language of
this statement is that of a dictatorship,'' he told the Associated
Press.
</P>
<P>
   The interview with Polisario leader Mohamed Abdelaziz was
published just days after U.N. envoy James Baker III visited the
region in an attempt to unblock a referendum meant to resolve
whether Western Sahara will gain independence or be integrated with
Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   War broke out in the stretch of desert along Africa's Atlantic
coast in 1976 when Spain abandoned the former colony and Morocco
annexed it and moved in settlers.
</P>
<P>
   The Polisario Front, traditionally backed by Algeria, battled
Morocco for 15 years seeking independence. The war ended in 1991
with a U.N.-negotiated cease-fire.

<HEADLINE> Italians Vote in Regional Elections  </HEADLINE>
By FRANCES D'EMILIO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- After a campaign heavy on personal attacks, Italians
voted Sunday in regional elections that will gauge the depth of
support for Premier Massimo D'Alema and his media magnate rival.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was seen as an early test of D'Alema's popularity ahead
of federal parliamentary elections. For rival Silvio Berlusconi's
conservative forces, it could determine whether the media baron and
former premier faces D'Alema in the spring 2001 polls.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-two percent of the approximately 42 million Italians
eligible to vote cast ballots in the elections for presidents and
legislatures in 15 of Italy's 20 regions.
</P>
<P>
   By early Monday morning, projections by the Abacus polling
organization based on a nearly 50 percent count of the votes region
by region, indicated the center-left would take six regions, while
Berlusconi's bloc would capture five.
</P>
<P>
   Four regions were too close to call, especially the Rome area,
Abacus said.
</P>
<P>
   Under sunny skies in central and southern Italy, many people
went to the polls directly from church after Palm Sunday services,
bearing palm fronds or olive branches.
</P>
<P>
   This year's campaign was the first held under new rules that
sharply restrict political television ads. Berlusconi claimed the
change unfairly targeted him because of his media realm. The new
rules call for televised debates, many of which ended up being
little more than exchanges of insults by party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has been one of the ugliest electoral campaigns in the
already bungled history of our republic,'' D'Alema commented as the
campaign wound down.
</P>
<P>
   Electoral rallies and forums were dominated by often bitter
exchanges between D'Alema, a former Communist who has headed a
center-left coalition government since October 1998, and
Berlusconi, whose center-right alliance includes former
neo-fascists.
</P>
<P>
   The media focus on how the national coalitions will fare in the
election eclipsed the scarce debate on the business of regional
governments, such as public health administration and
transportation services.
</P>
<P>
   The vote is the first time Italians have had a chance to
directly elect regional presidents. Direct mayoral elections, which
began in 1993, helped create a new class of influential politicians
accountable first to the voters, not to party machines.
</P>
<P>
   Five of Italy's 20 regions chose to schedule voting on other
dates.

<HEADLINE> Hornacek Honored By Suns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Jeff Hornacek, who began his career in Phoenix,
was honored by the Suns on Sunday night in a ceremony before the
start of their game against the Utah Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   Suns owner Jerry Colangelo presented a set of golf clubs to
Hornacek, who is retiring after this, his 14th, NBA season.
</P>
<P>
   He began that career in Phoenix as a second-round draft pick out
of Iowa State, the 46th selection overall, in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think anyone would have dreamed he would go on to have
the career he did,'' Colangelo told the America West Arena crowd,
which gave Hornacek a loud standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Hornacek played six seasons with the Suns before he was traded
to Philadelphia as part of the deal that brought Charles Barkley to
Phoenix in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thanks, Jerry, for taking a chance on me,'' Hornacek said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he turned to the sidelines and addressed former Suns coach
Cotton Fitzsimmons.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thanks, Cotton, for trading for Kevin Johnson and moving me
from point guard so I could shoot,'' Hornacek said.

<HEADLINE> Marion Jones Impressive in Relays  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALNUT, Calif. (AP) -- Marion Jones began her drive toward her
goal of winning five Olympic gold medals by taking the women's 400
meters at the Mt. SAC Relays in 49.59 seconds Sunday, making her
the fourth fastest American woman ever in the event.
</P>
<P>
   Running for the first time since she crumpled to the track in
pain during the World Championships last August, Jones accelerated
in the turn and sped away from a field that included Inger Miller,
who won the 200 at Seville, Spain, after Jones was hurt in the
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   After leading early at Mt. SAC, Miller faded to eighth and last,
finishing in 55.21. Latasha Colander-Richardson, a former teammate
of Jones at North Carolina, was a distant second in 51.16, and
Donna Fraser third at 51.62.
</P>
<P>
   Turning the Mt. SAC meet into a family affair, Jones' husband,
C.J. Hunter, threw the shot put 71 feet, 4 inches. That was the
second longest throw of his career, behind only his winning mark of
71-6 in the 1999 World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, 24, hopes to compete in the 100 and 200 and long jump, as
well as run for the United States in the 400 and 1,600 relays at
the Sydney Olympics in September.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who sustained a back injury during the World
Championships, did not compete during the indoor season. She was
extremely pleased with her season-opening 400.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if her dominant performance might have sent a message to
Miller, Jones shook her head no and said, ''I think I was sending a
message to my brain, saying, 'I'm back and I'm ready to run
fast.'''
</P>
<P>
   But she did say that her goals at Mt. SAC were to run a sub
50-second time and ''to send a message to the U.S. relay coaches if
they need somebody to run a 400 leg (in the 1,600), I'm ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who dominated the women's 100, 200 and long jump for the
past two years before the injury in Spain, doesn't consider the 400
one of her favorite events.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've had a rough time sleeping, knowing I was going to run the
400. I don't like it. I don't like the feeling when I'm done,''
Jones said, still slightly winded some 15 minutes after the race.
''So I'm happy I'm done with the 400 meters, at least until
September.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if she might turn out to be the big story at Sydney later
this year, Jones smiled and replied, ''If I go to Sydney and do
what I'm capable of.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hunter was as dominant in his event as his wife was.
Hunter's winning throw was more than four feet beyond the effort of
second-place finisher John Godina, the 1996 Olympic silver
medalist. His best at Mt. SAC was 67-1{.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm satisfied, but I really expected to throw farther,'' said
Hunter, who made six good throws. ''It's the most consistent meet
of my career. If I can stay consistent like this all year, it is
very promising for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering it's early in the season, there were some fine times
and marks at Mt. SAC.
</P>
<P>
   Anjanette Kirkland, formerly of Texas A&AMP;M, won the women's
100-meter hurdles in a sparkling 12.63, clocking to become the
fourth fastest American ever in the event. Arkansas long jumper
Melvin Lister won his specialty with a lifetime best 27-3}, edging
Mississippi junior Savante Stringfellow, whose jump was just an
inch behind the winner's.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Marsh, the 1992 gold medalist, came from far back to win
the men's 100 in a wind-aided 9.90, and Jamaican Chris Williams won
the 200 in 20.02.

<HEADLINE> Fusaichi Pegasus: Ky. Derby Favorite  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD ROSENBLATT, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The only anxious moments for trainer Neil
Drysdale occurred before the $750,000 Wood Memorial -- when his
eccentric colt, Fusaichi Pegasus, took his sweet time getting to
the starting gate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe he figured they wouldn't start the race without him,''
Drysdale said after the $4 million colt produced a rousing
4\-length victory over Red Bullet that established him as the
Kentucky Derby favorite.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has a mind of his own, and when he decides to do it, he
does it.''
</P>
<P>
   In between bouts of stubbornness -- he also pulled up after the
race and stopped on the clubhouse turn to gaze at the parking lot,
holding up the trophy presentation for five minutes -- Fusaichi
Pegasus turned in the most impressive performance by a 3-year-old
this year.
</P>
<P>
   This colt has his personality quirks. When the horses were
moving toward the starting gate on a rainy Saturday at Aqueduct
Racetrack, Fusaichi Pegasus decided to stop on the far turn and
check out the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   There he stood, with jockey Kent Desormeaux aboard, while the
rest of his competitors waited to enter the gate. After much
coaxing by Desormeaux, and with the assistance of an outrider,
Fusaichi Pegasus finally made it into his No. 5 gate.
</P>
<P>
   And after toying with 11 challengers until the turn for home,
the 4-5 favorite unleashed a powerful finishing kick for his fourth
win in five career starts. Fusaichi Pegasus, racing on the East
Coast for the first time, covered the 1 1-8 miles in 1:47 4-5, the
fifth fastest time in 76 runnings of the Wood.
</P>
<P>
   ''He came out of the race great and is feeling very good,''
Enrique Larios, Drysdale's foreman, said Sunday. ''He will be
leaving for Kentucky on Monday morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining him on Monday's flight from New York to Churchill Downs
will be Aptitude, who closed from eighth to finish third, and
Exchange Rate, the D. Wayne-Lukas trained colt who finished ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Red Bullet, the Wood runner-up who lost for the first time in
four starts, may not go to Kentucky. Joe Orseno, his trainer, said
the colt's next start is not yet set.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of people who would look at the Wood and say
'Red Bullet was second so he should go to the Derby,''' Orseno said
Sunday. ''But that may not necessarily be the best thing for the
horse. That's what's under discussion, what's best for the horse.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory confirmed Fusaichi Pegasus' status as the probable
favorite for the May 6 Derby, which prompted Drysdale to wonder
whether that was ''a good thing or a bad thing.'' No favorite has
won the Derby since Spectacular Bid in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Also, no Wood winner has gone on to take the Derby since
Pleasant Colony in 1981. The Wood-Derby double has been
accomplished by only 10 horses. Fusaichi Pegasus stands to earn an
additional $250,000 bonus offered by the New York Racing
Association should he go on to win at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale, who is nominated to the Hall of Fame this year, has
taken only one horse to the Derby -- A.P. Indy, who was scratched as
the 7-2 favorite behind Arazi the morning of the race with a
bruised hoof.
</P>
<P>
   After the race, Drysdale left for Churchill Downs, where his
other Derby horse, War Chant, is stabled.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Fusaichi Pegasus has improved with each start, and has
done everything Drysdale has asked. But as is the case in the
run-up to the Derby, Desormeaux knows there's one more question to
be answered: ''Can he get a mile and a quarter?''
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus returned $3.80, $2.70 and $2.20. Red Bullet,
ridden by Alex Solis, paid $3.60 and $2.80 and Aptitude, trained by
Hall of Famer Bobby Frankel, paid 3.20.
</P>
<P>
   Country Only, who set the pace until the final turn, was fourth,
followed by Appearing Now, Postponed, Cat's at Home, Painted
Pistol, Exchange Rate, Fight for Ally, Connect and Traditionally.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Mayor's Race Heats Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- The fierce race to govern North America's
largest city is getting ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of two leading hopefuls for Mexico City mayor filed
complaints Saturday with election officials in an attempt to get
each other's candidate kicked out of the race on legal
technicalities.
</P>
<P>
   Four political parties on Saturday filed a complaint with the
Federal District's Electoral Tribunal, contending Andres Manuel
Lopez Obrador of the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party has not
lived in the city continuously over the past five years as required
by law to run for mayor. A native of the southern Mexican state of
Tabasco, Obrador lost that state's governor's race in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Obrador's party responded in kind, charging his main opponent,
Jesus Silva Herzog of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, with
failing to register his candidature under his official birth name,
Jesus Silva y Flores.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls show the electoral races in a dead heat between
three candidates -- Obrador, Silva and Santiago Creel of the
center-right National Action Party.
</P>
<P>
   The mayorship of chaotic Mexico City, with its 9 million people,
is one the most important, visible and explosive electoral posts in
Mexico. Until 1997, the mayor was appointed by the president, who
since 1929 has been a member of the Institutional Revolutionary
Party, or PRI.
</P>
<P>
   The leftist Democratic Revolution party in 1997 won the first
modern election for Mexico City mayor, helping revive the political
fortunes of victor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who has since resigned to
make a third run for the presidency.

Asian Markets Open Sharply Lower
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Asian stock markets plummeted as they opened Monday, reacting
to the record losses on Wall Street last week that left many investors wondering
if its bull market was over. In the world's second largest economy, Japan's
Nikkei Stock Average fell a staggering 1,180.15 points, or 5.8 percent, to
19,254.53. Dropping below the key 20,000-point mark, the Nikkei stood at its
lowest level since March 17, with high-technology stocks being hit the hardest.
Elsewhere, Australia's All Ordinaries Index fell 5.6 percent at one point, and
the Korea Composite Stock Price Index was down 89.35 points, or 11 percent, to
711.54. The Korea Stock Exchange said it was a record fall, in both points and
percentage, on the index.

Protesters Swarm at Finance Summit
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thousands of marchers failed to stop world finance leaders
from meeting today, but prompted police to fire a stinging cloud of irritants at
a surging crowd. Police used pepper spray and what they said were smoke bombs to
drive back the protesters, who were convinced they'd been tear-gassed. But the
atmosphere was less tense than yesterday, when police raided and closed the
protest headquarters during the day and arrested more than 600 people in the
evening. The demonstrators' anger stems from causes ranging from human rights
atrocities in Ethiopia to the ''prison industrial complex'' and biotechnology in
food.

   MIAMI (AP) -- Protesters today dismissed accusations by Elian Gonzalez's
father that the Miami relatives of the 6-year-old boy were turning his son
against him. With the boy's fate still in the hands of federal judges, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez told CBS that he didn't believe a video taped at the relatives'
home in which his son said he didn't want to return to Cuba. But supporters of
the boy's relatives derided Juan Miguel's comments as either selfish or the
manipulations of Fidel Castro. ''This means he doesn't have any heart,'' said
Sergio Perez, 49, a mechanic who lives a block away. ''He doesn't have any
feelings.''

Lebanon Withdrawal Concerns Israel
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Attacks on Israel after it withdraws from Lebanon could
lead to war between Israel and Syria, a senior Israeli defense official warned
Sunday. If Syria permits or encourages Lebanese guerrillas to continue their
attacks on Israeli troops along the border after the pullout, promised by July,
Israel will have to ''apply levers to put pressure on the Syrians themselves,
not just on their indirect interests in Lebanon,'' Deputy Defense Minister
Ephraim Sneh said. The result ''could be a military confrontation in Lebanon,''
Sneh told a gathering of his Labor party in a Tel Aviv suburb. Sneh spokesman
Hillel Fartouk released Sneh's statements to The Associated Press.

EPA To Tap Into New Water Rules

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency will propose new
requirements to protect against disease-causing viruses and bacteria in tap

Clinton administration officials. The new regulations were to be announced
tomorrow by Vice President Gore. In a statement, he called the rules a
''significant step ... to ensure that Americans enjoy the safest drinking water
possible.'' The new requirements would not apply to private wells serving
individual homes, but only to public water systems serving at least 15 homes
that rely on wells and underground aquifers for at least part of their water
supply.

   TORONTO (AP) -- Alex Rodriguez hit three homers and drove in seven runs --
both career highs -- and the Seattle Mariners routed the Toronto Blue Jays 19-7
today for a convincing three-game sweep. Rodriguez scored five times, going
4-for-5. He hit a solo homer in the first inning and a two-run shot in the
fourth. With the bases loaded in the eighth, Rodriguez narrowly missed a grand
slam off Pedro Borbon when a liner down the left-field line hooked foul.
Rodriguez jumped up in anticipation when he thought the ball would go out, but
slumped his shoulders when it did not. On the next pitch, Rodriguez hit a
towering drive over the wall in left-center field for his seventh career slam.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kobe Bryant made 11 free throws without a miss today,
including four in the final 43.6 seconds, as the Los Angeles Lakers nipped the
Minnesota Timberwolves 101-95. Bryant, who had 25 points and 10 assists, snapped
a 95-all tie by making a pair of foul shots after rookie Wally Szczerbiak was
called for a blocking foul with seven seconds remaining. Minnesota then got the
ball to Terrell Brandon in the right corner, but Bryant broke through a screen
and defended the shot so well that Brandon, after leaving his feet, changed his
mind and tried to pass it.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Plunge in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks plunged early Monday, hit by Friday's
record tumbles on Wall Street. The U.S. dollar was sharply lower
against the yen.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 1,793.62
points, or 8.8 percent, to 18,641.06 in about the first 90 minutes
of trading. On Friday, the average closed down 91.74 points, or
0.45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 104.68 yen, down 1.18 yen from late Friday in
Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 105.09 yen on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, the Nikkei index started lower as investors
turned bearish after the Dow Jones industrial average plunged
617.78 points, or 5.7 percent to 10,305.77 at Friday's close.
</P>
<P>
   Dropping below the key 20,000-point mark, the Nikkei stood at
its lowest level since Jan. 12, with high-technology stocks being
hit the hardest.
</P>
<P>
   Sachio Ishikawa, general manager of equities at Chuo Securities,
said the panicky sell-off was reaching a feverish pitch.
</P>
<P>
   He said a drop of 1,500 points might prompt the exchange to halt
trading, but there had been no sign of that so far.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's Wall Street's drop was its biggest one-day point drop
ever. The Nasdaq composite index closed at 3,321.29 on Friday, down
355.49 points, also a record point drop.
</P>
<P>
   The plunges Friday came after the U.S. Labor Department said
consumer prices surged more than expected in March, reflecting
higher costs for everything from gasoline to housing.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department figures rekindled worries that the Federal
Reserve not only would raise interest rates again, but might be
more aggressive in containing to cool down the U.S. economy to
erase the threat of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 107.72 points, or 6.51 percent, to 1,545.98.
The TOPIX closed down 10.32 points, or 0.62 percent, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, the dollar moved sharply lower in line
with Friday's movement in New York, where the greenback dropped
against major currencies as U.S. stock prices sank on the inflation
worries.
</P>
<P>
   Zembei Mizoguchi, international bureau chief at the Finance
Ministry, said Monday that Japan's foreign exchange policy had not
been affected by the weekend meeting in Washington of finance
officials from the Group of Seven nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our foreign exchange policy remains unchanged. A strong yen
before an economic recovery is not desirable,'' Mizoguchi told
reporters in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no mention of ''concern'' over the yen's rapid
rise against the dollar that Japan reportedly wanted to include in
a joint communique issued after the G-7 meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Participating in the meeting were finance ministers from the
United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 101.18 yen, up from
101.10 yen late Friday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell
to 1.7350 percent from Friday's finish of 1.7900 percent. Its price
rose 0.48 point to 101.42.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Michael Finley scored 25 points and Erick
Strickland added 19 points and 11 rebounds as the Dallas Mavericks
kept up their late-season surge with a 114-106 victory over the
Vancouver Grizzlies on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   With 38 victories, the Mavericks have their highest total since
winning 47 games in the 1989-90 season, the last time they made the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Dirk Nowitzki's 16 points, Steve Nash's 13 points and nine
assists and Greg Buckner's 12 points helped Dallas win for the
seventh time in eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Othella Harrington matched his career high with 27 points,
Shareef Abdur-Rahim had 19 and Michael Dickerson 16 to pace the
Grizzlies, who lost their sixth in a row.
</P>
<P>
   The Grizzlies held an 89-86 lead with 8:23 left on Harrington's
basket. But Strickland's three-point play with 8:08 remaining
triggered an 11-1 run capped by Nash's 10-footer, giving Dallas a
97-90 edge with 5:46 left.
</P>
<P>
   The Grizzlies got as close as 108-104 with 58 seconds left on
Mike Bibby's 3-pointer. But Finley's basket with 39 seconds to play
extended Dallas' lead to six and closed out Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington's 14 third-quarter points kept Vancouver close as
Dallas took a 78-74 advantage into the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
Notes:@Vancouver has an all-time record of 3-16 against Dallas. ...
The Mavericks are 9-1 against the Grizzlies at Reunion Arena. ...
The Grizzlies have lost 10 of their last 12.

<HEADLINE> Oilers 5, Stars 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Doug Weight scored his first career
playoff hat trick, leading the Edmonton Oilers to an emotional 5-2
playoff victory over the Dallas Stars on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers trail the Stars 2-1 in the best-of-7 Western
Conference first-round series. Game 4 is Tuesday night at Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Weight's third goal, on a power play just over six minutes into
second period, gave the Oilers a 5-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Weight, allowed to walk through the faceoff circle to the left
of Ed Belfour, snapped a wrist shot between the legs of the Stars
goalie as 17,100 fans erupted in cheers and a cascade of hats,
helmets and foam puckheads.
</P>
<P>
   The win ended a string of nine consecutive playoff losses to the
Stars, who have dominated Edmonton since the Oilers upset Dallas in
the first round of the 1997 playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's game was a reversal of the first two. This time, the
Oilers set the tone and dominated the play, with the Stars running
around in their own end and taking retaliatory penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton outshot Dallas 38-28. The Oilers had 22 shots in the
first period, setting a club playoff record for shots in a period
(previous record 21). They had only 31 total shots in the first two
games.
</P>
<P>
   Weight opened the scoring 8:40 in when the puck appeared to
bounce off his lower leg and past Belfour in a goal-mouth scramble.
</P>
<P>
   He made it 3-0 on a power play with three minutes left in the
first when he hammered a shot from the high slot through traffic
and over Belfour's outstretched right pad.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Dowd and Ryan Smyth also scored for the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Modano and Brendan Morrow had goals for Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Smyth's goal came shorthanded as he converted a 2-on-1 rush with
Ethan Moreau just 76 seconds into the second period.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton had two power-play goals to end an 0-for-8 string
against the Stars, who had the best penalty-killing percentage in
the NHL in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   It was a physical game at both ends of the ice. Smyth was
knocked groggy by Morrow midway through the second period while
slicing through the neutral zone. He returned to play in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Stars defenseman Sergei Zubov, still recovering from a lingering
knee injury, is questionable for Game 4. Top forechecker Jere
Lehtinen (ankle) will definitely sit out.

<HEADLINE> Flyers 2, Sabres 0  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Here's two things Buffalo can no longer
dispute: the Philadelphia Flyers are for real, and the Sabres are
in deep trouble after Sunday's 2-0 loss.
</P>
<P>
   John LeClair, the center of Friday's controversial phantom goal,
scored the game-winner and rookie goalie Brian Boucher stopped 17
shots as the Flyers grabbed a 3-0 series lead. Mark Recchi sealed
the win scoring into an empty net with 37.9 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Only two teams -- the 1975 New York Islanders and the 1942
Toronto Maple Leafs -- have rallied from a 3-0 deficit in NHL
playoff history. Game 4 will be played at Buffalo on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres, who've managed just three goals in the series, had
trouble generating any offense, outshot 27-17.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo's best opportunity came with eight minutes left in the
second period when Curtis Brown pounced on a turnover in front. His
first shot was stopped by Boucher and Brown fanned on a second
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise Boucher -- registering his first playoff shutout and
fifth of his career -- and the Flyers' stifling defense did the
rest.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing to match the controversy of the Flyers' 2-1
win on Friday when video replays showed LeClair's game-tying goal
entered the goal through a hole in the net. The goal was allowed to
stand because video replay officials didn't see the decisive replay
before play resumed.
</P>
<P>
   Any thoughts that officials would give the Sabres a break Sunday
were quickly dispelled. The Flyers were awarded a first period
penalty shot and had six power plays -- including three straight in
the second period -- to Buffalo's three.
</P>
<P>
   LeClair opened the scoring with a power-play goal with 4:30 left
in the first. Simon Gagne, from behind the net, fed a centering
pass to LeClair, who snuck a shot through Dominik Hasek's legs.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the Flyers seven goals in the series have come from their
special teams, five on the power play and the other scored
shorthanded. Recchi's empty-net goal marked the first time in the
three games that a team had a two-goal lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres dodged a bullet when Hasek stopped Eric Desjardins on
a penalty shot 11:25 in. Desjardins took the shot in place of Peter
White, who was on a breakaway and hooked down from behind by Alexei
Zhitnik.
</P>
<P>
   White was shaken up when he hit the back of his head on the ice
but returned in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 36th penalty shot taken in playoff history, and first
since Toronto's Mats Sundin beat Hasek in last year's conference
final. The Flyers are 1-for-5 in playoff penalty shots, the only
goal coming when Eric Lindros beat Buffalo's Steve Shields in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The game was played in a raucous environment, as the sold out
HSBC Arena was packed with fans expressing their displeasure.
</P>
<P>
   One woman held up a towel that read: ''NHL: No Honor League.'' A
group of fans distributed small sheets of paper with the words ''No
Goal'' printed on them.
</P>
<P>
   Another placard read: ''Bettman and D'Amico are really Beavis
and Butthead,'' in reference to NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and
John D'Amico, the senior game official supervising this series.
</P>
<P>
   Bettman, in an interview during Fox Sports New York's coverage
of the Florida-New Jersey playoff game, defended the NHL over the
goal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unfortunate that it happened,'' Bettman said. ''There is
nothing wrong with the system, it just happened.
</P>
<P>
   ''Out of 6,000 goals, if this happens a handful of times you
have to live with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, Sunday was the first playoff game Buffalo has
hosted since the Sabres lost last June's sixth and deciding Stanley
Cup final game against Dallas, which was won on Brett Hull's
controversial overtime goal.

<HEADLINE> Barak Hints at Palestinian State  </HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Preparing Israelis for substantial land
concessions, Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Sunday all but offered
the Palestinians an independent state and said he would give them
suburbs around contested Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli hard-liners criticized him, but the Palestinians said
his proposals don't go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   In statements made at Sunday's Cabinet meeting and released by
his office, Barak outlined what he would -- and wouldn't -- concede
in a blueprint of a final peace treaty, due next month.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said he would turn over West Bank land that would give the
Palestinians territorial contiguity, something Palestinians see as
necessary for statehood.
</P>
<P>
   ''No serious person believes that the entity that will be
created will be a protectorate or autonomy made up of various
noncontiguous patches on the map without its residents being able
to leave its territory freely,'' Barak told ministers. He did not
refer directly to a Palestinian ''state.''
</P>
<P>
   He assured his hard-line Israeli critics that Jerusalem would
remain united under exclusive Israeli sovereignty but said
Palestinian suburbs just outside the city, claimed by both sides as
their capital, would be handed over.
</P>
<P>
   ''We always looked to Jerusalem when we prayed, but we never
directed our prayers to el-Azariya or Abu-Dis,'' he said, naming
Jerusalem suburbs that Israel has so far refused to concede as part
of interim troop withdrawals. He said Israel had no interest in
annexing the 50,000-60,000 Palestinians living around Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said most Jewish settlements in the West Bank would be
annexed to Israel in a permanent peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
   He said Israel would consider giving the Palestinians an
''advance'' on the last interim troop withdrawal, due in June, by
handing over land next month.
</P>
<P>
   Nabil Abourdeneh, an aide to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
rejected Barak's outlines, repeating the Palestinian position that
Israel must withdraw from the entire Gaza Strip, West Bank and east
Jerusalem, captured in the 1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
   Abourdeneh said that the Palestinians would never relinquish a
demand that Israel allow Palestinian refugees to return to homes
they lost in the 1948 Mideast War. Barak said refugees would not be
resettled in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Barak also defended a meeting with President Clinton last
Tuesday in which he agreed to more intensive mediation, saying the
United States would not offer proposals without first checking if
they would be acceptable to both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Barak turned his attention back to the Palestinians after the
chances of renewing peace talks with Syria dwindled. Israeli and
Palestinian negotiating teams wound up a second round of talks in
Washington Friday, aimed at reaching a final peace treaty in
September.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released after its weekly meeting late Sunday,
the Palestinian Cabinet said little progress had been made in those
negotiations, blaming Israeli intransigence. The statement
reiterated intentions to declare a Palestinian state by September.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to media reports that Israel is offering the
Palestinians up to 80 percent of the West Bank, Jewish settlers
demanded that Barak refrain from signing any agreements until they
have been approved in a referendum that Barak has promised for the
final treaty.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 young Palestinians, meanwhile, marched Sunday in
Bethlehem, calling on Israel to release Palestinian prisoners from
its jails. The marchers, many wearing masks and firing automatic
weapons in the air, burned pictures of Barak and threatened to use
violence if Israel did not release the prisoners, considered by
Palestinians to be freedom fighters.
</P>
<P>
   One demonstrator held a mortar bomb in each hand.

<HEADLINE> Devils 2, Panthers 1  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Scott Niedermayer returned from a
10-game suspension and tied the game and Scott Stevens got the game
winner as the New Jersey Devils beat the Florida Panthers 2-1
Sunday night to take a two-game lead in their playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie John Madden set up both odd-man rush goals and Martin
Brodeur stopped 22 shots as the Devils took a commanding 2-0
advantage in the best-of-7 first-round Eastern Conference series by
winning the first two at home.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sillinger scored for Florida, which will play host for the
next two games, on Tuesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The game was the first for Niedermayer since an ugly incident on
March 19, when he whacked Florida's Peter Worrell over the head
with his stick after being elbowed.
</P>
<P>
   There were some chants of ''Scotty, Scotty'' when he stepped on
the ice the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers tried to hit Niedermayer every chance they had, but
no one was around him when he whacked home a Madden rebound 56
seconds into the second period with Florida enjoying a 5-on-3 power
play.
</P>
<P>
   That tied the game at 1 and Stevens got his second playoff goal
in as many games, capping a 2-on-1 with Madden. Stevens worked a
give-and-go with the rookie and then made a great move to his
backhand to slide the puck between the legs of goalie Mike Vernon,
who was outstanding in stopping 28 shots.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur denied Alex Hicks in close less than two minutes after
Stevens scored. He also got lucky when Pavel Bure clanged a shot
off the goal post with 10:37 to go.
</P>
<P>
   Benefiting from an early four-minute power play, the Devils took
nine of the first 10 shots. The only reason they didn't take the
lead was Vernon, who made tough saves on Bobby Holik, Madden and
Claude Lemieux.
</P>
<P>
   Bure, who had a minus-2 rating in the opening game, helped the
Panthers take a 1-0 lead with 5:15 left in the period. He got the
puck in the right corner, charged the net and tried to stuff a shot
in. Brodeur made the save, but Sillinger slammed home the rebound
for his second goal of the series.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils tied it while skating with a two-man disadvantage in
the opening minute of the second period. Panthers defenseman Robert
Svelha could not keep a clearing attempt by Stevens in the New
Jersey zone, setting up a break by Madden down the left wing.
Vernon stopped his slap shot from the circle, but Niedermayer
whacked the rebound out of the air into an open net.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur made two good saves on slap shots by Bure late in the
period and the Devils just missed taking the lead late in the final
minute of the period when Alexander Mogilny banged a slap shot off
the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   Devils left wing Sergei Brylin appeared to hurt his right knee
early in the third period in a collision with Oleg Kvasha.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some concern about an abdominal strain, veteran
defenseman Ken Daneyko played in his 110th consecutive playoff game
for the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey center Jason Arnott, who sprained a wrist in the
Devils' 4-3 Game 1 victory, and Panthers defenseman Mike Wilson,
who bruised a foot, also played.

<HEADLINE> Giants End Homestand With Rainout  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- It took nearly 2{ years to build Pacific
Bell Park. The San Francisco Giants hope it doesn't take that long
for them to win a game in their new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants completed a winless first homestand in the park with
a rainout of their game against the Arizona Diamondbacks on Sunday
night. The game has not yet been rescheduled, but likely will be
added to a series in September.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco lost its first five games at the new park -- three
to Los Angeles and two to Arizona. The Giants' next chance to win
their first game at the $319 million stadium is April 28-30 against
Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know it's early and you always want to get off to a good
start, especially this year with the new park,'' Giants third
baseman Russ Davis said. ''Everything's new to everybody. With
everything that's been going on, the concentration maybe hasn't
been what it needs to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The rainout allowed the Giants, who have lost seven straight
overall, to avoid -- at least for now -- the possibility of becoming
the first team to lose its first six games in a new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants also avoided the possibility of being swept in a
homestand of six games or longer for the first time since 1900.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's some frustration, I'm sure. But it seems more like a
bad dream,'' Giants manager Dusty Baker said. ''We just have to
come home (next week) and start anew.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's Matt Williams, who spent 1987-96 with the Giants, said
the five-game home losing streak was being magnified because of the
new ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they lose five at home in July, it's not a big deal,''
Williams said. ''There's just a lot more attention now.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona also lost its first five games when it debuted Bank One
Ballpark in Phoenix in 1998, but defeated the Giants in its sixth
contest in the park.
</P>
<P>
   Officials waited 1 hour, 42 minutes before postponing the game.
President Clinton and his daughter, Chelsea, were in attendance and
waved to fans just before the postponement was announced.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 28th rainout in San Francisco since the Giants moved
west in 1958. A game against the Dodgers last Wednesday was
suspended in the sixth inning because of rain and completed the
following day.
</P>
<P>
   The rainout and the activation of left-hander Shawn Estes from
the disabled list led Baker to scramble his pitching rotation. Joe
Nathan will pitch Tuesday at Cincinnati and Estes, who had been
sidelined since spring training with left shoulder tendinitis, will
face the Reds on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Gardner, who was scheduled to pitch Wednesday, will move to
the bullpen. Livan Hernandez will pitch Thursday against the Reds,
as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona manager Buck Showalter said he will not juggle his
rotation, but just move everyone back a day. Sunday's scheduled
starter, Omar Daal, will open a series at home against the Colorado
Rockies on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who are you going to skip?'' Showalter asked. ''They're all
pitching well.''
</P>
<P>
Notes: Giants left fielder Barry Bonds said he has been bothered
by soreness in his left shoulder, but that he was prepared to play
Sunday. Bonds, who throws with his left hand, had left elbow
surgery early last season. ... The Giants optioned right-hander
Scott Linebrink to Fresno of the Pacific Coast League to make room
on the roster for Estes.

Asian Markets Plunge
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Asian stock markets plummeted as they opened Monday, reacting
to the record losses on Wall Street last week that left many investors wondering
if its bull market was over. In the world's second largest economy, Japan's
Nikkei Stock Average fell a staggering 1,793.62 points, or 8.8 percent, to
18,641.06 in about the first 90 minutes of trading. Elsewhere, Australia's All
Ordinaries Index fell 5.6 percent at one point, and the Korea Composite Stock
Price Index was down 89.35 points, or 11 percent, to 711.54. The Korea Stock
Exchange said it was a record fall, in both points and percentage, on the index.

Gov't to Some Workers: Stay Home
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The threat of traffic-snarling protests aimed at
disrupting world financial meetings tomorrow has prompted federal authorities to
tell government workers whose offices are in a restricted area around the bank's
headquarters to stay home. The officials said they could not estimate how many
employees that would involve, but such major departments as Commerce, Treasury
and Agriculture -- not to mention the White House -- are headquartered within
the restricted area. Thousands of marchers failed to stop world finance leaders
from meeting today, but paraded through the capital in a show of celebration and
anger that provoked one ugly episode -- a surging crowd met by a stinging cloud
of irritants fired by police.

Elian's Dad Lashes Out at Miami Kin

<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's father lashed out at his Miami relatives on
Sunday, accusing them of ''child abuse'' for turning his son against him and
insisting that the 6-year-old boy wants to return to Cuba. With the boy's fate
still before federal judges, Juan Miguel Gonzalez said on CBS' ''60 Minutes''
that he didn't believe a video taped at the relatives' home in which his son
said he didn't want to go. Family members did not make themselves available
after the show. Protesters, however, dismissed Juan Miguel's comments as either
selfish or the manipulations of Fidel Castro.

FAA To Recommend Boeing 737 Changes

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A special Federal Aviation Administration engineering
board is expected to recommend design changes in the rudder of the Boeing 737,
the world's most widely used jetliner. Top FAA officials said today that
preliminary recommendations prepared by the board also urge changes in training
of crews to deal with rudder problems better and increased rudder inspections.
FAA assistant administrator Thomas McSweeny stressed, however, that the board
considers the likelihood of potential problems with the 737 rudder so small that
it is not recommending immediate corrective action.

Israel Cites Lebanon Withdrawal Concerns
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Attacks on Israel after it withdraws from Lebanon could
lead to war between Israel and Syria, a senior Israeli defense official warned
Sunday. If Syria permits or encourages Lebanese guerrillas to continue their
attacks on Israeli troops along the border after the pullout, promised by July,
Israel will have to ''apply levers to put pressure on the Syrians themselves,
not just on their indirect interests in Lebanon,'' Deputy Defense Minister
Ephraim Sneh said. The result ''could be a military confrontation in Lebanon,''
Sneh told a gathering of his Labor party in a Tel Aviv suburb. Sneh spokesman
Hillel Fartouk released Sneh's statements to The Associated Press.

   AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- The Indiana Pacers clinched the top seed in the
Eastern Conference today, getting 21 points from Reggie Miller in a 112-101
victory over the Detroit Pistons, who were without Grant Hill. Dale Davis added
12 points and 15 rebounds for the Pacers, who will have the homecourt advantage
in the first three rounds of the playoffs. The Pistons clinched a playoff spot
earlier in the day when Orlando lost at Miami. Hill sat out with a bone bruise
in his left foot. He managed just four points in a season-low 16 minutes last
night at Philadelphia.

<HEADLINE> Notes From Sunday's Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Devil Rays-Tigers:
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: By taking two of three in Detroit, the Devil Rays won
their first series of the season and won consecutive games for the
first time since last September. ... Greg Vaughn is batting .423
(11-for-26) during a six-game hitting streak.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: Juan Gonzalez has a double in four straight games. He's
7-for-14 with a .563 on-base percentage in that period. ... Closer
Todd Jones opened the season with 5 1-3 scoreless innings and three
saves before suffering his first blown save Sunday.
Rangers-Indians:
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: John Wetteland's blown save Sunday was his first since
July 17 of last season against Arizona. ... When Esteban Loaiza
struck out Richie Sexson to end the seventh, it gave him five
straight strikeouts and a career-high 10 for the game. Loaiza's
previous high of nine came on July 30, 1998, against Toronto. ...
Despite a 2-1 loss, the Rangers are 30-17 against the Indians since
1996.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: As he began his windup in the first inning Chuck
Finley heard a voice say, ''It looks like he's coming with a
fastball here.'' Apparently, the Indians radio broadcast, which is
piped into the luxury suites, was turned up louder than normal and
the players could hear it on the field. When the inning ended,
Finley told plate umpire Greg Bonin about the problem and the
Indians' dugout called the press box three times to complain. The
situation was finally resolved when stadium operations shut off the
broadcast to the suites. ''I backed off throwing my pitch that
first time,'' said Finley. ''Or it might have been hit it in the
street.'' ... Finley became the first Indians pitcher since John
Farrell in 1989 to have at least 10 strikeouts in consecutive
starts.
Mariners-Blue Jays:
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: The Mariners are 8-4. That matches their best start
ever, previously done in 1996. ... Every Seattle starter picked up
at least one hit against the Blue Jays. ... John Olerud has five
hits in his last five at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: Blue Jay starters are 2-9 with 6.82 ERA ... Toronto
recalled LHP Clayton Andrews from Triple-A Syracuse. To make room,
they optioned INF Chris Woodward to Syracuse. ... On the three
occasions the Blue Jays and Raptors have played at the same time,
the Raptors have outdrawn the Jays each time, including 19,800 to
15,325 Sunday.
Royals-Yankees:
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: The Royals have their first off-day of the season
Monday, before beginning a three-game series in Minnesota. ...
Opponents have taken perfect games into the seventh inning twice
this season against the Royals. ... After hitting .315 with 14
homers and 48 runs in a seven-game homestand, the Royals were held
to .202 with one homer and 10 runs in the three-game series in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Despite Ramiro Mendoza's great start Saturday, manager
Joe Torre would not commit to giving the pitcher a spot in the
rotation all year. ''He's more valuable in the bullpen because he
can pitch more than once every five days. But I also know he'd
rather start.'' ... Jim Leyritz caught for the first time all
season and got his first hit, a tiebreaking solo homer in the
seventh inning. Jorge Posada caught the first 87 innings this
season. ... Jason Grimsley made his first start since Aug. 19, 1996
for Anaheim against Boston. ... The Yankees (5-0) are the only team
undefeated at home.
Athletics-Red Sox:
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: Randy Velarde (knee strain) is eligible to be activated
from the disabled list Monday.. ... Jason Giambi, who
hyper-extended his right knee in Friday's game, pinch-hit in the
eighth inning and flied out. ... Matt Stairs, who entered the game
with two hits in his last 29 at-bats, went 1-for-4 with three
strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: The Red Sox are the only team in the major leagues yet
to record a stolen base. ... RHP Bret Saberhagen is scheduled to
throw a simulated game Saturday and then go on a rehab assignment.
... Troy O'Leary snapped an 0-for-14 hitless skid with a single in
the fourth inning.
Orioles-Twins:
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: Sidney Ponson started on Sunday, a day after fellow
Aruba native Calvin Maduro started for Baltimore. In 1996, Aruban
outfielder Eugene Kingsale played in three games for Baltimore. Two
years later, left-hander Radhames Dykhoff, Ponson's cousin, made
his debut with the Orioles. All four players were originally signed
by Orioles scout Jesus Halabi.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: Minnesota has played 14 consecutive days since the
season opener on April 3. The team's first day off is Monday. ...
The Twins announced plans to offer fans the chance to purchase
authentic unused game tickets from Cal Ripken's 3,000th hit game. A
portion of the proceeds will be donated to the Kelly and Cal Ripken
Jr. Foundation, which primarily supports community adult and family
literacy, youth recreational and health-related programs.
Angels-White Sox:
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: OF Garret Anderson didn't play Sunday after hurting his
left ankle in the first inning the day before while coming out of
the batter's box. ... Mo Vaughn crossed up the White Sox's
defensive strategy in the first inning. With three fielders on the
second base side of the bag, Vaughn lined a double just down the
left-field line to end an 0-for-13 skid. ... RHP Tim Belcher,
recovering from shoulder surgery, made a strong rehab start for
Class A Lake Elsinore. He pitched three hitless innings and struck
out four of the nine High Desert batters he faced. ...
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: SS Jose Valentin missed his third straight game with a
tight hamstring. ... White Sox general manager Ron Schueler was
married Saturday in a ceremony at the Comiskey Park stadium club.
... Chicago manager Jerry Manuel wants to give second baseman Ray
Durham and right fielder Magglio Ordonez a day off this week.
They've played every inning so far this season. ... RHP Tanyon
Sturtze will likely start in place of James Baldwin against Seattle
on Monday. Baldwin is still recovering from a bruised rib suffered
when he was hit by a line drive off the bat of Tampa Bay's Greg
Vaughn last Wednesday.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Expos-Phillies:
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: Vladimir Guerrero has not struck out since Sept. 25,
1999, a span of 21 games and 77 plate appearances. Since that date,
he has hit nine homers and has 25 RBIs. ... Monday's starter,
Javier Vazquez, is 2-0 with a 4.31 ERA in five career apppearance
against Philadelphia. ... Despite a high fever, Mike Thurman
pitched three innings with Class A Jupiter on Saturday. Thurman has
been on the 15-day disabled list with tendinitis in his right
elbow. He allowed three runs on four hits in three innings. He
reported no pain his his elbow after the game.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: Curt Schilling made his third rehab start on
Saturday for Class A Clearwater. The right-hander allowed one hit
and no runs over five innings, striking out seven and walking one.
He threw 79 pitches, 51 for strikes. Schilling had surgery on his
right shoulder in December. ... Saturday's postponement will be
rescheduled as a part of a doubleheader in September, 12th or 13th,
when the Expos come back to Philadelphia.
Mets-Pirates:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Mets RHP Bobby J. Jones will likely miss at least his
next start after straining his right calf in the first inning
Sunday. He left Three Rivers Stadium on crutches and complained of
a burning sensation in his calf. He said, ''I can't put any weight
on it right now. I've never had a pulled or strained muscle before,
so I don't know what to expect. The bad part is I felt great.'' ...
LF Rickey Henderson also was lifted after being hit in the right
thumb by a Kris Benson pitch. Henderson's fingernail was cracked,
but X-rays weren't taken and the injury isn't believed serious. ...
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: Pirates RHP Kris Benson says a stiff neck may be
hampering his follow-through to the plate. He allowed only 16
homers in 31 starts last season but already has surrendered six in
three starts.
Braves-Brewers:
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: Closer John Rocker will return from his two-week
suspension in the Braves' next game, Tuesday against the Phillies
in Atlanta. Controversy aside, the Braves could use the help:
Atlanta's bullpen is 1-4 with a 5.00 ERA and four saves. ... The
Braves haven't yet had to use a fifth starter this season.
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: Everett Stull made his first major league start
against the Braves. The 28-year-old rookie was one of the top
starters at Richmond, Atlanta's Triple-A affiliate, last season
before the Braves released him last month. Stull also spent time in
the Montreal and Baltimore organizations before getting his break
with pitching-poor Milwaukee. ... After taking Monday off, the
Brewers embark on a nine-game road trip, their second-longest of
the season. Milwaukee usually plays predominantly on the road in
April to avoid unpredictable Wisconsin spring weather.
Marlins-Cubs:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO CUBS: SS Ricky Gutierrez extended his hitting streak to
a career high 11 games with a single in the second. ... Cubs
manager Don Baylor said he's concerned about the high number of
strikeouts so far. The Cubs have whiffed 115 times in 14 games,
most in the National League. ''They're alarming to me,'' Baylor
said. ''Power is one thing, if you're getting power. We're not
hitting many home runs at all. It's hard to start runners when
you're swinging and missing.'' ... Of the Cubs' eight losses, four
have come in extra-inning games.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: 2B Luis Castillo, who had started all 12 games, did not
play Sunday because of a strained back. He returned to Miami to
undergo an MRI exam. His status was day to day. ... Paul Bako's
two-run single in the fourth inning Sunday was his first hit as a
Marlin. ... Florida's bullpen has given up only 10 earned runs in
37 1-3 innings and has not been charged with a run in six games on
the Marlins' current road trip.
Cardinals-Rockies:
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: 1B Mark McGwire, who has missed four straight games,
will be re-evaluated Monday after receiving treatment over the
weekend for inflammation in his lower back. St. Louis has Monday
off before opening a 10-game homestand Tuesday. ... OF Jim Edmonds
has gone 1-for-12 after a string of nine straight hits. ... St.
Louis scrapped plans to recall RHP Gene Stechschulte for Sunday's
doubleheader against Colorado. Instead, Alan Benes remained on the
active roster.
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: Manager Buddy Bell said he probably will bring RHP
Rolando Arrojo back Thursday on three days' rest. Arrojo threw 81
pitches in the first game of a doubleheader Sunday. He gave up
eight runs in four innings. Colorado traded for Arrojo during the
winter, in part because of his control. He walked three hitters and
they all scored. Arrojo also hit a batter with the bases loaded.
... Opposing pinch-hitters are 1-for-18 against Colorado. The only
hit was a homer by Hal Morris.
Astros-Padres:
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: True to form, San Diego fans continued their recent
trend of booing former players making their first visit back to
Qualcomm Stadium. 3B Ken Caminiti received a warm ovation in his
first at-bat Saturday night. But in each of his subsequent at-bats,
the booing grew louder. ''I don't really care,'' Caminiti said.
''If they boo me, they boo me. I'm playing for another team now.
When I was here, the fans supported me and I appreciate that.''
Caminiti, the 1996 NL MVP with San Diego, did not play against the
Padres in any of the nine meetings last season or Friday night
because of injuries. San Diego fans also loudly booed former stars
Kevin Brown and Steve Finley last year in their initial returns.
... The Astros have not lost a season series to San Diego since
1992, winning six series and tying one. ... RF Moises Alou (calf)
missed his second straight game.
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: The most improved Padre this season has been reliever
Carlos Almanzar. The right-hander was a bust last season with an
ERA of 7.47 in 28 games. Almanzar, who had a rough beginning to
spring training, began developing his other pitches to compliment
his 91-92 mph fastball. He has been the perfect compliment to
closer Trevor Hoffman, filling the void left with the offseason
trade of setup man Dan Miceli. Almanzar has been nearly untouchable
in allowing one hit with 11 strikeouts in 8 2-3 innings. ... Tony
Gwynn's chronic left knee continues to keep him sidelined. The
right fielder has missed six straight games since having his knee
drained after Monday's game.
Reds-Dodgers:
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: The Reds extended their streak to nine games with at
least one error on Sunday, when Jose Vizcaino's grounder went
through the legs of third baseman Mark Lewis. It is the first time
they have committed an error in more than eight consecutive games
since an 11-game stretch in 1974. Only three NL teams -- New York,
Philadelphia and Arizona -- made fewer errors than Cincinnati last
season.
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: Reliever Antonio Osuna, who underwent elbow surgery
last September, is scheduled to pitch for San Bernardino in a rehab
outing on Monday before making his next one with Triple-A
Albuquerque. Manager Davey Johnson said he expects the right-hander
to be activated by May 1. ... 1B Eric Karros, who never used to be
hesitant about diving for foul balls in front of the visiting
dugout at Dodger Stadium, thought twice about it on a checked-swing
foul by Mark Lewis in the second inning on Sunday. The dirt warning
track has been replaced by a hard synthetic surface.
Diamondbacks-Giants:
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: Giants manager Dusty Baker and general manager
Brian Sabean met for one hour in a closed-door session in Baker's
office before Sunday's scheduled game against the Diamondbacks.
Neither said what the meeting was about. ... The Giants have been
ineffective against opponents' bottom of the order. In fact,
through the first five games at Pacific Bell Park, visiting No. 8
hitters were 10-for-19 with six homers and 11 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: By winning Friday and Saturday against the Giants, the
Diamondbacks ensured themselves of winning a sixth straight series
against San Francisco. The D'backs went 9-3 against the Giants last
season, and picked right back up this year with their winning ways
against San Francisco. ... Arizona had a winning record on its
first road trip of the season, which ended Sunday. The Diamondbacks
went 25-6 in their final 31 regular-season road games last season,
a big reason they won the NL West.

<HEADLINE> SuperSonics 121, Rockets 112  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Gary Payton scored a career-high 43 points Sunday
night to lead the Seattle SuperSonics to a 121-112 victory over the
Houston Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second career-high of the season for Payton, who had
never scored more than 38 during the first nine years of his
career. He had 41 points against Washington on Feb. 15 and 40
against Vancouver on March 13.
</P>
<P>
   Payton shot 17-for-31 from the field and 7-for-8 from the line
in the highest-scoring game by a Rockets opponent this season.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran guard also had 11 rebounds and seven assists.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle moved into a tie with Sacramento for seventh place in
the conference. Those two teams, who face each other Tuesday night
at Sacramento, want to avoid dropping to the eighth spot and a
first-round matchup with the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Vin Baker added 16 points, Rashard Lewis 15, Lazaro Borrell 12,
Shammond Williams 11 and Horace Grant 10. Payton also had seven
assists.
</P>
<P>
   Cuttino Mobley had career highs of 35 points and nine rebounds
to lead Houston. Steve Francis scored 20 with nine rebounds while
Matt Bullard and Shandon Anderson added 15 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets had their five-game winning streak snapped and lost
for just the third time in 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Payton scored eight early points to lead Seattle on a 10-0 run
in the first quarter that lifted the Sonics to a 27-9 lead. Seattle
took its biggest lead at 38-19 at the end of the period as Payton
had 15.
</P>
<P>
   Houston went on an 11-2 run at the start of the second quarter
to close to 40-30. Later in the period, Bullard hit three
3-pointers sandwiched around a pair of Moochie Norris free throws
to pull the Rockets to 50-47.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle settled for a 60-54 halftime lead as Payton had 23
points.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics stretched that to as many as 16 with the help of a
3-pointer by Payton with 4:31 left in the third. Payton had 32 as
the period ended with Seattle leading 88-75.
</P>
<P>
   Houston went on an 11-0 run midway through the fourth to cut the
Seattle lead to 93-90 before Lewis scored seven and Borrell four to
lead the Sonics on a 14-4 run that boosted their lead to 107-94
with 4:01 to play.
</P>
<P>
Notes: It was the first time in 13 games this season that the
Rockets shot 50 percent or better (50.6) and lost ... Walt
Williams, who has averaged 21.2 points the last five games, served
a one-game suspension for Thursday's altercation with Dallas' Shawn
Bradley. ... Payton had a season-high streak of 16 games of scoring
20 or more points ended in Friday's loss at Dallas ... The Sonics
evened their road record to 20-20.

<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Karl Malone, riled by a no-call in the third
quarter, had 32 points and 15 rebounds Sunday night as the Utah
Jazz beat the Phoenix Suns 96-82 to clinch their fourth Midwest
Division title in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   Utah swept the season series from the Suns for the first time

<P>
   With the loss, the Suns' lead over San Antonio slipped to one
game with two to play in the race for the No. 4 spot in the Western
Conference and homecourt advantage in the first round of the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Malone scored 21 in the second half as Utah pulled away from a
40-40 halftime tie. Jeff Hornacek, honored by the Suns before the
game, scored 11 of his 13 points in the fourth quarter. Bryon
Russell scored 16 for Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Hardaway scored 16 for Phoenix but was only 6-for-14 from
the field. Shawn Marion scored 15, but only two in the second half.
Todd Day added 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz, who had lost three of four and were blown out 106-83
at San Antonio on Saturday night, outscored the Suns 28-14 in the
third quarter to take a 68-54 lead into the final period.
</P>
<P>
   Day's 3-pointer cut the lead to 74-64 with 9:19 to play, but
Malone made 12-footer and Hornacek an 18-footer and Phoenix never
threatened again.
</P>
<P>
   Utah was leading 52-46 when Malone was flattened by the Suns'
Oliver Miller and no foul was called. Malone drew a technical foul
for protesting, Cliff Robinson missed the free throw, and the Jazz
went on a 14-0 run to open a 63-48 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Malone scored five and Howard Eisley sank a 3-pointer during the
run.
</P>
<P>
   The Jazz outrebounded Phoenix 49-31 and were 20-for-29 from the
free-throw line, compared with the Suns' 11-for-19.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix led nearly all of a close first half that ended in a
40-40 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Utah's only lead of the half was 39-38 on John Stockton's
15-footer with 57 seconds to go. Miller's rebound basket but
Phoenix ahead 40-39 with 8.7 seconds remaining, then Stockton tied
it by making one of two free throws with 4.6 seconds to play.
</P>
<P>
@Notes: Hornacek, who is retiring at the end of the season, was
presented a set of golf clubs by Suns owner Jerry Colangelo before
the game. Hornacek played his first six seasons in Phoenix. ...
After going 1-for-7 in the first three quarters, Hornacek was
5-for-5 in the fourth. ... The Suns' Kevin Johnson, who missed the
previous two games after aggravating a strained groin, played only
eight minutes in the first half before he left the game for good
with the same injury. ... Marion had four baseline slam dunks on
lob passes in the first half, two of them from Hardaway.

<HEADLINE> LA's Fiset Gets Start Vs. Detroit  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- Even a setback as big as giving up
four goals in the game's first 6:56 won't keep Stephane Fiset from
retaining his starting spot in goal against the Detroit Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset gave up four of the six fastest goals scored in playoff
history in the Los Angeles Kings' 8-5 loss to the Red Wings on
Saturday. He was pulled for Jamie Storr after giving up a fifth
goal early in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, he still has a .500 record against Detroit this
year,'' Kings coach Andy Murray said Sunday. ''He's been very good
against them and I thought he was outstanding in the first game (a
2-0 loss). Maybe one of the reasons Stephane is playing tomorrow is
because of that system of coaching that I have. I believe you show
support for your people.''
</P>
<P>
   Detroit leads the best-of-7 Western Conference first-round
series 2-0, with games Monday night and Wednesday night at Staples
Center in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of people that are trying to influence our
psyche right now, and try to tell you that when you're down two
games you can't win,'' Murray said after practice at the Kings'
suburban training center.
</P>
<P>
   History indicates that, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings have never been able to win a best-of-7 series after
losing the first two. Two years ago, they were swept by St. Louis
in four games in the first round, the same year Detroit won its
second straight Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ''We may be down two games in the series, but the one thing that
we feel good about is that we haven't played as good as we can
yet,'' Murray said. ''That is a shot of inspiration and adrenaline
for us, that we can play better. It's very possible that Detroit
can as well.''
</P>
<P>
   During the flight back from Detroit on Saturday night, the Kings
watched ''Saving Private Ryan.'' Ian Laperriere compared the
movie's first 24 minutes, in which the Germans are bombarding the
Allied forces on the beach at Normandy, to the Red Wings' early
offensive assault.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somebody said that's Stephane Fiset in the first five minutes.
They were shooting from everywhere,'' Laperriere said. ''He was out
there by himself. We made mistakes. It's not his fault. You can't
say one goal was his fault.''
</P>
<P>
   As painful as it might be, Fiset planned to watch video of Game
2.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's always good to see the mistakes you made,'' he said.
''It's not like I was playing a bad game. It's just I wasn't making
the big save. I'm going to come back strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiset lost both his starts for the Kings in the 1998 playoff
series against St. Louis, one year after helping Colorado win the
Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not playing the same way I was two years ago. I'm a better
goalie,'' he said. ''I can endure more pressure and come back
strong after a bad game. You learn a lot from going through a bad
time like two years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings were as amazed as the Kings at the rapid-fire
scoring in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing went like we expected,'' Detroit's Larry Murphy said.
''But that's why you can't take anything for granted, especially
not a team that can score like the Kings.''
</P>
<P>
   It was just the opposite in Game 1, where Detroit's first goal
deflected off a Kings player and its second was an empty-netter in
what turned out to be a defensive struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ''At least we know we can score against (Detroit goalie Chris)
Osgood. That's one thing we didn't do in the first game,''
Laperriere said. ''Stephane is going to come back stronger and I'm
sure Osgood is going to also. I don't think we're going to expect
an 8-5 game tomorrow.''

<HEADLINE> One dead, 2 Injured in Boat Race  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- One person was killed and at least two
others injured during a powerboat race Sunday on San Francisco Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the 35 boats participating in the Pacific Offshore
Powerboat Racing Association's Golden Gate Challenge were involved
in accidents, said San Francisco Police Inspector Narda Ziegler.
</P>
<P>
   Three people were onboard the boat involved in the fatal
accident, Ziegler said. The boat hit a swell, tossing two of the
three overboard. One of the two died at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco medical examiner's office identified him as
Clark Donley, 40, of Alamo. An autopsy is expected Monday.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates were in stable condition Sunday, Ziegler said.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the second accident were not immediately available.
The race started just west of Blossom Rock Buoy and ended at the
south tower of the Golden Gate Bridge.

<HEADLINE> Residents begin turning over illegal guns of deceased owners  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- What a difference a little publicity can
make.
</P>
<P>
   A week after a newspaper article described how Onondaga County
authorities were trying to track down thousands of handguns that
belonged to people who have died, residents have begun responding.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-seven people called the sheriff's department in the last
week to turn in guns. The callers said they were unaware that state
law required the weapons to be turned over to police within 15 days
of the death of a licensed pistol holder, or for someone else to be
licensed within that time, Detective Ray Herrick said. After 15
days, it's a misdemeanor for the guns to be in someone's home
without a license.
</P>
<P>
   Before the turn-ins of the past week, the department only had
received about 20 guns. Herrick said he's arranging to have the
weapons recovered from the people who have called. Some of the
pistol license holders died years ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are saying, 'We didn't know what to do,' '' Herrick
said. ''I'm sure a lot of it is that people forget because that's a
tough time in their lives. It's a little more important to deal
with their families than to deal with this pistol.''
</P>
<P>
   Herrick's time also has been spent doing interviews with
reporters from around the world about the county's unique project
to track down an estimated 12,000 unaccounted-for handguns of dead
people.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's department may be the first police agency in the
country to try to track down the guns of dead people, said Leonard
Curry, editor of Washington Crime News Service, a publication that
goes out to law enforcement agencies nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't seen anything like it,'' Curry said. ''I told
Herrick all he had to do was hold a contest to come up with a name
for it. He gets a zinger of a name, and he'll get a big grant.''
</P>
<P>
   Herrick, supervisor of the Onondaga County Sheriff's Department
pistol license unit, said he's gotten some complaints from people
who said the county or the state ought to reimburse people for the
handguns they turn in.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a case of somebody taking something without paying for
it, and that's stealing,'' said Clifford M. Kalb of Syracuse, a
72-year-old licensed pistol holder who has three handguns and
doesn't want his survivors to have to deal with them after he's
gone.
</P>
<P>
   But Herrick said the guns turned in to police can go back to the
families after they've arranged to get a pistol license. Or the
families can have a licensed gun dealer sell them to someone with a
license.
</P>
<P>
   Once the guns are turned in, the sheriff's department must hold
them for one year before destroying them. The whole process of
collecting all the guns is expected to take at least five years but
probably will last much longer.
</P>
<P>
   Police estimate there are as many as 4,000 cases in the county
alone. The licenses belong to people who would be at least 75 years
old if they are alive. Many of the gun owners would be in their
mid-100s.
</P>
<P>
   Since pistol license holders own an average of three guns each,
about 12,000 handguns are likely out there, either held illegally
by relatives or unaccounted for, police said. Files date back to
1931.
</P>
<P>
   A detective has so far found one case in which a pistol license
holder died and one of his guns wound up on the streets, traded for
drugs by a criminal.
</P>
<P>
   It's likely that a good number of the 1.1 million pistol
licenses in the state belong to people who are long gone, said Sgt.
James Sherman, head of the state police pistol license unit.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies stumbled onto the glut of unaccounted-for handguns in
the county five years ago when they started looking for a way to
reduce the load of paper records in the pistol license unit. They
discovered that a vast number of licenses apparently belonged to
the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's officials met with the Onondaga-Oswego Funeral
Directors Association a month ago to tell them about their project.
The funeral directors, who had been unaware of the state law, have
started passing on the information to grieving families. It has
become part of their routine checklist to ask a dead person's
survivor if he or she had any licensed handguns at home, said
Patricia A. Knight, treasurer of the association.
</P>
<P>
   The county's project is getting started as a national debate
rages over handgun control and how to reduce the number of weapons
available to criminals. The project should serve notice that
thousands of unaccounted-for guns would have been off the streets
if people had known the law and followed it, officials said.
