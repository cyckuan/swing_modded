Bush Steps Up Attack on Gore
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican George W. Bush sharpened the attack on his
rival, saying Democrat Al Gore is an ''obstacle to reform'' who is too partisan
to be president, much less fix Social Security or enact meaningful changes to
the campaign finance system. In an interview Wednesday with the Washington Post,
Bush pledged to stick with his plan for a sizable tax cut despite polls showing
tepid voter interest in one. He also said he would make saving Social Security a
focus of the fall debate against Gore.

US Envoy's Mission to Taiwan Begins

<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Praising the island's vibrant democracy, a U.S. envoy
began a mission to Taiwan on Wednesday in hopes of learning how serious the
newly elected president is about avoiding war with China. Lee Hamilton came to
Taipei hours after a U.S. diplomat wrapped up talks with Chinese leaders in
Beijing, saying he was encouraged by China's cautious attitude with Taiwan. The
diplomatic missions followed opposition leader Chen Shui-bian's stunning victory
in Taiwan's presidential election Saturday. Beijing distrusts Chen, 49, because
his party supports Taiwan independence.

Administration Maintains Pressure on Gun Cos.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Maintaining pressure on gun manufacturers, the Clinton
administration announced that 29 cities and counties will give preference to gun
makers that follow the lead of Smith &AMP; Wesson -- producing safer firearms and
adopting a code of responsible conduct. Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development Andrew Cuomo urged communities of every size to join the effort and
said preferential buying can force the gun industry to fall in line behind the
Smith &AMP; Wesson agreement because sales to law enforcement agencies represent 20
percent to 30 percent of the U.S. gun market.

Richardson: OPEC Will Hike Output
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson expressed confidence
Wednesday that oil-producing nations will increase production in a move likely
to reduce soaring oil prices. OPEC cut production by 4.3 million barrels a day
more than a year ago after prices plummeted to below $11 a barrel. Since then,
prices have soared as high as $34 per barrel. The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries meets March 27 in Vienna.

Pope Reaches Out to Palestinians

   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) -- Despite the Vatican's portrayal of his trip to
Israel as purely spiritual, Pope John Paul II touched on contentious issues of
clear consequence to the region. The pontiff Wednesday proclaimed Palestinians'
''natural right to a homeland'' and visited a camp for refugees exiled from
their homes since the 1948 Mideast War. Earlier in the day, John Paul called for
international action to end Palestinian suffering. ''Your torment is before the
eyes of the world,'' he declared. ''And it has gone on for too long.''

Lewinsky Touts Her New Role

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Enough with the talk about the president, Monica Lewinsky
has embarked on her next calling in life: Businesswoman. Lewinsky has put an
''Inc.'' after her name and is selling a line of high-end handbags on the
Internet and at one of New York's toniest designer shops. But she still faces
skeptics who wonder if she can build her name into a respected brand or will
quickly fall from notoriety like other celebrities-by-scandal. Lewinsky first
started stitching the bags the while being cooped up at home during the Clinton
mess.

Study Dispels Herpes Myths
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- People infected with genital herpes can spread it even
between flare-ups, when they have no symptoms, new research suggests. Up until
recently, patients and even most doctors thought people with herpes could safely
have unprotected sex when they had no symptoms, which can include painful,
oozing blisters, ulcers and fissures and tingling and burning. Most doctors
advised patients to abstain from sex during flare-ups, but some said sex with a
condom was OK.

<HEADLINE> Euphemistically speaking, that is the way government talks  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A ''euphemism,'' according to Webster's New
World Dictionary, is the use of a less distasteful or offensive
word or a phrase to substitute for another.
</P>
<P>
   A ''euphemism,'' according to many in government in New York --
if not the rest of the country and the world -- is a stock in trade,
a modus operandi, an everyday way of describing for the public its
activities using words and phrases that really don't describe
anything.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, for instance, the state Department of
Environmental Conservation (DEC) approved some rule changes for the
state's ''ozone non-attainment area.'' Translation: The smoggiest
region of New York, encompassing New York City and nearby counties.
</P>
<P>
   ''Non-attainment'' is a euphemism for failure, as in Syracuse
University's basketball team has a record of ''non-attainment'' in
winning an NCAA championship or Mario Cuomo was a ''non-attainer''
in his run for governor against George Pataki in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The state DEC isn't the only agency which finds the use of the
word ''failure'' distasteful.
</P>
<P>
   State education officials, in grading new standardized tests for
New York school children, have come up with the category of
students who showed only ''partial'' or ''minimal'' achievement or
-- worst of all -- ''no evidence'' of achievement on the
examinations.
</P>
<P>
   To most of the rest of the world, that means the students
failed.
</P>
<P>
   And smoggy counties and struggling students are hardly the only
ones getting put through the government's rhetorical wringer, New
York style:
JUST SHOOT ME
</P>
<P>
   Hunters, sometimes euphemistically known as ''sportsmen,'' like
to think of themselves as a hale and hearty lot, capable of waiting
stoically in a blind or doggedly tracking prey for hours, if not
days.
</P>
<P>
   Yet government would not dare offend these rugged individuals
when taking account of their activities, or perhaps not dare offend
the rest of New Yorkers who don't hunt.
</P>
<P>
   In the DEC's annual reports on hunting in New York, wildlife is
never ''killed'' or ''shot'' but rather ''taken'' or ''harvested.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's growing deer herds are ''managed'' by hunters with
the help of their guns and crossbows. In areas where herds really
need hunters' special form of management, hunters can shoot a
second deer -- their big-game licenses entitled them to one -- if
they hold a special ''Deer Management Permit'' from the state.
</P>
<P>
   Hunters may not kill deer, but cars do. The DEC is not squeamish
when reporting that deer are ''killed'' by motorists in the
agency's annual tallies of the car-deer collisions occurring across
the state.
FINE BY ME
</P>
<P>
   A top aide to Pataki paid $2,000 to the state Ethics Commission
last week. But don't think that state operations director James
Natoli was being punished by the commission for accepting expensive
dinners from Philip Morris' chief lobbyist in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Natoli's check represented a ''payment in lieu of assessment''
as part of a ''disposition agreement'' Natoli signed with the
commission. Translation: He paid as part of a deal which precluded
the commission from formally fining him in its inquiry of the
dinners, all in excess of the $75 limit, that lobbyist Sharon
Portnoy put on her corporate credit card. Natoli acknowledged doing
nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   This bit of legal hairsplitting is first cousin to the ''consent
decree,'' which the DEC, the state attorney general's office and
other state agencies frequently enter into. Usually, companies,
individuals and others signing consent decrees are being
investigated by the state. They typically agree to pay a fine, are
allowed to state in writing that they did nothing wrong and the
state gets them to promise never to do it again.
TAKING A TOLL
</P>
<P>
   The state Thruway Authority created a new variation this year on
''revenue enhancer,'' the now-classic government euphemism for a
tax or fee increase.
</P>
<P>
   The Authority's board was considering what it referred to as a
''toll adjustment plan.'' Translation: Annual toll hikes for
motorists of up to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, amid criticism from politicians, commercial truckers
and other motorists, the ''toll adjustment plan'' was ''taken'' by
the board and consigned to ''non-attainment'' status. There is ''no
evidence'' of its ''achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   Euphemistically speaking.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani snubs fellow Republican mayor  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Guess who didn't come to dinner?
</P>
<P>
   GOP officials said Wednesday that Rudolph Giuliani intentionally
snubbed a fellow Republican mayor last week when he assembled
Republican leaders from the Utica-Rome area to discuss his Senate
candidacy. Giuliani is running against Democrat Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City mayor had a private dinner Saturday night at a
downtown Utica restaurant with several dozen GOP bigwigs. Not
invited was Rome Mayor Joseph Griffo.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't receive an invitation. I was not aware of the dinner
... until the day after it happened. I saw it on the news,'' Griffo
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Republican sources, including one very close to Giuliani, said
Griffo was excluded from the session because he was one of the
mayors assembled by Gov. George Pataki to speak out against Sen.
John McCain and for Texas Gov. George W. Bush before New York's
March 7 presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   ''The guy was taking shots at Rudy. It wasn't the McCain thing
per se'' said one Giuliani confidant, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor of Rome said he couldn't understand the move given
that he is a supporter of the mayor's Senate candidacy and felt he
had good relations with his New York City counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know of no reason they should not have included me,
particularly if you're looking for the support of your colleagues
across the state,'' Griffo said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Giuliani and Clinton are working hard at building upstate
support. It is considered a key geographical battleground in the
Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Griffo said he has made no derogatory statements about Giuliani.
The Rome mayor said he had told a news conference in Yonkers that
he was disappointed Giuliani hadn't joined the other mayors on hand
to help boost Bush's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Griffo recalled Wednesday that he had also said at the time that
''the mayor's going to be needing to make a contrast between Mrs.
Clinton and himself, so I don't see the difference'' between that
and contrasting the Bush and McCain records.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know he's an opinionated person and has strong beliefs ...
but I don't understand if you're trying to build a coalition to
undertake a campaign and win why you would want to try to
disenfranchise anybody,'' Griffo added.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he still was a Giuliani supporter, Griffo said:
''Presently, I am.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rome mayor said he hadn't yet called Giuliani or his aides,
but planned to.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to make an effort to reach out to make a
determination if there's a problem and what their problem is,''
Griffo said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and Pataki, who headed up Bush's successful New York
primary campaign, got in a snit just before the voting when the
mayor refused to join in on attacks against McCain. Giuliani said
that while he was backing Bush, he considered McCain a friend. The
Pataki camp complained that Giuliani was more worried about turning
off McCain supporters who he needed for the Senate race than about
helping Bush.

<HEADLINE> McCall calls on Pataki to speak out on NYPD shooting  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- State Comptroller H. Carl McCall says Gov.
George Pataki should speak out on police shooting victim Patrick
Dorismond's death and convene a commission to investigate the
relationship between the police and the communities they patrol.
</P>
<P>
   McCall, the first black to win election to statewide office,
also criticized New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's handling of
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a time for thoughtful action, not antagonistic
attack,'' McCall, a Democrat, said in a letter to the Republican
governor Wednesday. ''Absent any leadership from the mayor, it is
imperative you become involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki thinks McCall's letter is just a political ploy, Pataki
spokesman Michael McKeon said. McCall has expressed interest in
running for governor in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would have expected the comptroller to join the governor in
waiting for a full investigation of the facts of this case before
rushing to judgment,'' McKeon said. ''We're certain that is the
tact he would have taken in the past. Unfortunately, it's clear
that his political ambitions now come first.''
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller, who said Giuliani ''has chosen to drive a wedge
to further divide the city'' and is ''unable or unwilling to
provide the leadership to restore calm and confidence'' called on
Pataki to appoint a commission to study NYPD-related issues,
including the use of street crime units, officers' use of deadly
force, racial profiling and minority police recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every New Yorker wants to have trust in the police officers
that patrol their neighborhoods. Unfortunately, that confidence and
trust has been undermined,'' McCall said. ''And Mayor Giuliani is
doing nothing to restore that trust. The governor must step up.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond, 26, was fatally shot by a New York City policeman
last week during an attempted drug sting outside a midtown
Manhattan bar. He was unarmed.
</P>
<P>
   After the shooting, Giuliani defended the police officer and
released Dorismond's criminal record, including a sealed juvenile
offense. Democrats, including U.S. Senate candidate Hillary
Clinton, have since criticized the mayor's handling of the
situation, including the release of the sealed record.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver has even scheduled hearings on
how Giuliani and the NYPD got hold of the sealed juvenile records
and how to stop it from happening in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am saddened that the mayor is continuing his pattern of
dividing and polarizing New Yorkers,'' Clinton said. ''At a time
when New Yorkers are in desperate need of leadership that can bring
the city together, Rudy Giuliani continues to tear people apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has lashed back, saying all of the attacks are
political in nature. ''The reality is that this is a politicized
response ... this is political piling on,'' he said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   McCall, who also has clashed with Giuliani in the past when the
mayor challenged his right to audit the books of New York City
agencies, said politics has nothing to do with what he's trying to
do.
</P>
<P>
   ''The police are fearful about going into some communities and
some communities are fearful about the police being in them,''
McCall said. ''So I don't know who else to turn to except the
governor because the mayor is incapable of addressing this
situation and it's not just a New York City problem.''

<HEADLINE> Stores seek relief from gas, cigarette taxes  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- More and more these days, when cars roll
into Charlie Schmidt's service station in Sanborn it's not a
fill-up the drivers want.
</P>
<P>
   It's directions to the Tuscorora Indian Reservation, about two
miles away.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel like that's a slap in the face,'' the businessman says.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers are undoubtedly looking for the cheaper gas and
cigarettes available from his Native American competitors.
</P>
<P>
   It's just one way consumers are skirting high taxes, say gas
station and convenience store owners who rely on fuel and tobacco
sales for two-thirds of their business. Add competition from the
Internet and border states, they say, and it's getting harder to
stay open.
</P>
<P>
   While encouraged by proposals before lawmakers to limit Internet
sales of tobacco and temporarily suspend the state sales tax on
gasoline, the New York Association of Convenience Stores on
Wednesday said more relief is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This issue is not about the current cost of gasoline nor is it
an issue about smoking,'' said Robert Newman, president of NOCO
Express and chairman-elect of NYACS. ''This is an issue of tax
fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statewide public awareness campaign, the 3,000-member
association is taking aim at the state's doubling of the cigarette
tax to a highest-in-the-nation $1.11 effective March 1, and the
state sales and petroleum business taxes levied on gasoline. All
should be reduced or repealed, NYACS said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The convenience store industry contributes over one billion
dollars a year into the western New York economy alone,'' said
NYACS President Jim Calvin. ''However the current tax structure
threatens many operators and we anticipate that this flow of
dollars will shrink considerably.''
</P>
<P>
   Permanently eliminating the sales tax on gasoline and lowering
the 13-cent per gallon petroleum business tax to a nickel would
bring the cost of gas down by 12 to 15 cents a gallon without
depleting funds set aside for road and bridge maintenance,
supporters said. A state tax official did not return phone calls
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   State taxes add between 31 and 33 cents to the price of gasoline
in New York, while the state tax in Massachusetts is 21 cents and
in New Jersey, 14 cents. No state tax is charged on reservation gas
sales.
</P>
<P>
   As for cigarettes, the state should roll back the 55-cent tax
increase, NYACS said, or begin collecting tax from reservation
cigarette sales, an unlikely prospect. Cigarettes sell for about
$2.29 on tax-exempt reservations and $4 to $5 a pack elsewhere in
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin said members are reporting sales decreases of 30 to 50
percent since the increase took effect.
</P>
<P>
   The cigarette tax is designed to raise $400 million a year to
help fund a new medical insurance program for working poor New
Yorkers. Advocates predict it will compel 270,000 adult New Yorkers
to quit smoking and 30,000 youngsters not to take up the habit.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin said that is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the universe of smokers were to gradually shrink and
thousands of smokers quit smoking because the higher tax made it
too expensive, store owners could and would adapt,'' he said. ''But
that's not what is happening here. Rather than exiting tobacco
road, smokers are simply detouring to the reservations, the
Internet and border states to avoid paying the higher tax.''

<HEADLINE> Runaway Van Kills Boy in N.C.  </HEADLINE>
By ESTES THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, N.C. (AP) -- A van unexpectedly shifted into reverse
then plowed backward into students waiting for classes to begin at
a middle school Wednesday. A 10-year-old boy was killed and six
other children and the driver were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The minivan's driver, 84-year-old Sara Bell Kennedy, had just
dropped off two children at Smithfield Middle School when the
vehicle suddenly lurched into reverse, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of a sudden, we saw a van going really fast in reverse,''
said Brittany Sherman, 14. ''It hit a student, and he went
flying.''
</P>
<P>
   As students frantically tried to get out of its path, the van
crossed a sandy yard, knocked down a flagpole and finally stopped
when it hit the school's brick wall.
</P>
<P>
   One student was trapped beneath the van, and others were briefly
pinned between the van and the building, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I put my hands on my face and started crying and praying,''
said Melissa Cockrell, 14.
</P>
<P>
   Byrone Murray died a short time later at Johnston Memorial
Hospital, said spokeswoman Susan Phillips. An 11-year-old student
and the driver were in stable condition. Three other students were
treated and released.
</P>
<P>
   At UNC Hospitals in Chapel Hill, a 12-year-old boy was in
critical condition with head injuries, and an 11-year-old student
was in serious condition with broken bones, pelvic injuries and
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The accident occurred at 7:45 a.m. outside the school's front
door.
</P>
<P>
   A crisis team of social workers, counselors and psychologists
was sent to the school but classes continued as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Police were still trying to determine why the minivan
unexpectedly shifted into reverse with Kennedy inside.
</P>
<P>
   George Mast, Kennedy's attorney, said he does not anticipate any
charges against his client. He said the last thing Kennedy
remembered was shifting into reverse to back away from a car parked
in front of her.
</P>
<P>
   ''The next thing she heard was the children screaming,'' he told
The News &AMP; Observer of Raleigh for a story in Thursday's editions.
''She doesn't remember anything in between.''

<HEADLINE> AOC Seeks Cycle Test Clarification  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The Australian Olympic Committee,
seeking to avoid possible legal challenges by athletes at the 2000
Games, has asked the IOC for clarification on blood testing of
cyclists.
</P>
<P>
   AOC president John Coates, also seeking a test case in the Court
of Arbitration for Sport over the legality of neck-to-ankle
bodysuits for swimmers, now wants the IOC to confirm it will back
bans resulting from doping tests conducted by the international
cycling federation (UCI).
</P>
<P>
   The UCI will conduct the blood tests of cyclists in the leadup
to and during Olympic competition, using its own medical staff and
protocol.
</P>
<P>
   The UCI conducts blood tests at all its major international
events, including the Tour de France. The IOC has not yet
sanctioned a universal blood test to implement in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Coates said he was pleased the UCI was conducting the tests at
the Olympics. But he had concerns about legal challenges from
banned cyclists if athletes in other sports were not subjected to
blood testing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not sure where (blood testing procedures in cycling) sits
with the IOC medical commission, particularly if there is a ruling
that an athlete should be withdrawn from the games following a
positive test,'' he was quoted saying in Thursday's Sydney Morning
Herald.
</P>
<P>
   The UCI introduced blood cell tests -- which it refers to as
''health checks'' -- to combat the use of erythropoietin (EPO)
within the sport.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC's current doping testing procedure is restricted to the
analysis of urine samples provided by athletes and cannot detect
EPO.
</P>
<P>
   Because the ''health check'' is not an absolute test for EPO,
the UCI disqualifies cyclists who show positive results from
competition on the grounds that the athlete would be endangering
his or her health by competing.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC and the Australian government is funding research at the
Australian Institute of Sport to formulate a blood test to detect
EPO. Researchers are confident a valid test will be produced before
the Olympics. Sydney 2000 organizers have measures in place to
implement blood testing as soon as the procedure is approved by the
IOC.
</P>
<P>
   Cycling Australia president Ray Godkin said ''EPO is running
riot'' in endurance cycling events and the UCI was determined to
test cyclists from all 53 nations qualified for the Olympics.

   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Portland Trail Blazers center Arvydas
Sabonis severely sprained his right foot Wednesday night when he
fell awkwardly after being bumped by Detroit's Christian Laettner.
</P>
<P>
   The injury occurred with four minutes left in the third quarter,
and the Blazers ahead 75-64.
</P>
<P>
   Sabonis got a long lob pass from Rasheed Wallace near the
basket, and Laettner nudged him with his right arm. Sabonis' left
foot slipped, and the 7-foot-3 player fell to the floor, his right
foot pinned underneath.
</P>
<P>
   Sabonis howled in pain, and he was helped from the floor by
teammates, unable to put any weight on his right leg.
</P>
<P>
   Laettner was called for a personal foul.
</P>
<P>
   Sabonis had 15 points and seven rebounds when he was hurt.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Shares Surge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan shares closed higher for the third
consecutive session Thursday, boosted by a 3.25 percent jump in the
Nasdaq composite index and growing confidence in President-elect
Chen Shui-bian, analysts and traders said.
</P>
<P>
   The Weighted Price Index surged 5.1 percent, up 464.48 points at
9,533.87. On Wednesday the index had risen 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were encouraged by Chen's circumspect statements on
future relations with Beijing, which dispelled initial concerns he
may assert Taiwan independence and provoke a war with China.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the time being, the atmosphere is good on the market side
and on the politics side,'' said Alan Tseng, a senior analyst at
Capital Securities Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Chen has been conciliatory toward Beijing and investors almost
immediately shook off any war fears early this week, focusing
instead on Taiwan's bright economic outlook.
</P>
<P>
   China and Taiwan have been governed separately since they split
amid civil war in 1949, although Beijing views Taiwan as territory
that must eventually reunify with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, turnover was a hefty $7.9 billion, up from
$7.1 billion Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most active shares was chipmaker Macronix
International Corp., which gained 16 cents to $2.66 (82.5 Taiwan
dollars). United Microelectronics Corp. rose 22 cents to $3.53
(109.5 Taiwan dollars), while Winbond Electronics Corp. rose 18
cents to $2.83 (88 Taiwan dollars).

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Who Defended McCarthy Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Warren E. Magee, a lawyer whose best-known
clients were Nazi war criminals and Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy, is
dead at age 91.
</P>
<P>
   Magee, beginning in 1948, took part in the Nuremberg war crimes
trials by defending Baron Ernst von Weizsaecker, the former German
secretary of state and wartime ambassador to the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   The German diplomat received a five-year prison term, later
commuted, and Magee's vigorous defense was rewarded with a Papal
Gold Medal from Pope Pius XII.
</P>
<P>
   Magee defended McCarthy, R-Wis., in a $2 million
libel-slander-conspiracy suit against Sen. William Benton, D-Conn.
Benton had called the Wisconsin senator a corrupt liar deserving of
expulsion from the Senate. McCarthy gained notoriety for leading
investigations of alleged communist infiltration in the U.S.
government in the early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Magee, a resident of Bethesda, Md., died Feb. 25 at his winter
home in Tampa, Fla.

<P>
   VANCOUVER, Wash. (AP) -- Tonya Harding didn't make an appearance
in Camas-Washougal Municipal Court on Wednesday as another pretrial
hearing was scheduled for April 12.
</P>
<P>
   ''We agreed to talk and investigate,'' said her Vancouver
lawyer, Steve Thayer, who declined to comment further on a

</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old ice skater faces a misdemeanor charge of

   She is accused of hitting her then-boyfriend, Darren Silver, 28,
with a hubcap and slapping and punching him during a fracas Feb. 22
in the house they shared in northwest Camas.
</P>
<P>
   Harding, who claimed she was defending herself, pleaded
innocent.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Harding pleaded guilty to covering up for her former

<HEADLINE> All-Star Guard Kidd Hurts Ankle  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- All-Star guard Jason Kidd broke his left ankle in
the Phoenix Suns' 114-93 win over Sacramento on Wednesday night and
will miss the rest of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd, who leads the NBA in assists and averages 14.5 points per
game, sustained the injury with .2 seconds left in the first half
while racing the clock to take a shot.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Fie, the Suns director of media relations, said Kidd
fractured a bone (medial malleolus) high in the left ankle and will
have surgery on Thursday. She said Kidd is ''questionable for the
playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Kings had taken a 52-50 lead, Kidd took an inbound
pass and drove down the right sideline before Kings guard Jason
Williams forced him to a stop.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd fumbled the ball out of bounds, then spun and reached for
the ball. When the clock stopped, Kidd remained doubled over
holding his lower calves.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd, who had no points but seven assists and five rebounds,
tried to walk off the court but took one tentative step before he
was carried off the court and into the locker room by teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Kidd is a serious blow to the Suns, who also lost
forward Tom Gugliotta for the season when he ruptured ligaments in
his left knee on March 10.

<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- A broken ankle to Jason Kidd tempered the Phoenix
Suns' 114-93 victory over the Sacramento Kings on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The All-Star guard will miss the rest of the regular season
after breaking his left ankle with .2 seconds left in the first
half while racing the clock to take a shot.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Fie, the Suns director of media relations, said Kidd

</P>
<P>
   The loss of Kidd is a serious blow to the Suns, who also lost
forward Tom Gugliotta for the season when he ruptured ligaments in
his left knee on March 10.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Robinson scored a game-high 26 points for the Suns, who
remained 1{ games ahead of the San Antonio Spurs for fourth place
in the Western Conference. The Spurs beat the Los Angeles Clippers
103-78 earlier Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve Rodney Rogers had 18 points and Randy Livingston,
subbing for Kidd, added 17 for Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Webber, who battled foul trouble much of the game, scored
16 points to lead Sacramento. Vlade Divac and Jason Williams each
had 14 for the Kings, who saw their three-game winning streak
snapped.
</P>
<P>
   After the Kings had taken a 52-50 lead, Kidd took an inbounds
pass and drove down the right sideline before Williams forced him
to stop. Kidd fumbled the ball out of bounds, then spun and reached
for the ball. When the clock stopped, Kidd remained doubled over,

<P>
   Kidd, who had no points but seven assists and five rebounds,
tried to walk off the court, but took one tentative step before he

</P>
<P>
   The Suns, who won for the 16th time in 19 games, rallied after
Kidd departed.
</P>
<P>
   Shawn Marion hit a 14-foot jumper and Robinson added a 3-pointer
in the first 50 seconds of the third quarter as Phoenix took the
lead for good, 55-52.
</P>
<P>
   Webber tied the game at 58 with a long jump shot with 9:54
remaining. But Marion scored six straight points and Penny Hardaway
added a 3-pointer to spark a 15-0 run and give the Suns a 73-58
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns hit 16 of 24 shots to outscore the Kings 38-22 en route
to an 88-74 lead after three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson took advantage of two quick fouls on Webber to help the
Suns take the lead in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   While guarded by Webber, Robinson missed his two field-goal
attempts and committed a turnover. After Webber left with his
second foul with 9:17 left in the quarter, Robinson scored 13
points on 5-of-6 shooting to lead Phoenix to a 34-25 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Everything reversed in the second quarter as Phoenix, which shot
70 percent in the first period (14-of-20), missed nine of its first
12 field-goal attempts. The Suns went 5:42 without a field goal and
committed 11 of their 18 first-half turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings hit seven of their first 12 shots, including Darrick
Martin's 3-pointer with 4:34 left in the half that gave Sacramento
a 44-41 lead.	   
Notes: The Suns are 28-5 when they score more than 100 points. ...
The Kings, who lead the NBA in scoring, were held below the
100-point mark for the fourth time in five games ... Phoenix's
16-point second-quarter matched a season low and the Suns' 38
points in the third quarter set a season high. ... Robinson has led
the Suns in scoring in four straight games and five of six. ...
Webber was 6-of-6 from the floor and 4-of-4 from the free-throw
line. Webber also was whistled for a technical after he'd left the
game in the fourth quarter.

''inappropriate and disruptive behavior'' after a Western Athletic
Conference tournament game earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   SMU athletic director Jim Copeland and coach Mike Dement
suspended the players indefinitely for violating team rules, the

<P>
   University officials weren't immediately available for comment.

in not naming the two players who were suspended.
</P>
<P>
   The university said it took the action after receiving
information from the Fresno, Calif., police department.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, a woman told police that two members of
the basketball team ''touched her through her clothes with their

<HEADLINE> Tool Promising for Heart Patients  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doctors could do a far better job predicting who is at high risk
of a heart attack or other cardiovascular problems by testing for a
certain protein in a simple, inexpensive blood test, researchers
reported today.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say doctors may adopt the test and use it along with
cholesterol screening to identify people who run a high risk of a
heart attack, stroke, bypass surgery or death from heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and
elsewhere used a highly sensitive version of the decades-old blood
test for a substance called C-reactive protein. The protein
indicates arteries are inflamed.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists believe that while high cholesterol causes fatty
buildups in the blood vessels, heart attacks are triggered when
inflammation causes the deposits to break off and clog an artery.
</P>
<P>
   The research was reported in today's New England Journal of
Medicine, along with a second study suggesting that MRI scans could
help doctors detect heart disease in women at a very early stage.
Often, women complain of chest pain, but conventional tests see no
sign of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In the first study, Harvard Medical School cardiologist Dr. Paul
Ridker and colleagues tested blood, taken from apparently healthy
postmenopausal women participating in the hospital's Women's Health
Study, for levels of C-reactive protein, or CRP, and 11 other
substances.
</P>
<P>
   After three years, researchers identified 122 women who had
heart attacks or other cardiovascular troubles and compared them
with 244 participants who were fine.
</P>
<P>
   The one-fourth with the highest CRP levels were 4.4 times more
likely to have had a heart attack or other cardiovascular trouble
than the one-fourth with the lowest CRP levels.
</P>
<P>
   The substance was the best predictor of heart attack risk --
almost twice as good as LDL, the ''bad cholesterol'' that is the
current gold standard in cardiac diagnosis. Cholesterol and CRP
screenings both cost around $20 on average.
</P>
<P>
   ''Half of all heart attacks in the U.S. occur in people with
normal cholesterol levels,'' so combining cholesterol screening
with testing for CRP is a big improvement, Ridker said.
</P>
<P>
   His research found women with the highest levels of both
substances were six times more likely to suffer a heart attack or
other problem than those with the lowest levels.
</P>
<P>
   The study involved only women, who have generally been excluded
from cardiac research even though heart disease kills one of every
two women. Doctors said there is no reason to believe the findings
wouldn't apply to men as well.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Daniel Shindler of the University of Medicine and Dentistry
of New Jersey in New Brunswick said CRP levels could help
cardiologists diagnose patients more accurately and lead to better
drug therapies.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I find C-reactive protein elevated, I will be more
aggressive'' in encouraging women to stop smoking, exercise more,
eat a healthier diet and control their diabetes, Shindler said.
</P>
<P>
   Former American Heart Association president Dr. Sidney Smith
said other research shows that giving drugs called statins to
reduce CRP levels helps prevent heart attacks in patients who have
already had one.
</P>
<P>
   A separate study by researchers at the University of Alabama at
Birmingham may have solved part of the mystery of why half of the
women hospitalized for chest pain appear to have healthy, unclogged
arteries when they undergo an angiogram, a standard cardiac X-ray.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers used a $900 MRI heart scan on 35 such women and
found that 20 percent of them had an abnormality in the relative
levels of two heart substances that give the heart muscle energy.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gerald Pohost theorized the scans are detecting ischemia, or
inadequate blood flow to the heart, that was occurring not because
of clogs in the major arteries but because many arteries too small
for an angiogram to spot were narrowed and did not expand normally.
</P>
<P>
   He said the technique eventually could help doctors detect heart
disease in women long before major arteries are significantly
clogged.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to need some further validation'' before routine
use, said Robert Balaban, scientific director of laboratory
research programs at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.

<HEADLINE> Study Disproves Myths About Herpes  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   People infected with genital herpes can spread it even between
flare-ups when they have no symptoms, researchers suggest in a
study published today in the New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, patients and most doctors thought people with
herpes could safely have unprotected sex when they had no symptoms,
which can include painful, oozing blisters, ulcers and fissures and
tingling and burning. Most doctors advised patients to abstain from
sex during flare-ups, but some said sex with a condom was OK.
</P>
<P>
   In their study of the incurable, widespread virus, University of
Washington researchers found herpes present in genital secretions
even when patients didn't notice any symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   ''The message from this study is first to encourage people who
might be at risk for genital herpes to be tested and, No. 2, they
should abstain during outbreaks and use condoms at all other
times,'' said Dr. Anna Wald, an assistant professor in the
department of medicine and epidemiology.
</P>
<P>
   Genital herpes, usually caused by the herpes simplex virus type
2, lurks in about one-fourth of U.S. adults, although only an
estimated 20 percent of them know it.
</P>
<P>
   Herpes is spread through sexual contact when it enters the body
through tiny passages in the skin. The virus lies dormant in nerves
at the base of the spinal cord until something triggers an
outbreak. Flare-ups generally last for a few days.
</P>
<P>
   There is no cure, but drugs can reduce the severity and
frequency of flare-ups.
</P>
<P>
   While herpes isn't fatal, the sores can make it easier to become
infected with the AIDS virus. Without precautions, herpes can be
transmitted during childbirth, infecting the baby and sometimes
causing brain damage or death.
</P>
<P>
   Wald's team studied 53 men and women who were unaware they had
the virus until it was spotted in a blood test on a routine visit
to a medical clinic in Seattle. Those patients were then asked to
participate in the study, along with another 90 clinic patients
with a history of symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Each swabbed specimens from around the anus and genitals daily
for three months and kept a diary of symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups had the virus present in secretions at the same rate
on symptom-free days: about 3 percent, or one day a month on
average.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also found that men were potentially infectious
at the same rate as women when no symptoms were noticeable,
disproving the myth men can't spread the virus while symptom-free.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Judith Wasserheit, head of sexually transmitted disease
prevention at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said
the study confirms other research but brings some good news: ''It
is possible to learn how to recognize many of your symptoms and to
use that knowledge to help protect your partner.''

<HEADLINE> Free gun locks offered by a gun industry group  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EASTON, Conn. (AP) -- Marilyn Davies has two good reasons for
getting gun locks: under the same roof where she keeps 10 guns, she
also babysits her two grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Even though she's told them over and over again, ''don't play
with the guns,'' she can't be sure they'll listen to her. So Davies
and her husband Bob, once competitive target shooters, were among
the first Easton residents to pick up free gun locks offered by a
gun industry group.
</P>
<P>
   ''You try to reinforce, reinforce, reinforce, but there might be
that one time they might pick it up,'' said Davies, who watches her
grandchildren in her home two or three days a week.
</P>
<P>
   During the last six months, the National Shooting Sports
Foundation has given away 50,000 locks in 28 cities, towns and
counties across the country. Another 111 communities will begin
distributing locks this summer.
</P>
<P>
   In Augusta, Ga., sheriffs have been unable to keep up with
demand. Five thousands locks have been given out since November.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ran out last weekend,'' said Mark Gibbons, an assistant to
Augusta Mayor Bob Young.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have parents with kids, we have hunters, we had a U.S.
Congressman come in and get some locks from us. It's pretty much
across the board -- businesspeople, truck drivers, you name it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Orlando, Fla., 3,000 locks have been distributed to
residents, plus another 633 to each of the city's police officers.
</P>
<P>
   And in Minneapolis, police gave out 1,000 locks on the first day
of their giveaway last week after an earlier survey revealed that
14,000 of the 34,000 residents with guns in their homes admitted
they were not locked up.
</P>
<P>
   In the raging debate over gun violence, gun locks have become
hot commodities.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, New York Gov. George Pataki called for mandatory
trigger locks for all guns.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Smith &AMP; Wesson -- the nation's largest gun
manufacturer -- agreed to provide external safety locks on all its
handguns within 60 days and internal locks within two years.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Jorgensen, a spokesman for Smith &AMP; Wesson, said the company
has shipped trigger or cable locks with all of its handguns since
September 1997. He said the company will continue to provide those
locks until it can develop internal locks.
</P>
<P>
   SigArms Corp., in Exeter, N.H., began supplying trigger locks
with its guns about two years ago. Fairfield-based Sturm, Ruger has
shipped its pistols and revolvers in lock boxes with padlocks for
more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The National Shooting Sports Foundation is distributing cable
locks, which resemble bicycle locks. The cables are pulled through
gun handles or barrels to prevent the weapon from being loaded or
fired. They differ from trigger locks, which keep the trigger from
being pulled, but allow the gun to remain loaded while the lock is
in place.
</P>
<P>
   In Easton, a woodsy town of about 6,500, including many hunters,
about a dozen people showed up to pick up cable locks Tuesday
evening as police began the program.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Kusovitski, a dentist, has four guns in his house --
three pistols and a .22-caliber rifle. He already has locks on two
of his guns. Even though he stores the other two in a locked safe,
Kusovitski picked up two cable locks as an extra deterrence for his
three children.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think many people don't take the responsibility seriously,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Aiken County, S.C., sheriffs have given out 500 locks since
November.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you have tragic cases like the little boy who shot the
little girl in Michigan ... we are being proactive in this
community to hopefully prevent a similar incident,'' said Lt.
Michael Frank.
</P>
<P>
   While the communities who receive the free locks praise the
program, some gun control groups question the motive and timing of
the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a Newtown-based trade
group representing about 1,800 gun, munitions and accessory
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I definitely think it is a public relations move largely due
to the fact that they haven't done anything to make guns safer in
so many years,'' said Nancy Hwa, a spokeswoman for Handgun Control
Inc., the nation's largest gun control lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
   Hwa said she believes the program was started to deflect
criticism after a barrage of lawsuits were filed against the gun
industry last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that they undertook this campaign basically shows
that the lawsuits have merit,'' Hwa said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the sports foundation, however, insist that they
began working on the project about a year before the first lawsuits
were filed.

   To pay for the locks, the foundation set up a voluntary 1

<HEADLINE> High Court upholds state's law  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNE YOUMANS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The state Supreme Court has rejected the
appeal of a man who claimed his conviction for possessing child
pornography should be overturned because the law does not define
the term minor.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond C. Ehlers Jr., convicted in Middlesex Superior Court in
1998, had argued the law was unconstitutionally vague. He also
claimed his crime did not fall under the statute, which requires
the illicit action take place before an audience.
</P>
<P>
   The high court ruled Wednesday the law's intentions are clear
and the photographs Ehlers had are proof of an audience of at least
one, the photographer.
</P>
<P>
   The case stems from the February 1996 arrest of Ehlers, who
prosecutors said was found with photographs of children in the
nude. Some allegedly depicted children performing sex acts with
each other and with adults.
</P>
<P>
   Ehlers sought to have the case dismissed, arguing the state's
child pornography statute does not specify whether a minor is a
child under 18, 17 or 16. He said that because the law concerns his
First Amendment rights, he can challenge its constitutionality on
the basis that it is vague.
</P>
<P>
   Ehlers also argued the law stipulates an audience must be
present or the action must be a live performance in order to be
considered pornography. He said the photos he had showed no
spectators to the acts.
</P>
<P>
   The Middlesex Superior Court judge denied the request and Ehlers
pleaded no contest on the condition that he have the right to
appeal. He received a three-year suspended sentence and was ordered
to serve three years probation.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court, in a unanimous ruling, upheld the lower
court's decision. Justice William J. Sullivan, writing the opinion,
conceded the law does not specifically define the term ''minor.''
But he said related statutes clearly define a minor as a child
under 16 and Ehlers, having admitted possessing photographs of
younger children, has no basis to challenge the law for vagueness.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan also said that because child pornography is not
protected under First Amendment rights to free speech, Ehlers
cannot challenge the constitutionality of the law.
</P>
<P>
   ''The defendant had fair warning that his conduct was
prohibited,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ehlers' contention that an audience must be present, the
high court found that the statute specifies an ''audience'' to
discourage the market for child pornography. Ehlers' interpretation
of an audience as two or more people watching or depicted in a
reproduction of an illicit act would negate the statute's impact,
the court ruled.
</P>
<P>
   ''Marketers and consumers of child pornography could avoid
prosecution merely by ensuring that their pornographic materials do
not depict any audience members,'' Sullivan wrote.
</P>
<P>
   An audience, the court found, could consist of a photographer,
anyone who witnessed the acts or anyone who viewed a reproduction
of the acts.
</P>
<P>
   Jake Donovan, an attorney for Ehlers, faulted the high court for
relying on related statutes in defining the term ''minor.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's significant that neither the state of
Connecticut, a learned judge of the Superior Court nor I could
agree on the definition of age as contained in the statute,'' he
said. ''That speaks to the fact the common man would be lost within
the words of the statute.''
</P>
<P>
   Donovan also said the Legislature should remove reference to
''audience'' in the law to avoid confusion.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you include a term in a statute, it should have meaning,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who answered the phone at the Ehlers' home in Haddam
said he was not available for comment.

<HEADLINE> Third person charged in shooting of 8-year-old  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- A third man has been charged with
capital felony and murder in the killing an 8-year-old boy and his
mother.
</P>
<P>
   Gary ''Mello G'' Garner was expected to be a key prosecution
witness in their cases against Russell and Adrian Peeler. Police
say Garner admitted driving the getaway car for Adrian Peeler after
the Jan.7, 1999 shootings of Leroy ''B.J.'' Brown and Karen Clarke.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors claim the pair were shot to prevent the boy from
testifying against Russell Peeler in the 1998 murder of Clarke's
boyfriend, Rudolph Snead Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Russell Peeler is currently serving a 105-year sentence for that
slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Garner, who had previously been charged with only conspiracy to
commit murder, was arrested on the new charges during a pretrial
conference. He faces a possible death sentence if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut Post, citing sources close to the investigation,
reported Wednesday that the new charges are an attempt by the state
to put pressure on Garner, who recently reneged on an agreement to
testify against the Peelers.
</P>
<P>
   Garner, 30, of Bridgeport, allegedly drove Adrian Peeler to
Clarke's North End home and waited outside during the slayings. He
then drove Peeler to a Milford motel, police said.
</P>
<P>
   But Russell Peeler's girlfriend, Angelina Keene, told police
that on a prior occasion her boyfriend had asked Garner to kill the
victims.
</P>
<P>
   Garner is awaiting sentencing in federal court on charges of
selling crack cocaine. He faces a potential life sentence on that
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, lawyers for the Peelers asked the state Supreme Court
to hear their appeal of a judge's ruling keeping a letter from a
state witness out of their hands.
</P>
<P>
   In a motion filed in state Supreme Court, the attorneys asked
for an expedited appeal of a decision by trial Judge G. Sarsfield
Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Ford refused to turn over to the defense a letter written by the
state's eyewitness, Josephine Lee, to her lawyer. The letter
inadvertently fell into the hands of a prosecutor. Ford said that
while the contents of the letter may help the defense, it is
inadmissible under lawyer-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers maintain a delay in hearing the appeal would render
the murder trial constitutionally flawed.
</P>
<P>
   If the Supreme Court agrees to hear the appeal, it would delay
the start of Russell Peeler's trial, set to begin next month.
Adrian Peeler is not expected to be tried before summer.

<HEADLINE> Disagreement leads to three budget proposals  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- The refusal by state Senate Democrats to
reopen Connecticut's two-year budget is drawing fire from both
Republicans and House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   A division of House and Senate members of the Appropriations
Committee on Wednesday means there are now three budget adjustment
plans: one from the House, one from the Senate and one backed by
Republican Gov. John G. Rowland and GOP lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican proposal calls for tax cuts and program spending
adjustments, but Senate Democrats have refused to consider making
major spending changes.
</P>
<P>
   Democratics have been bickering since early February when Senate
leaders said they would agree to only technical revision in the
biennial budget approved last year by the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their intention is to preclude discussion, preclude
deliberations and preclude this body from doing what it does every
year, and that is pass a budget for the people of Connecticut,''
said Sen. William Aniskovich, R-Branford.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Patricia Dillon, D-New Haven, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This process will be tainted, and the public ... will watch
it. I beg my friends in the Senate, do not first exclude the people
and then deny your own colleagues the right to participate.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Crisco, co-chairman of the Appropriations Committee,
said splitting the committee would speed up the budget
negotiations. The legislative session ends in seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We worked very diligently trying to come up with an
agreement,'' said Crisco, D-Woodbridge. ''That agreement cannot be
reached ... and I feel that we have no other options than to
proceed the way we are proceeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Pro Tempore Kevin Sullivan and House Speaker
Moira Lyons downplayed the skirmish in Appropriations, and said
they will begin negotiating with other legislative leaders on April
4.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still have three basic approaches to this budget -- all of
which are negotiable, all of which are compromisable and all of
which will lead to a conclusion that's bipartisan and successful,''
said Sullivan, D-West Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said the last time the Appropriations Committee split
to pass two budget bills was in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The three proposed changes for the 2001 budget are close, and
don't stray too far from the original $12.1 billion already
approved by the Legislature. Rowland's revisions push the budget to
$12.2 billion; the Senate plan increases it to $12.31 billion; and
the House bill inflates it to $12.35 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Genuario, R-Norwalk, criticized the proposal from
Senate Democrats for using too much of the state's $241 million
surplus for ongoing costs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their bill is not an adjustment bill, Genuario said. ''It uses
the gimmick of invading the surplus to fund operating budgets,
thereby setting up a significant deficit.''
</P>
<P>
   And Marc Ryan, Rowland's budget director, said both the House
and Senate leadership plans will put the state over the mandated
spending cap. He said Rowland's adjustments will keep the budget
well below the cap.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan insisted that the plans backed by his caucus and House
Democrats would not break the spending cap.

<HEADLINE> Study: Holiday Weight Gain Adds Up  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans pack on fewer pounds over the winter holidays than
commonly believed, but it all adds up over the years, according to
a study in today's New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Popular wisdom holds that most people gain five to 10 pounds
from Thanksgiving to New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   However, researchers at the National Institutes of Health found
the 195 volunteers they studied -- all of whom worked at or lived
near its Bethesda, Md., campus -- gained an average of only 1.05
pounds from September 1998 through March 1999. Most of that gain,
or 0.8 pounds, happened between Thanksgiving and New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 10 percent of the subjects gained five pounds or more
over the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Factors such as the number of holiday parties attended had
little effect. Lack of activity during the winter played a bigger
role.
</P>
<P>
   By the following September, the 165 volunteers who continued in
the study were an average of 1.4 pounds heavier than a year
earlier, indicating that rather than taking off their holiday
weight during the warmer months, they added a bit more.
</P>
<P>
   Obesity can contribute to heart disease, diabetes and other
serious health problems. According to the government, 55 percent of
Americans are considered overweight and 22 percent are obese.

<HEADLINE> Electric Chair on Way Out in Ga.  </HEADLINE>
By RUSS BYNUM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Georgia lawmakers have voted to phase out the
electric chair and make lethal injection the state's primary means
of execution, two months after a similar move in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   If Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes approves, Alabama and Nebraska would
be the only states still using the electric chair as their sole
means of execution.
</P>
<P>
   ''This makes it a humane sort of thing that will give dignity,
even to the families,'' said Democratic Rep. E.C. Tillman, the
bill's sponsor, who believes electrocution is cruel and unusual
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia passed its current death penalty law in 1973. A decade
passed before the first execution, but since then, there have been
23, all by electric chair.
</P>
<P>
   The switch to lethal injection -- approved by wide margins in
both houses of the Legislature -- was proposed because lawmakers
feared the U.S. Supreme Court might strike down electrocution in
response to lawsuits from inmates. The high court recently rejected
one such appeal and canceled its review of the other, but a similar
challenge is pending before the Georgia Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation sent to Barnes on Wednesday, death row
inmates convicted of crimes committed May 1 and thereafter would
die by injection. The 127 inmates already on death row would still
die in the electric chair.
</P>
<P>
   The phase-out is to prevent reopening their cases, since some
death sentences specify the executions be carried out by
electrocution.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, a death penalty supporter, planned to review the bill
before deciding whether to sign it into law, a spokeswoman said.

<HEADLINE> Fox Entertainment Head Herzog Quits  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Fourteen months after he left Comedy Central to
take over programming for the struggling Fox network, Doug Herzog
is calling it quits.
</P>
<P>
   Herzog has been trying to leave since one of his predecessors,
Sandy Grushow, was installed last November to supervise the network
and Fox's television studio.
</P>
<P>
   His year in the hot seat was a nightmare of falling ratings,
failing shows and fallout from the ''Who Wants to Marry a
Multimillionaire'' fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would imagine that the worst is behind us,'' Herzog said
Wednesday. ''I'm sorry I had to live through it. That's timing. At
the same time I'm walking out of here with two comedy successes to
look back on.''
</P>
<P>
   His slate of new programs for last fall, including the
critically praised comedy ''Action'' and the drama ''Harsh Realm,''
all failed in the ratings. Fox's average prime-time viewership has
slumped from 11.2 million last year to 9.3 million this season.
</P>
<P>
   The promising performance of midseason replacement comedies
''Malcolm in the Middle'' and ''Titus'' has given Fox hope
recently. Yet two stalwarts of its schedule, ''Beverly Hills,
90210'' and ''Party of Five,'' are in their last season and Fox
still isn't sure that ''The X-Files'' is coming back for another
year.
</P>
<P>
   Herzog, 40, was Fox's fifth entertainment president in eight
years.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Grushow was widely seen as a no-confidence
vote and set up an awkward shotgun marriage in the executive suite.
</P>
<P>
   ''The landscape changed and it ended up being a different
situation than the one I had signed up for,'' Herzog said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox has also taken heat for its reality specials with car chases
and attacking animals. Grushow said the network is leaving that
genre behind.
</P>
<P>
   Herzog said his departure has nothing to do with last month's
ill-fated TV marriage of Rick Rockwell and Darva Conger. The
special attracted a storm of criticism when it came out that a
former fiancee had served Rockwell with a restraining order and
Conger quickly moved for an annulment.
</P>
<P>
   The network's investigation into the special is expected to be
complete by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Grushow will assume Herzog's duties through this spring, when
Fox must present a new schedule to advertisers, and search for a
successor this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Doug has made important and lasting contributions to the
success of the network, particularly in the area of live action
comedies,'' Grushow said. ''We wish him the same success in his
future endeavors that has always characterized his career.''

<HEADLINE> Jury Rules for Cops in Rights Case  </HEADLINE>
By DUNCAN MANSFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A federal jury has exonerated four white
officers accused in a civil rights lawsuit of using excessive force
in the 1998 death of a black man under arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Stenson, 34, was stopped by police for driving without
headlights. Apparently fearing a parole violation because he had no
driver's license, he ran.
</P>
<P>
   After he was caught, wrestled to the ground and handcuffed, he
complained he couldn't breathe and died on the way to the hospital.
His widow, Marcellina Stenson, sued for $6.75 million.
</P>
<P>
   She and her lawyer refused comment Wednesday following the
jury's 8-3 verdict in favor of the officers. One juror was excused
because of work obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Officers Craig Sramek, Scott Coffey, James L. Miller Jr. and
L.B. Steele III had already been cleared of wrongdoing by the
Tennessee Bureau of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The TBI found nothing that these officers did was wrong. The
FBI found nothing these officers have done wrong. Now we have a
jury that says these officers have done nothing wrong,'' Knoxville
Police Chief Phil Keith said. ''It is time to get the community
back together.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical Examiner Sandra Elkins said Stenson died of a congenital
heart defect, not from anything the officers did.
</P>
<P>
   However, Steven Dunton, chief medical examiner for Gwinnett
County, Ga., testified for the plaintiffs that Stenson suffocated
from being held down on his belly with his hands cuffed behind him.

<HEADLINE> Police: Man Opens Fire in Church  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Texas (AP) -- A man apparently spurned by a love
interest opened fire in a church Wednesday night, wounding the
woman and three other people before he shot and killed himself,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The attack at the Iglesia Cristiana Espoa Del Cordero in
suburban Houston happened during a meeting that followed services
at the Pentecostal church. About 25 people were inside.
</P>
<P>
   Police spokesman J.M. Baird said the man found the 18-year-old
woman and professed his love for her.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we know is that the suspect was apparently in love with
the 18-year-old and found she liked him like a brother,'' Baird
said.
</P>
<P>
   The two argued, the man left and then returned with a gun,
police said. He opened fire, wounding the woman, her mother, the
pastor and an another man, before walking outside to kill himself.
</P>
<P>
   His name was not immediately released.
</P>
<P>
   Church member Jose Montana, 34, said he saw the man in early
Wednesday at a nearby Wal-Mart. He said he was making small talk
with the man -- whom he knew only as ''Oscar'' -- when ''he said he
was going to kill someone.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought he was kidding,'' Montana said. ''I told myself that
if I saw him at the church tonight I would call police.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49-year-old pastor and the young woman's 38-year-old mother
were hospitalized in critical condition at Memorial Hermann
Hospital. The young woman was in fair condition at another Houston
hospital with a bullet wound in her neck.
</P>
<P>
   The 32-year-old man was grazed by a bullet and did not have to
be taken to a hospital, Baird said.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, a man spewing anti-Baptist rhetoric walked into
a Fort Worth church and fatally shot seven people before he killed
himself in a pew. Seven others were injured at the Wedgwood Baptist
Church by Larry G. Ashbrook.

<HEADLINE> Senate Nixes Social Security Limits  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- By a 100-0 vote, the Senate joined the House
in agreeing Wednesday to let Social Security recipients collect
their full benefits no matter what they earn. President Clinton has
promised to sign the bill.
</P>
<P>
   That was welcome news for Lewis Bowers, 65, of Columbia, Md.,
and about 800,000 other people who remain on the job through their
late 60s.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers said he got a nasty surprise when his tax preparer told
him he had to reimburse the government a big portion of last year's
Social Security benefits because he had continued to work
construction and earned more than $17,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a rude awakening,'' said Bowers, who was visiting the
Capitol on Wednesday. ''A lot of people my age are going to be
happy tonight,'' he said after the Senate vote.
</P>
<P>
   The House passed an almost identical version by a 422-0 vote
three weeks ago. It will have to vote on it again, most likely next
week, congressional aides say, because the Senate made a technical
change to assure that workers age 64 are not penalized.
</P>
<P>
   ''I look forward to opening a new era of opportunity for older
Americans by signing this measure into law,'' President Clinton
said in a statement from India, where he was visiting the Taj
Mahal.
</P>
<P>
   The change would be made retroactive to Dec. 31, 1999,
effectively boosting the income of 800,000 workers 65 through 69 by
thousands of dollars before election day next November.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, those workers now must return $1 of Social
Security benefits for every $3 they earn above $17,000. Until
Congress raised the ceiling before the 1996 election, new
beneficiaries could earn only $11,250 a year before losing some of
their benefits.
</P>
<P>
   For folks like Clarence Plante, 68, a Wal-Mart employee from
Manassas Va., those extra dollars that will stay in his household
are sorely needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a penalty that really hurt,'' Plante said. ''Today,
it's not a luxury to work after 65.'' Many seniors are raising
their grandchildren, and after bills are paid, ''nothing is left
over,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers in both parties called the earnings limit a Depression
era relic intended to push seniors out of the workplace to make
room for younger workers.
</P>
<P>
   With a current unemployment rate of only 4.1 percent, penalizing
able-bodied seniors for continuing to work is the last thing the
government should be doing, said Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need the workers,'' Abraham said. ''It would be ridiculous
at a time when we have these (employment) needs to drive people
from the work force.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., who is not seeking re-election, sounded
the only discord in two days of debate. While supporting the bill,
Kerrey said he was troubled that more extensive Social Security
reform wasn't being pursued.
</P>
<P>
   Experts warn that without an increase in the current 12.4
percent Social Security tax or a decrease in benefits, the fund
will start paying out more money than it receives in 2017, shortly
after the post-World War II baby boomers begin retiring en masse.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those distant storm clouds, lawmakers spared no effort
congratulating themselves for passing the bill aimed at a critical
voting bloc.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., who faces a tough re-election
challenge in November, acknowledged as much, saying anytime
Congress passes a popular measure with constituents, it can
''enhance the capacity to campaign.''

<HEADLINE> Oilers 2, Mighty Ducks 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- Kevin Lowe got his message across to
the Edmonton Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   Three nights after the Edmonton coach criticized his team's
effort in a loss to Calgary, the Flames rebounded to beat Anaheim
2-1 on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the vigor and the grit weren't there against Calgary --
and Kevin didn't either,'' said captain Doug Weight, who had a goal
and an assist to against Anaheim to help the Oilers move into a
first-place tie with Colorado in the Northwest Division.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think as a team we really took that to heart. Calgary was a
downer because we knew how Kevin felt. We were down on ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   ''The loss to Calgary really hurt and I think this team wanted
to show the coaching staff that we're here to play and to make it
into the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Weight scored his 17th goal of the season with three minutes
left in the second period, slamming a rebound into an open side on
a power-play.
</P>
<P>
   ''He came out of the gate skating well, making plays and wanting
the puck,'' Lowe said about Weight. ''He really got everything
going. He wants to be the go-to guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mighty Ducks, who entered the game with a three-game winning
streak, are ninth in the Western Conference. The top eight teams
qualify for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in the race and we've got some big games coming up,''
said Anaheim coach Craig Hartsburg, whose club didn't arrive at its
Edmonton hotel until 4:30 a.m. after winning in Los Angeles on
Tuesday night. ''Our team wasn't quite as sharp as we were last
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Poti opened the scoring for Oilers on a power play midway
through the first period. His shot bounced off Anaheim defenseman
Kevin Haller and between goalie Guy Hebert's legs.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Ward tied it less than five minutes later, banging a rebound
between Tommy Salo's legs after Anaheim center Antti Aalto took a
quick shot after winning a faceoff deep.
</P>
<P>
   Salo stopped Mighty Ducks star Paul Kariya on a short-handed
breakaway early in the second with the game tied 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton forward Mike Grier had reconstructive surgery Wednesday
to repair a torn triceps muscle in his left arm.

<HEADLINE> NFL Instant Replay Voted On  </HEADLINE>
By DAVE GOLDBERG, AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The NFL's annual instant replay debate is ready
to start again.
</P>
<P>
   After the first season with replay since 1991, the league's
competition committee has voted 6-1 to recommend use of the same
system in 2000. It will be voted on by all 31 teams at the league
owners' meetings next week in Palm Beach, Fla., with 24 votes
needed for approval.
</P>
<P>
   Replay votes have been a staple of these meetings for the past
15 years.
</P>
<P>
   It was voted in for the 1986 season and voted out after 1991,
primarily because of delays it caused. It was reinstated for last
season after a series of controversial calls in 1998 with a
coaches' challenge system.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't always a critical success last year.
</P>
<P>
   Several teams always seemed to lose their challenges, notably
Tampa Bay, which also had a crucial catch overturned by replay in
the final minute of its 11-6 loss to St. Louis in the NFC
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   That makes it a question mark again this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's always a close call,'' Joe Browne, the NFL's chief
spokesman, said in a conference call Wednesday. ''Some clubs spoke
up against it during the season. The calm of the offseason may have
calmed them down some.''
</P>
<P>
   The only negative vote on the competition committee came from
Mike Brown, president of the Cincinnati Bengals, one of three teams
to vote against replay last season.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Ferguson, general manager of the Arizona Cardinals, voted
for replay, even though Arizona owner Bill Bidwill was another of
last season's three ''no'' votes. So did the committee's co-chair,
Rich McKay of the Bucs, who had expressed some reservations during
the season.
</P>
<P>
   One change that needs no vote stems from that controversial call
in the NFC title game.
</P>
<P>
   Under a new interpretation to be used next season, a ball that
hits the ground can be ruled a good catch if the receiver has full
possession. Replay showed Tampa Bay's Bert Emmanuel indeed had
possession, but under last season's rule, the simple touch to the
ground was enough to negate the catch on replay.
</P>
<P>
   On other matters:
</P>
<P>
   -- The owners will not move games from Sunday to Monday night the
last month of the season to make more attractive prime-time
matchups. But Browne said it may be considered for the 2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   -- The owners are expected to approve the sale of 49 percent of
the Baltimore Ravens by Art Modell to Baltimore businessman Steve
Bisciotti. That will probably be among the first things to take
place when the meetings officially open Monday.
</P>
<P>
   -- League officials will begin work on a schedule format for
2002, when Houston joins the league and the NFL will switch to
eight four-team divisions.
</P>
<P>
   -- Owners and coaches will discuss ways to stop the wave of
off-field violence that includes murder charges against two players
-- Rae Carruth, formerly of Carolina, and Ray Lewis of Baltimore.
The panel will include three head coaches -- Brian Billick of
Baltimore, Tony Dungy of Tampa Bay and Mike Holmgren of Seattle --
and three assistant coaches -- Marvin Lewis (Baltimore), Herman
Edwards (Tampa Bay) and Gil Haskell (Seattle.)

<HEADLINE> Population Surge Surprises County  </HEADLINE>
By SONJA BARISIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUSSEX, Va. (AP) -- Sussex County is bursting with peanut, cotton
and hog farms. There are no fancy office buildings, traffic-choked
highways or even suburbs to speak of.
</P>
<P>
   For culture seekers, there's a folk art museum and a peanut
museum. Gourmands make do with the Virginia Diner and its tempting
Southern-style buttermilk biscuits, salty Virginia ham and peanut
pie.
</P>
<P>
   This 496-square-mile rural patch of south-central Virginia is
the fastest-growing county in the nation?
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes. Sussex's population surged by 22.8 percent to 12,345
people between 1998 and last year, according to Census Bureau
estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 2,291 new residents, however, moved into
less-than-plush accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew we were going to have some changes as a result of two
state maximum-security prisons being built,'' County Administrator
Mary E. Jones laughed when asked about the population explosion.
</P>
<P>
   The Sussex I prison opened in May 1998 and has 1,160 inmates,
state Department of Corrections spokesman Larry Traylor said.
Sussex II opened in January 1999 and houses inmates convicted in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 800 people work at the prisons; Traylor did not know
how many live in Sussex County.
</P>
<P>
   County officials say the prisons eventually could help spur real
growth and economic development in Sussex and reverse a steady
decline in population since World War II. Young people too often
must leave to find jobs or further their education, said Jones, who
grew up in the county.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to more people, the county got a wastewater
treatment plant and public water system from the state for becoming
home to the prisons. Thinking those improvements will attract more
businesses, county officials are making plans to build a commerce
park, said Andre Greene, the county's director of planning.
</P>
<P>
   ''The prisons allowed the county to do things it would not have
been able to do, or would have taken longer to do,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Sussex, formed in 1754, has much to offer with Interstate 95,
other major U.S. highways and rail lines running through the
county, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   The county is 45 miles southeast of Richmond and 60 miles
northwest of the Hampton Roads region and its ports. It's a
four-hour drive from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   County residents already enjoying that rural lifestyle said they
were surprised to hear that the prisons boosted the population so
much.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh really? Well,'' said Shirley S. Yancey, who lives on six
acres in the county. She said she never gave much thought to the
prisons when there was talk about them being built.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's one of those things you know is going to happen, so why
get all shook up?'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Mentally ill man convicted of subway shove murder  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A schizophrenic man who pushed a woman to her
death under the wheels of a subway train has been convicted of
murder in a case that led to tougher laws regarding the mentally
ill.
</P>
<P>
   A jury in Manhattan's state Supreme Court took just three hours
to convict Andrew Goldstein, 30, of second-degree murder Wednesday
in the shove slaying of Kendra Ann Webdale, 32, on Jan. 3, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, whose first trial on the same charge ended in a hung
jury, faces a maximum sentence of 25 years to life in prison when
Justice Carol Berkman sentences him on April 6.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Canfield, Goldstein's lawyer, shouted, ''I have no
comment!'' as he and an associate fled down a stairwell from the
11th-floor courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Several jurors said later that they were convinced that
Goldstein is mentally ill but that he acted violently for reasons
other than insanity. They also said they hope he is put some place
where he can get help.
</P>
<P>
   After the verdict was read, Goldstein showed no emotion, but
members of the Webdale family wept and hugged each other.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been such a nightmare that I wouldn't want to use the
word happy,'' said Patricia Webdale, the victim's mother, ''but I
feel like jumping for joy.'' She added, ''I hope we learn from
Kendra's death.''
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Webdale, Kendra's father, said, ''I'm happy that it's over
and I'm happy with the outcome. I'm sorry that we had to sit
through this twice.''
</P>
<P>
   The victim's sister, Kim Webdale, said, ''The jury's verdict
absolutely reinforced our opinion. The verdict shows that Andrew
Goldstein was violent for reasons other than his psychosis.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy that he'll be in a place where he won't be able to
kill or hurt anyone for a very long time,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The ordeal is not quite over for the Webdales. They have several
multimillion-dollar civil lawsuits pending against the city and
several mental facilities that had treated Goldstein.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, of Queens, was charged with second-degree murder
after he pushed Webdale to her death onto the tracks in front of an
oncoming N train at the 23rd Street-Broadway station. Webdale, who
aspired to a career in the recording industry was originally from
Fredonia, N.Y., a town near Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Because Goldstein attacked Webdale while refusing to take his
antipsychotic medicine, the case led to a law -- called ''Kendra's
Law'' -- last year that allows for violent mental patients to be
medicated by force.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm pleased the Webdale family has received the justice they
have sought for so long. Out of this tragedy came Kendra's Law,
which will help people with mental illness while protecting New
Yorkers,'' Gov. George Pataki said in a statement. ''The jury
verdict ends a sad chapter for the Webdale family but the reforms
they championed will help all New Yorkers long into the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense lawyers in both trials admitted that Goldstein pushed
Webdale but said he did it because he is mentally ill.
</P>
<P>
   In the second trial, Canfield cited defense psychiatrist Dr.
Spencer Eth, who testified that Goldstein had suffered an
''earthquake'' in his mind and was not aware of what he was doing
when he pushed Webdale onto the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   But Assistant District Attorney William Greenbaum argued that it
was revenge, not mental illness, that drove Goldstein. Rebuffed by
one blonde woman on the platform, he targeted Webdale to get even,
Greenbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenbaum quoted prosecution psychiatrist Dr. Angela Hegarty,
who said violence is not a feature of schizophrenia. She also said
that the planning and execution of the act suggests he was
completely aware of what he did.
</P>
<P>
   One juror, a nurse, said she was not quite sure at first that
intentional murder was the correct verdict but after thinking about
Goldstein's planning, timing and execution of the push, she was
convinced to convict.

<HEADLINE> Pope To Visit Holocaust Memorial  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN NOVECK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- It is a stop nearly every state visitor to
Israel makes, a virtual moral requirement of any itinerary. Yet
never will the symbolism be so great as when Pope John Paul II sets
foot on the soil of Yad Vashem.
</P>
<P>
   For Israelis, the pontiff's scheduled visit today to the famed
Holocaust memorial should be the emotional high point of his
weeklong trip. Many are hoping he'll do something a pope has never
done before: make a direct apology for the Catholic Church's public
silence during the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Some hope he'll go even further and criticize Pope Pius XII, the
wartime pontiff whom many Jews accuse of doing little while the
Nazis exterminated their brethren. But students of the Vatican say
that is highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican has said Pius' diplomatic silence during World War
II actually helped save thousands of Jewish lives. He is being
considered for beatification, to the dismay of many in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Meir Gorsky, a professor of dentistry who lives near Tel Aviv,
says he is sure the pope will say something about the church's role
during the Holocaust, and that ''it will be great.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorsky will be there to hear it firsthand. The pope, a dear
childhood friend of Gorsky's late father, Leon Goldberger, has made
a special request that Gorsky come and meet him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm really looking forward to meeting him,'' Gorsky said. ''He
is nice, gentle, friendly. And he didn't have to do this. He is
really sure that he loves Jewish people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorsky said his father and the pontiff, then simply Karol
Wojtyla, were soccer buddies in Wadowice, Poland, each playing
goalkeeper for opposing teams. Karol would often have Sabbath
dinner at his Jewish friend's home, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When his father visited the pope at the Vatican many years
later, Gorsky said, the pope looked at the broadly built man and
said, ''I can see why you were a good goalkeeper.'' The pontiff
also told Goldberger not to call him ''Your Holiness'' -- it was too
formal.
</P>
<P>
   Gorsky, 54, said his father also played the piano as a youngster
-- and the pope sang along.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Gorsky, about 20 other friends from Wadowice are
expected to reunite with the pontiff today, a day that is as
symbolically important for Israel as Wednesday was for the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   During his only day in Jewish west Jerusalem, the pontiff will
meet President Ezer Weizman and also Israel's chief rabbis. Some,
like Rabbi David Rosen of the Anti-Defamation League, see the
meeting with Weizman as the most important event because it would
be ''a recognition of the transformation of the Catholic Church's
attitude toward the Jewish people in the land of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   During the last papal visit in 1964, Pope Paul VI never ventured
into west Jerusalem and never publicly uttered Israel's name.
</P>
<P>
   The pope visits only one Christian site today: the room revered
as the site where the Last Supper took place.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the pope visited the cradle of Christianity,
celebrating Mass in Bethlehem's Manger Square.
</P>
<P>
   But as expected, the day was a potent mix of prayers and
politics. John Paul gave a forceful speech in the presence of
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, during which he recognized the
Palestinians' ''legitimate aspirations'' and their ''natural right
to a homeland.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians presented him with a golden bowl of soil, to
which the pontiff briefly touched to his lips.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's spokesman parried suggestions that he was endorsing a
Palestinian state, saying such a state has not yet been proclaimed
and that the Vatican would consider the issue when it happened.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, John Paul showed sympathy with Palestinian
refugees from the 1948 Mideast war, visiting the Dheisheh camp near
Bethlehem. The visit was a peaceful one, and especially satisfying
for Arafat, who beamed alongside the pope as he spoke. But an hour
after the pontiff left, violence broke out.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of Palestinians hurled stones at baton-wielding
Palestinian police -- a show of dissatisfaction with Palestinian
leadership and the slow pace of peace talks with the Israelis. In a
battle that lasted for about half an hour, police pushed the
protesters back, but then retreated under a hail of rocks. Some
minor injuries were reported.

<HEADLINE> Sharks 4, Canucks 3  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- The San Jose Sharks, down a goal and
with their leading scorer in the dressing room, came up with one of
their biggest wins of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Damphousse and Jeff Friesen scored in the third period
as the Sharks, who blew an early two-goal lead, beat the Vancouver
Canucks 4-3 on Wednesday night to take over sole possession of
eighth place in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 3-2 and with Owen Nolan sidelined by a mild concussion,
the Sharks tied the game midway through the third period on
Damphousse's goal. Friesen scored the deciding goal with 4:10
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The victory moved the Sharks out of an eighth-place tie with
Anaheim, which lost 2-1 at Edmonton earlier in the night. Vancouver
remained in 10th place with 74 points, four behind the Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   Niklas Sundstrom and Patrick Marleau scored in the first period
for the Sharks, who broke a two-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Murray Baron, Trent Klatt and Matt Cooke scored for the Canucks,
who would have moved into a three-way tie for eighth with San Jose
and Anaheim if they had won. The loss broke a three-game winning
streak for Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Sundstrom opened the scoring on a power play midway through the
first period when he completed a give-and-go play with Mike Ricci.
It was the 32nd power-play goal allowed by the Canucks this season,
one of the worst marks in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks made it 2-0 in the final minute of the first period
when Marleau split two defensemen and slapped the puck over goalie
Felix Potvin's left shoulder from an extremely difficult angle to
the side of the net.
</P>
<P>
   But Vancouver came out with much greater intensity in the second
period, and got its first goal less than a minute into the period
when Baron scored his second goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Canucks tied the game midway through the period on a
power-play goal by Klatt, who tipped in Adrian Aucoin's shot. And
Potvin preserved the tie seconds later when he stopped Nolan on a
breakaway while the Sharks were shorthanded.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver took a 3-2 lead with 6{ minutes left in the second
period on Cooke's shorthanded goal. Peter Schaefer blocked a shot
at the other end of the ice, skated into the Sharks' zone and fired
a shot on net. The rebound landed in front of the net, and Cooke
got to it and flipped a backhander past Shields.

<HEADLINE> Holy Land Lives its Extremes  </HEADLINE>
By MORT ROSENBLUM, AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Deep within the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, a
priest's angry shouts bounced off ancient walls, giving
Christendom's holiest shrine the air of a rug bazaar on a bad day.
</P>
<P>
   ''Okay, no more! Go!'' the corpulent Greek Orthodox priest
bellowed at lined-up tourists, slamming the doors to the small
vaulted tomb where tradition holds Christ was buried and
resurrected. He fumed, flailing the air in unexplained ire.
</P>
<P>
   A disconsolate Spaniard turned his palms heavenward when asked
what happened. His party of 27 had come to visit sacred sites for
the millennium, just like John Paul II. The pope is having an
easier time of it.
</P>
<P>
   Against the backdrop of a Jubilee papal pilgrimage, life in the
Holy Land continues as usual: Spiritual highs are offset by sudden
tension in a wider context of relaxed Middle Eastern laissez-faire.
</P>
<P>
   At Holy Sepulcher, the pontiff's visit Sunday will be the first
time in long memory that the six Christian denominations that
occupy it pray together for peace and goodwill.
</P>
<P>
   Since an uneasy compromise of 1757, custody has been shared by
Roman Catholics, Greek Orthodox, Armenian Orthodox, Syrian
Jacobites, Ethiopians and Copts. Because of mutual mistrust, a
local Muslim family keeps the door key.
</P>
<P>
   The Greek priest plowed into the crowd without a word when asked
his name and his grievance. Later, a Franciscan friar smiled
ruefully when asked to describe interfaith relations at Holy
Sepulcher. A disgrace, he replied.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   John Paul first saw the Jordan Valley and Jerusalem beyond as
Moses must have seen them, planted with emerald fields from fresh
rains and a mild winter, speckled with vivid crimson wild poppies,
a land of promise.
</P>
<P>
   He rode up Mount Nebo in Jordan past silvery green olive trees,
citrus groves, and vegetable gardens. From the summit, the
breath-catching panorama took in purple mountains and open plains.
</P>
<P>
   Had he stopped to chat alongside the road, however, farmers
would have given him a different picture, close-up. In the 3,500
years of human progress since Moses, a lot of promise has gone out
of the land.
</P>
<P>
   For most of its final course, for example, the River Jordan is
no more than a saline, polluted brown trickle that can be forded in
a popemobile. Between the Israelis and Jordanians, it is pumped
nearly dry from its headwaters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Farmers around here depend on rain for their crops, and
domestic water supply comes by pipe from Israel,'' said Mohammad
Waheeb, the Jordanian archaeologist who unearthed a site that might
have been where John baptized Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Two millennia ago, he said, numerous fresh springs fed
tributaries to the Jordan which ran, as the old writings say, muddy
and wide. Now most springs have dried up and the washes -- wadis --
run only briefly after heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Holy Land, water is a fighting word.
</P>
<P>
   But if the pontiff did not stop to investigate, he is hardly
unaware.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just recently, I received a call from the Vatican wanting to
know all about water, food supplies and agriculture in the Middle
East,'' said Shaul Arlosoroff, an eminent Israeli expert in those
matters. ''The pope wanted to know.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The pope captivated the ancient heart of Bethlehem on Tuesday,
but a block off Manger Square, it was another world entirely.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul's Mass was broadcast live. Just up the old
cobblestones of Najajeheh Street, however, no one watched the
television glowing in a hole-in-the-wall barber shop. Anyway, it
showed Kermit the Frog, singing in Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing was different at the eternal open-air city market.
Wizened old men and women in shawls squatted behind colorful wares:
monster cauliflowers, odd-shaped tasty tomatoes, fat pomelos,
garlic bunches, spices, hot peppers.
</P>
<P>
   Racks of lamb and beef flanks hung outside on hooks. Pungent
odors of grilled kebabs wafted over open sacks of orange lentils
and multihued beans. Friends exchanged local gossip, pausing to
suck at hubbly-bubbly water pipes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I went to see him, for fifteen minutes,'' Amir Hermas said in
his spacious store that sold everything from kitchenware to Koranic
calligraphy mounted on green felt. ''He is an important man, and we
must welcome him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hermas, a Muslim, was more interested in what John Paul had to
say about Palestinian rights today than a son of God born three
blocks away in another era.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to the square, John Shaheen sat in his empty cafe built
under ancient arches. A Christian, he was happy to have the pope
nearby, but he did not close up shop to see him. Shaheen was not
sure what to think about the visit.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must find a way with the Jews,'' he said. ''It's a small
land, but both can fit. Maybe the pope can push just a little bit
and make it work.'' He paused a moment to draw at a cigarette, then
added: ''Or not.''

<HEADLINE> Pope Has Physical Ups and Downs  </HEADLINE>
By VICTOR L. SIMPSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- With his days packed full of events, speeches,
car trips and helicopter rides, the Holy Land pilgrimage is one of
the biggest tests in years for the frail Pope John Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   The pontiff spends 11 to 12 hours in the public spotlight each
day, interrupted only by the afternoon rest time planners sketched
in for him.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting Bethlehem on Wednesday, John Paul sat slumped in his
chair on the altar during Mass in Manger Square, hands trembling as
he waited during a pause for the Muslim call to prayer from a
mosque a hundred yards away.
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of a long day, he joked with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat after accepting a gold medal for his moral support of
the Palestinian ''struggle,'' then walked unaided to a waiting
Israeli helicopter that would fly him back to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Such ups and downs are increasingly frequent for the pope, who
turns 80 in May and suffers from a variety of ailments. He is
hobbled by a shuffling gait, slurred speech and a tremble in both
hands -- symptoms of Parkinson's, a progressive neurological
disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican has added a second personal physician to the papal
entourage, but Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls insisted
last week that this was not done out of any particular concern.
</P>
<P>
   The pope was clearly shaking during a stop in the Caucasus
mountain nation of Georgia last October, but aides blamed that on a
chill from the sudden change following the previous stop in balmy
India.
</P>
<P>
   The pope's current trip, the 91st pilgrimage of his 22-year
papacy, contrasts with some recent travels, which were short
journeys with schedules purposely kept light.
</P>
<P>
   His schedule Wednesday, for example, began at 8 a.m. when he was
driven from his Jerusalem quarters to a heliport and then flown to
Al-Maghtas near the banks of the Jordan River, one of two reputed
sites of Christ's baptism.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the pope was flown to Bethlehem for a ceremony
welcoming him to the Palestinian territories, a two-hour Mass, a
stop at the grotto believed to be Christ's birthplace, a visit to a
Palestinian refugee camp and the meeting with Arafat. He delivered
four speeches. His day officially ended at 7:30 p.m. upon his
return to his Jerusalem residence.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not a day he would have willingly passed up.
</P>
<P>
   Bethlehem, he said, was the ''heart'' of his millennium
pilgrimage, a trip he said he had first hoped to make for Christmas
1978 -- just two months after he assumed the papacy. ''That was not
possible then, and was not possible until now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can I fail to praise the God of all mercies'' for allowing
the trip to take place, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The pontiff's trip began Monday in Jordan and concludes Sunday
in Israel.

<HEADLINE> Travelers Prepare for US Air Strike  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL TOLME, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Caroline Suarez isn't worried about getting home from Florida if
US Airways shuts down Saturday to avoid walkouts by flight
attendants. For her, it will just mean more time in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going on vacation,'' Suarez, 35, said as she waited
Wednesday at Philadelphia International Airport with her husband
and 3-year-old son for a flight to Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   If their return flight is canceled, Suarez said her family will
just extend their trip.
</P>
<P>
   Other US Airways ticketholders were not so calm. Many revised
their vacation plans, booked backup tickets on other airlines or
canceled trips.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways, based in Arlington, Va., has said it will shut down
rather than face random walkouts by its 10,000 flight attendants,
who want increased pay and benefits. The flight attendants have
threatened to disrupt flights on 49 of the airline's busiest
routes, a strategy they have dubbed CHAOS, for ''Create Havoc
Around Our System.''.
</P>
<P>
   A shutdown would hit hardest in the East, where the airline
controls a third of the market. Charlotte, Philadelphia and
Pittsburgh, all US Airways hubs, would be affected most.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman Stephen Wolf, chief executive Rakesh Gangwal and
negotiators for the nation's sixth-largest airline have been
meeting daily with representatives from the Association of Flight
Attendants in Washington, hoping to reach agreement before the
strike deadline of 12:01 a.m. EST Saturday. The talks were being
overseen by the National Mediation Board.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers such as Wendy Lathrope, 28, of Williamstown, N.J.,
hoped for a quick resolution to the talks. She fretted about her
return flight to Philadelphia from Orlando, Fla., next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm worried I won't be able to get back. I have a full-time
job and I'm a graduate student,'' Lathrope, who hopes to see a
friend's new house, said in a phone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Some travel agents have stopped booking flights on US Airways,
and others have been bombarded with calls from travelers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've had at least 40 calls'' from travelers, including one in
the middle of a trip who was worried about running out of his
medication, said Howard Reynolds, owner of Boulevard Travel
International in Pawtucket, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Gordon, a travel consultant at Robertson Travel Bureau in
North Canton, Ohio, said many customers who planned spring break or
Easter trips are booking flights at as much as double the cost they
were paying on US Airways, just to ensure their vacations won't be
disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the trick is finding them space on other flights with
other airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one of the busiest times of the year,'' she said. ''In
a lot of cases, it's like looking for a needle in a haystack. There
aren't a lot of seats available.''
</P>
<P>
   The last major labor-related airline disruption came in February
1999, when American Airlines pilots staged an illegal sickout,
forcing the airline to cancel about 6,700 flights over a 10-day
period. The last strike occurred in 1998, when Northwest Airlines
was grounded for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, flight attendants staged demonstrations or passed out
leaflets in Charlotte, N.C., Reagan National Airport, Los Angeles,
Baltimore, Boston, Pittsburgh, and Columbus, Ohio on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Pittsburgh, about 150 flight attendants marched to a US
Airways ticket office and then to the office of PNC Bank chief
executive Thomas O'Brien, who is on the US Airways board.
</P>
<P>
   The airline has offered a package that would link flight
attendants' pay to the average of the four largest airlines plus 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendants, whose contract expired in 1996, say the
airline's offer would actually cut pay and fringe benefits by 5
percent. Flight attendants have had no raise since 1996 and their
pay ranges from $17,145 to $36,918.
</P>
<P>
   Union spokesman Jeff Zack said the decision by some travel
agents to avoid the use of US Airways is likely costing the airline
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a product of their own doing for announcing they will
shut down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways spokesman Richard Weintraub declined to comment on
the union's statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''The uncertainty and randomness of the CHAOS campaign is
disruptive and we will not subject our customers to that kind of
treatment,'' Weintraub said. ''You can be certain that we will make
every effort to accommodate our customers' needs,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from many other major airlines, including American,
TWA and Southwest, said they would accept US Airways tickets, as
did Amtrak, which planned to add extra rail cars to its trains in
the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Turneabe-Connelly, a spokeswoman for Southwest
Airlines, said their ticket sales spiked this week but it's
impossible to tell whether that was caused by the US Airways
situation or because of spring break travelers.

<HEADLINE> Via Dolorosa Sparks Confusion  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHLEHEM, West Bank (AP) -- The Palestinian Authority isn't up
on the latest in Roman Catholic liturgy -- a representation of the
Via Dolorosa presented to Pope John Paul II on Wednesday was a
station short of what the church has recently determined is the
route of Christ's crucifixion and resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat presented the pope with 14 flat ovals set in
velvet, each marking a station of Christ's last journey through
Jerusalem. As he opened the velvet box, the Palestinian leader
explained to the pope: ''These are the 14 stations of the cross.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Fifteen,'' Pope John Paul II interjected.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your Holiness, right you are,'' said Afif Safiyeh, Arafat's
envoy to the Vatican. ''The 15th station is that of the
resurrection.'' Arafat and the pope laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Christian pilgrims to Jerusalem have retraced the stations for
at least 16 centuries, often bearing a cross. Some stations are on
the same spot: for instance, pilgrims mark the crucifixion,
entombment and resurrection of Christ in the same cramped room of
the Church of the Holy Sepulcher.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican ended centuries of confusion over the stations in
the 18th century by saying there were 14. This century, however,
Roman Catholic liturgists have added the resurrection as a station.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just the first papal pilgrimage to
Palestinian-controlled areas -- it was the first time the pope had a
necklace placed over his neck.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat presented John Paul with a gold Bethlehem 2000 medal --
hanging at the end of a green ribbon -- after a proclamation was
read thanking the pope for his support of the Palestinian
''struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope has received many gifts during his 22-year papacy, but
this is the first time one has been hung on his person.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   John Paul had just uttered ''amen,'' sealing his homily
Wednesday during an outdoor Mass near the grotto believed to be
Christ's birthplace when a piercing cry of ''Allahu Akbar'' rang
out across Manger Square.
</P>
<P>
   It was close to noon, time for the Muslim call to prayer, and
the muezzin at the Omar Mosque on the opposite side of the square
was not about to be amiss in performing his regular duties.
</P>
<P>
   The pontiff and thousands of Christian worshippers waited
patiently for several minutes until the prayer call, broadcast over
a loudspeaker attached to the mosque tower, was completed.
</P>
<P>
   A few in the crowd fidgeted uncomfortably, and a nun shook her
head in apparent disbelief. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
sitting in the front row close to the stage, checked his watch just
before the call of prayer was sounded.
</P>
<P>
   Bethlehem Mayor Hanna Nasser said a compromise had been worked
out ahead of time, with the muezzin agreeing in deference to the
pope to shorten his prayer call to three minutes of ''Allahu
Akbar,'' Arabic for ''God is Great,'' and not reading the customary
Koranic verses.
</P>
<P>
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said the brief
interruption of the Mass underscored religious coexistence.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just something that happened in a very mutual and
respectful way,'' Navarro-Valls said, noting that the starting time
of the Mass had been delayed.

<HEADLINE> Pistons 104, Trail Blazers 95  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- For the second straight night, the formula
worked for the Detroit Pistons: Keep it close on the road against a
good team, and let Grant Hill take over in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Hill scored 14 points in the final period for the second
straight game as the Pistons rallied to beat the Portland Trail
Blazers 104-95 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes you come through, sometimes you don't,'' said Hill,
who scored 33 in Tuesday night's 100-90 win at Seattle. ''People
tend to remember more when you don't than when you do. I don't mind
that; I just go out and play my game and get better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Stackhouse added 23 points and Terry Mills had 14 of his
16 in the second half on 4-of-5 3-point shooting for the Pistons,
who have won three straight road games after losing their previous
11.
</P>
<P>
   Rasheed Wallace and Steve Smith each scored 20 for the Blazers,
who led by as many as 14 in the second quarter and 11 late in the
third before the Pistons started hitting shots from all over the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no sign of a panic situation,'' Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   Hill hit an 18-foot jumper and drove around Scottie Pippen for a
baseline dunk to pull the Pistons within 83-80. He then drove down
the middle of the lane for a layup and followed with a finger roll
to put Detroit up 84-83 with 7:26 left.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace had a thunderous dunk over Christian Laettner to put the
Blazers back ahead 85-84, but a 3-pointer by Mills gave the Pistons
the lead for good at 90-87 with 4:33 left.
</P>
<P>
   After Pippen's 3-pointer got the Blazers to 92-90 with 3:47 to
play, Hill sank a 15-foot jumper, Mills a 3-pointer and Stackhouse
drove for two layups and got fouled to make it a rout at 102-90
with 1:21 left.
</P>
<P>
   Hill hit seven of his eight shots in the fourth and also had
four rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''Grant just took over the game,'' Pistons coach George Irvine
said. ''When you stop to think about it, he is a great player who
has raised his game. And that is very difficult to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Backup Jerome Williams added 13 rebounds for the Pistons, who
shot 58 percent in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers lost center Arvydas Sabonis, who sustained a
severely sprained right foot with four minutes left in the third
quarter. Sabonis caught a long lob pass from Wallace with one hand
near the basket and was nudged by Laettner. Sabonis' left foot
slipped, and he fell to the floor, his right foot caught awkwardly
underneath him.
</P>
<P>
   Sabonis was carried off the floor by teammates and left the
arena on crutches. X-rays were negative. He finished with 15 points
and seven rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Portland was ahead 75-64 at the time, and the Blazers lost their
concentration.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sabonis getting hurt took the wind out of the team,'' said
backup center Jermaine O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Without Sabonis, the Blazers likely will have to bring back
Brian Grant, who has a sore right foot, back from the injured list
sooner than expected.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't want to just throw him out there for 40 minutes,''
Portland's Smith said. ''That's why we need Jermaine O'Neal and Joe
Kleine to step up.''
</P>
<P>
   Sabonis' injury was the worst of an awful quarter for the
Blazers, who turned it over eight times in the period.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers have lost four of their last six home games since
winning 16 straight at the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to figure out a way out of this pretty soon,
especially if we are going to lose Sabas for any length of time,''
Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy said. ''He's been our anchor since the
All-Star break.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons took a 13-8 lead on two fastbreak layups and two
dunks, both by Laettner. But Wallace hit three long jumpers and
Pippen drove for a finger roll to tie it at 16. Later in the first
quarter, Portland went on a 10-0 run, and Detlef Schrempf's 20-foot
jumper made it 31-20.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers pushed their lead to 14 in the second quarter,
despite Pippen sitting out the last 6{ minutes with his third
foul.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Detroit, 35-32, stayed three games ahead of Orlando for the
No. 7 spot in the Eastern Conference playoff race. ... The Pistons
had lost 26 of their previous 28 in Portland. ... Wallace has made
36 of 49 shots (74 percent) in his last four games, averaging 20.5
points. ... The Blazers fell to 41-3 when leading after three
quarters.

<HEADLINE> Oklahoma Executes Convicted Killer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   McALESTER, Okla. (AP) -- A man convicted of raping and fatally
stabbing an Oklahoma State University student who delivered him
pizza a decade ago was executed by injection early Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Lamont Rogers, 31, had admitted to killing Karen
Lauffenburger in 1990. In the death chamber, he smiled and turned
to his family to tell them he loved them.
</P>
<P>
   ''To the Lauffenburger family, I just pray you guys will find
peace and that God will heal you from the inside out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lauffenburger, a 21-year-old interior design student, was killed
the night of Dec. 19, 1990, after delivering a pizza to the
apartment of Rogers' girlfriend, Audra Todd.
</P>
<P>
   Todd testified that Rogers told her he planned to rob the person
who delivered the pizza. After the delivery, court records show,
Rogers robbed Lauffenburger at knifepoint, forced her to withdraw
$175 from her bank account at an ATM, then made her drive to her
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   There, he stabbed her to death and raped her as she was either
dead or dying, records showed.
</P>
<P>
   Lauffenburger's parents, Ray and Pat Lauffenburger, released a
statement in which they expressed sympathy for Rogers' family, but
called the execution a ''final act of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Our family has been constantly reminded of her absence with
each passing year during celebrations of holidays, birthdays and
special family gatherings,'' the statement said. ''We miss her
terribly and will continue to do so on a daily basis.''

<HEADLINE> Serb Woman Defends Her Home  </HEADLINE>
By DANICA KIRKA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- To anyone who might think
of driving her from her home, Jelisaveta Roganovic has a message:
You'll have to get past me first.
</P>
<P>
   It might not seem like much of a threat coming from a woman who
is 80 years old, the last Serb believed to be living alone on the
ethnic Albanian side of the divided city of Kosovska Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, Roganovic has a plan.
</P>
<P>
   Every night, this veteran of Josip Broz Tito's World War II
communist guerrilla army takes up her position as a sentinel
outside her home. Sitting in a lawn chair beside a box of rocks,
she waits all night long, ready to pelt any intruder coming up her
stairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know I'm going to die,'' she said during an interview
Wednesday. ''But I'm going to die like a man. I don't want to die
like a coward.''
</P>
<P>
   Roganovic's dilemma shows just how much pressure Serbs living in
Kosovo face right now, especially in a place like the gritty
industrial city of Kosovska Mitrovica, where riots between ethnic
Albanians and Serbs on the other side of the Ibar River break out
with some regularity.
</P>
<P>
   On the south side though, things are usually quiet -- in part
because the population is almost completely homogenous. The U.N.
refugee agency estimates that no more than 19 Serbs live here now.
All but Roganovic live together under NATO protection at a church.
</P>
<P>
   Roganovic was given a chance to leave, too, to go to a place
that was safer and would allow her a more normal life. Her family
has been begging her to come live with them in Vojvodina, a
province in northern Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   She refuses, choosing instead to trust the French soldiers who
guard her home. To her they are more than peacekeepers, they are
comrades, men she feels she can deal with, soldier to soldier. They
bring her tins of meat and pots of jam. They take her shopping.
They keep her company.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeepers, though, realize that her situation is
precarious and have made a special effort to take care of her, said
French Maj. Nicolas Naubin, a spokesman for French troops.
</P>
<P>
   They are going to have to work harder.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has failed so far to create an overall environment of
security in Kosovo, particularly for Serbs, who have been fleeing
the province because of revenge attacks by ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of ethnic Albanians died during Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic's 18-month crackdown on militants fighting for
independence for Kosovo. Then there is the 10 years of oppression
under the Milosevic regime for which many want recompense.
</P>
<P>
   In a place like Kosovska Mitrovica, 25 miles north of the
provincial capital, Pristina, the dangers are intense. Just across
the river on the north bank lies one of Kosovo's only substantial
remaining Serb population, a fact that has made the entire city
unstable.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs on the wrong side of the divide would be particularly
singled out for revenge. Another Serb on the ethnic Albanian side
and under strict NATO protection was hacked to death recently by an
attacker with an ax.
</P>
<P>
   Roganovic realizes this, and has faced her share of harassment.
Intruders have ransacked her home, taking her history books, her
bed linens, her dishes. Her telephone line doesn't work -- even
though she seems to be the only person in the building with such a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   So great is the danger she faces that human rights workers
familiar with her situation refused to permit photographs of her
and her home, allowing an interview only on condition that her
home's location not be revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Roganovic doesn't let on if she's nervous, greeting her
visitors with a hug and a kiss, offering her last bit of coffee in
friendship, insisting that a few candies be carried away for later.
She offers advice on staying safe, recounting the words of an old
commander in the Partisans, the guerrilla fighters who fought the
Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   ''We used to have positions in the snow. (My commander) told me,
'If you fall asleep, you are dead,''' she said. ''I never forgot
that lesson.''

<HEADLINE> Grasslands Face Fire Danger  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MacDONALD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FARGO, N.D. (AP) -- Forest Service officials are watching the
skies and hoping for rain, worried that abnormally dry conditions
in North Dakota's national grasslands could increase the risk of
fire, endangering cattle ranchers.
</P>
<P>
   A sea of wind-swept grass and wildflowers, the Little Missouri
National Grasslands in western North Dakota is largest in the
nation. The area covers about 1 million acres, a quarter of all the
publicly owned grasslands administered by the U.S. Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have basically had no measurable, significant precipitation
since August and that's not good,'' said Gary Petik, a rangeland
specialist for the agency's McKenzie Ranger District, which
includes half of the Little Missouri grasslands.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're pretty concerned at this point,'' he said. ''We're
setting up to have a very dry summer.''
</P>
<P>
   An obvious concern is a repeat of fires that burned an estimated
70,000 acres of the national grasslands last fall and damaged the
property of about 40 ranch families.
</P>
<P>
   Lesley Thompson, the ranger for the Medora District, said it is
too early to predict the seriousness of the fire threat. But every
day without rain only increases the danger, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We definitely need precipitation,'' Thompson added. ''But
there's still time for that to occur.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the fire danger here is already considered moderate,''
said Scott Fitzwilliams, another Medora District ranger. ''For this
time of year, that is very odd.''
</P>
<P>
   What worries Petik more is what the dry conditions could mean to
the ranchers who use the National Grasslands for grazing.
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service determines the number of cattle a rancher may
graze, based in part on the conditions of the grasslands each year.
If the land appears fragile because of a lack of moisture, overuse
or fire damage, grazing may be restricted.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been cautioning folks throughout the district,'' Petik
said. ''They've all been told that if we don't have significant
moisture, we're going to have to adjust the numbers downward.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   GLASGOW, Mont. (AP) -- Although not happy about the possibility
of summer drought, cattle producers across Montana say the dryness
and mildness of late winter have reduced calf mortality.
</P>
<P>
   ''You couldn't have ordered better weather,'' said Jim McIntyre,
who raises beef cattle in the Glasgow area. ''It's a cowboy's
dream.''
</P>
<P>
   He is optimistic about the spring calf crop and thanks Mother
Nature for the mild temperatures and dry ground that have
comfortably welcomed dozens of his calves into the world this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Montana cattle producers are seeing a drop in calf deaths that
are attributable to cold weather and diseases associated with the
cold. This could be the second year in a row that ranchers will
have larger, healthier calf crops.
</P>
<P>
   Warmer weather brought calving season a bit earlier than usual.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of February, 27 percent of the roughly 1.6 million
calves expected to be born in Montana this year were hobbling
alongside their mothers. The state average for that time of year is
16 percent, according to the government's Agricultural Statistics
Service.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been an excellent winter,'' said Verlin Koenig, Montana
State University extension agent for Valley County.

Pope To Visit Holocaust Memorial

<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- It is a stop nearly every state visitor to Israel makes, a
virtual moral requirement of any itinerary, yet never will the symbolism be so
great as when Pope John Paul II Thursday sets foot on the soil of Yad Vashem.
For Israelis, the pontiff's scheduled visit to the famed Holocaust memorial
should be the emotional high point of his weeklong trip. Many are hoping he'll
do something a pope has never done before: make a direct apology for the
Catholic Church's public silence during the Holocaust.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pushes India on Environment  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   AGRA, India (AP) -- President Clinton marveled at the wonders of
the Taj Mahal on Wednesday but lamented that pollution has
blemished the gleaming white marble walls of India's treasured
monument in a way that wars, invasions and natural disasters could
not.
</P>
<P>
   He urged India, one of the world's poorest nations, not to
sacrifice the environment for the sake of economic growth. ''Give
us a chance to work with your scientists to prove you can achieve
even greater economic growth and make the environment cleaner,''
the president said.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Clinton flew Thursday to the dusty village of Nayla,
where members of a women's milk cooperative told him heartfelt
stories of their struggle for child care, higher wages, better
education in a rural society where they traditionally are
considered subservient to men.
</P>
<P>
   ''Are there men in your village who support what you're doing?''
Clinton asked. A woman replied that there were none 15 years ago,
but ''today, a number of them do.''
</P>
<P>
   The women showered Clinton with flower petals in an ancient
courtyard, clapping and singing: ''Awaken, women of my land, it's
time we empower ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The president toured the Taj Mahal after addressing the
Parliament in New Delhi, urging India to forgo nuclear weapons and
resume a dialogue with Pakistan despite bitter tensions.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't make peace with your friends,'' Clinton said.
''Engagement with adversaries is not the same thing as
endorsement.'' Legislators slapped their desks in applause at much
of the president's speech but listened in silence as he urged
nuclear restraint and contact with Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a nuclear standoff, there is nothing more dangerous than
believing there is no danger,'' Clinton said. He said the United
States and former Soviet Union, despite safeguards and regular
communication, ''came far too close to nuclear war.''
</P>
<P>
   But even before the president spoke, India's government had
rejected his call to sign a nuclear test ban treaty and otherwise
restrain its nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   And afterward, Foreign Ministry spokesman Raminder Singh Jassal
said this was not the time for talks with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can we have a dialogue with Pakistan when massacres are
taking place with cross-border terrorism?'' he asked, referring to
the killing of 40 people in disputed Kashmir by gunmen whom India
calls Pakistan-backed militants. Pakistan ''must stop cross-border
terrorism and cease hostile propaganda against us,'' Jassal said.
''Only then the conditions for dialogue can be created.''
</P>
<P>
   The address to members of Parliament concluded Clinton's two
days of official business in New Delhi. He will spend Thursday and
Friday searching on safari for a Bengal tiger and visiting a
village to discuss the role of women. He also will stop in India's
banking and computer capitals before going to Pakistan on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A sweltering sun beat down on Clinton and his daughter Chelsea
as they turned tourist and strolled arm in arm amid the gardens and
fountains of the Taj Mahal -- the majestic, domed mausoleum that
Emperor Shah Jahan built for his wife when she died giving birth to
their 14th child.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's amazing, isn't it,'' Clinton exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   An army of 20,000 stone masons, gem cutters, marble fitters and
laborers toiled 22 years to build the storied tomb, completed in
1653. ''I've wanted to come here all my life,'' Clinton said.
Chelsea had come here with her mother in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The president's entourage was allowed to visit the cellar
chamber where the remains of the emperor and his wife rest under
intricately carved solid marble slabs. The room is closed to the
public; tourists see replicas of the tombs on the main level.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Taj Mahal's walls are brilliantly white, on closer
inspection they show signs of deterioration and spotty repair.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was sorry his visit prevented others from seeing
the tomb, or him. ''I'd like if they were up front,'' Clinton said.
''I would have liked to have seen them.'' Baton-waving police kept
residents off the streets in the nearby town but people clustered
in alleys for a glimpse as the president's motorcade raced past.
</P>
<P>
   Agra is one of the most polluted cities in India because of its
more than 150 iron foundries, oil refineries and gas emissions from
trucks and cars. The Supreme Court last year ordered some plants
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a speech with the Taj Mahal in the background, said,
''Pollution has managed to do what 350 years of wars, invasions and
natural disasters have failed to do. It has begun to mar the
magnificent walls of the Taj Mahal.''
</P>
<P>
   He announced $300 million in aid for clean energy programs and
said U.S. agencies would resume technical assistance to clean up
the air and water; the aid was cut off in 1998 when the United
States imposed sanctions on India and Pakistan for conducting
nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   The president emphasized the need to curb greenhouse gases
blamed for global warming, acknowledging the United States bears a
heavy responsibility because it is the world's biggest producer of
the gases.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States will never ask India or any other developing
nation to give up its economic growth in order to reduce
pollution,'' the president said. ''But we do ask you to give us a
chance to work with your scientists to prove you can achieve even
greater growth and make the environment cleaner.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Clinton said ''we must complete the work begun in
Kyoto'' and convince critics that global warming is a global
threat. The United States joined other nations in Kyoto, Japan, in
signing a treaty to curb greenhouse gases; Clinton has not asked
the Senate to ratify the agreement because he fears it would not
survive a vote.
</P>
<P>
   He said that some people in the United States believe the Kyoto
accord ''is some sort of a plot to wreck our economy. And
unfortunately some of them have a good deal of influence.''

<HEADLINE> McCain Supporters Courted  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In their quests for the presidency, Al Gore
and George W. Bush are eagerly courting the supporters of John
McCain, although with vastly different pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the vice president, is the circus barker, flailing his
arms and shouting as if through a bullhorn while urging these
so-called ''McCainiacs'' to step inside the Democratic tent.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to say a word to the supporters of Senator John McCain
in the Republican primaries,'' he told nearly 1,000 people Monday
in Springfield, Ill. ''To any who can hear the sound of my voice,
whatever party you're in ... I'd like to ask for your support.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Texas governor, is trying the soft sell, sitting back
and waiting for those voters, mostly independents and some
Democrats, to appreciate the superiority of the product -- himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''What's going to win his supporters over is when they realize
that Al Gore is no John McCain,'' Bush said after he beat the
Arizona senator for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   After trouncing McCain on Super Tuesday, Bush said he would be
''reaching out to the people he energized,'' but has had to
backtrack after sounding dismissive of McCain last week in an
interview with The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ''I appreciate the hard campaign that John McCain waged,'' Bush
said after the interview was published. ''Of course, he and I agree
on a lot and it starts with this: The best reform for America is to
end the Clinton-Gore era in Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   As party labels fray, independent-minded voters are increasingly
a prized commodity in elections.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton won among independents in 1996, while in 1992,
Clinton and Bush's father, then-President Bush, each got about a
quarter of the independent vote. Ross Perot got almost half.
</P>
<P>
   The latest polls on the contest between Bush and Gore show
independents roughly splitting between the two, if not leaning
toward Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Though not an independent, McCain created a political stir by
pledging to attack the Washington establishment, particularly over
the way lobbyists influence policy through campaign donations.
</P>
<P>
   He also drew support from people who were enthralled with his
personal story. The son and grandson of Navy admirals, McCain was a
Navy fighter pilot who spent 5{ years in a prison camp after being
shot down during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   The race for the nomination seesawed between Bush and McCain
before the Texas governor won it with a string of victories on
Super Tuesday, March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls showed McCain's voters were more likely to be older
men who were not part of the religious right with moderate feelings
about abortion. A third of his supporters were independents, and
almost half of the men who voted for him were fellow veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Four in 10 of McCain's voters also didn't think Bush knew enough
to be president, and two-thirds had unfavorable views of Bush, the
polls showed.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Rothenberg, a Washington political analyst, said the
feelings are understandable and may explain Bush's laid-back pitch
immediately after his win.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem for Bush is he beat McCain, so immediately that
will leave a bad taste in the McCain people's mouths,'' Rothenberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the appeal to these voters from Gore, who defeated
the reform-minded Bill Bradley, has been as more of a compatriot
than conqueror.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he secured the Democratic nomination, the vice
president overtly asked for their support. He later pledged to make
McCain's signature issue -- campaign finance reform -- a centerpiece
of his own effort, although the move resurrects questions about his
fund-raising problems that stem from the 1996 Clinton-Gore
re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the March 14 primaries in six southern states,
Gore used a fund-raiser in the predominantly Republican Nashville,
Tenn., suburb of Belle Meade to make a direct -- if self-conscious --
pitch to supporters of both McCain and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm naturally going to want to provide a home for those who
were drawn to their candidacies in part because of that issue,''
Gore said at the $500-per-person reception. ''That's not the only
reason I'm saying (I support campaign finance reform). I've said it
beforehand.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Gore appeared with Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, a
third-party politician who supports campaign finance changes, and
openly appealed for support from political independents.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also visited places like Wayne State University in Detroit,
telling the Michigan independents who had supported McCain: ''I'm
anxious to talk to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush says Gore's new campaign finance push shows the vice
president ''will say anything to get elected.'' He says the
approach is the opposite of the ''straight talk'' that McCain
practiced throughout his candidacy, and that voters will flock to
him as they realize that.
</P>
<P>
   ''People want to focus on areas where we disagree,'' he said
last week of McCain. ''I'm going to focus on areas where we agree,
and there's a lot of agreement.''

<HEADLINE> Two Fight for Reform Party Control  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYNCHBURG, Va. (AP) -- One of two men laying claim to the Reform
Party chairmanship and its millions of taxpayer dollars contends in
federal court that the wrong guy was improperly elected at a party
meeting last month in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ''The events at Nashville were fraught with people who shouldn't
have been voting,'' Tracey Lenox, the attorney for Jack Gargan,
said Wednesday in a preview of the testimony he was expected to
give when the trial resumed today. ''The outcome was preordained.''
</P>
<P>
   Gargan, an ally of Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, follows rival
chairman Pat Choate to the stand. Choate, the 1996 running mate of
party founder Ross Perot, was elected in Nashville to replace
Gargan. Gargan argues that the meeting was illegally convened and
that he is still chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have run parallel chairmanships and dueling
''official'' party Web sites and are planning rival nominating
conventions with $2.5 million in federal funding -- some of which is
missing.
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry -- and the raucous nature of the Nashville meeting --
has cost the third party significant credibility this election
year, Choate testified Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It adversely affects our capacity to make a meaningful run for
the presidency this fall,'' he told U.S. District Judge Norman K.
Moon, who is expected to pick the real chairman at the close of the
scheduled three-day trial.
</P>
<P>
   Choate specifically pointed to a March 14 electronic letter from
a Robert Tice urging recipients to file criminal charges against
leaders of Perot's faction ''for attempting to violate our civil
rights,'' as well as $100 million in civil suits against the same
people. A copy of the e-mail was provided to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really a form of political terrorism,'' Choate said.
</P>
<P>
   Lenox objected to the document being admitted into evidence on
grounds that there was no evidence that the author acted at
Gargan's direction.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know anything about it,'' Gargan said during a court
break. ''That's called guilt by association.''
</P>
<P>
   Gargan also said he has instructed the people who posted an
''official'' Reform Party Web site loyal to him to take it down,
but he acknowledged plans to replace it with his own ''official''
party site.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing is only one fight facing the Reform Party, and may
not be its last in federal court. Joining Pat Buchanan, who is
seeking the Reform presidential nomination, the party is
challenging the Commission on Presidential Debates on the grounds
that its rules would unduly bar the party from those events in the
fall. If the Federal Election Commission does not rule in the
party's favor, Choate and Buchanan intend to pursue the matter in
federal court.
</P>
<P>
   In federal court this week, Choate and others allied with Perot
sought a court order to bar Gargan and his supporters from acting
as leaders and planning the convention in Ventura's state.
</P>
<P>
   Each man blames the other for the turmoil that has gripped the
party well into the election year.
</P>
<P>
   On the stand, Choate complained that Gargan's allies, in a flood
of e-mail and press releases, had caused confusion and driven away
party members ''in droves.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Choate's, Gargan's supporters painted the trial's outcome
in broad historic terms.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we do not prevail here, democracy and our future will be in
great jeopardy,'' said Virginia Reform Party Chairman Sue Harris de
Bauche, a Gargan ally who was asked to leave the Nashville meeting
after shoving a Perot supporter. She is married to Ronn Young, the
party treasurer who also was ousted in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   But Dale Cooter, Choate's lawyer, put a professional
parliamentarian on the stand who had been hired by Perot's allies
to rule over the procedures of that meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Generally, it was handled properly,'' Ben Carpenter, of
Memphis, Tenn., told the court. He said he had not received money
or anything else that would have slanted his rulings.
</P>
<P>
   About $2 million of the $2.5 million in federal funds for the
party convention is currently in the court's custody. Gargan said
he doesn't know where the rest of the money is, but assumes it was
spent on deposits for contracts on the Minnesota convention.

<HEADLINE> Bill Aims To Fight Oil Price Fixing  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans said they wanted to ''send a
message'' to OPEC oil producers. Democrats called it meaningless
''feel good fluff.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, all but a handful of House members -- Republicans
and Democrats alike -- voted for a bill Wednesday that both sides
acknowledged would do little to help Americans deal with the high
cost of oil, or lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the vote may have demonstrated how little power
Congress has to address the soaring oil and gasoline prices that
grip the nation, much less influence foreign oil production plans.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, although characterized by some lawmakers as
tepid and inconsequential, passed the House 382-38, marking the
first congressional response to the tripling of oil prices over the
past 14 months.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, titled the ''Oil Price Reduction Act,'' simply
requires the White House to review pricing practices of the
11-member Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the
president to work with other nations to restrict military
assistance against countries found to be engaged in petroleum price
fixing.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it was touted by supporters as a ''wakeup call''
and a ''clear message'' to the Clinton administration and OPEC,
which meets next Monday to consider new oil production levels, that
this country is angry over the run-up in oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   It ''spotlights OPEC's price-fixing activities,'' declared Rep.
Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y., the measure's chief sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., ridiculed the measure as ''feel good
legislation'' that does little beyond requiring reports --
documents, he added mockingly, that ''already have them quaking in
Kuwait and quivering in Venezuela.''
</P>
<P>
   But when it came time to vote, Frank cast a ''present'' -- not
wanting to endorse the legislation, but also not eager to be seen
voting on the wrong side in the oil cartel versus American consumer
debate.
</P>
<P>
   There were 187 Democrats who voted with Republicans for the
legislation, including some who were highly critical of the bill
during a two-hour debate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes people laugh at Congress. This is a day for
laughing,'' Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, declared, chastising the
Republican majority for pushing the ''meaningless'' legislation,
which he earlier in a news release described as ''feel good
fluff.'' Still, Frost voted for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans, meanwhile, were planning a largely symbolic
vote of their own on a proposed ''gas tax holiday,'' possibly early
next week, in an apparent attempt by the GOP leadership to try to
gain some political advantage on a high-profile pocketbook issue.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., this week quietly
filed two gasoline tax bills -- one to suspend the 4.3 cent-a-gallon
increase that Congress approved in 1993, and another to suspend the
entire 18.4 cent federal levy -- with a test vote planned for early
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Senate cannot initiate tax legislation, the vote
could revive efforts to cut the federal gasoline tax. A tax
rollback recently ran into trouble in the House, where some
lawmakers said it would take too much money away from highway
construction.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides used Wednesday's House debate for partisan attacks
over the conduct of America's energy policy.
</P>
<P>
   The bill will show OPEC ''that not all branches of this
government are asleep at the wheel,'' said Rep. Porter Goss,
R-Fla., accusing the Clinton administration of sitting by idly for
18 months as prices soared. Other GOP lawmakers accused the White
House of imposing an energy policy that has stifled domestic oil
production.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the majority whip, accused the
administration of ''tin cup diplomacy, running around begging OPEC
to open their valves'' while accusing the White House of ignoring
domestic oil producers.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats shot back that it has been the Republican majority in
Congress that has blocked legislation promoting energy conservation
and more fuel-efficient automobiles, and several years ago wanted
to close down the Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know price gouging, price fixing is going on,'' said Rep.
Peter DeFazio, D-Ore. ''You're telling (the administration) to do
what they already are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   DeFazio questioned why Republicans weren't considering a ban on
Alaska oil exports, a drawdown of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve
or creation of a heating oil reserve in the Northeast -- all
measures strongly opposed by the oil industry.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton says mayor's reaction wouldn't wash in Senate  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's reaction to
criticism of the Police Department after the latest shooting of an
unarmed black man reveals a characteristic that wouldn't serve him
well in the Senate, Hillary Rodham Clinton said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to work with people you don't necessarily agree with,
who may say terrible things about you, who may engage in rhetoric
and strategies that you disapprove of,'' said Clinton, Giuliani's
Democratic opponent in the Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''But you have to get up every day and work with those people
and get things done for the people who elect you and for the state
you represent.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady said Wednesday that the mayor's actions after
last week's police killing of Patrick Dorismond -- releasing the
victim's sealed juvenile record and his girlfriend's complaint that
he'd hit her -- ''have aggravated tensions in the city and have
helped drive a wedge between the police and the communities they
serve.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Giuliani had ''basically written off'' New York City's
black residents when he said he felt no responsibility to reach out
to the community after the killing.
</P>
<P>
   ''What does that say about how people would be represented by
him?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's campaign spokesman, Bruce Teitelbaum, said, ''It
sounds like Mrs. Clinton is still reading off the same script
prepared by (black activist) Al Sharpton.''
</P>
<P>
   Statewide polls on the Senate race have routinely shown the
Republican mayor getting less than 10 percent of the black vote,
while Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, gets more than 80
percent.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the mayor was asked if he felt any responsibility to
talk or meet with black people after the third fatal shooting of an
unarmed black man in 13 months.
</P>
<P>
   ''No, I don't think so,'' he said. ''I think this is a situation
that clearly had nothing to do with race. The three police officers
were Hispanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the mayor has an ''enormous trust chasm'' and ''has
presented a false choice to New Yorkers.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not necessary to choose between effective policing and
respectful policing,'' she said. ''It is not necessary to give up
trust and good relations between the police and the communities
they serve in the pursuit of lowering the crime rate.''
</P>
<P>
   NAACP President Kweisi Mfume echoed the tone of Clinton's
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rather than trying to demonize Patrick Dorismond, an unarmed
Haitian American killed during a police encounter, Giuliani should
be reviewing police training standards to see what steps the
department can take to avoid the unnecessary use of lethal force,''
Mfume said Wednesday in a statement from the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke Wednesday to reporters in White Plains after
talking about schools with a crowd of about 250 educators, parents
and students at the YWCA. She said she is a supporter of charter
schools, but that New York's law was ''guaranteed to cause
problems'' because it recognized two different chartering
authorities -- the Board of Regents and the State University -- and
because it does not properly enforce the separation of church and
state.

<HEADLINE> Nazi Labor Talks To Wind Up  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- As time runs short for the aging victims of
Nazi-era forced and slave labor, negotiators say they are nearing
agreement on how to divide up a $5 billion compensation fund after
more than a year of talks.
</P>
<P>
   The latest two-day round of negotiations was due to wind up
today, after a group session led by the U.S. and German envoys to
the meetings that include class-action lawyers, Jewish groups and
the governments of eastern European countries and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The talks have stalled over the question of how to divide the
money between the various groups who would benefit, along with how
much should be set aside for a fund for academic projects on the
Nazi labor policies that were used to help fuel Hitler's war
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Eastern European countries have also criticized the amount being
set aside for claims for Nazi-confiscated bank accounts and
insurance policies, which are also to be covered under the fund
that seeks to give German firms legal security from class-action
lawsuits in the United States. They say that takes away money for
labor victims.
</P>
<P>
   The head German envoy to the talks, Otto Lambsdorff, said
Wednesday he felt the negotiations were near a final breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   But the spokesman for German industry was cautiously optimistic
about predicting results.
</P>
<P>
   ''As is always the situation when people are very close, they
are looking for smaller differences and sometimes the smaller
differences become larger and larger,'' Wolfgang Gibowski said
Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Germany has proposed $4 billion of the fund go to labor victims,
with $500 million for property claims. The rest of the money will
cover the foundation and administrative and legal costs.
</P>
<P>
   Slave laborers -- those held in concentration camps or ghettos
and expected to be worked to death -- are to receive $7,500 each.
Forced laborers in industry, who lived under less severe
conditions, are to receive $2,500, while those put to work on farms
are to get $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gibowski said the amounts each victim would receive could be
decreased if too many people apply for the fund. The estimate of
surviving victims has ranged widely, up to 2.3 million people,
mostly non-Jews from Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Cabinet approved a
bill to set up the fund, which is to be split by the government and
German industry. The government hopes the bill will be passed by
parliament before its summer break.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan's President To Resign  </HEADLINE>
By MARCOS CALO MEDINA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan's president will resign as the
leader of the ruling Nationalists, officials said today, granting
the demands of party members who blamed him for last weekend's
humiliating election defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation of Lee Teng-hui comes less than a week after his
chosen presidential candidate, Vice President Lien Chan, finished a
distant third in Saturday's election.
</P>
<P>
   Lien will take over as acting chairman of the Nationalists on
Friday when party leaders gather for an emergency meeting, said
Ting Yuean-chao, a spokesman for the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Since the election, protesters have gathered outside the party's
headquarters in downtown Taipei, demanding that Lee take the blame
for the defeat and resign immediately. On Sunday, Lee said he would
step down in September, but that was not soon enough for his
critics.
</P>
<P>
   ''He had wanted to resign after the election setback, but he
wanted to initiate it himself, not under pressure,'' said Wang
Tan-ping, a top official in the party's central policy committee.
''He's a man who has great concerns about his historical legacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Also today, Lien apologized to supporters during his first
formal public speech since his election loss, which ended the
Nationalist's 50-year grip on Taiwan's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to himself and his running mate, Premier Vincent Siew,
the vice president said, ''The most important factor in the loss
was that two guys weren't diligent enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Lien urged party members to ''bravely stand up'' and reunify the
party.
</P>
<P>
   The loss to Chen Shui-bian of the Democratic Progressive Party
has sparked an extensive shake-up in the party's high ranks. Today,
the head of the Nationalists' vast business empire, Liu Tai-ying,
said that he would step down when a successor was picked.
</P>
<P>
   Also resigning are Secretary-General Huang Kun-hui and Deputy
Secretary-General Huang Cheng-hsiung, Ting said.
</P>
<P>
   The stiff, professorial Lien struggled to convince voters that
he could reform the Nationalist Party, long accused of deep-rooted
corruption. Late in the campaign, Lien said if elected, he would
try to put the party's business assets into a trust.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Youth Flocks to Putin  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW KRAMER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- In Russia's last presidential election, an ailing
Boris Yeltsin waved his arms in the air and tried to dance at a
rock concert, pleading with young people to back him. But Vladimir
Putin is getting the support of many of those voters without
lifting a finger.
</P>
<P>
   Jaded by years of botched reforms and massive corruption, young
Russians are flocking to Putin because they are worried about being
able to find employment and their financial security.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to finish university and be sure of finding a normal
job,'' said 18-year-old Alexei Papygin.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm voting for Putin. All the others don't have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Far from being discouraged by the ex-KGB agent's conservative
image, polls show support for Putin among voters under the age of
30 is 60 percent, slightly higher than in the population as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
   Strong backing from younger voters will help ensure Putin's
victory in Sunday's presidential vote, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's image as a tough, competent leader appeals to many
younger voters, who are not worried about warnings that he may roll
back democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas six years ago, about 20 percent of young people said
they supported a ''strong hand'' in government, between 40 percent
and 50 percent now say they want the strong government Putin is
promising, according to the Youth Institute, which conducts monthly
surveys of young people's opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Young people are waffling. They want to live in a free country
with opportunities for a career, but they want a strong hand and
discipline in the country,'' said Vladimir Radionov, director of
the institute.
</P>
<P>
   ''The contradiction will be difficult to reconcile in the
future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most young Russians' disillusionment starts with their wallets
and a widening gap between rich and poor in their own generation.
Better-off young people are likely to be in college and more likely
to live in cities, free to spend evenings in the bars and
nightclubs that flourished after the collapse of communism in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The other extreme can be seen on the streets of the seedy
districts in Moscow and scores of other Russian cities. Young men
in leather jackets loiter around shell-game tables or kiosks
selling cut-rate vodka. Young prostitutes stand on the sidewalks
and smoke, waiting for clients who arrive in flashy Mercedes or BMW
cars.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before, sports clubs and entertainment were for everybody. Now
they're a thing for the rich, and the middle-class kids spend their
time on the streets, and the streets are covered with prostitutes
and narcotics,'' said Oleg Zolotov, a 29-year-old part-time worker,
while drinking a beer on a park bench at lunchtime.
</P>
<P>
   Like many young Russians, Zolotov was downbeat about his career
prospects. The average monthly wage in Russia was about $60 in
1999, and opportunities for travel and education are shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   Even among elite university students, many say the country is
drifting and needs a strong leader. At Moscow State University,
Russia's most prestigious, students say they hope a Putin victory
will mean a new beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Others fear Putin has put the country on the slope to
authoritarian rule, pointing to his tough campaign against Islamic
separatists in Chechnya. At least 1,600 young Russian soldiers have
been killed in the war, a chilling statistic in a country where
most men face compulsory military service.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not clear what to expect from him,'' said Tanya Ivanova,
an 18-year-old geography major who plans to vote for someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Others express disillusionment, saying nothing will change, no
matter who wins.
</P>
<P>
   ''My vote won't count for anything. They already decided who
will be president,'' said Kirill Torzhevsky, 19, a math major.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only choice is to boycott the vote,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> School Plan in Denver Controversial  </HEADLINE>
By JON SARCHE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- A governor-supported plan to link school
performance to monetary rewards has failed to make the grade with
hundreds of Colorado parents and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   A school principal has resigned to protest the legislative
measure, which would establish a formula for issuing letter grades
to schools depending on how students score on a statewide
standardized test.
</P>
<P>
   Schools that receive As and those showing the greatest
improvement would receive financial bonuses. Those receiving Fs
eventually could be put under new management.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes amid efforts by lawmakers and educators
throughout the country to improve student achievement.
</P>
<P>
   What is in question is whether accountability systems for
schools actually lead to improvement, said Tom Jandris, state
services director for the Denver-based Education Commission of the
States.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still lack a wide body of systemic research that
demonstrates whether grading schools accelerates student
achievement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, supporters of the bill say grades would expose and
correct problems, while critics contend they would unfairly target
low-income and inner-city schools already troubled by low parent
involvement and high levels of student turnover.
</P>
<P>
   Low-scoring schools would be permanently stigmatized,
eliminating any chance at improvement, and could even affect
neighborhood property values, the critics say.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cannot stand behind this idea of saying to these 600
children, 'You are F material,''' said Mitchell Elementary School
Principal Lynn Spampinato, who tendered her resignation in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Under the grading system, Mitchell, in a predominantly black
inner-city area, would receive an F despite dedicated teachers,
relatively high parent involvement and innovative programs,
Spampinato said.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Coleman, who has two children at Mitchell, said: ''I'm
looking at my kids' report cards and looking at the other kids, and
to say that that school is an F is a misconception.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathy McKittrick, a teacher at Abraham Lincoln High School,
joined about 300 people at a recent protest outside the Capitol.
She argues that the bill is ''based on the false premise that all
kids can be measured by the same yardstick.''
</P>
<P>
   Education Commissioner Bill Moloney said the purpose of the
report card system -- advancing through the Legislature with Gov.
Bill Owens' blessing -- is to draw attention to problems.
</P>
<P>
   Of states with school evaluation systems, 21 issue specific
ratings on schools, while only Florida and California use letter
grades, said Shelby Samuelsen, education policy analyst for the
National Conference of State Legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Such laws are so new that there is little data available to
determine whether they are working, Samuelsen said, but added that
Texas and North Carolina, whose systems have been in place for a
while, have seen gains in student test scores.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's proposal is modeled closely on the 6-year-old Texas
system, which has resulted in significant gains in student
achievement, said Texas Education Agency spokeswoman Debbie
Ratcliffe.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe a lot of that has to do with the accountability
system because it shines a spotlight not only on successes, it
shines a spotlight on weaknesses,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Women Wins Large Federal Settlement  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government has agreed to pay $508
million to 1,100 women to settle the largest federal sex
discrimination case since the Civil Rights Act was signed into law
in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement reached Wednesday, which still requires approval
from a federal judge, would settle a 23-year-old complaint by women
who said they were denied jobs with the U.S. Information Agency and
its broadcast arm, the Voice of America, because of their gender.
</P>
<P>
   The now-defunct agency, which was absorbed by the State
Department in October, was responsible for disseminating U.S.
government news and information overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ''The message has to be sent to the United States government, to
employers in this country and to employers around the world: The
cost of discrimination is high. If you compound that with delay,
the cost of discrimination is enormous,'' said Bruce Fredrickson,
the women's lead attorney.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $508 million that must be paid to the women --
approximately $450,000 apiece before taxes -- the government must
give them nearly $23 million in back pay and interest and pay their
attorneys' fees. Those fees will be at least $12 million, because
the lawyers intend to bill the government for approximately 90,000
hours of work over the 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said this was the largest sex
discrimination case, although there have been larger settlements
involving other forms of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers decided to settle to save money, after many
years of insisting on trying each individual case in the courts,
even though the suit had been certified as a class-action case.
</P>
<P>
   They already had lost 46 of the 48 cases that had gone to trial,
with each woman winning about $500,000. Those 46 will share in
Wednesday's settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We took into account the prior court decisions of the trial
and appellate courts ..., the results of the individual class
members' hearings that had been conducted to date, as well as our
independent projections of the likely results of the remaining
hearings in the absence of a settlement,'' said Wilma A. Lewis,
U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, the government was found guilty of sex discrimination
in U.S. District Court in Washington. Since then, the government
filed and lost two appeals and was denied a hearing by the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   The women applied for jobs as international radio broadcasters,
radio broadcast or electronic technicians, writers and editors, and
production specialists at the agency and the Voice of America
between Oct. 8, 1974 and Nov. 16, 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the women denied jobs had been experienced broadcasters
from national and international news outlets, qualified writers and
reporters, or experienced technicians and producers for network
television and radio.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one of the happiest days of my life. We have won the
war, a just war,'' said Jahanara Hasan, who was rejected for a
position broadcasting to the people of her native Bangladesh in
favor of a less qualified man. ''The United States, being one of
the greatest advocates of human rights, should not allow its
officials to bring dishonor to the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Hasan, 56, works in Washington as the assistant to the
ambassador from Bangladesh.

<HEADLINE> German Fence Dispute Magnified  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Complaining to a neighbor about a bush growing
through her fence got Regina Zindler nowhere. So she took him to TV
court.
</P>
<P>
   The simple tale of yet another neighborly dispute in Germany
might have ended there, except for the 50-something housewife's
distinctive Saxon drawl. The way she pronounced the word for
chain-link fence, ''Maschendrahtzaun,'' captured the imagination of
a comedian-singer whose country music parody has turned the
backyard dispute into one of the most talked about conflicts in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old chain-link fence entered German lore after
Zindler sought television justice in October for a decade-old
complaint about the way neighbor Gerd Trommer's snowberry bush was
pushing through her Maschendrahtzaun (pronounced
MUSH-in-drawt-tsaun). She lost.
</P>
<P>
   But as fate would have it, comedian Stefan Raab was watching.
Zindler's drawn out way of saying Maschendrahtzaun kept playing
through his head -- and he used her sampled voice to immortalize the
utterance in a country tune he composed in English:
</P>
<P>
   ''And if I ever be king/and I get a crown/then it would surely
be made of/Maschendrahtzaun,'' goes one verse; others include
obscenities relating to the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Performed on Raab's show making fun of German TV clips, the song
went to No. 1 on the German charts and stayed there for seven
weeks. Frau Zindler and her fence were catapulted into media
stardom.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands descended upon Zindler's small town of Auerbach,
population 25,000, to hold impromptu fence parties at the edge of
the property and clamor for autographs.
</P>
<P>
   The trespassing snowberry bush wasn't nearly as bothersome by
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to be a normal person like before,'' Zindler has said.
''It was terrible that people would stand for hours on the
sidewalk.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was too late to retreat to anonymity. Local tourism
authorities and businesses were in the act.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's more to experience than the quarrel at the fence,''
offers a tourism brochure for Vogtland, a region near the Czech
border where Auerbach is located. The city also plans an exhibit on
the ''Fence Queen,'' as Zindler has since been dubbed.
</P>
<P>
   There are Maschendrahtzaun souvenirs, including T-shirts,
pottery with fence designs, chocolate and marzipan fence pastries --
even replicas of a pink jogging suit Zindler had been seen wearing,
which have sold out at $25 each.
</P>
<P>
   Someone even replaced the sign at the Auerbach city limits with
one reading ''Grosse Maschen-Draht-Zaun Stadt,'' or ''Big
Chain-Link Fence City.'' The sign is now enshrined in the city's
museum.
</P>
<P>
   While the catchy tune is credited with bringing fame to Auerbach
and a certain notoriety to Frau Zindler, the tale's true appeal is
that the conflict typifies the way Germans often relate to each
other.
</P>
<P>
   The fence dispute is emblematic of the daily squabbles in
densely populated Germany, where privacy and order are so highly
valued that neighbors regularly complain about barbecue smoke
blowing into their windows and neighbors flushing their toilets at
night or making home repairs on a Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a quarrel between neighbors, which happens every day
in Germany ... but never in Germany has there been such a
well-known argument between neighbors,'' said Juergen Preuss, who
worked for the tourism office on the brochure.
</P>
<P>
   The frenzy grew so great that Raab called for the hundreds of
fans who were descending on Auerbach to leave Zindler alone. His
request came after a piece of the beloved barrier was stolen,
although a local construction store donated a replacement. Later,
someone also made off with a piece of the famed foliage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Have fun and celebrate your Maschendraht-parties at home with
friends. And leave the fence there where it belongs,'' Raab said in
January, announcing he would skip a ceremony marking the single's
rise to platinum sales to help quiet the hype.
</P>
<P>
   A parody of the parody has even made it to neighboring Austria,
where the opposition used it to play off the trademark bow tie of
the new chancellor, Wolfgang Schuessel, whose government has been
under pressure from its European partners since entering a
coalition with the far-right party of Joerg Haider. In the Austrian
dialect, the word ''Mascherl'' means bow tie, similar to
''Maschen'' in the word for fence.
</P>
<P>
   ''And the EU takes their trust away/We'll send them our veto
over the Mascherl-Draht-Zaun'' -- or bow tie fence -- go the lyrics
that have been widely circulated by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, fan pressure finally got to the snowberry bush's
owner, who uprooted the bush and moved it away from Zindler's
beloved Maschendrahtzaun.
</P>
<P>
   Zindler, in return for the gesture of reconciliation, offered
her own tribute: a musical retort recorded last month under the
stage name ''Regina Z.''
</P>
<P>
   Its name? ''Peace at the Fence.''

<HEADLINE> China OKs Import of US Farm Products  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- China has issued rules to its ports that will
end a ban on U.S. citrus and allow for increased shipments of meat,
poultry and wheat, fulfilling an agreement reached nearly a year
ago, administration officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement settled a series of disputes over inspection and
certification standards, but China had delayed until late Tuesday
releasing the necessary regulations for shipments to start.
</P>
<P>
   ''Final implementation of this agreement is a fundamental
breakthrough for American's farmers and ranchers,'' Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese action also removes a potential stumbling block in
the administration's effort to get Congress to approve permanent
normal trade relations for China, which has promised in turn to
lower tariffs on a wide range of U.S. goods. The administration had
been worried about losing votes of farm-state lawmakers because of
China's delay in implementing the agricultural agreement.
</P>
<P>
   China ''has signaled to U.S. agriculture that this could be the
beginning of a good relationship,'' said the chairman of the House
Agriculture Committee, Rep. Larry Combest, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The citrus exports will be phased in over two years. During that
period, approved counties in Florida and California will be allowed
to ship citrus that is produced in areas that are free of fruit
flies.
</P>
<P>
   China banned U.S. citrus in 1980, citing concerns about the
Mediterranean fruit fly. Sunkist Growers Inc., a California-based
cooperative, is estimating it will sell China $500 million worth of
citrus, primarily oranges, grapefruit and lemons, over the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the agreement, China also is recognizing U.S.
inspection standards for meat and poultry and allowing shipments of
wheat from the Pacific Northwest that contain minimal amounts of a
fungus known as TCK smut.
</P>
<P>
   ''China is a land of enormous potential for American poultry
producers,'' said John Bekkers, chairman of the National Chicken
Council. ''China's implementation of the agreement means sales for
the industry and jobs for American workers.''
</P>
<P>
   China already is a major importer of U.S. poultry but all of the
shipments have had to go through Hong Kong because of the absence
of certification rules. The agreement will allow U.S. poultry to be
shipped to other ports and cuts the Chinese tariff from 20 percent
to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   More than 735,000 tons of chicken, turkey and duck products
worth $455 million were shipped to China last year. China has
purchased far less beef and pork -- about $14 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   China had announced last month that it was going to accept a
trial shipment of wheat from the Pacific Northwest. Allowing
shipments from that region will save on freight costs and help U.S.
farmers compete with producers in other countries for sales in the
huge Chinese market. No wheat has been shipped to China from that
area for more than two decades.

<HEADLINE> Coalition Aims at Gun Profits  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A coalition of 28 cities and counties aim to
use collective buying power to give preference to gun makers that
follow the lead of Smith &AMP; Wesson -- signing an agreement to produce
safer firearms and stick to a code of responsible conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ''Government at every level should use their procurement
policies to support manufacturers who take responsible steps to
make guns safer and to keep guns out of the wrong hands,'' said
Andrew Cuomo, secretary of Housing and Urban Development,
announcing the formation of a new gun-safety coalition.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Wednesday, Cuomo urged communities of
every size to join the effort. He said preferential buying can prod
the gun industry to fall in line behind the Smith &AMP; Wesson
agreement because sales to law enforcement agencies represent 20
percent to 30 percent of the U.S. gun market.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Bill Campbell of Atlanta said his city buys ''about a
million dollars (worth) of guns each year.''
</P>
<P>
   When the purchasing power of other cities is added the gun
manufacturers ''will comply or they will cease operations,''
Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's common sense for police to buy guns from a company that
makes it harder for criminals to get hold of guns that can be used
against police and civilians,'' Cuomo said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in an agreement announced by President Clinton, Smith
&AMP; Wesson said it would quickly install gun locks on all the weapons
it sells, introduce ''smart gun'' technology permitting weapons to
be fired only by their owners and bar sales of its weapons at gun
shows without a background check.
</P>
<P>
   The company broke industry ranks and changed its policy in
exchange for a promise that a lawsuit against it would be dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to that development, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman
of the Senate Judiciary Committee, introduced legislation to block
lawsuits by the federal government against gun makers, calling such
suits ''extortion'' and an attempt to impose gun control over
congressional objections.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said his legislation would call a halt to ''frivolous and
burdensome lawsuits against law-abiding manufacturers, dealers and
firearms owners.'' He said it would also require ''the immediate
destruction of background check records in order to protect the
privacy rights of firearms owners'' and would bar the government
from charging fees for such checks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do not believe that the administration ever really intended
to see its lawsuit against the firearms manufacturers to verdict,''
Hatch said. He said he suspected it was simply a bargaining ploy.
</P>
<P>
   Two gunmakers -- Glock Inc. and Browning -- announced they will
not sign voluntary gun-safety agreements following the Smith &AMP;
Wesson model.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo said Wednesday's announcement was an open attempt to keep
the pressure on those and other gun makers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Consumers want a safer America'' Cuomo said. ''Because of
Smith &AMP; Wesson's agreement we now know a safer America is possible.
And we demand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining the coalition were the attorneys general of Connecticut,
Maryland and New York and mayors or county officials in California,
Connecticut, Florida Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio, Rhode Island, Texas and
Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   The list included Los Angeles, San Francisco, Atlanta, St.
Louis, Boston and Florida's Miami-Dade County.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the capacity to squeeze manufacturers like a pincers
and hurt them in the marketplace.,'' said Democratic Attorney
General Eliot Spitzer of New York. ''We are bigger than the NRA
(National Rifle Association).''
</P>
<P>
   The NRA has been harshly critical of gun initiatives in general.
NRA executive Wayne LaPierre discounted the importance of the Smith
&AMP; Wesson deal, saying there was not much new in it.

<HEADLINE> India's 'Cyberadad' Attracts Cos.  </HEADLINE>
By RAMOLA TALWAR BADAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HYDERABAD, India (AP) -- Multicolored Nissan truck frames dance
across computer screens at Tower Automotive, being revised by
design engineers who, with the click of a mouse, ship them to the
main office in Minneapolis -- while U.S. coworkers are home asleep.
</P>
<P>
   And Tower Automotive is not alone.
</P>
<P>
   Many multinational companies, some with high-level Indian
employees who found success abroad, are flocking to this corner of
India, where highly skilled labor is cheap, technology is booming
and, because of the time difference, workers are available when
Americans are at rest.
</P>
<P>
   Once stinking and littered with garbage, Hyderabad now gleams
with American computer companies such as Microsoft and Oracle. It
even has a high-tech nickname: ''Cyberabad.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton visits Hyderabad on Friday, bypassing
Bangalor, in neighboring Karnataka state, which is known as India's
original Silicon City.
</P>
<P>
   Hyderabad's transformation began in 1994, when Chandrababu Naidu
was elected chief minister of Andhra Pradesh state. Last year,
Naidu established a software technology park on a 250-acre site,
roped in dozens of computer companies to set up shop and provided
all the facilities under one roof.
</P>
<P>
   ''Financial resources, technology can be borrowed,'' Naidu said.
''We have excellent human resources. More and more employment will
create more wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   Naidu persuaded software giant Microsoft to put a development
center in Hyderabad, one of only two outside the United States.
''One of the largest pool of talented software professionals is in
India; so we thought India is the best place to be,'' said
Microsoft general manager Srinivas Koppolu.
</P>
<P>
   Naidu was the first chief minister to computerize his
government. Telephone lines were scarce here a few years ago, but
now, Naidu meets with his department heads by teleconference.
</P>
<P>
   Naidu still faces daunting challenges: poor health care
facilities, a violent separatist movement in the north and
widespread disparities in development. Critics say he is so focused
on attracting technological investment that he ignores the needs of
the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ''What will happen to low skilled workers? Lopsided development
will increase employment problems,'' warns Gummadi Nancharaiah,
head of the economics department at Hyderabad's Central University.
</P>
<P>
   But Naidu cites several projects he has launched for farmers and
the poor, and industry proponents say booming revenues from
high-tech enterprises eventually will trickle down to all.
</P>
<P>
   For many here, Hyderabad's growth stirs hope that India will
soon join the ranks of Asia's affluent nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first time I came back to India in 1996, I was blown away
by the change, the number of foreign companies that are coming
in,'' said Kishen Kavikondala, 31, a Hyderabad native who left 10
years ago to study in the United States. Kavikondala now heads
Tower's India operations.
</P>
<P>
   Tower produces modules and assemblies of cars and trucks for
clients like Ford, Nissan, GM, Honda and Toyota. It uses
computer-simulated tests to judge a truck's capacity to carry
different loads.
</P>
<P>
   Kavikondala persuaded his employer to set up a design center in
Hyderabad after he learned last year that foreign automobile
companies planned to expand production and sales operations in
India.
</P>
<P>
   Anil Garg, vice president of AristaSoft, says his company came
here from Mountain View, Calif., to harness local talent.
AristaSoft develops and integrates a client's business system and
reduces the time companies would spend setting up information
technology systems.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't come here just because I'm Indian. Most people in my
company are not Indian,'' Garg said. But, he added, ''Indians leave
a part of themselves behind when they go abroad. If there's someway
to stay connected, it's great.''
</P>
<P>
   Software exports are expanding by 50 percent every year. Last
year, software accounted for 10.5 percent of all Indian exports,
according to the National Association of Software and Services
Companies, or NASSCOM.
</P>
<P>
   NASSCOM predicts information technology will create 2.2 million
jobs within eight years. Another assessment by consulting firm
McKinsey and Co. predicts revenue from information technology
exports to rise from less than $4 billion this year to $50 billion
by 2008.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,800 technical schools here are producing 68,000
software professionals every year -- in a country where only four in
10 adults can read.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Waste Bill Clears House  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation that would clear the way for
thousands of tons of highly radioactive nuclear waste to be shipped
to the Nevada desert has passed Congress, but likely will not
become law.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has promised a veto and supporters in neither
the Senate nor the House appear to have enough votes to override a
veto. The measure passed the House on Wednesday by a 253-167 vote,
after clearing the Senate last month 64-34.
</P>
<P>
   It takes at least two-thirds of those voting to override a
presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fate of Nevada's future is now in the president's hands,''
said Rep. Jim Gibbons, R-Nev.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would require that shipments of used nuclear
fuel, building up at reactors in 31 states, begin to be shipped to
Nevada in 2007, once the Nuclear Regulatory Commission approves a
license for a permanent waste site in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The NRC is expected to decide as early as 2006 on whether the
Yucca Mountain underground nuclear waste repository 90 miles
northwest of Las Vegas should be licensed. Now under scientific
review, the site is proposed for opening in 2010. State officials
have pledged to fight it.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to win broader support, the bill's sponsors
deleted provisions that would require creation of a temporary waste
storage site and require that the federal government immediately
take title of the waste now held by electric utilities.
</P>
<P>
   But Nevadans continue to oppose any legislation that would bring
the nation's highly radioactive wastes, which remains dangerous for
10,000 years, to the state.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has opposed the legislation partly because the
bill raises questions about the authority of the Environmental
Protection Agency to independently determine radiation exposure
standards for a future Yucca Mountain underground repository.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was just an exercise in futility,'' Rep. Shelley Berkley,
D-Nev., said in an interview after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the legislation argued that the government has a
legal obligation to take more than 40,000 tons of highly
radioactive used reactor fuel now kept at commercial reactors in 31
states.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government broke its promise to begin storing nuclear
waste. The (Clinton) administration still refused to deal in good
faith ... to fix the problem,'' said Rep. Fred Upton, R-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   While Nevada's lawmakers sought to keep waste out of their
state, other opponents of the bill said it does not go far enough
to ensure a central storage facility is built. Still other House
members said they were concerned about thousands of waste
shipments, many by truck, crisscrossing the country.
</P>
<P>
   This bill ''does more harm than good, it's a sham. It's nothing
more than bait and switch,'' complained Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   He said the House should take up its own legislation, which
would create a temporary storage facility and require the Energy
Department to take title of the waste.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has struggled for six years over how to deal with the
buildup of used reactor fuel now mostly held in water pools at 71
reactor sites around the country. Some utilities complain they are
running out of storage room while electricity users have
contributed $13 billion into a federal waste fund.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation, the EPA would have to consult with the
NRC and the National Academy of Sciences if it wanted to issue the
standards before June 1, 2001. The NRC has suggested less stringent
standards than the EPA is considering for the Yucca Mountain site.

<HEADLINE> INS Slammed For Releasing Criminals  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE MITTELSTADT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A key House lawmaker is harshly critical of
the immigration service for releasing 35,000 immigrants with
criminal records into U.S. communities over the past five years,
saying one-third of them went on to commit new crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just find this another absolutely catastrophic failure of
this agency,'' Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., said.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, who chairs the House appropriations subcommittee that
funds immigration operations, made clear his displeasure during a
sharp round of questions lobbed at Immigration and Naturalization
Service Commissioner Doris Meissner during a hearing by his panel
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 35,318 criminal aliens freed by INS during the five-year
period ending last May, 11,605 went on to commit new crimes, Rogers
said, citing newly compiled Justice Department figures.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're dealing with here is mayhem on the American people,
and that cannot be tolerated,'' Rogers fumed, saying 98 homicides,
142 sexual assaults, 347 robberies and 1,214 assaults were among
the total.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner defended her agency's performance, although she
acknowledged that the numbers are ''of great concern to us.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The custody of criminal aliens is a top priority of this
agency and the removal of these aliens is occurring at a very rapid
rate,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the releases weren't at INS' discretion, Meissner said,
ordered either because the incarcerated immigrants had won their
deportation cases or because bond was allowed by judges.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, she said, INS exercised its discretion to
release criminal aliens viewed as posing no flight risk or danger
to the community. Included in that category are a class of
essentially stateless immigrants whose home countries -- Cuba,
Vietnam and Laos among them -- refuse to accept their return and who
otherwise would remain indefinitely incarcerated, long after
completing their sentences.
</P>
<P>
   And, included in the total, are an as-yet uncalculated number of
criminal aliens who were deported but slipped back into the United
States, INS officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Recidivism ''occurs at an alarmingly high rate for U.S. citizen
criminals just as it does for criminal aliens,'' Meissner said.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal aliens' recidivist rate of 37 percent pales in
comparison to the 66 percent rate posted by the U.S. criminal
population, INS officials said, though they acknowledge the
five-year snapshot might not provide a complete picture.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over criminal alien releases was touched off
after the INS' parent, the Justice Department, complied with a
demand for information from the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Angered by the INS' release of a Mexican drifter suspected in
nine killings, the Judiciary Committee's chairman issued subpoenas
last August for information on recidivist criminal aliens.
</P>
<P>
   INS has been under fire for allowing Angel Maturino Resendez,
the suspected ''railroad killer,'' to slip repeatedly through its
fingers. Also known as Rafael Resendez-Ramirez, he is charged in
connection with murders in Texas, Illinois and Kentucky. His trial
in one of the Texas slayings begins next week.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's inspector general, in a report earlier
this week, blamed Resendiz' release on errors by poorly trained
immigration agents and design flaws in their computerized lookout
system.
</P>
<P>
   Resendiz allegedly murdered four more people in this country
after the Border Patrol released him back to Mexico last June. When
released, he was wanted by the FBI, Texas Rangers and Houston
police for questioning about murders near U.S. rail lines.

<HEADLINE> Moment of decision: Rich and poor wait to hear from colleges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EDITOR'S NOTE: In just a few weeks, the agonizing wait will be
over. High school seniors across the country will know whether they
got into the college of their dreams. For many high-achieving
students who live in America's privileged suburbs, the past year
has been filled with worries about whether they will get into the
''right'' school. But the anxieties are of a different sort in
grittier parts of the nation, where some youngsters are the first
in their family to ever go to college -- and they are all too aware
of the many obstacles ahead. Here's a look at the mood at two very
different high schools, one in prosperous Westchester County, N.Y.,
the other on the impoverished West Side of Chicago.
</P>
<P>

In well-to-do New York suburb, there's the 'right' school
</P>
<P>
By JIM FITZGERALD
</P>
<P>
   CROSS RIVER, N.Y. (AP) -- Paul Goldner has a 93 average, which
ranks him in the top 10 percent at one of the nation's most
rigorous high schools. He scored an impressive 1430 on his SATs.
And he has competed with the U.S. figure skating team as an ice
dancer.
</P>
<P>
   But he hasn't heard yet from Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of tension at the high-achieving schools of
well-to-do Westchester County this time of year, but for most of
the students, it's not a question of whether they will get into a
school.
</P>
<P>
   It's whether they will get into the right school.
</P>
<P>
   Goldner, an 18-year-old senior, has been accepted at the
prestigious University of Chicago, but Chicago is a little farther
away than he wants to go. He has applied to Amherst, Brown and
several other New England colleges, in addition to Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's sort of a relief to know I'm in somewhere, but I'm still
a little worried,'' he says in an interview at John Jay High School
in Cross River.
</P>
<P>
   At John Jay, about 90 percent of the graduates go to college,
compared with 67 percent nationwide. At Fox Lane High in nearby
Bedford, it's in the high 90s. Starting sophomore year, students
are bombarded with unsolicited college brochures, catalogs, videos
and phone calls. And thanks to some universities' early-acceptance
or rolling-acceptance policies, many seniors know well before the
traditional April 1 date that they have a college they can go to.
</P>
<P>
   That first fat envelope is ''the icebreaker,'' says Alexa Lynch,
a senior at Fox Lane who has been accepted at Northeastern. ''At
least you have somewhere to go, even if it's not your top choice.
If you get rejected everywhere else, you still know you're going to
college.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, who has a 94 average, is really hoping to get into
Middlebury College in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've wanted to go to Middlebury since I was a freshman,'' she
says. ''If I don't get it, I guess I'll cry, I'll be upset, but I'm
not going to go into my room and yell, 'My life is over!'''
</P>
<P>
   Her classmate Sumei Johnson already knows the pain of rejection.
Johnson, who has also been accepted at Northeastern and is still
waiting on Boston College, found out the hard way that applying for
early admission at Penn can also mean early rejection.
</P>
<P>
   ''Penn was a crusher,'' she says. ''It was the only school I had
applied to at the time, but now I think it's going to work out
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldner says Harvard is a long shot for him, partly because
''everyone who applies there has grades like mine.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If I get into Harvard, it'll be because of the ice dancing,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Christina Dagostino, a Fox Lane senior, told colleges
about how she restarted the school's Safe Rides program, which
offers a ride home from parties to anyone worried about drunken
driving. Lynch spent a month in Nicaragua, helping to build a
church and a community center. And Amanda Ingrassia, a senior at
John Jay, coached fifth-grade girls basketball -- a challenge,
because ''they want to sit and braid hair.''
</P>
<P>
   Colleges are looking ''for students who are going to stand out
in their schools and are going to provide different things, not
just going there to learn and get an education, but going to add to
the community,'' Dagostino says.
</P>
<P>
   The Westchester seniors seem well aware of their good fortune
compared with many others around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel very guilty, sometimes,'' Goldner says. ''I know I'm
lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Though a majority of the students come from well-to-do families,
all but one of those interviewed say costs will play some part in
their final choice. Several say their parents expect them to
contribute in some way.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want me to work this summer and pay for some of the
necessities,'' Samuel Filler says. ''They also expect me to do well
if they're going to pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ingrassia so far has been accepted only at the State University
of New York at Binghamton, though she is hoping for Haverford,
Cornell and the University of New Hampshire. Binghamton, which
would cost less than half of what the other schools charge, has one
thing going for it, Ingrassia says.
</P>
<P>
   ''My parents told me, if I go there they'll buy me a car,'' she
says.

<HEADLINE> Eco-Terrorists Wreak Havoc  </HEADLINE>
By AMALIE YOUNG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Using darkness for cover, activists
smashed a window in a Wisconsin warehouse, crawled inside and
placed incendiary devices on a propane tank. They set the timers
and fled.
</P>
<P>
   That same day, March 13, a group calling itself the Animal
Liberation Front boasted that they'd burned the warehouse down --
even though they hadn't. The devices had malfunctioned and last
week's attack on the refrigerated warehouse containing gourmet dog
food had failed.
</P>
<P>
   Acting solo or side by side, the ALF and its sister group -- the
Earth Liberation Front -- have claimed credit for a string of costly
arson attacks and other acts of sabotage across the country.
</P>
<P>
   In their communiques, the so-called eco-terrorists say they're
on a crusade to protect animals and the environment. They also say
their intentions are non-violent.
</P>
<P>
   It's little comfort to the people who own property that has been
destroyed or damaged in the attacks. Dana Watkins, whose dog food
warehouse in Viraquo, Wisc., was apparently the latest target, used
to provide food to fur farms -- favorite targets of the vandals.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins worries the radicals may return and try to finish the
job. ''Every night we go to bed scared, wondering what will
happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the past three years, damage from acts of eco-vandalism
has amounted to millions of dollars. Since December 1997, the two
groups have taken responsibility for at least 10 arson attacks,
including a $12 million fire that destroyed a ski lodge in Vail,
Colo.
</P>
<P>
   No lives have been lost, but some fear it's only a matter of
time.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until fairly recently, they have been more of a nuisance than
a real problem,'' said Gary Perlstein, co-author of ''Perspectives
on Terrorism,'' a book about radical American fringe groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somebody is going to die, even if it is accidentally,'' he
said. ''When they find that their present activities don't work,
they'll have to get more aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Though their histories are murky, ELF and ALF trace their
origins to the late 1970s with the founding of Earth First!, a
group energized by Utah anarchist Edward Abbey's novel ''The Monkey
Wrench Gang.''
</P>
<P>
   Serious environmental terrorism started to mount in the 1980s as
conservationists fought to prevent loggers from cutting ancient
trees and new concerns were sparked about endangered animals.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1980s, an increasing number of animal-rights
activists had joined radical environmentalists in bids to save both
wilderness and animals. Some believe there is a link between
eco-terrorists and Eugene-based anarchists who were blamed for some
of the violence during the World Trade Organization talks in
Seattle last year.
</P>
<P>
   Mainstream environmentalists say they know little if anything
about the radical groups and disown violence, worrying that the
fanatics may harm their cause.
</P>
<P>
   ''They discredit people who might otherwise speak out in our
democracy,'' said Wendell Wood, a conservationist with the Oregon
Natural Resources Council.
</P>
<P>
   AFL and ELF have no official headquarters or Web site. The only
faces attached to the two groups are self-proclaimed ''spokesmen''
who alert the media each time the groups strike.
</P>
<P>
   Both spokesmen say they are merely sympathetic mouthpieces for
the two groups, passing on anonymous communiques after the groups
strike.
</P>
<P>
   ''The public has a right to know that these are not just random
acts,'' said Craig Rosebraugh, the 27-year-old spokesman for the
ELF.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the FBI raided Rosebraugh's Portland home and
seized computers, papers and other items. Later that month,
Rosebraugh was called before a federal grand jury to answer
questions about the ELF and ALF.
</P>
<P>
   Rosebraugh, who runs a Portland vegan bakery, says he refused to
answer the grand jury's questions.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Compton, an FBI spokesman in Portland, declined to
comment on Rosebraugh's status or investigations into attacks
linked to the groups.
</P>
<P>
   David Barbarash, who acts as ALF spokesman from his home in
British Columbia, served four months in jail for taking part in an
ALF action -- the release of cats used in medical research at a
Canadian university in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Barbarash also faces charges in Canada for mailing letters
booby-trapped with razor blades to more than 20 hunting guides in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sending razor blades to people is a violent activity,'' he
said. ''I have never taken any violent action against people.''
</P>
<P>
   Perlstein speculates that the ELF and ALF are a single, loosely
knit network whose members don't all know each other. That way,
they can't inform on the others if caught.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a classic shell network that's been used in guerrilla
warfare,'' he said. ''Unless the FBI can arrest someone with
information, they're going to have difficulty catching them.''

<HEADLINE> US Envoy Meets Taiwan's New Leader  </HEADLINE>
By ANNIE HUANG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- A former U.S. congressman wrapped up a
brief meeting today with Taiwan's newly elected president aimed at
determining whether his policies toward China could bring the two
countries closer to war.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides declined to speak to reporters after their meeting,
holding their comments until unofficial U.S. envoy Lee Hamilton's
departure on Friday. Hamilton is a former Indiana congressman with
expertise in Asian affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Washington and Beijing have been closely watching Chen Shui-bian
since he won Saturday's three-way race with 39 percent of the vote.
Both are looking for signs he might take Taiwan dangerously close
to war with China.
</P>
<P>
   During the presidential campaign, Chinese leaders made it clear
they reviled Chen because of his past support for Taiwan
independence. In newspaper editorials, policy papers and speeches,
Beijing tried to scare voters away from him.
</P>
<P>
   During the presidential campaign and since his election victory,
Chen has worked hard to assure Beijing and Washington that he will
try to ease tensions with China.
</P>
<P>
   Before he was elected, Chen began distancing himself from his
party's support for allowing Taiwanese to vote on whether the
island should declare independence. He said he would only call such
a referendum if China attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan and China split amid civil war in 1949, and Beijing has
repeatedly threatened to use its massive military against the
island if it tries to split away for good.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton is a presidential emissary to Taiwan in everything but
name. He was traveling as a private citizen because Beijing would
fiercely protest an official U.S. visit. China insists Taiwan is a
Chinese province that should not have diplomatic ties with other
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Visits to Taiwan by unofficial U.S. envoys are usually low key,
and it was not unusual for Hamilton to decline to speak to
reporters or discuss his meeting with Chen. Hamilton also planned
to meet retiring President Lee Teng-hui, who officials said would
step down Friday as his party's leader because of the election
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   After arriving Wednesday night, Hamilton said in a brief
statement that he was looking forward to learning ''more about the
policies (Chen) seeks to carry out when he assumes office and
pleased to have the opportunity to exchange views with leaders in
Taiwan.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen was also mum about today's meeting. Later in the day, he
met with Defense Minister Tang Fei and praised the military for
remaining neutral in the run-up to the election.
</P>
<P>
   ''National security will be my top priority,'' Chen told Tang.
''National interests will take precedence over any party
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   When reporters pressed him for comment about his meeting with
Hamilton, Chen would only talk about how Taiwan's stock market
soared 464 points today.
</P>
<P>
   Share prices had nose-dived Monday as jittery investors dumped
stocks on worries about war and Taiwan's uncertain political
future. But the fears seem to be fading and the market has closed
up the past three days.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Chen has expressed a wish to meet Chinese leaders and
hold discussions about topics of their choice. He has invited
Chinese leaders to visit Taiwan, and Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said he would like to visit the island.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that both sides are stuck on disagreements that
have blocked talks with Taiwan's current government. Beijing
insists that before negotiations begin, Taipei must agree that the
island is an inseparable part of ''one China.''
</P>
<P>
   Chen and Taiwan's current president have refused to accept that
condition. They think China's notion of ''one China'' means that
the ruling government of that nation would be in Beijing. That
would make Taipei a subordinate, unequal power that would have less
clout at the bargaining table.
</P>
<P>
   Chen has urged Beijing not to set conditions for talks -- a
request China has refused.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the other major candidates, Chen, a former Taipei
mayor and defense attorney, had the least amount of experience in
foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The other two main candidates -- independent James Soong and Vice
President Lien Chan -- have graduate degrees from U.S. universities
and can speak English. Chen, 49, never studied abroad and his
English speaking skills are minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, who retired from Congress in 1998, is the director of
the U.S.-based Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. He
was once the ranking Democrat on the House International Relations
Committee.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Braces for More Flooding  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- Towns in southern Mozambique face
being swamped for the second time in less than a month by the
surging Limpopo River, relief workers said. Residents, many of whom
had just returned home, have fled to higher ground.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots took off early today from the airport in the capital,
Maputo, to conduct an aerial surveillance of the river but did not
immediately report back their findings, said Abby Spring, a
spokeswoman for the U.N. World Food Program.
</P>
<P>
   ''Weather remains the No. 1 concern for us,'' Spring said.
''Each day, we're monitoring to prevent further loss of life.
</P>
<P>
   The flooding was expected to hit some areas as soon as early
today following recent heavy rains in neighboring Zimbabwe and
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are hardly any people left in Chokwe,'' said Ian Macleod
of the U.N. Children's Fund. The town was first submerged by
floodwaters almost a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   During last month's floods, the worst on record in this
impoverished southeast African nation, thousands of people were
forced to seek refuge in trees and on rooftops until they were
rescued by helicopters. The confirmed death toll of 492 is expected
to rise.
</P>
<P>
   The government had urged people to stay away from low-lying
areas until the rainy season ends late this month, but an estimated
10,000 Chokwe residents returned anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Now almost all of them have left again after government warnings
that began Monday. Most have moved to Chaqualane village further
south, on higher ground.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Leonardo Simao said the wave of water was
expected to reach Xai-Xai, the capital of Gaza province, within a
few days and cause renewed flooding there, 80 miles southeast of
Chokwe on the coast. There were virtually no people still living in
low lying areas of Xai-Xai, Macleod said.
</P>
<P>
   Macleod said the rate at which water was being released into the
Limpopo from the Massingir dam on Mozambique's western border had
more than quadrupled between Sunday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. Tom Dolney said two
helicopters were on standby at Maputo airport for rescue missions.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also feared renewed flooding in Mozambique's
devastated central region, where the levels of the Buzi, Save and
Pungue rivers were rising.
</P>
<P>
   ''All road access has been cut off. At this point, they are not
saying it's a life-threatening situation, but it will require
careful monitoring,'' said Aya Shneerson of the U.N. World Food
Program, who flew over the area Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   While floodwaters had receded in many areas, the ground remained
saturated and any fresh influx of water posed a serious threat, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mozambique asked international donors for another
$100 million in emergency aid. The additional money was needed to
ensure ongoing emergency aid to 650,000 flood victims until the end
of August, Simao said.
</P>
<P>
   The estimate of the number of people still displaced by the
floods has increased from 360,000 to 450,000 out of a total
population of 19 million.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 24, the government asked for $65 million in aid to meet
the immediate needs of 300,000 people, but this did not take into
account damage caused by subsequent flooding caused by Cyclone
Eline.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations said it had received more than $118 million
in pledges from 44 different donor countries and organizations,
including money spent on direct relief operations. The government
said thus far it had received at least $58.7 million, including
$8.2 million for food assistance and $36 million for infrastructure
repairs.

<HEADLINE> US Businesses Urge Seoul on Autos  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- The American Chamber of Commerce,
concerned about foreign carmakers' small market share in South
Korea, urged the government Thursday to further lower tariffs on
autos.
</P>
<P>
   ''The current situation is politically unsustainable,'' said
Paul M. McGonagle, president of the American Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1998 agreement, South Korea reduced the tariff on
vehicles from 80 percent to 8 percent. But the current levy is
still three times the U.S. rate.
</P>
<P>
   About 910,000 passenger cars were sold in South Korea last year.
Of them, only 2,400 cars, or 0.26 percent, were foreign.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean automakers sold 410,000 passenger cars in the
United States during the same period, grabbing almost 2 percent of
the market.
</P>
<P>
   McGonagle said another reason behind the sluggish sales of
foreign cars was the ''negative public perception'' attached to
owning a foreign vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   After South Korea was forced to accept a $58 billion bailout
from the International Monetary Fund, many people felt spending
money on imported goods was unpatriotic. Civic groups staged a
''Buy Korean'' campaign amid the economic crisis in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Despite South Korea's significant economic recovery, McGonagle
said, resistance to owning a foreign car remains an obstacle to a
bigger market share.
</P>
<P>
   The chamber said it hopes South Korea's government takes
measures to improve access to the market, including supporting a
foreign auto show in May.

<HEADLINE> New Britain officer acquitted of larceny  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A New Britain police officer has been
acquitted of attempted robbery and larceny, six years after he was
charged in a corruption case that focused on the Hartford police.
</P>
<P>
   A six-member jury found Kevin Cloukey, 38 innocent in Superior
Court on Wednesday. He was accused of assisting a drug dealer
shakedown clients and attempting to rob another dealer of money in
May 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Cloukey was one of eight police officers, including a former
state trooper, arrested during an 18-month probe conducted by
Hartford Superior Court Judge Arthur Spada.
</P>
<P>
   One Hartford officer charged in the investigation was acquitted
of criminal charges. Another Hartford officer, accused of larceny,
was granted a special form of probation that will allow him to
clear his record if he completes his probation successfully.
</P>
<P>
   All told, 26 suspects, not all of whom were arrested, were
developed during a probe that called 148 witnesses. Cloukey was the
second officer acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Cloukey, a seven-year veteran of the force at the time, and
fellow New Britain Officer Daniel Phillips, then 38, were arrested
Oct. 25, 1994, and stripped of their guns and badges. They
initially continued to be paid, but later were suspended from the
payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, a detective with the gang task force, was charged with
perjury and using a false search warrant to enter a cafe dancer's

   The jury in Cloukey's case deliberated for over two days
following more than two weeks of testimony. Judge John F. Mulcahy
Jr. presided over the trial.

   During the trial, Springer attacked two of the state's crucial
witnesses, brothers Johnnie and Luis Baez, both convicted drug
dealers, who accused Cloukey of being involved in assisting a drug
operation.

<P>
   Springer argued it was inconceivable that Cloukey could have
been involved since he was supplying information to police
narcotics investigators who at the time were constantly watching
Cancel's drug dealings.

   AGRA, India (AP) -- President Clinton marveled at the wonders of the Taj
Mahal on Wednesday but lamented that pollution has blemished the gleaming white
marble walls of India's treasured monument in a way that wars, invasions and
natural disasters could not. He urged India, one of the world's poorest nations,
not to sacrifice the environment for the sake of economic growth. ''Give us a
chance to work with your scientists to prove you can achieve even greater
economic growth and make the environment cleaner,'' the president said.

For Israelis, the pontiff's scheduled visit to the famed Holocaust memorial

do something a pope has never done before: make a direct apology for the
Catholic Church's public silence during the Holocaust.

<HEADLINE> House Panel Approves Education Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans are steering an education
savings account bill toward passage despite the threat of a
presidential veto and the opposition of most Democrats who say
there are fairer ways to spend education dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The tax-writing Ways and Means Committee on Wednesday approved
by 21-16 a five-point bill to give tax relief to parents and
encourage spending both for public and private schools. The vote
was along party lines except for Republican Rep. Nancy Johnson of
Connecticut, who voted against the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which could reach the House floor next week, parallels
a measure passed by the Senate earlier this month by 61-37, six
votes short of what would be needed to override a promised veto by
President Clinton. The president has vetoed two bills that
contained similar education savings account legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would allow parents to place as much as $2,000 per
year, per child, in education IRAs. Tax-free interest from those
contributions could be used for transportation, tutors, books and
any other expenses for K-12 public, private or parochial schools.
</P>
<P>
   It would expand an existing program that allows contributions of
only $500, and only for college students.
</P>
<P>
   The House measure, sponsored by Rep. Kenny Hulshof, R-Mo., also
would:
</P>
<P>
   --back a national public school construction initiative.
</P>
<P>
   --increase student loan interest deduction.
</P>
<P>
   --make earnings on prepaid college tuition plans tax exempt
rather than tax deferred.
</P>
<P>
   --provide incentives for companies to donate computer equipment
to public schools.
</P>
<P>
   It would cost an estimated $11.6 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, said the
legislation would give parents ''more choices as they design the
best education for their children.'' He said three-fourths of the
benefits would go to children in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats argued that the savings accounts would be used
mainly by affluent families and accelerate the abandonment of
public school systems.
</P>
<P>
   The National Education Association, in a statement, said the GOP
bill ''diverts billions of dollars to tax breaks for private school
education savings accounts'' and that families with children in
private school would receive more than half the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, the ranking Democrat on the
committee, joined Johnson in offering an amendment that would have
stripped out the education savings account provisions and
substituted language to subsidize $24.8 billion in zero-interest
school modernization bonds. It was defeated on a voice vote.
</P>
<P>
   Coming up with the money to hire more teachers and build and
modernize school facilities has been the top education priority of
the White House and Democrats. Republicans have emphasized giving
states, local school districts and parents more control over
education dollars.

<HEADLINE> Senate To Vote on Crop-Insurance  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation that would sharply reduce the
premiums farmers pay for federally subsidized crop insurance would
encourage growers to buy higher levels of coverage and lessen the
need for other forms of federal assistance, backers say.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate was to vote today on the measure, which also would
offer coverage for the first time to livestock producers and expand
policies for fruit and vegetable growers.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, similar to a bill approved by the House last
year, would cost taxpayers $1.5 billion annually over the next four
years. A House-Senate conference committee would work out the
differences between the two bills.
</P>
<P>
   Policies can be purchased to protect farmers from
weather-related losses as well as drops in commodity prices. But
many farmers, especially in the South and East, say the insurance
is too expensive for the coverage it provides.
</P>
<P>
   ''Very few businesses have the economic situation that
agriculture has. Just a little more supply than is necessary will
cause prices to go down,'' said Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said the legislation ''will
provide the security necessary to help farmers through lean years
so that they will be around to experience better prices and
increased revenue in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The government now pays from 13 percent to 57 percent of a
farmer's premium, depending on the level of coverage. Under the
Senate bill, the government's share on most policies would range
from 45 percent to 60 percent. The House bill would have the
government pay from 31 percent to 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Senators from the Northeast insisted on setting aside $126
million in the legislation to help farmers in their region get the
insurance. Few farmers in the region now buy the coverage,
including only 8 percent of producers in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Although lawmakers from the Plains states have been pushing
hardest for the higher subsidies, the legislation is ''going to
have to be viewed by people all across the country as having
something that's going to benefit them,'' said the chairman of the
House Agriculture Committee, Rep. Larry Combest, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is S. 2251.

<HEADLINE> Protesters in China Block Trains  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- People protesting the closure of a
company that had illegally raised money from investors blocked the
main train line in eastern China, delaying more than 40 trains,
officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The protest by 2,000 to 3,000 people in Zhenjiang, 180 miles
northwest of Shanghai, began early Wednesday, said an employee of
the Zhenjiang train station. She said the protest lasted seven to
eight hours.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters were upset by the closure of a Zhenjiang company
that attracted unauthorized investments by promising high interest,
the station employee said. She said depositors were unhappy with
repayment terms announced by authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Zhenjiang Public Cooperative refused to give
any information about the company or sums of money involved.
</P>
<P>
   Zhenjiang police said the protest ended peacefully but would not
say whether anyone was arrested or give any details.
</P>
<P>
   The line through Zhenjiang is the major train route in eastern
China, connecting Shanghai with Nanjing, Beijing and other major
cities to the north.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 42 trains were delayed by the protest, said an
employee of the Shanghai Train Station information office.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers were taken off some trains and bused to Nanjing.

<HEADLINE> Audit Looks at AIDS Care  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Blacks and Hispanics with AIDS are getting
inferior care compared with whites who have the disease, government
auditors concluded in an assessment of how government funding on
AIDS programs was spent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Compared with whites, African Americans and Hispanics receive
less appropriate care for their HIV disease,'' said an audit to be
released today by the General Accounting Office, the investigative
arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The audit of funds administered to state and local AIDS service
groups through Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resource Act grants
was requested by Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., a doctor who has treated
patients with AIDS and HIV.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-year-old act, named for the Indiana boy whose battle with
AIDS attracted national attention, provides money for health
clinics treating low-income AIDS patients and for training for
those caring for HIV-infected individuals. It has provided nearly
$8 billion in government funds to AIDS programs. The money goes
primarily to cities with high concentrations of AIDS patients and
to states.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO audit showed that blacks, Hispanics and women were
receiving substandard care when compared to whites when it comes to
doctors' visits, emergency room visits, hospitalizations and drug
therapies.
</P>
<P>
   The findings come as research shows that the AIDS epidemic is
hitting minorities and women hard. Blacks, who make up about 13
percent of the U.S. population, accounted for 49 percent of AIDS
deaths in 1998, according to the Centers for Disease Control.
Thirty-two percent of deaths were among whites and 18 percent were
among Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   More than 23 percent of AIDS diagnoses reported in 1998 were
among women.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn blamed the disparity in care on ''faulty emphasis on AIDS
data in determining funding and priority setting.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ryan White Care Act program does not take into account that
women and minorities account for many new cases of HIV infection
when funding decisions are made, Coburn said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those with HIV, of which women and communities of color are
the fastest growing segments, are currently not counted or
recognized when funding is determined,'' said Coburn in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO audit also found that rural areas may offer more limited
medical and social services than cities because urban areas
generally receive more money per AIDS case.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Flavin, spokesman for the HIV/AIDS Bureau at the Department
of Health and Human Services, which administers the Ryan White Care
Act grants, said he had not seen the GAO final report and could not
comment on the findings.
</P>
<P>
   HHS initiated a new program in 1998, in collaboration with the
Congressional Black Caucus, to help blacks and Hispanics get
services to their communities. Part of the $527 million in Ryan
White CARE Act grants appropriated to AIDS programs this year is
aimed at minority communities.

<HEADLINE> Report: EPA Claims Misleading  </HEADLINE>
By LIBBY QUAID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite an order from Congress to shrink
paperwork, the amount of time that businesses and governments spend
reporting to the Environmental Protection Agency is on the rise,
congressional investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   And EPA officials misled the public with claims to the contrary,
according to a General Accounting Office report obtained Wednesday
by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last week, EPA Administrator Carol Browner told a
House subcommittee the agency had eliminated more than 26 million
hours of paperwork over the past four years, saving industry $800
million.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have here a real disconnect between what the GAO found and
what EPA has represented to us as achievements they've made,'' said
Sen. Christopher Bond, who requested the study and is chairman of
the Senate subcommittee that oversees the EPA's budget. The EPA
made similar assertions in 1999 reports.
</P>
<P>
   Browner was scheduled to testify before Bond's subcommittee
today. Bond, R-Mo., said he intends to have her explain her earlier
statements about paperwork reductions.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO found that despite an order by Congress to cut
paperwork, the amount of time spent reporting to the EPA actually
rose by 10 million hours -- or 9 percent -- between 1995 and 1998.
And it's projected to grow by another 5 million hours by the end of
this fiscal year, Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   EPA spokesman David Cohen defended the agency's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Technically, I think the senator has a point,'' he said of
Bond's remarks. ''But what he's not saying is the good news about
EPA taking burden reduction quite seriously. Compared to where some
of the programs might have been had we not taken action, the
paperwork reduction is significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed the Paperwork Reduction Act on the heels of the
1995 Republican takeover of the House, envisioning a 25 percent,
government-wide reduction in paperwork by the end of fiscal 1998.
The EPA was one of six agencies with an estimated paperwork burden
of 100 million hours or more.
</P>
<P>
   GAO investigators scrutinized areas where EPA said the biggest
reductions occurred. They challenged some, such as EPA's decision
to allow some wastewater facilities with good histories to report
less frequently, which the agency estimated reduced paperwork by
4.7 million hours.
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials who oversee that area told investigators the
change produced ''significantly less'' reduction, although they
could not say precisely how much.
</P>
<P>
   EPA also claimed credit for major reductions when it corrected
mistakes in earlier estimates of paperwork hours, even though
nothing had changed for those filling out the forms.
</P>
<P>
   ''EPA's revisions of agency paperwork estimates had no real
impact on the burden being borne by the public,'' the GAO report
said. ''The underlying reporting and recordkeeping requirements did
not change, only EPA's method of measuring their effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Sullivan, executive director of the National Federation of
Independent Business Legal Foundation, said businesses with between
20 and 50 workers typically spend 19 cents of every dollar on
regulatory costs.
</P>
<P>
   The intent of the 1995 law was to force agencies to consider
less burdensome alternatives, so ''when you have a report that says
EPA's paperwork burden is going up, then that shows EPA is ignoring
the intent of the law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bond, who also chairs the Senate Small Business Committee, said
federal paperwork is particularly burdensome on small businesses
and local communities ''who continue to tell us they are drowning
in paperwork.''

<HEADLINE> Disaster Area Examined in Florida  </HEADLINE>
By NIALA BOODHOO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOMESTEAD, Fla. (AP) -- Visiting a bulldozed lime grove, U.S.
Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman got a firsthand look at the
lethal effect of a nasty little import: the canker.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman declared four devastated south Florida counties
agricultural disaster areas on Wednesday, allowing farmers to apply
for emergency, low-cost loans.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a monumental problem,'' Glickman said after watching
farmers set fire to an infected lime tree. ''The issue is
non-native, invasive species, and whether we have the resources to
deal with this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Glickman, who is touring the country to inspect problems caused
by foreign pests, was scheduled to tour an inspection facility
south of San Diego today. He plans to visit the Port of Long Beach,
Calif., the nation's busiest cargo container port, on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   South Florida's $20 million lime industry has already lost more
than half of its crop to the canker, which entered the United
States from an unidentified foreign country.
</P>
<P>
   The state has waged a constant fight with different strains of
the canker for decades. This particular strain was discovered near
Miami's airport in 1995, and spread quickly after Hurricane Irene
last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The canker has thus far affected mainly lime trees, although
officials fear it could affect Florida's northern citrus crops, an
$8 billion industry of mainly oranges and grapefruit.
</P>
<P>
   In hopes of containing the disease, officials have already
burned at least 500,000 trees in citrus groves and back yards in a
70-mile swath from Homestead to Boca Raton, and expect to destroy
another 500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The price tag of the eradication was estimated at $175 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our nightmare is that they that miss one tree, and after
another tropical storm or hurricane it starts all over again,''
Homestead farmer Mark Philcox told Glickman.

<HEADLINE> $508M Awarded in Gender Suit  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government has agreed to pay $508
million to 1,100 women to settle the largest federal sex
discrimination case since the Civil Rights Act was signed into law
in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement reached Wednesday, which still requires approval
from a federal judge, would settle a 23-year-old complaint by women
who said they were denied jobs with the U.S. Information Agency and
its broadcast arm, the Voice of America, because of their gender.
</P>
<P>
   The now-defunct agency, which was absorbed by the State
Department in October, was responsible for disseminating U.S.
government news and information overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ''The message has to be sent to the United States government, to
employers in this country and to employers around the world: The
cost of discrimination is high. If you compound that with delay,
the cost of discrimination is enormous,'' said Bruce Fredrickson,
the women's lead attorney.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $508 million that must be paid to the women --
approximately $450,000 apiece before taxes -- the government must
give them nearly $23 million in back pay and interest and pay their
attorneys' fees. Those fees will be at least $12 million, because
the lawyers intend to bill the government for approximately 90,000
hours of work over the 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said this was the largest sex
discrimination case, although there have been larger settlements
involving other forms of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Government lawyers decided to settle to save money, after many
years of insisting on trying each individual case in the courts,
even though the suit had been certified as a class-action case.
</P>
<P>
   They already had lost 46 of the 48 cases that had gone to trial,
with each woman winning about $500,000. Those 46 will share in
Wednesday's settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ''We took into account the prior court decisions of the trial
and appellate courts ..., the results of the individual class
members' hearings that had been conducted to date, as well as our
independent projections of the likely results of the remaining
hearings in the absence of a settlement,'' said Wilma A. Lewis,
U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, the government was found guilty of sex discrimination
in U.S. District Court in Washington. Since then, the government
filed and lost two appeals and was denied a hearing by the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   The women applied for jobs as international radio broadcasters,
radio broadcast or electronic technicians, writers and editors, and
production specialists at the agency and the Voice of America
between Oct. 8, 1974 and Nov. 16, 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the women denied jobs had been experienced broadcasters
from national and international news outlets, qualified writers and
reporters, or experienced technicians and producers for network

<HEADLINE> Report: U.S. Missiles Replaced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Hundreds of Patriot missiles in the Mideast and
South Korea had to be quickly replaced by the Army after tests
found potential flaws in the weapons system, The Wall Street
Journal reported today.
</P>
<P>
   ''A significant number of failures were found'' during testing
and the decision was made to replace all ''suspect missiles,'' said
Lt. Gen. Paul Kern, a top acquisition officer for the Army.
</P>
<P>
   The number of withdrawn missiles remains classified, but the
missiles were pulled over the past 10 days from approximately 11
batteries protecting U.S. forces in South Korea, Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia, the newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
   A typical battery has about 64 missiles, and unidentified
officials told the Journal that the number pulled was certainly in
the hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   The part of the system that appears most vulnerable is a radio
frequency downlink that allows the missile to communicate with
radar guiding its flight, the Journal reported.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. allies, which also rely on the Patriot system, have been
informed of the problem. The issue is of particular concern to
Israel, which, like the United States, tends to keep more of its
Patriot launchers on full alert, the Journal said.
</P>
<P>
   Kern said engineers were working on the problem, but he did not
know how long it would take to find a solution. Dave Shea, a
spokesman for Raytheon Co., the missile manufacturer, said the
company is working with the Army to identify and resolve the
problem.

<HEADLINE> Agreement reached on allocating Nazi labor compensation fund  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Negotiators agreed today on how to allocate the
money from a $5 billion fund to compensate Nazi-era slave and
forced laborers, resolving the last major point of contention after
months of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement would allocate $4 billion for compensating slave
and forced labor victims and another $500 million to cover claims
for property, bank accounts and insurance policies stolen by the
Nazis as well as ''humanitarian cases,'' said Deputy Treasury
Secretary Stuart Eizenstat, the U.S. government envoy to the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of how many people could benefit range from 800,000 to
2.3 million. Most are non-Jews from Eastern Europe who had been
left out of previous compensation efforts because they were behind
the Iron Curtain.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, slave laborers -- those who were put to work in
concentration camps and expected to die doing their jobs -- would
receive up to $7,500 each. Forced laborers, who worked in factories
outside camps, would get up to $2,500 each.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have taken a huge step forward today,'' Eizenstat said.
''This brings this process a substantial step closer to
completion.''
</P>
<P>
   Another $350 million will be used for a foundation to sponsor
research and educational projects around the theme of Nazi labor,
with the remainder going for administrative costs and legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   All sides agreed in December on the size of the fund, to be
financed half by the German government and half by industry. But
negotiators had been wrangling over how to divide the money among
the various groups to be covered.
</P>
<P>
   Eastern European countries had been pushing to get the most
money possible to cover victims of the Nazi labor practices, while
German industry insisted that the foundation for future projects
was an integral part of the effort. Jewish groups had wanted to
make sure an appropriate amount was allocated for property claims.
</P>
<P>
   Eizenstat said it was now up to the German government to enact
legislation creating the foundation. He emphasized that it must
conform exactly to the principles agreed to in the talks if German
businesses are to get the legal relief they are seeking.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it does not incorporate the substance of the agreements
reached here, it will not be deemed to be sufficient basis for
dismissal of the lawsuits or for the U.S. to act in support of that
goal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In any case brought against German companies in U.S. courts, the
U.S. government has agreed to send a letter of support stating its
position that all Nazi-era related claims should be referred to the
fund.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's Cabinet approved a
bill to set up the fund and hopes to have it enacted before
parliament's summer break.
</P>
<P>
   But Gideon Taylor, executive vice president of the Jewish Claims
Conference, said some technical questions remained to be resolved
in the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor declined to speculate when payments might actually begin
to victims. German officials have said they want them to start this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Germany has paid about $60 billion under other compensation for
Nazi-era wrongs since World War II.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF: TB Threatens Asian Economy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Tuberculosis poses a serious threat to
Asia's sustained socioeconomic development, the United Nations
Children's Fund said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued ahead of World TB Day on Friday, UNICEF
said that Asia accounts for about 70 percent of all TB cases. It
said that each year there are 8 million new cases of TB and an
estimated 2 million people die of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The spread of tuberculosis -- an opportunistic disease which
afflicts especially weakened persons -- has been abetted by the
spread of HIV/AIDS, which has hit Asia hard. TB itself is a
bacterial infection that spreads through the air when an infected
person coughs, spits or sneezes, and which usually affects the
lungs.
</P>
<P>
   ''People whose immune systems have been weakened by HIV/AIDS
face a 30 times greater risk of developing the disease,'' UNICEF
said. ''Approximately 40 percent of people with HIV/AIDS also
develop TB, and in many countries TB is also the leading cause of
death for HIV/AIDS-infected people.''
</P>
<P>
   A separate U.N. agency dealing with AIDS, UNAIDS, noted that TB
hinders development because it frequently hits society's most
economically active sector, those between the ages of 15 and 54.
</P>
<P>
   The director of UNICEF's East Asia and Pacific office in
Bangkok, Kul C. Gautam, was quoted as saying that TB kills 750,000
women each year, more than any other infectious disease.
</P>
<P>
   ''The deep stigma of TB often results in women being ostracized
by their families and communities, which in turn has a devastating
impact on the well-being of their children, families and society in
general,'' Gautam said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that effective treatments are possible, and some Asian
nations, even poorer ones, have been trying to implement them.
</P>
<P>
   ''The remaining challenge is to mobilize sufficient political
will to attack TB and to build a social partnership that includes
governments, the business and private sectors, concerned
institutions, NGOs ,and communities and families,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Army Replaces Hundreds of Missiles  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army has replaced hundreds of Patriot
missiles in the Mideast and South Korea after discovering a pattern
of technical glitches in the air defense weapon system, the
Pentagon said today.
</P>
<P>
   Rear Adm. Craig Quigley, a Pentagon spokesman, confirmed a
report in today's editions of The Wall Street Journal that the
flawed missiles have been swapped out with newer ones. Quigley said
technical experts at the Army's Redstone Arsenal in Alabama are
attempting to determine the cause of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal quoted Army Lt. Gen. Paul Kern, a senior acquisition
officer in the Pentagon, as saying the decision to quickly replace
the suspect missiles was made after ''a significant number of
failures were found'' during testing.
</P>
<P>
   The number of withdrawn missiles is classified but they were
pulled over the past 10 days from approximately 11 batteries
protecting U.S. forces in South Korea, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, the
Journal reported. Each battery has about 64 missiles, and Pentagon
officials today said the number pulled was in the hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriot is used to defend against aircraft and short-range
ballistic missiles at medium and high altitudes. An upgraded
version, called the PAC-3, is being developed to provide a greater
capability against short-range missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The part of the system that appears most vulnerable is a radio
frequency downlink that allows the missile to communicate with
radar guiding its flight. Quigley said it was possible -- though not
yet confirmed -- that the problem could be a result of aging. He
said the problem was detected in Patriot batteries that are kept
powered up constantly on full alert, but not in those in a lower
state of readiness.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. allies such as Israel which operate their own Patriot
missile batteries have been informed of the problem, Quigley said.
The issue is of particular concern to Israel, which, like the
United States, tends to keep more of its Patriot launchers on full
alert.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal quoted Kern as saying he did not know how long it
would take to find a solution. Dave Shea, a spokesman for Raytheon
Co., the missile manufacturer, said the company is working with the
Army to identify and resolve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots have been sold to Germany, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, the
Netherlands and Saudi Arabia.

<HEADLINE> Report: Minorities Slighted on Care  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Blacks and Hispanics with AIDS are getting
inferior care compared with whites who have the disease, government
auditors concluded in an assessment of how government funding on
AIDS programs was spent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Compared with whites, African Americans and Hispanics receive
less appropriate care for their HIV disease,'' said an audit
released today by the General Accounting Office, the investigative
arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO said that blacks, Hispanics and women with AIDS make up
the vast majority of people served by local AIDS groups funded by a
government program.
</P>
<P>
   But a congressman who requested the audit said that substandard
care for minorities and women is a result of the federal
government's emphasis on distributing funds based on the number of
full-blown AIDS cases, instead of on the number of HIV-infected
people.
</P>
<P>
   ''The resource dollars are going in the wrong direction,'' said
Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., who released the GAO audit of funds
administered to state and local AIDS service groups through Ryan
White Comprehensive AIDS Resource Act grants.
</P>
<P>
   Coburn said more federal dollars should be directed towards
prevention, which accounted for less than 10 percent of the $10
billion in federal AIDS spending last year, according to the GAO.
</P>
<P>
   About 300,000 people in the United States have AIDS. Hundreds of
thousands are HIV-infected.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-year-old Ryan White program, named for the Indiana boy
whose battle with AIDS attracted national attention, provides money
for health clinics treating low-income AIDS patients and for
training for those caring for HIV-infected individuals. It has
provided nearly $8 billion in government funds to AIDS programs.
The money goes primarily to cities with high concentrations of AIDS
patients and to states.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO audit cited a 1999 national study of HIV-infected people
that showed blacks, Hispanics and women were receiving substandard
care when compared to whites when it comes to doctors' visits,
emergency room visits, hospitalizations and drug therapies.
</P>
<P>
   The findings come as research shows that the AIDS epidemic is
hitting minorities and women hard. Blacks, who make up about 13
percent of the U.S. population, accounted for 49 percent of AIDS
deaths in 1998, according to the Centers for Disease Control.
Thirty-two percent of deaths were among whites and 18 percent were
among Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   More than 23 percent of AIDS diagnoses reported in 1998 were
among women.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO audit also found that rural areas may offer more limited
medical and social services than cities because urban areas
generally receive more money per AIDS case.
</P>
<P>
   The Ryan White program provided $3,081 for every person living
with AIDS in Atlanta in 1997. In contrast, funding for people with
AIDS living in Virginia was $1,723, the audit showed.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Health and Human Services, which administers
the Ryan White Care Act grants, agreed with most aspects of the GAO
report, the audit said.

<HEADLINE> EPA Paperwork Claims 'Misleading'  </HEADLINE>
By LIBBY QUAID, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite an order from Congress to shrink
paperwork, the amount of time that businesses and governments spend
reporting to the Environmental Protection Agency is on the rise,
congressional investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   And EPA officials misled the public with claims to the contrary,
according to a General Accounting Office report.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last week, EPA Administrator Carol Browner told a
House subcommittee the agency had eliminated more than 26 million
hours of paperwork over the past four years, saving industry $800
million.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Christopher Bond, who requested the GAO study and is
chairman of the Senate subcommittee that oversees the EPA's budget,
said at a hearing today, ''This whole reinvention effort is
beginning to look like an effort to reinvent the facts. Only in
Washington would an agency confuse a goal with an accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond, R-Mo., asked for an explanation of Browner's earlier
statements about paperwork reductions as she testified before his
subcommittee today.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO found that despite an order by Congress to cut
paperwork, the amount of time spent reporting to the EPA actually
rose by 10 million hours -- or 9 percent -- between 1995 and 1998.
And it's projected to grow by another 5 million hours by the end of
this fiscal year, Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Browner said EPA must aggressively set new public health and
environmental standards that require polluting industries to report
to the agency. She also said that making more information public is
another goal.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the same time we are streamlining existing programs, we
have been expanding other programs. That is our job,'' Browner
said.
</P>
<P>
   EPA spokesman David Cohen defended the agency's efforts on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Technically, I think the senator has a point,'' he said of
Bond's remarks. ''But what he's not saying is the good news about
EPA taking burden reduction quite seriously. Compared to where some
of the programs might have been had we not taken action, the
paperwork reduction is significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed the Paperwork Reduction Act on the heels of the
1995 Republican takeover of the House, envisioning a 25 percent,
government-wide reduction in paperwork by the end of fiscal 1998.
The EPA was one of six agencies with an estimated paperwork burden
of 100 million hours or more.
</P>
<P>
   GAO investigators scrutinized areas where EPA said the biggest
reductions occurred. They challenged some, such as EPA's decision
to allow some wastewater facilities with good histories to report
less frequently, which the agency estimated reduced paperwork by
4.7 million hours.
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials who oversee that area told investigators the
change produced ''significantly less'' reduction, although they
could not say precisely how much.
</P>
<P>
   EPA also claimed credit for major reductions when it corrected
mistakes in earlier estimates of paperwork hours, even though
nothing had changed for those filling out the forms.
</P>
<P>
   ''EPA's revisions of agency paperwork estimates had no real
impact on the burden being borne by the public,'' the GAO report
said. ''The underlying reporting and recordkeeping requirements did
not change, only EPA's method of measuring their effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Sullivan, executive director of the National Federation of
Independent Business Legal Foundation, said businesses with between
20 and 50 workers typically spend 19 cents of every dollar on
regulatory costs.
</P>
<P>
   The intent of the 1995 law was to force agencies to consider
less burdensome alternatives, so ''when you have a report that says
EPA's paperwork burden is going up, then that shows EPA is ignoring
the intent of the law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bond, who also chairs the Senate Small Business Committee, said
federal paperwork is particularly burdensome on small businesses
and local communities ''who continue to tell us they are drowning
in paperwork.''

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's reaction to the latest
police shooting of an unarmed black man ''is not just meanness,
it's mental,'' the Rev. Jesse Jackson said today.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's something that is not well about his response to
unarmed people being shot by police,'' Jackson said. ''This
consistent reaction for the police who shoot unarmed people before
even asking for information, without showing sympathy to the
victims ... that sounds like a disturbed person.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's an ugly consistency, and people are beginning to see
that Mr. Giuliani's reaction to these things is not just meanness,
it's mental,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate response from Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's comments, after addressing students at Martin Luther
King Jr. High School in Manhattan, followed by a day similar
comments from an array of critics including Hillary Rodham Clinton,
his opponent in the race for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady said Wednesday that the mayor's actions after
last week's police killing of Patrick Dorismond -- releasing the
victim's sealed juvenile record and his girlfriend's complaint that
he'd hit her -- ''have aggravated tensions in the city and have
helped drive a wedge between the police and the communities they
serve.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Giuliani had ''basically written off'' New York City's
black residents when he said he felt no responsibility to reach out
to the community after the killing.
</P>
<P>
   ''What does that say about how people would be represented by
him?'' she asked. Instead of trying to ease tensions, she said,
Giuliani ''has lashed out at Patrick Dorismond, (Assembly) Speaker
(Sheldon) Silver, at the media, at the Justice Department and at
me.''
</P>
<P>
   NAACP President Kweisi Mfume echoed Clinton's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rather than trying to demonize Patrick Dorismond, an unarmed
Haitian American killed during a police encounter, Giuliani should
be reviewing police training standards to see what steps the
department can take to avoid the unnecessary use of lethal force,''
Mfume said.
</P>
<P>
   In Albany, state Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a black Democrat,
called on Gov. George Pataki to appoint a commission to study the
New York Police Department's use of street crime units, deadly
force and racial profiling, plus its recruitment of minorities.
</P>
<P>
   He said Giuliani apparently believes ''you put out a fire by
throwing gasoline on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to Clinton's remarks, the mayor's campaign spokesman,
Bruce Teitelbaum, said, ''It sounds like Mrs. Clinton is still
reading off the same script prepared by (black activist) Al
Sharpton.''
</P>
<P>
   Statewide polls on the Senate race have routinely shown the
Republican mayor getting less than 10 percent of the black vote,
while Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, gets more than 80
percent.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the mayor was asked if he felt any responsibility to
talk or meet with black people after the third fatal shooting of an
unarmed black man in 13 months.
</P>
<P>
   ''No, I don't think so,'' he said. ''I think this is a situation
that clearly had nothing to do with race. The three police officers
were Hispanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the mayor has an ''enormous trust chasm'' and ''has
presented a false choice to New Yorkers.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not necessary to choose between effective policing and
respectful policing,'' she said. ''It is not necessary to give up
trust and good relations between the police and the communities
they serve in the pursuit of lowering the crime rate.''

   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- ''I don't want to see us separate,'' said
the Rev. Robert Edgar, new general secretary of the National
Council of Churches, as he opposed a bid by the council's
international welfare agency, Church World Service (CWS), to take
control of its own finances. Contributions to the welfare arm
amount to 88 percent of council income.
</P>
<P>
   The council and its CWS unit are both supported by 35 member
denominations with 100,000 local congregations. Edgar, who assumed
leadership of the council in January, spoke last week to delegates
at a Portland meeting of the committee that governs CWS.
</P>
<P>
   The governing committee decided last year that CWS should seek
to manage its own finances. Later, the council asked CWS to pay a
special assessment of $1.4 million to help meet a council deficit
of $4 million for 1999; it also raised the fee it is charging CWS
this year for administrative services.
</P>
<P>
   After Edgar's talk, a delegate from the American Baptist
Churches, Bucky Sydney, complained that the council, ''which has
bungled finances for 25 years, gets it wrong and every time we have
to ante up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Patrick Mauney, an Episcopal Church executive who
chairs the governing committee, said, ''I'm heartened that we're
addressing the issue head on.''
</P>
<P>
   Edgar and CWS officials will resume talks on the issue April 20.

Incorporation papers quietly filed for rival Baptist denomination
</P>
<P>
   TYLER, Texas (AP) -- Four Baptist leaders have taken the first
legal step toward a new denomination to rival the Southern Baptist
Convention, the largest U.S. Protestant body.
</P>
<P>
   The founding board members say they incorporated and registered
the name ''Baptist Convention of the Americas'' with the Texas
secretary of state in 1998 in case such an entity is needed, but
acted quietly to prevent further discord among Southern Baptists.
</P>
<P>
   One founder, local pastor Paul Powell, told the Tyler Morning
Telegraph that the likelihood of a breakaway denomination increases
as strife continues between the Baptists' conservative and moderate
factions. His colleagues are on the moderate side.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sure looks like we're headed in that direction,'' said
Powell. ''We know the gap is widening between the two. Everything
that happens kind of accentuates that.'' He added that ''mad,
narrow-minded and fundamentalist'' Baptists ''are not my kind of
Baptists.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell formerly led the denomination's pension board. The other
founders are Houston businessman John F. Baugh; Baylor University
Chancellor Herbert Reynolds; and the Rev. W. Winfred Moore, who
teaches religion at Baylor.

New Jersey school district adds a second Muslim holiday
</P>
<P>
   PATERSON, N.J. (AP) -- The Paterson school district, the first in
the state to close for a Muslim holiday, added a second day off
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Paterson schools previously closed for the feast marking the end
of Ramadan, the month of fasting. This year the school district
added a day off March 17 for Eid al-Adha, the worldwide festival
marking the end of the pilgrimage to Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   No other district in New Jersey closes for any Islamic holiday,
said a spokesman for the New Jersey School Boards Association.
</P>
<P>
   Muslims comprise 21,000 of 150,000 Paterson residents and about
3,700 school-age children.

Orthodox-Lutheran dialogue urges common Easter date
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A panel representing the Evangelical Lutheran
Church in America and U.S. Eastern Orthodox churches has endorsed a
call to have all Christians mark Easter on the same date.
</P>
<P>
   Christianity's eastern and western branches often follow
different dates. For instance, this year western Easter is April 23
and Orthodox Easter is April 30.
</P>
<P>
   Easter is the Sunday following the first full moon after the
spring equinox, but eastern and western Christians use different
calculations.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in a 1997 meeting in Aleppo, Syria, sponsored by
the World Council of Churches, proposed joint acceptance of modern
astronomical calculations taken from the meridian of Jerusalem,
starting in 2001 when both eastern and western Easters fall on
April 15.

Orthodox Jews offer women graduate training in Talmud
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Yeshiva University has launched a graduate
program in Orthodox-oriented study of Talmud and Torah for women,
said to be the first university-based program of its kind in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The two-year program for up to 10 women will lead to a
certificate, but students have the option of simultaneously earning
master's degrees tuition-free at the university's graduate school
of Jewish education.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Ephraim Kanarfogel, who will direct the new program,
said it ''will enable an elite cadre of women to be better prepared
to be leaders in Jewish scholarship.''
</P>
<P>
   He stressed that the training is not analogous to rabbinic
ordination, which Orthodoxy does not allow for women.

Major Muslim groups offer help to imam arrested in shootout
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Four U.S. Muslim organizations that urged
fugitive Imam Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin to surrender to authorities
announced after his arrest that they would offer legal help and
monitor his trial.
</P>
<P>
   The imam, known as civil rights militant H. Rap Brown before his
conversion, is charged with fatally shooting one sheriff's deputy
and wounding another as they tried to serve an arrest warrant in
Atlanta for theft and impersonating an officer.
</P>
<P>
   The American Muslim Council, Council on American-Islamic
Relations, Islamic Society of North America and Muslim American
Society said they were not prejudging the case but noted Al-Amin's
''longstanding role as a community leader who had a positive impact
on the lives of so many people.''
</P>
<P>
   The groups said the charges were ''inconsistent with what is
known of his moral character and past behavior as a Muslim.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin's group is recognized as a member of the Islamic Shura
Council that issues orthodox religious rulings, along with the
Islamic Society of North America and Muslim American Society.

Episcopalians cancel consecration of new bishop
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- The Atlanta diocese of the Episcopal Church
canceled the consecration of its new bishop on short notice, citing
''very recent discoveries of lack of disclosure in personal
financial and family matters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Journal-Constitution said the Rev. Robert Trache and
his wife filed for personal bankruptcy in a Virginia federal court
Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Richard Callaway, head of the diocesan standing
committee, told the newspaper the issue was not so much the
couple's problems as ''how they handled the decisions they made and
how they were disclosed to the body of the faithful.''
</P>
<P>
   Trache was in Atlanta when the cancellation occurred but issued
no comment.
</P>
<P>
   The priest, who was also a candidate for bishop of Michigan last
year, was formerly rector of St. James' Episcopal Church in
Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Episcopal News Service said Trache would not be returning to the
Richmond parish, which has already begun the search process for a
new rector.

<HEADLINE> Religion Today  </HEADLINE>
By JULIA LIEBLICH, AP Religion Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAIFA, Israel (AP) -- While Pope John Paul II pleads for
religious harmony in the Holy Land, 17 cloistered nuns on Mount
Carmel quietly pray for their Jewish neighbors. Not to win souls
for Christendom. These nuns want Jews to be Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can you be a servant in Israel if you speak about
conversion?'' says Sister Angela del Bono, mother superior of the
Monastery of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, in a rare interview from
behind a metal grille in the parlor of a sprawling granite convent.
</P>
<P>
   She pounds her hand on her forehead beneath a veil. ''Imagine
someone coming in here and telling me to become an Adventist or a
Muslim,'' she says, smiling at her own fervor.
</P>
<P>
   The Carmelites will not see the pope in their country. They
leave the cloister only in emergencies. Every day one nun listens
to the radio and reports news to the others.
</P>
<P>
   When del Bono learned that the pontiff was going to the Western
Wall while in Jerusalem, she saw it as a profound message of hope
for Christian-Jewish understanding. This theme of the papal visit
is the life work of her sisters. It's a rare calling within a rarer
one: Christians praying for Jews within the confines of a cloister.
In an age of action, the nuns are devoted to contemplation and to
the belief that prayer can bring about real change in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''We pray that Jews remain true to their covenant,'' says del
Bono, 68, holding a thick wool sweater tightly around her
floor-length brown habit in the unheated convent.
</P>
<P>
   ''We pray that people come to the full revelation of God... If
they are good Jews and we are good Christians this is already glory
to God without forcing anyone to change,'' the native Italian nun
says, speaking in English. ''We pray for all to be happy and be
righteous in front of God. Each man can go to heaven --Jews,
Catholics, Muslims, Zulus -- if they are ... of goodwill. If they
feel godly, if they follow their own conscience, they will go to
heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Her community was founded in 1892 by two nuns from the Carmelite
monastery in Avignon, France, with the help of twin brothers,
Joseph and Augustin Lemann, Jewish converts who had become priests.
The brothers, according to the nuns' history, were taken with the
idea of Carmelite nuns living on Mount Carmel, where the the Bible
(I Kings 18) says God sent fire and rain when the Israelite prophet
Elijah prayed to him, after 450 pagan prophets of Baal had failed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1895, Pope Leo XIII gave the nuns two prayer intentions: to
pray for the land of Israel and the reconciliation of hearts.
</P>
<P>
   A former mother superior told del Bono that she thought the
early sisters on Mount Carmel prayed for the conversion to Jews.
''It's incredible to think of this,'' del Bono says. She is not
sure when the mission changed.
</P>
<P>
   But Nostra Aetate, a 1965 papal declaration of a new theological
approach to Jews and Judaism that rejected anti-Semitism, had a
strong impact on Catholics. And by the time del Bono arrived in
1968, there was no talk of winning converts.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the nuns pray communally seven times a day and spend two
hours in private prayer. They devote the rest of the day to the
community's work of making rosaries and cards of pressed flowers.
</P>
<P>
   They spend most of the day in silence.
</P>
<P>
   Even in their solitude, however, Carmelite nuns have had their
share of controversy surrounding Catholic-Jewish relations. When a
group of Carmelite nuns started a convent at Auschwitz in 1984,
Jews protested until the nuns left.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think (the nuns) wanted to provoke hate,'' del Bono
says. ''They were remembering the suffering.'' But given the
controversy, she says, she supported their leaving.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican's 1998 canonization of Edith Stein, a Jewish-born
Carmelite nun who was killed in Auschwitz, brought Jewish charges
that who felt the Catholic church was laying claim to a martyr who
died because of her Jewish heritage.
</P>
<P>
   The Carmelites celebrated, she says. ''We thought: 'What a joy.
What an honor.' But some Jews thought: 'Why is the Catholic Church
taking our Edith Stein?'''
</P>
<P>
   Del Bono says she has no problems with conversion to
Christianity if it is chosen freely and after much thought. ''Edith
Stein had a long history before becoming a Catholic.'' she says.
Such choices, del Bono says, are a mystery to be respected. ''Each
soul is a mystery only God can see.''
</P>
<P>
   Catholics who hold on to old attitudes about Jews, she says,
would not appreciate her community's mission. And the nuns'
vocation is often misunderstood by both Catholics and Jews who see
the contemplative life as escapist.
</P>
<P>
   A Jewish student who visited the monastery told her she was
''going against the laws of God by choosing celibacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Bono laughs. ''I told her: 'I am the spiritual mother of
many.'''
</P>
<P>
   As mother superior of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, she is paying
special attention to the children of Israel during the papal visit.
She prays that the trip will lead to greater understanding between
the world's religions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We pray for peace,'' she says. ''Peace is the point.''
</P>
<P>
   ''People ask me: 'How do you feel when you pray and there is no
peace?' I say, 'Imagine what it would be like if no one were
praying.'''

<HEADLINE> Stepfather shoots himself on roof after teen's remains found  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DIX HILLS, N.Y. (AP) -- A Long Island family's tragedy doubled
when a man allegedly butchered his stepson, scrawled an anti-black,
anti-gay slur on the remains, then killed himself during a police
standoff.
</P>
<P>
   John Fenrich Jr., 36, committed suicide Wednesday, a day after
police told him that remains found in a Queens park were believed
to be those of his 19-year-old stepson, Steen Keith Fenrich.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday, Fenrich had called a local cable news station
and said his stepson's dismembered body had been found; but
investigators had not told him the body was dismembered, police
sources told The Associated Press, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   A skull, foot and pulverized bone fragments were found by a
passerby Tuesday afternoon in a plastic container in Alley Pond
Park in Bayside, Queens. The teen-ager's Social Security number was
scrawled on the skull, along with a racial epithet and derogatory
term for homosexuals, the sources said. Steen's mother, Wanda, is
black. John Fenrich was white.
</P>
<P>
   Police sources said today that the flesh from the bones had
either been boiled off or burned off with acid.
</P>
<P>
   Police downplayed a published report that, during hours of
negotiations, Fenrich confessed to killing his stepson because
Steen Fenrich was gay.
</P>
<P>
   After the stepfather, a self-employed carpenter, called News12
Long Island, the station called police to report that Fenrich was
considering suicide. News12 did not air the contents of the
conversation and would not confirm that Fenrich had mentioned body
parts.
</P>
<P>
   Suffolk police arrived at Fenrich's house in Dix Hills at 5:20
a.m. An hour later, Fenrich climbed onto his roof holding a handgun
and a high-powered rifle and fired several shots into the air.
</P>
<P>
   Fenrich's wife and 15-year-old son left the brown-shingled
split-level home a short time later. Neighbors were told to stay in
their basements while hostage negotiators tried to talk him down.
The elder Fenrich's brother, a sergeant in the New York Police
Department, was at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   One neighbor who refused to be identified said Fenrich told the
cops: ''Shoot me! Shoot me! What are you waiting for?''
</P>
<P>
   Another neighbor, who also would not give her name, said she
heard him telling police, ''I'm a failure as a father.''
</P>
<P>
   At 1:25 p.m., Fenrich put a gun to his head, pulled the trigger
and fell to the ground. He was pronounced dead at Good Samaritan
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ''He reached for the gun after someone screamed something from
the ground, then the shot went off,'' said Bill Paden, 25, who
lives across the street. ''He was just sitting there for most of
the morning and then it just got crazy the last 10 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Fenrich and his wife had a checkered past. According to court
records, they were indicted in 1998 in a bizarre scheme that
involved bilking insurance companies out of hundreds of thousands
of dollars. The Fenriches were charged with filing false claims
based on self-inflicted injuries, including staged car accidents
and phony slip-and-falls.
</P>
<P>
   In one claim submitted in 1998, John Fenrich said a son -- not
named -- was hit by a motorist while riding a bike. Fenrich also
claimed he lost his pinkie in a 1995 car accident; an investigator
found evidence the finger had been amputated years earlier, the
papers said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fenriches were out on bail while negotiating a plea bargain
in the case, according to Mrs. Fenrich's attorney, Steven Keats.
</P>
<P>
   Shari Lawrence, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Army Personnel
Command, said available records showed Steen Keith Fenrich, the
stepson, joined the Army in July 1997, went through basic training
at Fort Jackson, S.C., and was later trained as a food service
specialist. He was discharged after nine months, but the reason and
his status at the time were not publicly released, Lawrence said.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor, Ray Saper, said he ran into Steen Fenrich four
months ago and learned he had gotten his own apartment in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was just a very nice guy.... He was always jogging or
in-line skating through the neighborhood,'' said Karina Wahee, 21,
a neighbor who graduated a year ahead of Steen from Half Hollow
Hills East High School. ''When I heard, I thought, 'No, it just
can't be them.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Fenrich home, surrounded by trees, is in a mixed
neighborhood of middle-class homes, million-dollar mansions,
brand-new developments and wooded lots.
</P>
<P>
   The rifle could still be seen lying on the roof near several
skylights late Wednesday afternoon.

   The Kentucky Supreme Court ruled there is no difference and said

   Harrelson planted four hemp seeds in 1996, knowing he would be
arrested so he could challenge the law outlawing possession of any
part of the cannabis plant.
</P>
<P>
   Through three different courts, the star of ''Natural Born
Killers'' and ''The People vs. Larry Flynt'' has argued the statute
is unconstitutional because it does not distinguish between
marijuana and hemp, which contains only minute amounts of the
substance that makes marijuana smokers high, tetrahydrocannabinol
or THC.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mere fact that hemp may contain less THC than marijuana is
of no consequence,'' Justice Donald Wintersheimer wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The state Supreme Court said Harrelson should be making his
argument in the General Assembly, not the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson's trial for possession of marijuana, a misdemeanor
that carries a potential fine and little possibility for jail time,
has been put off pending his appeals. After one earlier hearing on
his case, Harrelson said he was prepared to stand trial to continue
his fight.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Tom Jones and Harrelson's attorneys in Lexington,
Ky., did not immediately return calls seeking comment today.
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson has invested in a hemp clothing company, and he touts
hemp's potential for saving America's last old-growth trees. He has
argued that if paper manufacturers used hemp instead of trees to
make paper, there would be no need to cut down the nation's
forests.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky is an ideal battleground for hemp advocates because
hemp was once one of the state's leading crops. In the 1800s it was
used to make rope and sails, but anti-drug laws, the availability
of other fibers and the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937 wiped out
production in the United States. However, some farmers did grow
hemp during World War II under federal license.

<HEADLINE> Anthony Edwards Powers 'ER' Success  </HEADLINE>
By BETH HARRIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- Anthony Edwards sinks into cushions in
his trailer on the set of ''ER,'' a light stubble dusting his face.
He's traded his green scrubs for a red wool sweater, rumpled pants
and running shoes.
</P>
<P>
   On this afternoon at soundstage 11 on the Warner Bros. lot, with
his scenes already completed and hardly anyone paying attention,
Edwards is perfectly playing his character, the beleaguered Dr.
Mark Greene, without even trying.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm so sickeningly close to it that I don't know if I separate
so well anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There was the handsome George Clooney, the intense Eriq La
Salle, the doe-faced Noah Wyle, the gritty Julianna Margulies and
the graceful Gloria Reuben. But it has been the low-key Edwards who
has anchored the show, making ''ER'' an NBC juggernaut for the past
six years.
</P>
<P>
   He provides another impressive performance in an episode airing
Thursday at 10 p.m. EST titled ''Under Control,'' in which
everything that could go wrong in the hospital seemingly does. It's
the only original episode airing this month.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are days where the doctors go, 'Oh, why this day? Was it
a full moon or what was it in which so many things just
multiply?''' Edwards said. ''This is an episode where they try to
capture that, 'Oh, no one would ever believe all this would happen
at once.'''
</P>
<P>
   How much is he like Dr. Greene, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   ''What I like about playing Mark Greene is there's a lot of
things about him that I would like to be,'' Edwards said. ''I'd
like to be that committed, to be that good at something.''
</P>
<P>
   His commitment is acting, though don't tell that to him.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I'm committed to doing is pretending,'' he said,
laughing, ''which is very different. It's absolutely what I do for
a living. I'm incredibly lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was only 100 years ago that they didn't allow actors to be
buried in cemeteries. Now people are actually asking us to endorse
them politically. I'm like, 'Come on, you want the seal act to
endorse.' We don't want the clowns telling people how to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Under Control'' will showcase Edwards, a four-time Emmy
nominee for his work on ''ER.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Our show more than any has a really good balance,'' he said.
''It's not a one-character show, so we always are kind of bouncing
around anyway. The frustrating thing is the fact that the networks
are spreading out shows between sweeps periods so we have an
audience that's going to have to watch three or four weeks of
reruns before we get a new show on.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's one of the energies of this episode -- to try and make
sure the audience comes back, that we're not cheating the audience.
The thing that people don't realize is that actors and writers feel
a great affinity and responsibility to the audience. They feel bad
about the fact that everybody has to watch these reruns for three
weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that doing ''Under Control'' was easy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just a lot of work,'' Edwards said. ''It's fun work, but
the challenge is you don't want to let the audience down by being
lost. In that kind of taking them through the journey, your
challenge is to keep it subtle and yet interesting, which is
probably what we should do every episode.''
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, he deflects praise for steering the show to the top
of the Nielsen ratings, where it long reigned until dislodged by
the ABC phenomenon ''Who Wants to be a Millionaire.'' ''ER''
reclaimed the top spot in February with a two-parter killing off
Kellie Martin's character, medical student Lucy Knight.
</P>
<P>
   It's the team that makes the show click, he said, not any one
person.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just a great convergence of really sparse and intense
writing, really good acting,'' Edwards said. ''You see why this
show works because the acting on all the levels, all the different
characters, came together perfectly. (It was) beautifully directed.
</P>
<P>
   ''When our show's great, you can't go, 'It's Tony Edwards or
it's Julianna or it's (executive producer) John Wells. You can't
have a great performance on this show without great writing and
everybody else doing it well. ... That seems to be the tightrope of
'ER' that I like to be around.''
</P>
<P>
   He'd better get used to the tempo. Clooney and Reuben are long
gone and Margulies is next, but Edwards is committed for two more
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   And that's fine with him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would just take one or two horrible prima donna-type actors
to ruin a perfectly good show like this,'' he said. ''We just don't
have them.''

<HEADLINE> Letter Powder Seen As an IRS Threat  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW OTT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OGDEN, Utah (AP) -- Ten people were sent to the hospital after an
employee at the Internal Revenue Service's busiest tax return
processing center opened an envelope containing a blue powder-like
substance.
</P>
<P>
   Three employees who came in close contact with the envelope
Wednesday night appeared to break out in rashes, but IRS
spokeswoman Kim Carlos said it wasn't clear whether that was a
reaction to the powder. All 10 employees examined at the hospital
were released.
</P>
<P>
   The powder was taken to the Dugway Proving Grounds, an Army
chemical and biological weapons testing site in western Utah.
Results of tests on the powder were expected Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The powder was in an envelope within an envelope, in which there
was also a 1040-EZ tax return and a threatening letter. It was
unclear whether the tax return had been filled out or signed or
whether it was bait to get the second envelope opened.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos said about 125 employees were on the night shift when the
envelope was opened in the area where returns are opened and
sorted. She said return-sorting operations were moved to another
part of the building and work continued.
</P>
<P>
   The room remained quarantined Thursday until officials determine
what the blue powder is.
</P>
<P>
   The Ogden IRS Service Center is the nation's largest regional
tax service center. Last year it processed more than 20 million
business and individual tax returns from 14 western states. It
issued 13.3 million refunds totaling more than $21 billion.

<HEADLINE> White House E-Mails Investigated  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department has launched a criminal
inquiry into White House computer breakdowns that made it
impossible to search thousands of incoming e-mails in response to
law enforcement and congressional subpoenas, court papers revealed
today.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, by Justice's campaign fund-raising task
force, will focus on the missing 1996-99 e-mails and allegations
that White House officials threatened contract employees with
retaliation if they revealed the problem, the papers said.
</P>
<P>
   The task force, a House committee and plaintiffs in a civil suit
brought by the conservative legal organization Judicial Watch had
sought e-mails on campaign fund-raising irregularities and other
matters. The task force has been conducting an ongoing
investigation into fundraising.
</P>
<P>
   The papers were filed in the civil action, seeking a delay in
the administration's response on the e-mails so that the case
wouldn't interfere with the criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said last Friday that the computer breakdowns
that prevented the searches were ''entirely unintentional.'' A
former White House contractor has said in court papers that she was
warned not to reveal the e-mail problems.
</P>
<P>
   The contractor, Betty Lambuth, said a subordinate told her some
of the e-mails deal with ''Vice President Al Gore's involvement in
campaign fund-raising controversies'' and ''the sale of Clinton
Commerce Department trade mission seats in exchange for campaign
contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The task force has begun an investigation into whether
subpoenas issued to (the White House) were fully complied with and
whether persons were threatened with retaliation in order to
prevent the existence of the affected e-mails from becoming known
to the task force,'' said a court affidavit by Robert J. Conrad
Jr., chief of the campaign fund-raising prosecution force.
</P>
<P>
   Reconstructing the incoming e-mails from 1996-1999 would involve
a costly and time-consuming undertaking: up to $3 million and up to
two years, White House counsel Beth Nolan wrote Friday to Rep. Dan
Burton, chairman of the House Government Reform Committee.

<HEADLINE> FedEx Net Income Increases 45 Pct.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- FedEx Corp. reported its third-quarter
earnings rose 45 percent although soaring fuel costs raised its
expenses by more than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The overnight delivery company said Thursday its net income came
to $113 million, or 39 cents per share, for the quarter ended Feb.
29, compared to $78 million, or 26 cents per share, in the same
period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The results beat the 34 cents per share in operating earnings
forecast by analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue came to $4.5 billion, up 10 percent from $4.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials cited growth in the company's International
Priority service, where average daily volume increased 14 percent,
for the strong results
</P>
<P>
   Total average daily package volume grew 3 percent at FedEx
Express, the world's largest express transportation company, and 4
percent at FedEx Ground, North America's second-largest provider of
small-package ground delivery service.
</P>
<P>
   The company's overall performance was hurt by both higher fuel
prices and severe winter storms in the United States, said
executive vice president and chief financial officer Alan B. Graf
Jr.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company's revised fuel forecast indicates
fourth-quarter expenses could rise by more than $75 million
compared to last year, but said FedEx expects to offset those
increases with fuel surcharges to its customers.
</P>
<P>
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, FedEx reported
earnings of $443 million, or $1.49 per share, up from $410 million,
or $1.37 per share, a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nine-month revenue came to $11.01 billion, up from $10.33
billion.

<HEADLINE> Couple Who Sued Kmart Awarded $23M  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GASTONIA, N.C. (AP) -- A couple who claimed they were roughed up
by Kmart security guards while exercise-walking behind a store won
a $23 million judgment -- but state law capping punitive damages at
$250,000 will give the retail giant a break.
</P>
<P>
   Dan and Alice Rhyne of Gastonia claimed they were attacked in
1998 while walking a three-mile route around Kmart and other
stores. They said two men, who were not wearing Kmart uniforms and
did not identify themselves as store employees, attacked them
behind the Kmart store.
</P>
<P>
   The Rhynes said when they refused to follow security guard Shawn
Roberts into the store, he put Dan Rhyne in a choke hold until
police arrived. Police arrested them, and the Rhynes sued.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just knew somebody had to believe us, and they came
through,'' said Dan Rhyne, 57. ''It's been a long two years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gastonia County jury found Kmart and Roberts liable for
unlawful detention. The other guard was cleared of liability early
in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Rhynes' lawyer, Bill Moore, said he expects the judge to
reduce the $23 million verdict to the $250,000 allowed by the
state. He said he then will appeal in hopes of getting the state
Supreme Court to overturn the law restricting punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Kmart attorney John Honeycutt Jr. declined to comment.

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs cut in farmers' crop-insurance premiums  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate today overwhelmingly approved
legislation that would sharply reduce the premiums farmers pay for
federally subsidized crop insurance and encourage growers to buy
higher levels of coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which passed 95-5, also would offer coverage for
the first time to livestock producers and expand policies for fruit
and vegetable growers.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, similar to a bill approved by the House last
year, would cost taxpayers $1.5 billion annually over the next four
years. A House-Senate conference committee will work out the
differences between the two bills.
</P>
<P>
   Policies can be purchased to protect farmers from
weather-related losses as well as drops in commodity prices. But
many farmers, especially in the South and East, say the insurance
is too expensive for the coverage it provides.
</P>
<P>
   ''Very few businesses have the economic situation that
agriculture has. Just a little more supply than is necessary will
cause prices to go down,'' said Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said the legislation ''will
provide the security necessary to help farmers through lean years
so that they will be around to experience better prices and
increased revenue in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The government now pays from 13 percent to 57 percent of a
farmer's premium, depending on the level of coverage. Under the
Senate bill, the government's share on most policies would range
from 45 percent to 60 percent. The House bill would have the
government pay from 31 percent to 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the legislation say it could pay for itself, if
sufficient farmers buy coverage to lessen the pressure on Congress
to provide disaster assistance each year. Congress has approved $15
billion in emergency aid over the past two years to compensate
growers for weather-related losses and a slump in commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''Under this legislation, there will be enough incentives for
farmer to participate at high levels that in a future disaster the
need for disaster aid will drop significantly,'' said Ken Ackerman,
administrator of the Agriculture Department's Risk Management
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The program has tripled in size since the early 1990s and covers
about two-thirds of the eligible acreage nationally. The program is
paying farmers some $2.2 billion to cover losses on 1999 crops
caused by drought, hurricane and rain.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to senators earlier this week, the Agriculture
Department said the bill ''represents real progress'' but raised
several concerns about the measure, including a provision that
would reduce USDA's role on a board that oversees the program.
</P>
<P>
   Senators from the Northeast insisted on setting aside $126
million in the legislation to help farmers in their region get the
insurance. Few farmers in the region now buy the coverage,
including only 8 percent of producers in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Although lawmakers from the Plains states have been pushing
hardest for the higher subsidies, the legislation is ''going to
have to be viewed by people all across the country as having
something that's going to benefit them,'' said the chairman of the
House Agriculture Committee, Rep. Larry Combest, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Five Republicans voted against the measure, in addition to
Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi: Thad Cochran of
Mississippi, Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, John McCain of Arizona
and Jon Kyl of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 2559.

<HEADLINE> Cops Say Man Killed Son and Himself  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DIX HILLS, N.Y. (AP) -- A man who fatally shot himself during a
rooftop standoff committed suicide after killing his stepson,
dismembering the body and scrawling racist and anti-gay slurs on
the remains, police said.
</P>
<P>
   John Fenrich Jr., 36, began his siege after telling a TV station
that the dismembered remains of his stepson had been found, even
though investigators never announced the body had been mutilated.
</P>
<P>
   Fenrich called News12 Long Island before dawn Wednesday, saying
he was considering suicide because of his son's slaying. The
station then called police, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, investigators told Fenrich they had found the
remains of 19-year-old Steen Keith Fenrich in a park in the borough
of Queens, New York City Police Detective George Nagy said.
</P>
<P>
   A skull, foot and pulverized bone fragments were found by a
passerby Tuesday afternoon in a plastic container in Alley Pond
Park. Police said Fenrich scrawled his stepson's Social Security
number on the skull, along with racial and homophobic epithets.
Steen's mother, Wanda, is black. The stepfather was white.
</P>
<P>
   After being called by the cable station, police arrived at
Fenrich's split-level home on Long Island. Fenrich climbed onto his
roof holding a handgun and a rifle and fired several shots into the
air.
</P>
<P>
   Fenrich's wife and 15-year-old son left the home a short time
later. Neighbors were told to stay in their basements while police
negotiators tried to talk Fenrich down. His brother, a New York
City police sergeant, also was at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Eight hours into the siege, Fenrich put a gun to his head and
pulled the trigger. He was pronounced dead at a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Fenrich and his wife were indicted in 1998 in an insurance-fraud
scheme in which they were accused of filing false claims based on
self-inflicted injuries and staged car accidents.
</P>
<P>
   In one claim, John Fenrich said a son -- not named -- was hit by a
motorist while riding a bike. Fenrich also claimed he lost his
pinkie in a 1995 car accident; an investigator found evidence the
finger had been amputated years earlier, authorities said in court
papers said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fenriches were out on bail while negotiating a plea bargain
in the case, according to Mrs. Fenrich's attorney, Steven Keats.

<HEADLINE> Chaplain Candidate Offers To Quit  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Rev. Charles Wright, whose selection as
House chaplain triggered charges of religious bias in Congress,
offered to withdraw this week in a private meeting with Speaker
Dennis Hastert, Republican sources said today.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, his nomination in limbo for months, made his offer amid
signs that Hastert was moving quickly to find a replacement.
Republicans are eager to quell a controversy in which some
Democrats accused them of anti-Catholic bias for passing over a
priest last fall when Wright was tapped.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, a Presbyterian minister, could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   John Feehery, Hastert's spokesman, declined all comment on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   But several sources said the speaker and Wright held an
unannounced meeting in the Capitol on Tuesday. They said the
minister decided on his own to offer his withdrawal, without any
pressure from the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Wright's nomination emerged last fall from a bipartisan
committee of lawmakers, but Hastert has the authority to name a
chaplain on his own authority. It was not clear how quickly he
would do so, or what the religion would be of his selection.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have been battered for months by charges of
anti-Catholic bias that first arose when the Rev. Tim O'Brien was
passed over for the chaplain's post.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am convinced that if I were a mainline Protestant minister
and not a Catholic priest, I would be the candidate,'' he said in
an interview in December, and some Democrats also alleged bias.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said O'Brien had been the top pick of the bipartisan
group of lawmakers that sifted through contenders, but Hastert and
Majority Leader Dick Armey turned to Wright instead. The two GOP
leaders said they had been given a list of three finalists -- Wright
and O'Brien included -- but were unaware of any ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans complain that Democratic leader Dick Gephardt first
agreed to Wright's choice, but has since sought to gain political
gain, particularly in view of the fact that Catholics are expected
to account for more than 25 percent of the voters in this fall's
election. In public comments, Gephardt has criticized the selection
process as flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Both Hastert and Armey have strongly denied any anti-Catholic
bias, and Hastert recently told a closed-door meeting of lawmakers
the matter had weighed heavily on him personally.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Republicans have initiated a series of
gestures in recent months that appeared part of an effort to
counter the criticism. These included awarding the Congressional
Gold Medal to an elderly and ill Cardinal John O'Connor of New
York.

<HEADLINE> Senate Passes Crop Insurance Bill  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate today overwhelmingly approved
legislation that would sharply reduce the premiums farmers pay for
federally subsidized crop insurance and encourage growers to buy
higher levels of coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which passed 95-5, also would offer coverage for
the first time to livestock producers and expand policies for fruit
and vegetable growers.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, similar to a bill approved by the House last
year, would cost taxpayers $1.5 billion annually over the next four
years. A House-Senate conference committee will work out the
differences between the two bills.
</P>
<P>
   Policies can be purchased to protect farmers from
weather-related losses as well as drops in commodity prices. But
many farmers, especially in the South and East, say the insurance
is too expensive for the coverage it provides.
</P>
<P>
   ''Very few businesses have the economic situation that
agriculture has. Just a little more supply than is necessary will
cause prices to go down,'' said Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said the legislation ''will
provide the security necessary to help farmers through lean years
so that they will be around to experience better prices and
increased revenue in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The government now pays from 13 percent to 57 percent of a
farmer's premium, depending on the level of coverage. Under the
Senate bill, the government's share on most policies would range
from 45 percent to 60 percent. The House bill would have the
government pay from 31 percent to 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the legislation say it could pay for itself, if
sufficient farmers buy coverage to lessen the pressure on Congress
to provide disaster assistance each year. Congress has approved $15
billion in emergency aid over the past two years to compensate
growers for weather-related losses and a slump in commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''Under this legislation, there will be enough incentives for
farmer to participate at high levels that in a future disaster the
need for disaster aid will drop significantly,'' said Ken Ackerman,
administrator of the Agriculture Department's Risk Management
Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The program has tripled in size since the early 1990s and covers
about two-thirds of the eligible acreage nationally. The program is
paying farmers some $2.2 billion to cover losses on 1999 crops
caused by drought, hurricane and rain.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to senators earlier this week, the Agriculture
Department said the bill ''represents real progress'' but raised
several concerns about the measure, including a provision that
would reduce USDA's role on a board that oversees the program.
</P>
<P>
   Senators from the Northeast insisted on setting aside $126
million in the legislation to help farmers in their region get the
insurance. Few farmers in the region now buy the coverage,
including only 8 percent of producers in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Although lawmakers from the Plains states have been pushing
hardest for the higher subsidies, the legislation is ''going to
have to be viewed by people all across the country as having
something that's going to benefit them,'' said the chairman of the
House Agriculture Committee, Rep. Larry Combest, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Five Republicans voted against the measure, in addition to
Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi: Thad Cochran of
Mississippi, Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, John McCain of Arizona
and Jon Kyl of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 2559.

<HEADLINE> Hollywood Preps for Biggest Parties  </HEADLINE>
By ERICA WERNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Kevin Spacey sugar cookies are on order,
the sculptured shrubbery is ready, and the limos, the cigars and
the fortune-teller have been reserved for months.
</P>
<P>
   It's Oscar season in Tinseltown, and while much of the country
speculates on who will win an Academy Award, Hollywood is also busy
wondering who is throwing the biggest Oscar bash with the most
stars -- and how to get in.
</P>
<P>
   ''My cousin Jimmy from Connecticut called,'' begging for a
ticket, said Sid Ganis, chairman of the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts and Sciences Governor's Ball, the swank industry event held
right after the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing doing, cousin Jimmy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, unless Jimmy's last name is Breslin or Smits, he may be
out of luck Sunday. At many of the parties -- from the
super-exclusive Dreamworks gala at Spago to Vanity Fair's lavish
Melrose Avenue bash -- only celebrities, Oscar winners and the
really well-connected can get in.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone wants to see little gold statues at their party,''
said Brian Baldwin, who is planning a post-Oscar party for his
boss, producer Ben Mathis, at the storied Argyle hotel on Sunset
Boulevard. ''Some people don't care what the category is, as long
as they see statues.''
</P>
<P>
   Civilians can sometimes buy their way in. Charity fund-raisers
are part of how Hollywood celebrates its big night out.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the old days, Mary Pickford or Doug Fairbanks would open up
their wallets and throw a party and everyone would have fun,''
Baldwin said. ''In Hollywood now, there's this attitude like you
can only have a party if you charge your guests.''
</P>
<P>
   Elton John's annual dinner and party to raise money for his AIDS
foundation is always one of the hottest tickets in town. The price
of admission: $1,500. The event raised more than $360,000 last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The bash, sponsored by InStyle magazine, will be held in a
restaurant on Melrose Avenue across from the Vanity Fair party,
where guests will be served cookies with frosted portraits of Oscar
nominees.
</P>
<P>
   InStyle's Cyd Wilson isn't worried about competing guest lists.
''There are enough celebrities in this town to go around,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody has a party like this, nobody,'' bragged Norby Walters,
who is organizing the Night of 100 Stars benefit for The Film
Foundation at the Beverly Hills Hotel. ''If you're not going
downtown'' -- to the Academy Awards ceremony -- ''this is the No. 1
one place to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The lucky few who make it into one of the big Oscar fetes will
be treated to over-the-top decor, free-flowing booze and delicacies
like candied walnuts and tuna tartare.
</P>
<P>
   One party put on by a Web site has a fortune-teller in a cigar
lounge. The first 1,000 guests at the Elton John party will get
gift bags valued at $650 each. (Though that's nothing compared with
the gift baskets the Oscar presenters are getting. Those are worth
up to $15,000 and include a baseball autographed by Joe Dimaggio
and a Montblanc pen.)
</P>
<P>
   Partygoers may have to fight for a decent set of wheels, though.
Los Angeles limousine companies say their cars have been booked for
three months.
</P>
<P>
   Around Oscar time, ''we make 'em beg real hard,'' said Johne
Baker, vice president of A-List Limos of Beverly Hills.

<HEADLINE> Actor Faces Trial for Pot Possession  </HEADLINE>
By MARK R. CHELLGREN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) -- Actor Woody Harrelson today lost his
battle to draw a legal line between industrial hemp and its
narcotic cousin marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky Supreme Court ruled there is no difference and said
Harrelson has to go back to Lee County to be tried for possession
of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson planted four hemp seeds in 1996, knowing he would be
arrested so he could challenge the law outlawing possession of any
part of the cannabis plant.
</P>
<P>
   Through three different courts, the star of ''Natural Born
Killers'' and ''The People vs. Larry Flynt'' has argued the statute
is unconstitutional because it does not distinguish between
marijuana and hemp, which contains only minute amounts of the
substance that makes marijuana smokers high, tetrahydrocannabinol
or THC.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mere fact that hemp may contain less THC than marijuana is
of no consequence,'' Justice Donald Wintersheimer wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The state Supreme Court said Harrelson should be making his
argument in the General Assembly, not the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson's trial for possession of marijuana, a misdemeanor
that carries a potential fine and little possibility for jail time,
has been put off pending his appeals. After one earlier hearing on
his case, Harrelson said he was prepared to stand trial to continue
his fight.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Charles Beal said Harrelson holds strong
convictions about the environmental and economic benefits of hemp.
</P>
<P>
   ''I suspect we'll end up going to trial,'' Beal said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Tom Jones did not immediately return a phone call
seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson has invested in a hemp clothing company, and he touts
hemp's potential for saving America's last old-growth trees. He has
argued that if paper manufacturers used hemp instead of trees to
make paper, there would be no need to cut down the nation's
forests.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky is an ideal battleground for hemp advocates because
hemp was once one of the state's leading crops. In the 1800s it was
used to make rope and sails, but anti-drug laws, the availability
of other fibers and the Marijuana Tax Act of 1937 wiped out
production in the United States. However, some farmers did grow
hemp during World War II under federal license.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved sharply higher today, led by
another advance in tech shares, after The Wall Street Journal
reported Microsoft is moving closer to resolving its antitrust
dispute with the government.
</P>
<P>
   In early afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 198.24 at 11,064.94. The Nasaq composite
index rose 110.91 at 4,975.66.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, which passed 1,500 and reached
a new closing high Wednesday, rose another 27.66 to 1,528.30.
</P>
<P>
   Tech stocks, following a big advance Wednesday, advanced today
as Microsoft surged on the Journal's report that the company and
the government are accelerating their talks toward settling a
wide-ranging antitrust suit. Microsoft was up 7~ at 111[.
</P>
<P>
   Other technology bellwethers also rose. Shares in network
equipment maker Cisco Systems rose 4 7/16 to 76|, and Oracle, a
major business software company, was up 3 1/16 to 87[.
</P>
<P>
   Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP;
Co., in Kansas City, said the big moves by tech leaders over the
past few days have been spilling over into smaller tech companies
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''Microsoft, Cisco and Intel have been very strong over the past
few days, and some investors have started to think that they're
missing something,'' Belski said.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in chip maker Intel fell, however, as investors collected
some of the stunning 75 percent gains the stock has seen since the
beginning of this year. Intel was off 3[ at 140 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Blue chip industrial stocks also rose as fund managers adjusted
their portfolios for the end of the first quarter. Aluminum maker
Alcoa rose 3 to 69~, and International Paper rose 2 3/16 to 39
7/16. Both are components of the Dow 30.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors also rose 3 9/16 to 85 3/16 on a rumor that the
media conglomerate News Corp. was interested in making a bid for
the automaker in order to get its satellite subsidiary, Hughes
Electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues edged declining issues by a margin of 3-to-2 on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 710.97 million
shares, down slightly from the same time Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index, which includes smaller companies, was up
6.52 at 577.71.

<HEADLINE> Brokerage harassment suit settled  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Two Wall Street brokerage houses settled a $10
million sexual harassment lawsuit Thursday, giving female employees
a shot at damages for alleged outrageous sexual antics that
prompted comparisons to ''Animal House.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This case should send a strong message to all of Wall Street
that we will not tolerate an old boys' club or frat house
atmosphere in the workplace,'' said state Attorney General Eliot
Spitzer, who announced the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Garban LLC and its affiliated firm, Garvin Guy Butler, were
accused of allowing strippers onto the trading floor, permitting
pornography in the office, and allowing male workers to drop their
pants in the view of female workers.
</P>
<P>
   Women at Garban ''were subjected to continual, unwelcome sexual
harassment,'' according to the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement was extended to include minority workers who were
allegedly subjected to racial epithets and racist jokes. Executives
at both companies were not only aware of the racist and lewd
behavior, but participated, the suit alleged.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed by the state attorney general in 1998, was
settled with a deal that clears the way for dozens of Garban
employees to collect back pay, lost benefits, lawyers' fees and
damages.
</P>
<P>
   Female and minority workers who were at the firm between
September 1996 and September 1998 are eligible.
</P>
<P>
   A private company was brought in to resolve any claims. The
process was expected to take about a year, and Garban will pay the
expenses, said Spitzer spokesman Scott Brown.
</P>
<P>
   A call for comment to Garban's office in lower Manhattan was not
returned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other complaints contained in the lawsuit were that
male workers routinely bragged about their sexual exploits, used
the bathroom with the door open, and addressed women in vulgar
terms.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit claimed that the harassment began in 1984. Employees
who complained about mistreatment were often threatened or fired,
the suit said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Garban will pay $200,000 to cover the
state's legal fees, as well as implementing several new policies to
prevent a repeat of the aberrant behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The company was also required to report any bias complaint over
the next three years directly to the attorney general's office.

<HEADLINE> WTO Tackles Agriculture's Future  </HEADLINE>
By CLARE NULLIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- The World Trade Organization on Thursday formally
launched negotiations to break down barriers to trade in farm
products -- an exercise which likely will last years and be fraught
with problems.
</P>
<P>
   Symbolizing the bitter divisions over agriculture policy and the
general crisis within the WTO following the collapse of the Seattle
conference, the 135-nation body failed even to agree on who should
head the talks permanently and instead just named an interim
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still have no solution,'' Norwegian diplomat Kare Bryn said
of the hunt for a chairman acceptable both to supporters and
opponents of agricultural trade liberalization.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are all in agreement that this is an unfortunate
situation,'' said Bryn, head of the WTO general council and thus
responsible for finding a chairman for the agriculture committee.
</P>
<P>
   Bryn said he had named New Zealand ambassador Roger Farrell to
chair Thursday's meeting as it was vital that the agricultural
talks should begin as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was expected to be devoted to organizational matters
like timetables and restatement of existing views, rather than any
new proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture has for years been the biggest single stumbling
block to the quest to break down barriers to exports and open up
global markets.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and farm producers like Australia and Canada
want to dismantle farm supports which, they maintain, distort
trade. In particular, they want to the European Union to ax its
massive subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   The EU -- which is backed by Japan -- says it is prepared to make
some subsidy cuts. But it insists that the agriculture negotiations
should also address issues like animal welfare, food safety and
protection for rural communities rather than just free market
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   A small group of French and Swiss farmers demonstrated outside
the WTO's lakeside headquarters to protest the negotiations and
their perceived threat to small farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union and Japan have so far blocked the nomination
of Celso Amorim, Brazil's highly respected ambassador to the WTO
and a former foreign minister, on the grounds that Brazil is a
member of the group of free traders.
</P>
<P>
   The EU has proposed Nacer Benjelloun, Morocco's ambassador to
the WTO but has so far won little additional support.
</P>
<P>
   The general council agreed that Farrell should be interim head
of the agriculture talks as he is currently the chairman of the
more senior WTO committee on goods -- which also covers agriculture.

<HEADLINE> Florida Competing for Spring Break  </HEADLINE>
By BILL KACZOR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- As he basked in the sun, sipping
a beer on a glistening white Florida Panhandle beach, Anthony
Keller was already looking ahead to his next spring break.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old Penn State University student said he'll likely
go to Cancun, Mexico, or one of the other foreign destinations that
are giving Florida a run for its spring break money.
</P>
<P>
   ''More freedom, more liberty,'' said Keller, of Palmerton, Pa.
''There's probably more things to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Panama City Beach remains the leading domestic destination for
spring break, annually attracting an estimated 400,000 to 500,000
visitors, according to Student Travel Services in Hanover, Md.
Other top spring break spots include Daytona Beach, South Padre
Island, Texas, Lake Havasu City, Ariz., Myrtle Beach, S.C., Miami's
South Beach and Key West.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, however, students are heading for foreign shores,
attracted by relatively low cost tour packages -- from around $600
to $700 per person with four to a room for a week including air
fare -- a lower drinking age and a virtual guarantee of warm weather
in tropical climates. North Florida can be chilly in late February
and early March, although temperatures have been mild this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cancun, Jamaica, Acapulco are all hot spots,'' said Kirk
Riley, president of Student Adventure Travel, based in Dallas City,
Ill. Some students are forsaking beaches altogether and opting for
Paris or London.
</P>
<P>
   Riley began in the tour business with spring bus trips, but he
stopped doing Florida after the drinking age increased to 21. He
didn't want to deal with students getting into trouble for underage
drinking and drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a problem in Cancun and other destinations where the
drinking age is 18 and students fly, rather than drive.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Baranoski, the office manager for Student Travel
Services, which serves as a ticket wholesaler from a number of tour
operators, said they sent a record 20,000 students to Cancun on
more than 100 charter planes during the week of March 11-18. The
company's overall spring break business has gone from 27,000
travelers last year to 40,000 this year, mostly to Cancun.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cancun's got everything,'' said Mike Rush, vice president of
Sun Coast Vacations in Waitsfield, Vt. ''It has the nightlife. It
has some cultural activities and day excursions. People can go to
the Mayan ruins.''
</P>
<P>
   The growing popularity of foreign destinations has not gone
unnoticed in Panama City Beach, where spring break has meant big
business in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Party central shifted west to Panama City Beach about 10 years
ago, when officials in Daytona Beach decided to clean up that
city's image as a place where drunken fraternity boys pass out on
the beach. Daytona Beach inherited spring break from Fort
Lauderdale, which parted ways with the college crowd in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   In January, some tourism officials blamed foreign competition
when hotels reported that spring break bookings were down as much
as 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Reports of Panama City Beach's demise, however, were premature,
said Robert Warren, executive director of the city's Convention and
Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   A last-minute publicity push helped increase reservations, and
Warren predicted that revenues will equal past years. He said
bookings probably were slow to start due to a late Easter that has
spread spring break business, usually lasting five or six weeks,
over a two-month period.
</P>
<P>
   No changes are necessary as far as Scott Farrell, 23, of
Brooklyn, Ohio, is concerned. The winter graduate of Ohio Northern
University took time off from his sales job for a spring break
fling with a couple buddies still in college.
</P>
<P>
   Farrell said he found police to be lenient and got a good rate
at his hotel. He also said the recently renourished beach was a
vast improvement over the storm-eroded one he visited in Cancun
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is my first time here and I've definitely enjoyed it,''
Keller said. ''I'm having as good or better time than I did in
Cancun.''

<HEADLINE> 6th-Grader Holds Class at Gunpoint  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Ohio (AP) -- A sixth-grader pulled a gun in his classroom
Thursday morning but a teacher persuaded him to drop the weapon,
the school superintendent said.
</P>
<P>
   No one was hurt and the 12-year-old boy was taken into custody.
He told authorities that his mother is in jail and he wanted to
join her, Superintendent Anthony Krukowski said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy came into his McKinley Elementary School classroom at
about 9 a.m., pointed a gun at the floor and told his classmates
and teacher Dan Kemats to get down, Krukowski said.
</P>
<P>
   A pupil in the hallway overheard the exchange and summoned
another teacher, Linda Robb, who persuaded the boy to give up the
gun, Krukowski said. The whole thing was over in less than five
minutes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's name was not released.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities didn't immediately say if the gun, which was not a
toy, was loaded. The boy apparently got it from home and kept it in
his pocket, Krukowski said.
</P>
<P>
   The school was closed for the day. It will not have classes
Friday but will be open for students who want to come in for
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ''Naturally the students were shook up, any time you have an
incident like that,'' Krukowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Krukowski said he wasn't very familiar with the boy and was
unaware of any behavior problems. ''As far as I am aware of, there
was nothing substantial,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning at a Cincinnati elementary school, Vice President Al
Gore said the incident in Lisbon ''once again raises the question
that has confronted us so often in the past year or two or three.
That is, how can we all come together to give our children better
values? ... Isn't it time for all of us to come together across
party lines to require mandatory child-safety trigger locks and
other common-sense measures to deal with this problem?''
</P>
<P>
   The school has about 650 students from kindergarten through
sixth grade. The district has about 1,350 students. Lisbon is about
25 miles south of Youngstown, near the Ohio-West
Virginia-Pennsylvania lines.

<HEADLINE> Education Breaks Key for Taxpayers  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON, AP Tax Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Education may be its own reward, but numerous
tax breaks are available for earners, their spouses and their
children to pay for college or other higher education. One warning:
The government can seize tax refunds from people who default on
federal student loans.
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury Department can take money out of a taxpayer's
refund if a federal student loan is in default, which generally
means a failure to make payments for nine months or more. Last
year, some $1.3 billion in defaulted loans was collected from tax
refunds.
</P>
<P>
   There are ways to prevent this, said Kevin Tharp, director of
delinquency and default at USA Group, the nation's biggest student
loan administrator. Borrowers already in default should contact the
lender and make some payment arrangement before the Internal
Revenue Service starts taking action toward their refund. Also,
payments can be reduced or delayed temporarily if the borrower is
having financial trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ''The vast majority of defaults can be avoided,'' Tharp said.
''We prefer to work with former students to avoid default in the
first place.''
</P>
<P>
   People hoping to claim education tax breaks by this year's April
17 filing deadline should obtain Form 8863, which was not included
in standard tax packages mailed to homes by the IRS. The form is
available over the Internet from the IRS or at one of the agency's
400 offices.
</P>
<P>
   The Hope Scholarship allows a taxpayer to claim a $1,500 credit
for each student in the family who carries at least half of a full
course load at a higher education institution. The credit only
applies during the first two years of higher learning, however.
</P>
<P>
   The Lifetime Learning Credit, on the other hand, is not
restricted to those first two years and can be used for the costs
of undergraduate or graduate courses, or for job skills classes.
There are no requirements for a minimum number of courses, but the
credit is limited to 20 percent of tuition and fees up to a maximum
of $1,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers cannot claim both credits in the same year. They also
cannot claim either credit if their adjusted gross income exceeds
$100,000 for those who are married and filing jointly, or $50,000
for singles and heads of households.
</P>
<P>
   One way parents can get around those income limits is to avoid
claiming a child who is a student as a dependent, according to tax
advisers. The child can then claim the credit, and for
higher-income parents the loss of the dependency exemption might
not make much difference.
</P>
<P>
   Families with children under 18 might want to open an education
IRA, which allows a contribution of up to $500 a year for each
child. The money then will not be subject to taxes if it is used
for higher education expenses before the beneficiary reaches age
30.
</P>
<P>
   There are some things to keep in mind:
</P>
<P>
   --In any year when an education IRA is distributed, a taxpayer
cannot claim any of the education credits and there are limits on
student loan interest deductions.
</P>
<P>
   --Contributions cannot be made to one of these IRAs in the same
year they are made to any of the state prepaid tuition programs on
behalf of the same child.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress are pushing to expand the annual
contribution limits from $500 to $2,000 and allow the money to be
used for expenses at all levels of education, both public and
private. President Clinton has twice vetoed similar bills.
</P>
<P>
   The law now also permits up to $1,500 in interest on student
loans to be deducted. Those deductions are limited to the first 60
months of loan payments.

<HEADLINE> Two Killed, House Set on Fire in Pa.  </HEADLINE>
By TODD SPANGLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONROEVILLE, Pa. (AP) -- Two people were shot to death Thursday
and a woman was wounded inside a home that caught fire, authorities
said. The wounded woman rushed bleeding into a neighboring
business.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting was reported at about noon at the house in
Monroeville, about 15 miles east of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe it to have been sparked by a domestic violence
situation,'' said Monroeville Police Chief George Polnar. Police
believe a man may have shot his girlfriend and a second woman, then
set the house on fire and killed himself, Polnar said, but he
couldn't yet confirm that scenario.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon, firefighters had put out the flames and the
house was smoldering. Police were circling the building.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who had been shot ran into The Money Tree, a mortgage
company next door to the house.
</P>
<P>
   ''She said, 'Somebody shot me. Call 911.' She said, 'This guy
shot me,''' said Diana Kugliari, a mortgage consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Another Money Tree employee, Tony Nicolazzo, said the woman,
with blood on her face and hands, ''told us that the boyfriend of
the girl who lived next door was in the house and shot the girl.''
</P>
<P>
   ''She apparently got out of the house through a window and came
over here. She escaped,'' he said. ''She feared that the other girl
had already been shot and that the other girl was already dead.''
He said the woman was taken away in an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Ross, spokeswoman for Mercy Hospital in Pittsburgh, said a
23-year-old woman was being treated for gunshot wounds and was
awake and alert.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolazzo also said it appeared that a body had been brought out
of the house and covered up with a sheet in the yard.
</P>
<P>
   The house sat alongside a four-lane road in a middle-class
neighborhood of well-spaced homes and businesses. Another neighbor,
Letty Postlethwaite, said she saw a man go into the house at about
11:30 a.m.

<HEADLINE> Celine Dion Makes Brief Appearance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) -- Celine Dion came out of retirement
long enough to sing five songs for fellow golf enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm nervous. I haven't trained,'' she told about 1,000 people
attending a dinner Wednesday night for the LPGA Nabisco
Championship tournament. She and husband Rene Angelil played in the
event earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Dion's performance at the Palm Springs Convention Center was her
first since a farewell concert on New Year's Eve in Montreal. She
began a two-year hiatus in January.
</P>
<P>
   Dion, 31, has a new look -- a super-short blond haircut. Singing
to pre-recorded music, she did a version of Frank Sinatra's ''All
The Way,'' with Sinatra's voice accompanying her.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thank you, Frank,'' she whispered at the end while snapping
off a skyward salute to the late singer, who made his home in the
desert.

<HEADLINE> Lawsuit Puts Trebek in Jeopardy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORRANCE, Calif. (AP) -- An airline security employee has filed a
lawsuit against Alex Trebek over an alleged flap last year at Los
Angeles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Marlene Andrade, 31, of Hawthorne, claims that the 59-year-old
''Jeopardy!'' game show host tried to get an oversized bag past her
United Airlines security gate last May.
</P>
<P>
   She contends that Trebek became upset when she asked him to put
the bag on a conveyor belt that has a metal guard at its mouth to
check bag sizes. Trebek lifted the metal template as if he had the
same privileges as airline employees, and slammed it on her hand
when she intervened, Andrade said in papers filed Monday in
Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages. Trebek had no comment.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Move Higher  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks moved broadly higher today, led by
another advance in high-tech issues, as Microsoft surged on hopes
that the software maker and the government may soon resolve their
longstanding antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   The advance pushed the Dow back above 11,000 and sent the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index further into record territory.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average was up 231.75 at 11,098.45 in
the last hour of trading, while the Nasaq composite index rose
96.91 to 4,961.66.
</P>
<P>
   The S&AMP;P 500, which passed 1,500 and reached a new closing high
Wednesday, gained another 28.22 to 1,528.86.
</P>
<P>
   The rally also lifted industrial blue chips as fund managers
scrambled to put their cash to work in the stock market before the
end of the first quarter next week. Aluminum maker Alcoa rose 3 to
69~, and International Paper rose 2 3/16 to 39 7/16. Both are
components of the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a very strong quarter in terms of tech stocks as
well as flows into mutual funds, so there's a lot of pressure on
fund managers to be fully invested by the end of the quarter,''
said Ricky Harrington, technical analyst at Wachovia Securities in
Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   But the real stars of the day were once again the major
high-tech shares, which shot higher from the opening following a
report in The Wall Street Journal that Microsoft and the government
are accelerating their talks toward settling a wide-ranging
antitrust suit. Microsoft was up 7 11/16 at 110 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Other technology bellwethers also rose. Shares in network
equipment maker Cisco Systems rose 5 1/16 to 77\, and Oracle, a
major business software company, was up 3 1/16 to 87[.
</P>
<P>
   Brian G. Belski, chief investment strategist at George K. Baum &AMP;
Co., in Kansas City, said the big moves by tech leaders over the
past few days have been spilling over into smaller tech companies
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''Microsoft, Cisco and Intel have been very strong over the past
few days, and some investors have started to think that they're
missing something,'' Belski said.
</P>
<P>
   The main exception to the rally was chip maker Intel, which came
off its highs as investors collected some of the stunning 75
percent gains the stock has seen since the beginning of this year.
Intel fell 1~ to 142 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues edged declining issues by a margin of 3-to-2 on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 851.73 million
shares, down slightly from the same time Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A sharp rally in the bond market was also making its presence
felt on Wall Street. With fewer places to put their money and
long-term bond yields now well below 6 percent, fund managers were
looking again at stocks to buy in order to put their cash to work
by the end of the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The runup in the Treasury market was all the more remarkable
since it came on the heels of Tuesday's rate increase by the
Federal Reserve. The Fed has also indicated it intends to raise
rates more, but bond traders appear to be unfazed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bond market is out of control,'' said Harrington.
''Despite what the Fed has done so far, there's still so much money
out there. Momentum and money flow are driving this market.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index, which reflects the performanc of
smaller-company stocks, was up 4.12 at 575.31.

<HEADLINE> Brokerages Settle Harassment Suit  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY McSHANE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Two Wall Street brokerage houses Thursday
settled a $10 million sexual harassment lawsuit that was filed over
alleged antics so outrageous they prompted comparisons to ''Animal
House.''
</P>
<P>
   Garban LLC and its affiliated firm, Garvin Guy Butler, were
accused of allowing strippers onto the trading floor, permitting
pornography in the office, and allowing male workers to drop their
pants in the view of female workers.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other complaints: male workers routinely bragged about
their sexual exploits, used the bathroom with the door open and
addressed women in vulgar terms. Employees who complained about
mistreatment were often threatened or fired, the suit said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This case should send a strong message to all of Wall Street
that we will not tolerate an old boys' club or frat house
atmosphere in the workplace,'' said state Attorney General Eliot
Spitzer, who announced the agreement. His predecessor filed the
lawsuit in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also contended that minority workers were subjected
to racial epithets and racist jokes. Executives were not only aware
of the racist and lewd behavior, but participated, the suit
alleged.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, female and minority workers who were at
the brokerages between September 1996 and September 1998 are
eligible to collect back pay, lost benefits, lawyers' fees and
damages.
</P>
<P>
   A private company was brought in to resolve any claims. Garban
will pay the expenses, plus $200,000 for the state's legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   A call for comment to Garban's office was not returned Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Harrelson Hemp Case Back To Court  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) -- Woody Harrelson's marijuana possession
case is headed back to a county court for trial now that he's lost
his state Supreme Court appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson planted four hemp seeds in 1996, knowing he would be
arrested, so he could challenge a Kentucky law outlawing possession
of any part of the cannabis plant.
</P>
<P>
   Through three different courts, Harrelson has argued the statute
is unconstitutional because it doesn't distinguish between
marijuana and hemp, which contains only minute amounts of the
substance that makes marijuana smokers high, tetrahydrocannabinol
or THC.
</P>
<P>
   The state's high court ruled Thursday there's no difference
between the two. ''The mere fact that hemp may contain less THC
than marijuana is of no consequence,'' Justice Donald Wintersheimer
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The misdemeanor carries a potential fine and little possibility
for jail time. The trial has been put off pending Harrelson's
appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Tom Jones did not immediately return a call.
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson, 38, has invested in a hemp clothing company and touts
hemp's potential for saving old-growth trees. He has argued that if
paper manufacturers used hemp instead of trees to make paper, there
would be no need to cut down the nation's forests.

<HEADLINE> Reformist Shot in Iran Improving  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- An Iranian reformist shot at point-blank
range in Tehran nearly two weeks ago is breathing on his own,
recognizes friends and relatives and communicates through nods and
eye movements, his doctors were reported as saying Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Saeed Hajjarian, a Tehran city councilor, publisher and
confidant of President Mohammad Khatami, was shot in the face March
12 by a gunman on a motorcycle. University chemistry student Saeed
Asgar has been arrested and accused of the shooting. Further
details about the suspect or motive have not been released.
</P>
<P>
   Hajjarian's doctors say he has been steadily improving since
surgeons punctured his windpipe earlier this week to help him
breathe and placed a feeding tube into his stomach, according to
the official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   IRNA, quoting doctors at Sina hospital in Tehran, said Hajjarian
is breathing without respiration equipment and that his blood
pressure and heart functions are normal.
</P>
<P>
   Hajjarian, 46, now recognizes visitors and ''intimates his full
comprehension of the spoken word,'' communicating through eye
movements and nodding, IRNA said. A minor lung infection that
developed after he was hospitalized is under control, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-reform newspapers and Hajjarian's allies have blamed the
attack on hard-liners who oppose Khatami's cultural, social and
political reforms.

<HEADLINE> Can Oil Riches Stabilize Nigeria?  </HEADLINE>
By GLENN McKENZIE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) -- Beneath the swamps where poor Nigerians
eke out a living from fishing and farming are some of the world's
largest untapped oil fields.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the precious resource that gives troubled Nigeria hope for
the future also fuels spiraling violence that threatens the
political and economic prospects of Africa's energy giant.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when crude prices have tripled from 1998 lows, the
world's sixth-largest exporter has some of the industry's largest
untapped oil fields.
</P>
<P>
   Community activists in the oil-rich Niger Delta demand some of
that wealth for the impoverished region and stage frequent attacks
against petroleum facilities, kidnapping workers and sabotaging
pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   Police and soldiers have responded with deadly raids, razing a
village last November. Human rights groups estimate hundreds of
people have been killed in clashes with police.
</P>
<P>
   The government of President Olusegun Obasanjo, whose election
last year ended 15 years of military rule, has sent confusing
signals about how it plans to handle the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The state Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. has warned it will
fund a police unit authorized to shoot saboteurs on sight. But the
government has also made vague promises of development money to
appease restive communities.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria produces about 2 million barrels of oil a day, worth
nearly $17 billion last year. Roughly one-twelfth of the oil
imported by the United States comes from Nigeria, and the country
has proven reserves of 25 billion barrels.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite its oil wealth, years of corrupt military rule have
left Nigeria one of the world's 25 poorest nations. And the Delta,
where most of the drilling occurs, is one of its poorest regions.
</P>
<P>
   Sabotage forces costly pipeline shutdowns and other industry
delays. Last year, 497 cases of vandalism were reported, compared
to 57 a year earlier. These include frequent cases of local
residents siphoning off fuel by puncturing pipelines with picks and
shovels, then using buckets and barrels to collect the spilling
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   At least 35 people, including children, were killed Wednesday
when a fire broke out while they were siphoning off gasoline in a
remote part of southeastern Abia state. Twenty people were injured,
and authorities said 28 suspected vandals were taken into custody.
In October 1998, a huge explosion and fire sparked by scavengers
siphoning off fuel in the Niger Delta town of Jesse killed at least
700 people.
</P>
<P>
   ''Deliberate action is necessary to send a strong message'' to
those who sabotage the pipelines, a spokesman for the state oil
company, Ndu Ughamadu, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   But human rights activists warn that any move to crack down on
the vandalism with hired guns threatens to heighten tensions in the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Officials warn the government will also get tough with oil
companies blamed by state officials and Delta villagers for water
and air pollution that has harmed fishing and farming.
</P>
<P>
   Environment Minister Imeh Okopido said he plans legislation that
would require oil companies to eliminate spills and the practice of
flaring -- burning natural gas produced as a byproduct of oil
drilling -- by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the 42 years since oil activities began in Nigeria, nothing
has been done about the atrocious state of the environment. That is
going to change,'' Okopido said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The oil companies agree that flaring could be eliminated by
selling the natural gas instead of burning it, but are pushing for
a more conservative target of 2008.
</P>
<P>
   The government also promises to boost development and tackle
corruption, which has diverted billions of dollars from the economy
in recent decades and left schools, roads and hospitals in decay.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pledges, no new government money has been channeled
to the Delta so far. Proposals to increase government and company
spending from 3 percent to 13 percent of overall revenue have also
stalled under Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies have advocated more government-led development as
a way to bring stability. The Shell Oil Co. spent $42 million on
community assistance projects in 1998, according to company
spokesman James Herbert.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not enough money from oil wealth is plowed back into the Delta
region for development,'' Herbert said in a telephone interview
from London.
</P>
<P>
   The oil companies' profit margin is among the world's highest.
Retrieval costs in the Delta hover between $3 and $5 a barrel,
while recent oil prices were over $30, said Aret Adams, a Nigerian
oil industry analyst and former government adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Observers say attacks against the industry could escalate if it
doesn't do more.
</P>
<P>
   ''The industry needs to put their money where their mouth is if
it expects to end communal violence,'' Adams said. ''People without
jobs or food in their stomachs can be moved to desperate acts.''

<HEADLINE> Fed Was Unanimous in Rate Hike  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Reserve's policy-making committee
was unanimous in its decision to boost an important interest rate
by a quarter-point in February to keep inflation from becoming a
problem. However, some members had urged that the rate be pushed
even higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Open Market Committee, which includes Fed Chairman
Alan Greenspan, voted 10-0 to raise the federal funds rate -- the
interest that banks charge each other on overnight loans-- to 5.75
percent, according to minutes of the Feb. 1-2 meeting released
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   That marked the fourth time the Fed boosted the funds rate since
June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Even though there was no dissent on the February funds rate
increase, the minutes said that in discussion before the vote, a
few, unidentified members expressed a preference for a half-point
increase in the funds rate ''in order to provide greater assurance
against a buildup of inflationary expectations and inflation over
coming months.''
</P>
<P>
   And, other members acknowledged that the Fed ''might need to
move more aggressively at a later meeting'' should the rapidly
growing economy generate a pick up in inflation pressures.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the minutes said that all members agreed to the
quarter point move for a number of reasons, including uncertainties
about the outlook for growth in demand relative to that of supply,
the economy's response to previous rate increases and somewhat
unsettled conditions in financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Members ''saw little risk in a gradual approach,'' the minutes
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Fed boosted interest rates by another
quarter-point to slow the red-hot economy and keep inflation under
control. That action pushed the funds rate to 6 percent. The
minutes of that meeting are expected to be released in May.
</P>
<P>
   At the February meeting, policy-makers also were united in
expressing their concerns that inflation could spoil the economic
good times the country is currently enjoying.
</P>
<P>
   Members unanimously agreed that future risks to the economy were
''weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened
inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fed also decided to boost its mostly symbolic discount rate,
the interest that the Fed charges to make direct loans to banks, by
a quarter-point at the February meeting. It did so again on
Tuesday, pushing the rate to 5.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Black Caucus Wants More African Aid  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Black Caucus members called on
U.S. lawmakers to forgive the debt of flood-ravaged countries in
southern Africa and help the nations rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are witnessing a tragedy of catastrophic proportions,''
said Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., at a news conference Thursday that
also drew ambassadors from several African nations.
</P>
<P>
   Caucus Chairman James Clyburn, D-S.C., said the widespread
flooding -- which has hit Zimbabwe, Swaziland, Madagascar and South
Africa -- threatens progress made by the hardest-hit country,
Mozambique, to end internal warring and feed its people.
</P>
<P>
   Clyburn said last year was the first year the impoverished
country didn't request international food aid.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want to see the gains washed away with the flood
waters,'' Clyburn said.
</P>
<P>
   This week alone, low-lying southern Mozambican towns are at risk
of being flooded for the second time in less than a month as heavy
rains upstream in South Africa drove up water levels in local
rivers.
</P>
<P>
   More than a month of floods, the worst on record in the
southeast African nation, have displaced more than 1 million people
nationwide, according to the caucus.
</P>
<P>
   In Madagascar, flooding has killed more than 1,500 people and a
cholera outbreak brought on by the deluge has infected more than
25,000 others.
</P>
<P>
   The confirmed death toll of 492 is expected to rise.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have been among the 1,400 aid workers, 1,000 soldiers
and 53 aircraft from eight separate armies to descend on the
southeast African nation this month.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., however, called the U.S. response
''inexcusably slow'' and plans to introduce legislation to forgive
the debts and provide reconstruction aid for eight southern African
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said last week the U.S.
Agency for International Development already has provided $7
million in emergency food aid and $5.7 million in disaster
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   She said the Treasury Department is moving to forgive the $4.9
million debt owed by Mozambique to the U.S. government, and
assistance is going to Zimbabwe, Botswana and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has already forgiven nearly all the debt owed
by Mozambique. But legislation is necessary to coordinate that debt
relief with other nations and to bestow U.S. approval for
international lending agencies like the International Monetary Fund
to engage in debt relief.
</P>
<P>
   Mozambique owes $87 million to creditors this year, of which
approximately $58 million is owed to countries and $30 million to
international institutions.
</P>
<P>
   On March 9, the House passed a resolution expressing support for
humanitarian assistance.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Feasts On Indian Delicacies  </HEADLINE>
By KRISHNAN GURUSWAMY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- What's on Clinton's plate in India?
Marinated shrimp, lamb cooked in a clay oven, spicy chicken,
vegetable pilaf, buttery lentil, cottage cheese, pickles, two
scoops of mango ice cream, an eggless Indian ice cream,
almond-pistachio fudge, almond-saffron sorbet, and three other
sweets.
</P>
<P>
   All in one meal.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wonderful. Thank you,'' Clinton told the staff after the
feast, detailed in Indian newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   So much for lunch. Dinner was another mouthful.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton went to an Afghan restaurant that same day and shared at
least five meat dishes along with assorted vegetables, stews and
breads -- including a four-foot naan -- with daughter Chelsea and
mother-in-law Dorothy Rodham.
</P>
<P>
   Chef Gev Desai tried to persuade Clinton to have another helping
but the president demurred. ''If I eat any more, you guys will have
to carry me out on a stretcher,'' he said, according to the Times
of India.
</P>
<P>
   Lunch was with Indian President K.R. Narayanan at the Ashok
Hotel; dinner at Maurya Sheraton's Bukhara restaurant. Clinton has
been to at least four restaurants on his all-you-can-eat trip.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Clinton planned to give a dose of medicine to three young
tuberculosis victims in a visit to a Hyderabad hospital Friday. But
because he was coming, the hospital turned some patients away.
</P>
<P>
   Daga Shantilal, who is from the trust that runs Mahavir
Hospital, denied the hospital was ignoring ill patients and said
many people were trying to be admitted only to see Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Police and hospital guards were seen refusing entry to several
dozen people during a 30-minute period Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   One man, accompanied by two women, argued with a guard, shouting
''It is an emergency.'' The guard said, ''We are not taking any
patients,'' and the three eventually went away.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is this? So many patients are being shifted here and
there all the time because of him,'' said Kelaparthi Shekhar, 24,
who has chronic heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was to administer the last treatment in a six-month
course of medication to two 8-year-old girls and a 15-year-old boy.
He's marking World Tuberculosis Day in the nation with the highest
number of TB sufferers.
</P>
<P>
   The Mahavir Hospital is run by a trust fund of the minority Jain
community, a pacifist sect.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers: Push China on Rights  </HEADLINE>
By FREDERIC J. FROMMER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton should personally lobby
foreign heads of state to back a United Nations resolution
condemning China's human rights record, a bipartisan group of
lawmakers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   ''We don't want our government to just go through the motions,''
Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., said at a news conference. ''We want
the president to be on the phone, calling other nations.''
</P>
<P>
	   Wellstone spoke in Washington while Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright addressed the 53-nation U.N. Human Rights Commission in
Geneva. She asked member countries to back a U.S. resolution
''expressing concern about widespread denials of political,
cultural, labor and religious freedom in China.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Chinese delegation to the U.N. has thwarted attempts at
censure since the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, in which hundreds
of pro-Democracy activists died.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Tim Hutchinson, R-Ark., applauded the Clinton
administration's efforts but said the president needs to get
personally involved, as he has on other issues.
</P>
<P>
	   ''I want the president to show that he feels just as strong
about human rights, by picking up that telephone and calling
leaders in other nations, and lining up the support that only he
can ensure to see the passage of this important resolution,''
Hutchinson said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear whether Clinton planned to take an active role.
The White House press office referred calls to the National
Security Council, which did not immediately return a phone call
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Those at the Washington news conference gave the administration
credit for pushing harder for the resolution than in past years.
Mike Jendrzejcyzk, Washington director of Human Rights Watch's Asia
Division, said last year the administration made only a ''token
gesture'' to get the resolution passed.
</P>
<P>
	   Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said she pointedly told Albright at a
hearing this month: ''Either the Chinese are outsmarting us in
Geneva, or we're not trying hard enough. Which could it be? I think
we weren't trying hard enough.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pelosi warned failure to pass the human rights resolution will
make it harder for Congress to approve a bill extending most
favored nation trade status to China, a move favored by the Clinton
administration. Pelosi is among the leading opponents of the
measure.
</P>
<P>
	   Song Yongyi, who was arrested last year and detained by the
Chinese government for nearly six months on charges of spying, said
he owed his release to international pressure.
</P>
<P>
	   ''Dialogue alone is not sufficient,'' said Song, a Chinese-born
librarian at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pa., who became an
American citizen last month.
</P>
<P>
	   His release, he said, shows that China can ''no longer disregard
strong international pressures on human rights.''

<HEADLINE> Boy Holds Classmates At Gunpoint  </HEADLINE>
By THOMAS J. SHEERAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Ohio (AP) -- A 12-year-old who told authorities he wanted
to be with his mother in jail briefly held his sixth-grade class at
gunpoint Thursday before a teacher persuaded him to give up the
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   No one was hurt and no charges were immediately filed against
the boy, who was taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
   The boy said ''his biological mother was in jail and he wanted
to visit her, be with her,'' said Anthony Krukowski, superintendent
of Lisbon schools.
</P>
<P>
   Police did not immediately confirm whether the mother was in
jail.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief John Higgins said the weapon was a loaded, 9 mm
semiautomatic. The boy apparently brought the gun from home and
concealed it in his clothes, Krukowski said.
</P>
<P>
   About 8:45 a.m., the boy stood up in his classroom at McKinley
Elementary School, pointed the gun at the floor and told his fellow
students and teacher to get down, Higgins and Krukowski said.
</P>
<P>
   A student in the hall overheard the exchange and summoned
another teacher, Linda Robb, Krukowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Robb stood in the doorway of the classroom and asked the boy if
she could talk to him. The two walked out into the hallway and
hugged, and the boy handed the gun over to Robb, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The student, who was not identified, was taken into custody by
police in this city, which is about 25 miles south of Youngstown in
northeastern Ohio, near the West Virginia and Pennsylvania state
lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Vindicator of Youngstown reported that the boy was on
crossing duty with another sixth-grader, Katie Hartman, on Thursday
morning. The girl said that at the end of their duty the boy told
her: ''Goodbye, Katie. I won't be back.''
</P>
<P>
   She asked what he meant, but he didn't answer.
</P>
<P>
   Sixth-graders were sent home, but the other students were kept
in class because the district didn't want younger children going
home without making sure their parents knew, Krukowski said.
</P>
<P>
   The school, which has about 650 students from kindergarten
through sixth grade, will be closed on Friday but will be open for
student counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ''Naturally the students were shook up, any time you have an
incident like that,'' Krukowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Krukowski said he wasn't very familiar with the boy and was
unaware of any behavior problems.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, campaigning at a Cincinnati elementary
school, said the incident ''once again raises the question that has
confronted us so often in the past year or two or three. That is,
how can we all come together to give our children better values?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the student's access to a firearm points out the need
for gun control measures such as child-safety trigger locks.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Give Pakistan Hard Facts  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAIPUR, India (AP) -- President Clinton will tell military-ruled
Pakistan it is ''a country that is in trouble'' and should not
waste its energy in a dangerous confrontation with nuclear neighbor
India, National Security Adviser Sandy Berger said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He said Clinton would tell the people of Pakistan that ''we care
about their future, that we don't want Pakistan to fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger said Clinton would ''convey some hard realities'' to Gen.
Pervez Musharraf, the military leader who took over Pakistan's
government in a coup in October and has refused to set a date for
national elections. The United States welcomed Pakistan's
announcement of local elections but said that was not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're looking for is a roadmap for national elections and
a restoration of democracy in Pakistan,'' White House press
secretary Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Winding up a five-day visit to India and Bangladesh, Clinton
will fly to Islamabad on Saturday. After meeting with Musharraf,
the president is to make a live television address to the people of
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has labeled South Asia as perhaps the most dangerous
place in the world because of the nuclear arms race between India
and Pakistan and their bitter dispute over the Himalayan territory
of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is concerned that Pakistan, emboldened by its
longtime friendship with the United States, might escalate tensions
with India to the point of conflict -- believing that America and
other world powers would step in and force a settlement of
differences.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like giving a country a security umbrella,'' a senior
administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
''That's not something we're going to do in this case.''
</P>
<P>
   If the United States is seen by Pakistan as a too-willing
peacemaker, ''we increase the possibility of war rather than
decrease the possibility of war,'' the official said at a dinner
meeting with reporters at a resort where Clinton stayed.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policymakers say Clinton will make clear to Musharraf that
Pakistan cannot count on the United States to bail it out, even
though it was America's ally throughout the Cold War and helped in
the struggle against Soviet forces in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan wants the United States to mediate the Kashmir conflict
but India objects, saying bringing in outside help would reward
terrorism. Clinton has urged Pakistan and India to re-engage on
their own and that there be restraint on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The United States holds out the hope that both Pakistan and
India will sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty this year,
although neither side seems inclined to do so and the U.S. Senate
rejected the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan and India have fought two wars over Kashmir and clashed
again last summer when Pakistan-based fighters seized mountain
peaks inside India. More than 1,000 combatants died before Clinton
persuaded then-Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to withdraw the forces.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said Clinton would tell Pakistan that the United States
is ''worried about the future of Pakistan.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Pakistan, where the per capita income is $441 a year,
has deep-seated economic and political problems, as well as the
problem of terrorist groups operating out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ''And I think that in some way one of the great dangers in this
region is the potential failure of Pakistan,'' Berger said. ''So
the message the president will give in Pakistan is -- you've got to
decide what's important here in terms of your own future.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also said Clinton, particularly in his televised address,
would remind Pakistan of its friendship with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we can turn our back on the Pakistani people
with whom we've had a very strong relationship,'' Berger said.
''But it's a country that is in trouble and really needs to put all
of its energy into self renewal and not territorial conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   ''They don't have the luxury of that,'' Berger said.

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Up, But Not As Bad As 70s  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Oil prices are soaring and OPEC is to blame.
The prospects of $2 per gallon gasoline this summer is real. So
where's the outrage and crisis command center?
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, President Carter, confronted with an oil price
run-up, told the nation it faced ''the moral equivalent of war.''
He set the machinery of government to work with price controls and
gas rationing that produced blocks-long lines at filling stations.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson calls Saudi Arabia -- the
linchpin of any pricing strategy by the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries -- America's good friend and ally. He argues
that the market should rule and that quiet diplomacy is the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must be prudent, not overreact,'' he tells lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The world has indeed changed. Today's oil and gasoline price
shocks have little in common with the Arab oil embargo of 1973 and
the price upheavals of the Carter years in the late 1970s and into
1981.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the '70s, what happened with oil prices was highly charged
and triggered by geopolitics and nationalism. It was seen as
consumer vs. producer, North vs. South, retribution for decades of
exploitation,'' said Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy
Research Associates and author of the ''The Prize,'' a Pulitzer
prize-winning history of the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now the politics and spirit of confrontation has drained out
of the oil markets,'' Yergin said in an interview. ''It's much more
a business of buying and selling to make profits as opposed to
trying to score political shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ebel, an energy and national security expert at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies, said even OPEC's
most militant factions today ''understand they need us just as
badly as we need them.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We give value to their oil,'' said Ebel.
</P>
<P>
   That's what triggered the latest oil crisis: The price of oil in
1998 had plummeted dangerously low as producers, led by Saudi
Arabia, boosted production in anticipation of growing demand from
Asia just as the Asian economy took a dive. The resulting oil glut
drove prices to less than $10 a barrel and prompted OPEC and other
producers such as Mexico and Norway to cut production. Prices
quickly tripled.
</P>
<P>
   That contrasts sharply to the 1970s oil crisis, when the 1973
embargo was in Arab retaliation to U.S. support of Israel, and in
1979 when religious revolutionaries in Iran overthrew the shah, cut
off its oil spigot and kept 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
</P>
<P>
   It was a time when many economists and environmentalists feared
that oil prices of $80 a barrel or more would soon become a
permanent part of the economic landscape. Some worried erroneously
that the world was running out of oil. And the energy efficiency
movement had yet to catch on.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, economic times were tough -- made tougher by the
oil price surge that peaked at $39 a barrel in 1981: double-digit
interest rates, a 9 percent inflation rate and unemployment
approaching 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis mentality prompted a series of government actions
that most economists now acknowledge made things worse: gas
rationing, price controls and a heavy hand of regulation,
interfering in the energy markets.
</P>
<P>
   Today, an economic boom has drowned out the grumbling from the
gas pumps. In February, Americans went on a buying binge, even as
Northeast heating oil prices surged. By March, gas prices averaged
$1.57 nationwide, but the stock market continued moving higher.
</P>
<P>
   ''Economic times are good. There's not a great sense of crisis
mentality. There's a sense of let's not get tied up in knots
here,'' said Paul Portnoy, an economist and president of Resources
for the Future, a Washington think tank.
</P>
<P>
   While prices may go still higher this summer, almost two-thirds
of those asked in a recent CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll said they
believe the high prices will be temporary.
</P>
<P>
   More oil is imported today, 56 percent, than in 1973, 35
percent. But less of it is concentrated in the Middle East. More
important, say economists, the United States is less dependent on
oil today. Once widely used by industry, at power plants and for
heating, oil now plays a modest role in non-transportation sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades ago, oil purchases amounted to 8 percent of all the
goods and services purchased by Americans, compared with 3 percent
today, the Energy Department says.
</P>
<P>
   Even in transportation, where oil still dominates, there have
been dramatic changes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're using more gasoline,'' acknowledged John DeCicco of the
American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy. But because of
efficiency improvements, it's a lot cheaper in terms of miles
traveled.
</P>
<P>
   While $2 gasoline may bring sticker shock, DeCicco said,
motorists today, even after the latest price surge, are paying 8
cents a mile for gasoline. In 1973, they were paying 12 cents a
mile, and in 1979, 16 cents, both figures adjusted for inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, the average car got 13.3 miles per gallon, said
DeCicco. Today, even with the popularity of gas-guzzling sports
utility vehicles, the average is 19.4 miles per gallon.

<HEADLINE> House To Name New Chaplain  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID ESPO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Speaker Dennis Hastert intends to appoint a
Catholic priest as House chaplain, Republican sources said today,
moving to end a controversy that has roiled the House for months
and produced charges of religious bias.
</P>
<P>
   These sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Hastert's appointment was likely as early as today. It would mark
the first time a Roman Catholic has held the post of ministering to
House members and their families.
</P>
<P>
   One source said Hastert's choice, whose name could not be
learned immediately, was a vicar in the Chicago archdiocese, and
has extensive experience in counseling priests.
</P>
<P>
   The way was cleared for the appointment after the Rev. Charles
Wright withdrew, four months after he was picked and a priest, the
Rev. Tim O'Brien, was passed over. The choice sparked allegations
by some Democrats -- vigorously denied as quickly as they were
levelled -- that Republicans were biased against Roman Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, his nomination in limbo for months, offer to resign
earlier in the week in an unannounced meeting with Hastert in the
Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, a Presbyterian minister, could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   John Feehery, Hastert's spokesman, declined all comment on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   But several sources said the speaker and Wright held an
unannounced meeting in the Capitol on Tuesday. They said the
minister decided on his own to offer his withdrawal, without any
pressure from the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Wright's nomination emerged last fall from a bipartisan
committee of lawmakers, but Hastert has the authority to name a
chaplain on his own authority.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have been battered for months by charges of
anti-Catholic bias, first made by O'Brien, a losing candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am convinced that if I were a mainline Protestant minister
and not a Catholic priest, I would be the candidate,'' he said in
an interview in December, and some Democrats also alleged bias.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said O'Brien had been the top pick of the bipartisan
group of lawmakers that sifted through contenders, but Hastert and
Majority Leader Dick Armey turned to Wright instead. The two GOP
leaders said they had been given a list of three finalists -- Wright
and O'Brien included -- but were unaware of any ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans complain that Democratic leader Dick Gephardt first
agreed to Wright's choice, but has since sought to gain political
gain, particularly in view of the fact that Catholics are expected
to account for more than 25 percent of the voters in this fall's
election. In public comments, Gephardt has criticized the selection
process as flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Both Hastert and Armey have strongly denied any anti-Catholic
bias, and Hastert recently told a closed-door meeting of lawmakers
the matter had weighed heavily on him personally.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Republicans have initiated a series of
gestures in recent months that appeared part of an effort to
counter the criticism. These included awarding the Congressional
Gold Medal to an elderly and ill Cardinal John O'Connor of New
York.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Exports Century's Photos  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- There's a shot of a young GI from the Vietnam
War, gazing out soberly from under a camouflage helmet, and another
of two young Hispanic women posing in front of a wall in Brooklyn
full of graffiti.
</P>
<P>
   There's the Easter parade along New York's Fifth Avenue in 1900,
and from the 1990s there's President Clinton playing the saxophone
that a grinning Boris Yeltsin has just given him at the Russian's
country dacha.
</P>
<P>
   All are included in a pictorial record of the United States in
the 20th century that the federal government is sending around the
world. No other century has been chronicled in photographs from
start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   One version, 130 images from the more than 9 million in the
National Archives, goes on exhibit at the agency's headquarters in
downtown Washington on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Old photographs are time machines,'' writes curator Bruce
Bustard in the catalog describing the show. ''Looking at historic
photographs helps us imagine what it was like when the first
airplane took off, when a landing craft ramp fell open on D-day, or
when the first human being stepped on the moon.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the second part of the exhibit. The first part was shown
last year.
</P>
<P>
   A selection from the show opened in Cairo, Egypt, March 13. It
will be shown there and in the nearby port city of Alexandria until
May. Then it goes to Morocco and Syria. Next year, it's scheduled
for eight Indian cities, and in Bahrain, Jerusalem, Kuwait and
Oman. In 2002, it has dates in Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Qatar and
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the pictures were made as Cold War propaganda, like an
almost impossibly white and spotless modern kitchen. The idea was
to show the Soviets the beauty of life in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the dark side is there too.
</P>
<P>
   Ten small boys and girls with their mustachioed superintendent
appear in a Newton, N.C., cotton mill of 1908. John Meintz of
Minnesota -- no town given -- shows the scars on his torso from being
tarred and feathered for failing to take part in a war bond drive
in 1918. Government photographer Dorothea Lange pictures the
despair on a San Francisco bread line in 1933.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the foreign tour, the Smithsonian Institution plans to
take the exhibit to about 20 U.S. cities, beginning in the fall.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Three workers injured in a Pennsville chemical plant explosion  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PENNSVILLE, N.J. (AP) -- An early morning explosion at a Salem
County chemical plant injured three workers, including one in
critical condition with burns to his arms and face.
</P>
<P>
   Two workers at Ganes Chemicals Inc., a manufacturer of
pharmaceutical ingredients, were loading an industrial dryer with a
powdery substance wet with solvents shortly after 4 a.m. Thursday
when the machine exploded, said plant manager William Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Whipkey, 42, of Carneys Point, was in critical condition at
Crozier-Chester Medical Center in Chester, Pa., with burns on 25
percent of his body, a hospital spokeswoman said. Davis said the
''flash and heat'' of the explosion burned Whipkey's arms and face.
</P>
<P>
   There was no sustained fire, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Gillespie, 37, of Pennsville, suffered minor burns to his
face, Davis said. He was treated at Christiana Hospital in Newark,
Del., and released.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Potter, who was working nearby, was ''knocked off his
feet'' by the impact of the explosion. He initially refused medical
treatment and went home, but then told his wife he had trouble
walking, Davis said. A spokeswoman at Christiana Hospital said the
Smyrna, Del., resident was treated and released.
</P>
<P>
   The company closed the building where the incident occurred for
the day, and ceased all dryer operations until an internal
investigation is complete.
</P>
<P>
   No criminal charges have been filed, said Pennsville Police Lt.
Kelly O'Rourke.

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybean Futures Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures fell sharply Thursday
on the Chicago Board of Trade as a storm system moving across the
central United States provided welcome moisture for dry soil.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat prices were hardest hit, the result of heavy rains that
soaked the winter wheat belt before heading east. Lackluster weekly
export sales figures reported by the U.S. Department of Agriculture
also pressured the market.
</P>
<P>
   Corn followed wheat's lead, with the wet weather headed next for
the western corn belt. Sluggishness in weekly export sales
contributed to the decline.
</P>
<P>
   Soybeans fell to a two-week low, with the showers due to enter
soybean growing regions Thursday night and expected to continue
into the eastern Midwest this weekend. As with other farm
commodities, soybean export sales figures failed to meet market
expectations, putting additional pressure on prices.
</P>
<P>
   Wheat for May delivery fell 5{ cents to $2.56\ a bushel; May
corn fell 4\ cents to $2.30\ a bushel; May oats fell 2\ cents to
$1.19} a bushel; May soybeans fell 9 cents to $5.22 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
   Beef and pork futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   April live cattle fell .10 cent to 73.02 cents a pound; May
feeder cattle rose .15 cent to 84.27 cents a pound; April lean hogs
were unchanged at 62.52 cents a pound; May pork bellies rose .18
cent to 88.80 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Ambassador Criticizes Albright  </HEADLINE>
By CLARE NULLIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- Cuba's U.N. ambassador compared Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright to Snow White's evil stepmother Thursday after
Albright urged the U.N. Human Rights Commission to condemn abuses
by Fidel Castro's government.
</P>
<P>
   Albright told the 53-nation commission that ''the Castro regime
continues to suppress dissent, deny free speech, outlaw free
assembly and harass human rights advocates'' and others.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban Ambassador Carlos Amat dismissed Albright's proclaimed
concern for human rights, ribbing her and her colleagues for their
infrequent attendance at U.N. rights meetings. The last time a top
U.S. official attended was in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to the children's fairy tale, he said Albright -- who
had already left the hall after giving her 15-minute speech -- was
like the stepmother with the ''poisoned apple in Snow White.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It would appear the secretary of state came to this commission
to kill or destroy all the efforts we are making to uphold the
credibility of this commission,'' Amat said.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about rights violations in the United States, Amat
referred to the stepmother asking the mirror on the wall who was
the fairest one of all.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you asked the mirror what is the most beautiful country in
the world, the mirror would refuse to tell you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States routinely tries to push through criticism of
Cuba's record at the U.N. commission's annual meeting under a
procedure reserved for serious offenders like Iraq, Myanmar and
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the commission voiced concern ''at the continued
violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms in Cuba, such as
freedom of expression, association and assembly and rights
associated with the administration of justice.'' But the vote was a
narrow one: 21-20 with 12 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba hoped that it might be let off easy this year, but Albright
urged countries to back a new resolution drafted by the Czech
Republic and Poland.
</P>
<P>
   As she addressed the packed commission chamber, the four-member
Cuban delegation exchanged knowing smiles and quiet jokes with each
other -- their relaxed manner in marked contrast to the walkout by
Chinese diplomats to protest Albright's criticism of Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Senate Approves Crop Insurance Bill  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to induce more farmers to buy federally
subsidized crop insurance, the Senate overwhelmingly agreed
Thursday to sharply reduce premiums and cover new commodities. The
changes would cost taxpayers $1.5 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to cutting premiums by as much as half on some
policies, legislation that passed 95-5 would offer insurance for
the first time to livestock producers and expand coverage for fruit
and vegetable growers. A House-Senate conference committee will
work out differences between this bill and a similar measure that
passed the House last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department says the legislation could pay for
itself by making farmers less dependent on federal disaster
assistance and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Under this legislation, there will be enough incentives for
farmers to participate at high levels that in a future disaster the
need for disaster aid will drop significantly,'' said Ken Ackerman,
administrator of USDA's Risk Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has approved $15 billion in emergency aid over the past
two years to compensate growers for weather-related crop losses and
a slump in commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
   The government already spends $2 billion a year on the insurance
program, which has tripled in size since the early 1990s. But many
farmers, especially in the South and East, say the coverage isn't
worth the cost of the premiums at current subsidy levels. Premiums
average $7 an acre nationwide but vary widely depending on the
crop, location and deductible. About two-thirds of the eligible
acreage nationwide was insured last year.
</P>
<P>
   The policies, which are sold through private companies, can be
purchased to protect farmers from weather-related losses as well as
drops in commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''Crop insurance is obviously an extremely vital part not only
of a safety net to guarantee income, but also as part of an overall
marketing strategy'' for farmers, said Senate Agriculture Committee
Chairman Richard Lugar, R-Ind.
</P>
<P>
   The government now pays 13 percent to 57 percent of a farmer's
premium, depending on the level of coverage. Under the Senate bill,
the government's share on most policies would range from 45 percent
to 60 percent. The House bill would have the government pay 31
percent to 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Both bills would provide improved coverage for farmers who have
reported a series of crop losses.
</P>
<P>
   A key sticking point in upcoming House-Senate negotiations could
be a $500 million pilot project in the Senate bill that would let
some farmers get a cash payment from the government in lieu of the
subsidized insurance.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, in a letter to
senators this week, said the bill ''represents real progress'' but
raised several concerns about the measure, including a provision
that would reduce USDA's role on a board that oversees the program.
Under the legislation, the chairman must be from the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
   ''Establishing a major government program with a $32 billion
liability for which the taxpayers are ultimately responsible, under
the control of a part-time board not supervised by any government
official who is accountable to the taxpayers, and with a built-in
conflict of interest, disrupts channels of responsibility and
destroys financial and political oversight,'' Glickman wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Senators from the Northeast insisted on setting aside $126
million in the legislation to help farmers in their region get the
insurance. Few farmers in that region now buy the coverage,
including only 8 percent of producers in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation is ''going to have to be viewed by people all
across the country as having something that's going to benefit
them,'' said House Agriculture Committee Chairman Larry Combest,
R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Five Republicans voted against the Senate bill: Majority Leader
Trent Lott of Mississippi and Sens. Thad Cochran of Mississippi,
Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, John McCain of Arizona and Jon Kyl of
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 2559.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Kohl Official Alleges Wrongdoing  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Ex-Chancellor Helmut Kohl was personally involved
in firing a party official in the 1980s who refused to sign a
questionable financial report, the former official told parliament
investigators Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The parliament investigating committee also issued its first
penalties Thursday, levying the maximum $500 fine on two key
figures for refusing to answer questions in the scandal over the
Christian Democrats' anonymous donations, secret accounts and
falsified financial reports.
</P>
<P>
   Ruediger May, former head of the party's financial office, said
that in 1989 he had questioned a $400,000 charge for postal fees
for a letter Kohl sent to all party members.
</P>
<P>
   May said he was given a check from an account he hadn't
previously known about to cover the charge and listed the money
under ''special revenue.'' He said he received the check from Horst
Weyrauch -- the party's longtime financial adviser and a key figure
in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   When he asked where the money came from, he said he was told:
''You don't have to know everything.''
</P>
<P>
   May said he later refused to sign the party's financial report
and sent a note to party leaders retelling what happened. He was
fired a short time later. He said he was told by the party's
secretary general at that time, Volker Ruehe, that Kohl had ordered
him fired.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl has admitted accepting up to $1 million in anonymous -- and
therefore illegal -- donations during the 1990s. But he has denied
knowledge of the alleged extensive system of slush funds and
off-the-books cash that traded hands in the Christian Democratic
party during his 25 years as its chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl himself has raised almost $3.5 million to cover fines
anticipated for his illegal donations. The party also faces a $20.5
million fine for a falsified 1998 financial report, and could face
more.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers looking into influence-peddling allegations under Kohl
imposed a fine on Weyrauch on Thursday when for a second time he
refused the answer their questions, citing the right against
self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Also fined was Hans Terlinden, a former party office manager in
Bonn. He read a prepared statement to the committee in which he
said that between 1983-98 he had ''several times received money for
the CDU'' from Kohl ''and correctly transferred it further.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not know the source of the money, and could not
discount that he himself had accepted donations for the party. He
said he regretted it if this led to violations of party financing
laws.
</P>
<P>
   He then refused to answer any questions and was fined. The
committee said he also faced possible jail time if he refuses to
testify when called again April 6.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Terlinden and Weyrauch said they would appeal the
fines.

<HEADLINE> Putin Mends Rift Before Election  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Acting President Vladimir Putin toured Moscow
Thursday with the capital's powerful mayor, a former adversary who
Putin praised in a move to end the longtime rift before elections
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''What has been done in Moscow causes respect,'' Putin told
reporters during a viewing of some of Mayor Yuri Luzhkov's latest
projects. Luzhkov enjoys wide popularity for his efforts to
refurbish the sprawling, often shabby capital.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-election polls have shown Putin with a substantial lead over
the 10 other candidates, but it is unclear whether he has enough
support to nail a first-round victory Sunday. That would require
more than 50 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Mending fences with Luzhkov could increase Putin's chances of
winning without a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov has been locked in a bitter feud with the Kremlin ever
since he was considered a leading presidential candidate. Luzhkov
abandoned his presidential bid after his party was routed in
December's parliamentary elections by a Kremlin-backed party.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov, although initially critical of Putin after he rose to
the presidency upon Boris Yeltsin's Dec. 31 resignation, has since
moderated his opposition. He recently voiced support for Putin and
accompanied the acting president on several official trips.
</P>
<P>
   Putin in turn has praised Luzhkov's leadership and on Thursday
accepted his invitation to discuss Moscow's problems.
</P>
<P>
   The trip went smoothly except for a visit to a subway station
under construction where a blackout left Putin, Luzhkov and their
retinue in pitch darkness and subway workers had to light the scene
with flashlights.
</P>
<P>
   Despite protestations that he is too busy with official duties
to campaign, Putin has proven a tireless and effective campaigner.
</P>
<P>
   He began the week with a sudden trip to Chechnya in a fighter
jet on Monday, then went on a three-day tour along the Volga River,
stopping in several cities and targeting separate interest groups
at each stop.
</P>
<P>
   The trip included stopovers in the republics of Tatarstan and
Bashkortostan, whose streaks of independence have long vexed the
Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Putin claimed victory, saying both republics agreed to
voluntarily end their defiance of the federal law and turn over
more revenues to the federal coffers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The strengthening of the Russian state is an absolute
priority,'' Putin said at a Cabinet session Thursday. ''A single
legal space is essential to make the country attractive for
investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said 983 foreign
observers have arrived to monitor the elections.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Minister Questioned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Police questioned Transport Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai for nine hours Thursday, indicating he might face charges
of sexually assaulting a young worker in his office.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai, head of the small Center Party, was summoned to
police headquarters in Jerusalem and told he was being interrogated
under warning, a term that means that police might recommend
bringing charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the 23-year-old worker, whose name has not been made
public, was brought to police headquarters. Israel radio reported
that police brought them face to face to test their stories.
Mordechai has denied all wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The worker was interrogated extensively after filing the
complaint March 6. Police also questioned other members of
Mordechai's staff.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai took leave from office after police decided to open
the inquiry into the worker's charges. She alleged that on Feb. 25,
Mordechai summoned her to his office, flung her onto a sofa,
slipped his hand under her blouse and fondled her, her lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Mordechai, a career army officer before entering politics,
served as defense minister under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu,
leaving his government to challenge him for the premiership in last
year's election. He dropped out the day before the voting, trailing
in the polls far behind Netanyahu and Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   After Barak won the election, Mordechai led his party into
Barak's coalition government. He was named transport minister and
deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   A decision over whether to indict Mordechai is to be made by the
attorney general after the police finish their investigation.
Mordechai is likely to be interrogated again, Israel radio
reported.

<HEADLINE> European Stocks Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Retail stocks led a decline in European shares
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks companies in
countries that joined the single currency, ended down 3.10 points
at 443.60. The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index was down 9.2 points at
5,259.2 and the Dow Jones Stoxx 50 Index down 10.1 points at
5,060.1.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Sweden's Hennes and Mauritz plunged 30 percent
following the surprise announcement that its chief executive
officer, Fabian Maansson, was resigning and that first-quarter
pretax profit had fallen.
</P>
<P>
   This rocked confidence elsewhere in the retail sector.
</P>
<P>
   Stockholm's General Index ended down 2.1 percent, while the Dow
Jones Stoxx Index of shares in European companies fell 2.33 points,
or 0.6 percent, to 394.00, and the retail subindex underperformed
all others, closing down 5.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among other weak retailers, GUS was down 5.0 percent and
Kingfisher fell 3.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fears that the European Central Bank and the Bank of England
will increase rates aggressively in coming weeks, were eased by
weaker-than-expected German producer prices data and a report on
March monthly U.K. trends from the Confederation of British
Industry.
</P>
<P>
   Producer prices in Germany rose 0.2 percent on the month and
were up 2.4 percent on the year in February, against analysts'
expectations of 0.4 percent and 2.6 percent rises, respectively.
Excluding mineral oil prices, the index rose only 0.7 percent on
the year and was flat on the month.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturing orders in Britain were weaker in March but the
outlook among producers is more positive than in the first half of
1999, according to the CBI's Industrial Trends survey.
</P>
<P>
   London's FTSE-100 Share Index fell 0.2 percent to 6,594.6.
Frankfurt's Xetra DAX Index fell 1.3 percent to 7,694.78, dragged
down by BMW and SAP, while the Paris CAC-40 Index was down 0.2
percent to 6,268.31.
</P>
<P>
   Milan's MIBtel Index fell 0.2 percent to 32,086, Amsterdam's AEX
Index was down 1.1 percent to 671.89 and Belgium's Bel-20 Index was
up 0.6 percent to 2,907.93.

<HEADLINE> Mr. Potato Head Ads Crop Up in R.I.  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID RISING, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Mr. Potato Head, the plastic spud with
the interchangeable features, has been selected as the symbol of a
new state tourism campaign. Not by the state of Idaho, but Rhode
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Potato Head is a homegrown spud, produced by Pawtucket-based
toymaker Hasbro Inc. And as part of a campaign dubbed ''Rhode
Island -- The Birthplace of Fun,'' 6-foot statues of him will greet
visitors around the state.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising campaign will also include ads in national
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Lincoln Almond held a mock swearing-in ceremony Thursday,
naming the toy the state's official travel ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   ''With Mr. Potato Head sprouting up in our communities, Rhode
Island will peel ahead of the crop when it comes to attracting
visitors from around the world,'' Almond said.
</P>
<P>
   But what about Idaho, where spuds come in 50-pound bags rather
than 160-pound statues?
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not trying to usurp their territory,'' said Becky Bovell
of the Rhode Island Economic Development Corp.'s tourism division.
''I think that they're safe in that their potatoes are to be
consumed and ours are to be enjoyed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mr. Potato Head statues were designed by local artists with
different themes. The first 20 will go up over several days,
followed by another 20 or more as corporate sponsors sign on.
</P>
<P>
   There's Salty Spud, dressed in orange raingear with a fishing
net in one hand. There's one covered in sand with seaweed hair,
starfish eyes and a mouth of shells. Another wears horn-rimmed
sunglasses and a bikini.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought, I can't do this, it's ridiculous. We were laughing
all day,'' said artist Linda Dewing, who created The Independent
Potato, a golden spud leaning on an anchor and designed to look
like the state symbol, The Independent Man.
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro sponsored one of the statues, donated many of the toys
for giveaways and waived licensing fees for use of the spud's
likeness. The state contributed $200,000 for advertising and other
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign comes at a time when Hasbro is working to make Mr.
Potato Head its corporate symbol. Mr. Potato Head, first made in
1952, was one of Hasbro's first toys and has seen a burst in
popularity from its role in the ''Toy Story'' movies.
</P>
<P>
   ''What Mickey and Minnie Mouse are to Disney, Mr. and Mrs.
Potato Head will be to Hasbro,'' company presient Herbert Baum
said.

<HEADLINE> Mixed Reaction to Pope's Message  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The extraordinary symbolism of a Roman Catholic
pope paying his respects at Israel's Holocaust memorial moved many
Jews -- although some said John Paul II's words on Thursday fell
short of the apology they had hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   Israel Meir Lau, the Jewish state's chief rabbi, said he had
wanted the pontiff to at least implicitly criticize the wartime
pope, Pius XII, for failing to speak out during the Nazi genocide.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need the condemning of the silence of some during World War
II,'' Lau said, ''not for the victims, not for the survivors even
but for the future, for the young generations to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Efraim Zuroff, head of the Israeli office of the Los
Angeles-based Simon Wiesenthal Center, said the speech ''left a lot
to be desired,'' particularly in blaming what the pope called the
''godless ideology'' of the Nazis for the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   That ''shirked responsibility for the teachings of the Catholic
church, which helped create the conditions which lead to the
Holocaust,'' Zuroff said.
</P>
<P>
   Others Jewish leaders, though, were awed by the sight of the
frail 79-year-old John Paul greeting rabbis and listening intently
as a cantor intoned a prayer for the dead at Yad Vashem. Some
lauded the pope, who has made efforts to reconcile Christians and
Jews throughout his 22-year papacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''It went very far in spirit,'' said Malcolm Hoenlein, the
director of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish
Organizations in a phone interview from New York. ''It is something
that would have been unthinkable not long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Haim Ramon, the government minister who is organizing the
Israeli end of the papal pilgrimage, said the pope's speech was
''another milestone in the relationship between the Catholic Church
and the state of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   At a reception for the pope Thursday, about 30 rabbis rushed
forward to greet him. Black-hatted rabbis mingled with
pink-skullcapped cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ''For many rabbis, it wasn't an easy step to take,'' said Chief
Rabbinate official Daniel Sperber. ''But I think that the mere fact
that the pope came to meet the chief rabbis, rather than the rabbis
coming to the pope, and thus displayed good Christian virtues like
humbleness and meekness, was a very important move.''
</P>
<P>
   John Paul nudged a deeply conservative Vatican into formally
recognizing Israel in 1994. More recently, he has asked God's
pardon for crimes visited upon the Jews by followers of the church.
</P>
<P>
   That, and the speech at Yad Vashem, led many to say that
expecting more from the pope was missing the point.
</P>
<P>
   ''One cannot ask for more,'' said Miriam Papish, a Polish Jew
who lost her whole family in the death camps. She watched the pope
in her tiny pensioner's apartment overlooking Jerusalem's gray,
sculpted hills, a box of tissues within handy reach. ''He has
already done so much by coming here, to Yad Vashem.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Eric Yoffie -- head of the Union of American Hebrew
Congregations, Reform Judaism's synagogue grouping -- had mixed
feelings. On the one hand, he said, ''if every step forward is
greeted with an attack, there is little incentive for additional
steps to be taken.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said he ''simply cannot understand the
failure of the pope to speak out.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Assets of the nation's retail money market
mutual funds rose by $891.1 million in the latest week to $998.37
billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Assets of taxable money market funds in the retail category fell
by $320.5 million to $829.70 billion for the week ended Wednesday,
the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. Tax-exempt fund
assets rose by $1.21 billion to $168.67 billion.

taxable money market fund assets rose by $3.18 billion to $658.18
billion; assets of tax-exempt funds fell by $289.0 million to
$52.04 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Total money market assets stood at $1.709 trillion for the week.
</P>
<P>
   Assets for the previous week were revised to $1.705 trillion to
reflect reporting errors and a change in the number of funds
reporting.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 5.32 percent from 5.28 percent the
previous week, said IBC's Money Fund Report, a trade journal
published in Ashland, Mass., by IBC Financial Data Inc. The 30-day
average yield rose to 5.28 percent from 5.26 percent, IBC Financial
Data said.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-day compounded yield rose to 5.46 percent from 5.42
percent the previous week, and the 30-day compounded yield rose to
5.42 percent from 5.40 percent, IBC Financial Data said.
</P>
<P>
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
48 days, unchanged from the previous week, IBC Financial Data said.
</P>
<P>
   The online service bankrate.com said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the annual percentage
yield available on money market accounts was 2.04 percent as of
Wednesday unchanged from a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based unit of Intelligent Life Corp.
said the annual percentage yield available on interest-bearing
checking accounts was 0.82 percent, down from 0.83 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bankrate.com said the annual percentage yield was 4.85 percent
on six-month certificates of deposit, unchanged from the previous
week. Yields were 5.31 percent on 1-year CDs, up from 5.28 percent;
5.56 percent on 2{-year CDs, unchanged; and 5.95 percent on 5-year
CDs, up from 5.93 percent.

<HEADLINE> Al-Amin Lawyers: Unfair Treatment  </HEADLINE>
By ASHLEY ESTES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Attorneys for Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin
refused to waive his extradition to Georgia in the slaying of a
deputy, and told a state judge Thursday the 1960s black militant
known as H. Rap Brown is being treated unfairly by jailers.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer J.L. Chestnut told the court ''hysteria and paranoia''
have surrounded Al-Amin's arrest and confinement. He is being
locked up 23 hours a day and allowed only an hour to make phone
calls, Chestnut said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is it because he's black? Or is it something he said 30 years
ago?'' Chestnut asked after the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin, 56, was a prominent black militant who split from the
nonviolent civil rights crusade in the 1960s. He served a five-year
sentence for an armed robbery in New York, but associates have said
his conversion to the Muslim faith changed his focus.
</P>
<P>
   ''His attitude, from the moment of his arrest, can only be
described as passive,'' Chestnut told Montgomery County District
Judge Lynn Bright.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Amin is charged in Georgia with murder and aggravated assault
in the March 16 shooting that killed Fulton County Deputy Ricky
Kinchen and wounded Deputy Aldranon English.
</P>
<P>
   The deputies were shot while trying to serve Al-Amin with a
warrant at his Atlanta grocery store, officials have said. Al-Amin
was captured four days later at a rural Alabama site west of
Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said Al-Amin was being held without bond and advised
him of his rights, including the right to waive extradition. But
Chestnut told the court Al-Amin would fight any attempt by Georgia
to bring him back.
</P>
<P>
   An extradition request from Georgia is not expected unless a
grand jury returns an indictment, officials have said. The next
grand jury convenes Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a black-and-white striped inmate's uniform, Al-Amin
nodded when Bright asked him if he understood the charges against
him.
</P>
<P>
   Another defense lawyer, Rose Sanders, said she would like a
probable cause hearing ''as quickly as possible'' so authorities
can present their case against Al-Amin. A hearing has not been
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, Chestnut said he believes Al-Amin's
claim that he is the victim of a government conspiracy, but the
defense lawyer did not raise the claim during the brief court
proceeding. There has been no elaboration from the defense on the
conspiracy claim.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, several members of a group called the Malcolm X
Grassroots Movement distributed flyers supporting Al-Amin.
</P>
<P>
   ''(Al-Amin) has never stopped fighting for our people's
rights,'' it read. ''That's why the government's been trying to
frame him for 30 years. Don't let them win now.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some Muslim residents of the Lowndes County town of
White Hall, where Al-Amin was captured Monday, complained about
their treatment at the hands of authorities during the search.
</P>
<P>
   Clarence Rasheed was one of four people detained after a black
Cadillac was stopped by authorities during the hunt for Al-Amin. He
said they had not seen Al-Amin for weeks, but the FBI said an
investigation was continuing into who may have aided the fugitive
during his flight.
</P>
<P>
   At the court hearing in Montgomery, Sanders asked Bright if
Al-Amin could attend Muslim services Friday, which are usually held
in the jail.
</P>
<P>
   Bright told the attorneys to take up his jail treatment with
Sheriff D.T. Marshall or file a court petition.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 253.16; Nasdaq Up 75.94  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks advanced broadly today, carrying the Dow
over 11,000 for the first time in seven weeks, as a rally in
high-tech issues spread throughout Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft touched off the advance after The Wall Street Journal
reported that the software maker and the government were
accelerating talks toward resolving their longstanding antitrust
case.
</P>
<P>
   The advance, which also drove the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
into record territory for the third straight day, cemented a
stunning comeback by the Dow, which had closed as low as 9,811.24
just last week.
</P>
<P>
   According to preliminary calculations, the Dow Jones industrial
average rose 253.16 today to 11,119.86. It last closed above 11,000
on Feb. 3.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech dominated Nasdaq composite index rose 75.94 to
4,940.69, while the S&AMP;P 500, which surpassed 1,500 for the first
time on Wednesday, gained another 26.71 to 1,527.35.
</P>
<P>
   The rally lifted industrial blue chips as fund managers
scrambled to put their cash to work in the stock market before the
end of the first quarter next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a very strong quarter in terms of tech stocks as
well as flows into mutual funds, so there's a lot of pressure on
fund managers to be fully invested by the end of the quarter,''
said Ricky Harrington, technical analyst at Wachovia Securities in
Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   But the real stars of the day were the major high-tech shares,
which shot higher from the opening following a report in the
Journal that Microsoft and the government are moving forward in
their talks aimed at settling the government's antitrust case
against the software maker.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was up sharply as were many other big-name technology
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   A sharp rally in the bond market was also making its presence
felt on Wall Street. With fewer places to put their money and
long-term bond yields having fallen in recent weeks, fund managers
were looking again at stocks to buy in order to put their cash to
work by the end of the quarter.

<HEADLINE> Anti-abortion leader eyes Senate race; third parties considercoalition  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Anti-abortion activist and Operation Rescue
founder Randall Terry said Thursday he may get into New York's
Senate race, even as a spoiler, because Republican Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani ''is a threat to the pro-life movement.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I would rather see a pro-abortion Democrat in office than a
pro-abortion Republican,'' said Terry, who lost a 1998 Republican
primary to run for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Both Giuliani and Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton are abortion
rights supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, former state Attorney General Dennis Vacco, a
Giuliani supporter, said he has been urged by friends to consider
entering the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's tempting to the extent that I believe I still have
something to contribute ... I have a sense of having left with
unfinished business,'' said Vacco, who narrowly lost his bid for a
second term in 1998 to Democrat Eliot Spitzer.
</P>
<P>
   But Vacco, now a waste industry executive, said ''at this stage,
it's a little bit too late for a new entrant into this race ... As
the old saying goes, timing is everything in politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, the head of the state Conservative Party said he
has opened talks with leaders of two other third parties in New
York -- the Ross Perot-inspired Independence Party and the
anti-abortion Right to Life Party -- about fielding a fusion
candidate to challenge Clinton and Giuliani for the Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a real possibility that we could put a person on the
(Conservative Party) line that would have three lines,'' Michael
Long said. ''That would change the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Long met with leaders of the Independence Party -- which is the
New York arm of the Reform Party -- and the Right to Life Party
recently at a Brooklyn restaurant. The talk centered on fielding an
anti-abortion candidate who could appeal to all three parties.
</P>
<P>
   One source familiar with the restaurant summit, and speaking
only on condition of anonymity, said that among the potential
candidates discussed were former U.S. Rep. Joseph DioGuardi of
Westchester County, a Republican, and former Watertown Mayor Jeff
Graham, an Independence Party leader.
</P>
<P>
   Third parties are particularly important in New York this year
with polls showing Giuliani and Clinton in a close contest.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican candidate running for statewide office in New York
has won without the backing of the Conservative Party in 25 years.
Such backing can be crucial in a close race because unlike other
states, New York allows major party candidates to add third-party
votes to their totals when determining a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Long has insisted that for Giuliani to have Conservative Party
backing, he must support a ban on what critics call ''partial-birth
abortion.'' The New York City mayor has refused to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Independence Party leaders are inviting Clinton, Giuliani and
other potential Senate candidates to a forum in Buffalo on April 29
to discuss individually why they should be given the party's
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   Terry said he will make a decision about running for the Senate
by the beginning of May. The anti-abortion activist said that

   ''Frankly, the Vermont fight is a more important one than this

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks advanced broadly today, carrying the Dow
over 11,000 for the first time in seven weeks, as a rally in

   Unemployment Rises by 4,000
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New claims for unemployment benefits ticked up
last week but were still in a range economists said indicated
employers are having trouble finding qualified workers. The Labor
Department said today that the number of Americans filing new
claims for unemployment benefits rose by 4,000 to 266,000 for the
week ending March 18. That was a smaller increase than many
analysts were expecting. Meanwhile, the more stable four-week
moving average of claims, which smoothes out week-to-week
volatility, fell slightly last week to 271,000, the lowest level
since Dec. 15, 1973, when such claims were at 256,750.

   Govt. Open To Microsoft Punishment
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department appears to be
retreating from demands in secret negotiations to break up the
Microsoft Corp., a concession that would dramatically improve
chances for settling the landmark antitrust case. Microsoft has
indicated it will not accept any settlement that divides the
company, and U.S. Assistant Attorney General Joel I. Klein believes
such a punishment may not be necessary to adequately restrain what
the trial judge characterized as Microsoft's monopoly power over
the technology industry, said two people close to the case,
speaking on condition of anonymity. Shares of Microsoft were at
111~, up 8|.

   EU Extends Vodafone Probe Deadline
</P>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Commission extended the
deadline for a decision in its antitrust probe into Vodafone
Airtouch PLC's planned takeover of Germany's Mannesmann AG by about
a week until April 11 or 12. The deal, valued at $180 billion when
it was announced in February, would be the biggest corporate merger
to date. The extension from the previous April 4 deadline gives the
European Union executive body more time to look into ''new
undertakings'' from the companies, Commission spokesman Michael
Tscherny said today. He declined to give details, but said they
concerned British mobile phone company Orange PLC, which is owned
by Mannesmann. Vodafone is Britain's largest mobile phone company
and Orange is the third biggest, so combining them may violate both
EU and British antitrust rules.

   GM Reducing Some Saturn Models
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. says it will reduce
production of the Saturn L-series sedans and wagons through the end
of May due to sluggish sales. The Wilmington, Del., plant where GM
builds the midsize sedans will begin idling one of its two shifts
on March 27 through May 30. GM said today it will alternate idling
the first or second shift every week. The 1,200 workers at the
plant will receive their normal pay while they're not working.
Saturn spokeswoman Sue Mallino declined to give an estimate of
exactly how much production would be cut. The plant is capable of
building 200,000 vehicles a year; Saturn has sold 10,643 L-series
sedans and wagons through February.

Morgan Stanley's net income, which translates to $1.34 a share,
compared with $1.04 billion, or 88 cents a share, a year earlier.
Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had estimated
that the New York-based securities firm and investment bank would

<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Bausch &AMP; Lomb Inc. offered today to buy
Illinois-based Wesley Jessen VisionCare Inc. for about $600 million
to gain ground in the color contact lens market. The $34-a-share
bid could thwart Wesley Jessen's planned acquisition of Ocular
Sciences Inc., a rival contact lens maker in San Francisco. Wesley
Jessen of Des Plaines, Ill., said Monday it had agreed to buy
Ocular Sciences for about $18 a share, or $413 million. Bausch &AMP;
Lomb said it was interested only in buying Wesley Jessen and not
Ocular Sciences. Its proposed merger would expand Bausch &AMP; Lomb's
contact lens revenues of $488 million in 1999 by more than $300
million. Shares of Bausch &AMP; Lomb were at 55 5/10, down }.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Two Wall Street brokerage firms where sexual

General Eliot Spitzer, harassed female workers and minority
employees subjected to sexual or racial epithets are eligible for a
financial settlement from Garban LLC and its affiliated firm,
Garvin Guy Butler. The deal allows female and minority workers who

<HEADLINE> Interfaith Talk Less Than Peaceful  </HEADLINE>
By JULIA LIEBLICH, AP Religion Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The dialogue with Pope John Paul II was
supposed to promote harmony between Muslims, Christians, and Jews.
But the Muslim cleric railed against Israel before walking off the
stage, leaving the pope and a rabbi alone to plant a tree for
peace.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Rabbi Israel Meir Lau, Sheik Taysir Tamimi and the pope
met Thursday at a Catholic conference and study center in
Jerusalem, where the pope called for ''closer ties among all
believers.''
</P>
<P>
   Those ties became strained, though, when the Jewish and Muslim
leaders mixed politics with religion.
</P>
<P>
   Lau, Tamimi and the pope began the evening sitting in
throne-like chairs on a stage in front of a mural of a dove flying
over Jerusalem. Choruses of Muslim, Christian, and Jewish
schoolchildren sang songs of peace in the Pontifical Institute of
Notre Dame, formerly on the border of east and west Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ''Religion is not, and must not become, an excuse for violence,
particularly when religious identity coincides with cultural and
ethnic identity'' said the pope.
</P>
<P>
   But Lau drew a heckler when he said the pope's visit indicated
the recognition of Jerusalem as ''a united capital eternal city''
for Israel; Palestinians claim part of Jerusalem as their own
capital. And Tamimi, deputy chief justice of the Palestinian
Islamic courts, gave an angry litany of Israeli aggression against
Palestinians, including confiscation of land and Israeli occupation
of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi David Rosen, an interfaith activist with strong ties to
the Vatican, said Lau's comments ''were less than tactful.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But I think the sheik outdid him in inappropriateness,'' Rosen
said. ''This is normal for those of us involved in interfaith
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Palestinians applauded during Tamimi's talk, but the
response from the audience was mixed. Sister Hortense Nakhleh of
the Rosary Sisters school in Jerusalem said many Palestinian
Christians who work for peace were offended.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the beginning of each encounter between religions, we
expect some explosions, but not in the presence of the pope,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kitty Cohen, a veteran of interreligious work, said dialogue
remains possible between the sides, but not by religious leaders
with political agendas.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks Thursday night, the pope called on Christians,
Muslims and Jews to ''find in our respective religious traditions
the wisdom and the superior motivation to ensure the triumph of
mutual understanding and cordial respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Religion, he said, ''is the enemy of exclusion and
discrimination, of hatred and rivalry or violence and conflict. ...
We must do all we can to turn awareness of past offenses and sins
into a firm resolve to build a new future in which there will be
nothing but respectful and fruitful cooperation between us.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, Cardinal Edward I. Cassidy, the Vatican official in
charge of interreligious dialogue, summed up the night: ''Nothing
is perfect in a situation like this. But that we could have it at
all was already something.''

<HEADLINE> OPEC Expected To Boost Output  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE STANLEY, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- OPEC oil ministers are widely expected to reach an
agreement next week that would boost petroleum supplies to thirsty
importers.
</P>
<P>
   But the crucial, unanswered question remains whether OPEC
countries will pump crude in sufficient quantities to ease oil
prices down from the highest levels since the 1991 Persian Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has been
under intense pressure from the United States to relax year-old
production quotas that have caused prices for crude and refined
products such as gasoline to skyrocket.
</P>
<P>
   American motorists now pay an average of $1.54 per gallon for
unleaded gasoline, an increase of 57.3 cents since last March,
according to a recent survey conducted for the AAA auto club.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts are warning of possible shortages and
$2-a-gallon gasduring the peak driving season this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Oil ministers for the 11 OPEC countries are to meet Monday in
Vienna, Austria, for their semiannual review of global oil markets.
</P>
<P>
   Saudi Arabia, OPEC's No. 1 exporter, has expressed interest in
stabilizing prices at a level that won't cause extreme economic
pain for the countries that buy its oil.
</P>
<P>
   If high oil prices start bringing down economies, producers
fear, demand for oil will plunge, and OPEC revenue from crude oil
sales could quickly shrink.
</P>
<P>
   Other members of the cartel have echoed the call for price
stability. Even Iran, long a hawkish supporter of high prices, now
appears to back some form of a production increase.
</P>
<P>
   But OPEC has not shown willingness to boost production by the 2
million-2.5 million barrels per day that the United States and
other industrial powers are hoping for.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, analysts predict that OPEC will raise its daily output
by little more than 1 million barrels. Many say this won't be
enough to simultaneously replenish depleted oil inventories, meet
seasonal needs for gasoline and push down prices.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's unlikely that OPEC will simply agree to what the
West is asking for,'' warns Charlie Sharp of the London brokerage
T. Hoare Canaccord.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC produces more than 26 million barrels of crude each day, or
about 35 percent of the world's supply.
</P>
<P>
   Non-OPEC producers that have cut output in tandem with the
cartel, including Mexico and Norway, favor an increase in
production but are waiting to see what OPEC does.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, OPEC is a victim of it own success in reviving
prices from the doldrums of late 1998, when crude sagged to less
than $11 per barrel.
</P>
<P>
   After prices failed to respond to two rounds of production cuts
earlier that year, OPEC finally got results in March 1999 when it
trimmed output by an additional 2.1 million barrels per day,
reducing the global supply by 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Crude prices more than tripled as a result, peaking in the
United States on March 8 at $34.37 per barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for home heating oil and gasoline have soared, creating
what Peter Gignoux, head of the petroleum desk for Salomon Smith
Barney, calls ''an oil-shock quarter'' for the first three months
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has been meeting with
officials of oil-producing nations to stress America's displeasure
with costlier crude.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said Wednesday that if OPEC doesn't act to bring down
prices, the United States would reserve the option of dipping into
its own strategic petroleum stockpile.
</P>
<P>
   OPEC Secretary-General Rilwanu Lukman said Wednesday that it is
unfair to assume that the Vienna meeting will result in increased
output.
</P>
<P>
   However, other OPEC sources and industry analysts believe that a
decision to boost production is likely.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there is a consensus over major issues,'' says Raad
Alkadiri of the Petroleum Finance Co., a consulting firm based in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   One complication is that OPEC members already are cheating on
their own quotas, overproducing by at least 1 million barrels per
day. OPEC's compliance rate with its cuts of last March has slipped
from a high of 91 percent in July to 74 percent in February,
according to the Paris-based International Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Any increase in production must somehow account for these
''unofficial'' barrels, which have benefitted consumers by helping
to moderate the spike in prices.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp of T. Hoare Canaccord suggests that OPEC might decide to
let its compliance rate slip to perhaps 60 percent, in addition to
increasing its official production.
</P>
<P>
   ''That effectively would create a softish landing in the oil
price,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipation that OPEC will open its taps further has caused
prices to slip over the past several days.
</P>
<P>
   West Texas Intermediate crude, the benchmark U.S. oil, has
tumbled 20 percent since peaking two weeks ago. It fell 15 cents to
$27.31 a barrel Thursday on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 253.16; Nasdaq Up 75.86  </HEADLINE>
By SETH SUTEL, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks advanced broadly Thursday, carrying the
Dow Jones industrial average over 11,000 for the first time in
seven weeks, as a rally in high-tech issues spread throughout Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft set the pace early on, rising sharply after The Wall
Street Journal reported the software maker was moving closer toward
resolving a government antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   The advance, which also drove the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
into record territory for the third straight day, cemented a
stunning comeback for the Dow, which has gained 1,300 points since
closing at just above 9,800 on March 14.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow rose 253.16 Thursday to 11,119.86, its first close above
11,000 since Feb. 3. The blue chip index is still 5.1 percent below
its closing high of 11,722.98, reached Jan. 14.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech dominated Nasdaq composite index rose 75.86 to
4,940.61, while the S&AMP;P 500, which surpassed 1,500 for the first
time on Wednesday, gained another 26.71 to 1,527.35.
</P>
<P>
   The rally lifted industrial blue chips as fund managers
scrambled to put their cash to work before the first quarter closes
a week from Friday. Aluminum maker Alcoa rose 2| to 69{, and
International Paper rose 1~ to 39[. Both are components of the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a very strong quarter in terms of tech stocks as
well as flows into mutual funds, so there's a lot of pressure on
fund managers to be fully invested by the end of the quarter,''
said Ricky Harrington, technical analyst at Wachovia Securities in
Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The real stars of the day were the major high-tech shares,
following the example set by Microsoft, which jumped 8| to 111~.
Network equipment maker Cisco Systems gained 5| to 77 13/16, and
Oracle, a major business software company, was up 2 13/16 to 86~.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the tech sector fared as well, however. Compaq
tumbled 2| to 29| on rumors the computer maker would report poor
first-quarter earnings, and chip maker Intel slipped 1 7/16 to 142|
as investors collected profits from the stunning 75 percent gain
the stock has enjoyed since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the rally in tech stocks was strong enough to lift other
parts of the market, which several analysts interpreted as a
positive sign after several weeks of sharp gains largely limited to
sensitive sectors such as biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people are encouraged by the broadening-out
process,'' said William Meehan, chief market analyst for Cantor
Fitzgerald. ''We've had huge movement in a number of assets.''
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered declining issues by an 8 to-5
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 1.06
billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.07 billion the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   A sharp rally in the bond market also made its presence felt on
Wall Street. With fewer places to put their money and long-term
bond yields having fallen in recent weeks, fund managers were
looking again at stocks to buy in order to put their cash to work
by the end of the quarter. The long bond was yielding 5.91 percent
in late afternoon trading, down from 5.96 percent late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The runup in the Treasury market was all the more remarkable
since it came on the heels of Tuesday's rate increase by the
Federal Reserve. The Fed, which has raised rates five times since
June, has indicated it may make further increases this year, but
bond traders appear unfazed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bond market is out of control,'' said Harrington.
''Despite what the Fed has done so far, there's still so much money
out there. Momentum and money flow are driving this market.''
</P>
<P>
   Gains in shares of smaller companies were not as large as in the
broader market. The Russell 2000 index rose 2.60 to 573.79.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.2 percent.
Germany's Xetra DAX index was down 1.3 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100
was down 0.2 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.2 percent.

all wrapped in music on the stage of Carnegie Hall.
</P>

   They delivered the world premiere Wednesday of composer Judith
Weir's ''woman.life.song'' -- commissioned by Wall Street takeover
king Henry Kravis to celebrate his wife's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The years are broken across my body like thin crystals,''
Angelou said in a husky, soothing voice, reading from the series of
songs that follow the stages of a woman's life.
</P>
<P>
   The texts of the 50-minute piece were first read by their three
creators, who sat side-by-side onstage. Norman, who conceived of
the project, then sang them, accompanied by the Orchestra of St.
Luke's.
</P>
<P>
   ''To the mother, the lover, who made thunder under the sheets,''
she sang in the words of Estes, a psychoanalyst who describes her
dying mother with hypnotic rhythms. Estes is a ''cantadora,'' a
keeper of old stories in her Latin oral tradition, as reflected in
her best-selling book ''Women Who Run with the Wolves.''
</P>
<P>
   As she stood reading and facing the audience, her empty chair
became a tiny stage that summed up the evening: Morrison's and
Angelou's hands suddenly linked across the seat, clasping under the
spotlights. The gesture united two grande dames of American letters
who had risen above their shared struggle, as minority women in a
race-troubled society.
</P>
<P>
   In ''woman.life.song,'' the three lyricists paint a woman's
progression from youth to age with words both shattering and funny.
</P>
<P>
   ''Breasts!! Song of the Innocent Wild-Child'' is Estes' teasing
fantasy about a girl blossoming into womanhood, set to
Spanish-style music: ''Oh, Breasts!! If I had breasts I would wear
them/ ever so smartly. I would use them to proudly point with, or
flash them in disdain, or lift them up in joy -- but I would never
flaunt them, nor stuff them, and especially, never fluff them...''
</P>
<P>
   Angelou wrote texts for the beginning and end of the piece
called ''On Youth'' and ''On Maturity.''
</P>
<P>
   A nostalgic, Southern tone suffused her reading of the first -- a
child's memory of being poor with a grandmother roasting peanuts in
the oven, ''and as the air became perfumed with the friendly aroma
of roasting nuts and my uncle ... began to hum the old songs of the
spirit: the aroma of the nuts, the sound -- the heavy silk sound of
the ancient spirituals, a glass of cold milk in my hand, my young
body -- obedient to my will -- made me rich beyond measure.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman performed those words as a larger-than-life declamation.
With her resplendent soprano, she gave a powerhouse performance
that also could be as delicate as a whisper.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison, the only black American woman to win a Nobel Prize in
literature, has her own take on a woman's youth. Norman's soaring
high notes were tense with expectation in Morrison's ''Edge,'' in
which an infatuated young woman is ''racing to the edge of love/
the bed of love/ the love-me-till-I'm-dead of love.''
</P>
<P>
   Weir's composition didn't always measure up.
</P>
<P>
   Though the texts are universal, they emanate an American spirit
that was learned -- and earned -- through the hardships of these
minority women. The music, while intricately crafted and executed,
at times sounded removed from that human landscape. The English
composer attempted to give Estes' lyrics an exotic touch, adding a
guitar to the orchestration, but the strummed lilt drew the
listener more into a Spanish mode than Estes' Mexican-American.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was an intriguing evening that ended with a touch of
humor.
</P>
<P>
   For a final bow, Morrison wore her winter coat with a purse
hanging over the shoulder -- ready to leave. She apparently hadn't
expected such a long accolade.

<HEADLINE> Indian Media Sizes Up Clinton  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Sizing up the significance of President
Clinton's visit, Indian newspapers said he's impressed the
country's legislators and people but what that means in the long
run is not clear.
</P>
<P>
   ''After euphoria, it's time for reality check,'' said The Times
of India on its front page.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clinton wraps hard message in soft words,'' The Statesman said
of the president's speech to members of Parliament earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
   R.K. Laxman, India's most popular political cartoonist, showed
Clinton lecturing on his ''grand vision'' to bring peace by
encouraging India to hold talks with Pakistan, even as missiles fly
and terrorists sneak across the border.
</P>
<P>
   ''Smart guy! Fantastic solution! It never occurred to us,'' says
a lawmaker depicted in the cartoon, in The Times.
</P>
<P>
   Indian Express said Clinton had tread carefully on issues such
as India's nuclear weapons capability and its dispute with Pakistan
over Kashmir. Clinton, who meets Pakistani officials Saturday, made
little headway in urging India's leaders to open a dialogue with
Pakistan and to slow its nuclear weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   ''Perhaps there is no point in India being so sensitive on
issues that are not purely regional, for in this age, no issue is
local,'' the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Another paper, The Hindu, said India should resist any
temptation to use the United States as a mediator in its
territorial dispute with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ''The relationship with the United States, which is a promising
and potentially multifaceted one, should not be held hostage to
India's regional stakes,'' it said in an editorial.

<HEADLINE> Senate Welcomes Rail Merger Halt  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE MITTELSTADT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators welcomed the decision by federal
regulators to temporarily halt mergers in the rapidly consolidating
railroad industry, saying Thursday the deals are hurting
competition and service.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the railroads have become larger, the mergers have become
more complex and difficult,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
said at a hearing of the Senate Commerce subcommittee on surface
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the short term, it appears to me that it has drained
financial resources from the railroads and ... eroded service gains
and efficiencies at various points,'' said Lott, R-Miss.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Surface Transportation Board last week ordered a
15-month moratorium on railroad mergers, effectively halting a
planned $6 billion deal between Texas-based Burlington Northern
Santa Fe and Canadian National Railway.
</P>
<P>
   The board acted after a four-day hearing on the future of the
railroad industry, which has been beset by service disruptions
since the 1996 Union Pacific-Southern Pacific merger and last
year's takeover of Conrail by CSX and Norfolk Southern.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Rockefeller, D-W.Va., said the order was an
''extraordinarily bold decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Burlington Northern and Canadian National have petitioned the
board to lift the freeze and are turning to federal court to try to
block the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Burlington Northern's chairman, Robert Krebs, in a written
statement submitted to the Senate subcommittee, said the board's
decision was ''illegal'' and that his railroad and would-be partner
should not be punished for previous mergers' failings.
</P>
<P>
   The board chairwoman, Linda Morgan, told senators that the board
had the authority to impose the freeze while regulators develop new
rules for what she said may be the industry's final round of
mergers.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are those who argue that what we did by suspending
merger activity was extreme and unnecessary,'' Morgan said. ''The
board's action was unprecedented, but bold action was necessary
given the extraordinary circumstances presented to the board.''
</P>
<P>
   The board believes ''the risk of creating more instability in an
already unstable rail sector was too great,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   While applauding the board's action, senators also faulted
Congress for not giving the agency more guidance. Lawmakers have
not been able to agree on reauthorizing the agency.
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee chairwoman, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, said the
moratorium should prod Congress to act and grant the agency new
powers to weigh mergers' effect on competition.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe very strongly that Congress has a role to play here.
Sitting on the sidelines simply will not do while we witness the
rapid integration of the rail industry,'' said Hutchison, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledged the difficulty of enacting legislation that
fosters competition and protects shippers' rights while restoring
the railroad industry to financial health. Her own reauthorization
bill -- one of several in Congress -- is viewed by some as an attempt
to re-regulate an industry that was deregulated two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison rejected that criticism. ''My purpose is the opposite.
It's to keep competition in the industry and to avoid monopolies
from occurring that would put our shippers in a worse position,''
she said after the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Lott urged caution.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the situation will sort itself out as the railroads
digest the previous mergers,'' he said. ''We need to be careful
about rushing a legislative solution to what can probably be
handled by the industry itself and by the efforts of the (STB).''

<HEADLINE> Nail Bacteria Linked to Baby Deaths  </HEADLINE>
By CAROL COLE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Bacteria found under the long fingernails
of two nurses may have contributed to the deaths of 16 sickly
babies in 1997 and 1998 in an Oklahoma City hospital, researchers
say.
</P>
<P>
   All of the babies were newborns in the neo-natal intensive care
unit at Children's Hospital of Oklahoma, and all had infections
caused by the same bacteria found under the nurses' nails.
</P>
<P>
   However, researchers said they cannot be certain that the nurses
transmitted the bacteria to the infants. And the hospital pointed
out that the babies -- most of whom were premature -- had seriously
deficient immune systems, and said that other problems played a
larger role in their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the hospital has changed its policy to require
short fingernails on nurses, and no babies in the neo-natal ICU
have died from the bacterial infection since then.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were reported in the February issue of the
Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology Journal. The study was
done by the state Health Department, the hospital and the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt like the connection was strong enough to report it,''
said state epidemiologist Dr. Michael Crutcher, who helped write
the study. But he added: ''There was no way to definitively prove
that this was the mechanism of transmission.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Jarvis, chief of the investigation and prevention
branch of the CDC's hospital infection program, said the agency has
investigated two or three outbreaks over the past 10 years in which
fingernails were thought to have played a role.
</P>
<P>
   But like the Oklahoma hospital, Jarvis suggested that other
factors were at play. ''In all of these with data to support that
fingernails have been the critical element, it hasn't been the only
element,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bacteria, pseudomonas aeruginosa, can be found in every
hospital nursery in America, said Dr. Roger Sheldon, medical
director of the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The death rate in the hospital's neo-natal ICU is close to the
national rate, but at one point, the staff noticed an increase of
approximately one death per month. The hospital called the CDC,
which studied the records of all the babies who had been in the
unit in 1997 and the first three months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Of 439 newborns admitted during that period, 46 acquired the
bacterial infection and 16 died.
</P>
<P>
   The study found evidence of an association between the bacteria
and exposure to two nurses with long or artificial fingernails. The
bacteria were also found on two sinks and fingernails of another
nurse with short, natural nails, but that nurse was not linked to
the infection in the infants.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC suggested improved hand-washing and requiring nurses to
have short, natural fingernails, which are considered less likely
to harbor germs.
</P>
<P>
   Yvonne Sibley, head nurse in the neo-natal ICU, said all nurses
in the hospital must now have nails that are considered
piano-playing length.
</P>
<P>
   Crutcher, the state epidemiologist, said at no time was there
negligence on the part of hospital personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The newborns in the neo-natal ICU are mostly premature and may
weigh as little as a pound, or were born to mothers with drug
habits, said Gay Conner, a hospital spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just because of the nature that they're in NICU, already their
immune systems are compromised,'' Conner said Thursday. ''Fifty
percent of the ones who died would have died from something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Sheldon, the hospital's medical director: ''These children
didn't die of infection. They died of being born way too soon.''

<HEADLINE> Star quintet offers Carnegie Hall world premiere of'woman.life.song'  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It was some birthday gift: Singer Jessye Norman
and writers Maya Angelou, Toni Morrison and Clarissa Pinkola Estes
-- wrapped in music on the stage of Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, they delivered the world premiere of composer
Judith Weir's ''woman.life.song'' -- commissioned by Wall Street
takeover king Henry Kravis to celebrate his wife's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The years are broken across my body like thin crystals,''
Angelou said in a husky, soothing voice, reading from the series of
songs that follow the stages of a woman's life.
</P>
<P>
   The texts of the 50-minute piece were first read by their three
creators, who sat side-by-side onstage. Norman, who conceived of
the woman-as-theme project, then performed the work, accompanied by
the Orchestra of St. Luke's.
</P>
<P>
   ''To the mother, the lover, who made thunder under the sheets,''
she sang in the words of Estes, a psychoanalyst who paints a
picture of her dying mother with hypnotic rhythms.
</P>
<P>
   Estes is a ''cantadora,'' a keeper of old stories in her Latin
oral tradition, reflected in her best-selling book ''Women Who Run
with the Wolves.''
</P>
<P>
   As she stood facing the audience while reading, her empty chair
became a tiny stage that summed up the evening: Morrison's and
Angelou's hands suddenly linked across the seat, clasping under the
spotlights.
</P>
<P>
   Center stage at Carnegie Hall, the gesture united two grande
dames of American letters who had risen above their shared
struggle, as minority women in a race-troubled society.
</P>
<P>
   In ''woman.life.song,'' the three lyricists paint a woman's
progression from youth to age with words both shattering and funny.

   ''Breasts!! Song of the Innocent Wild-Child'' is Estes' teasing

Spanish-style music: ''Oh, Breasts!! If I had breasts I would wear
them/ ever so smartly. I would use them to proudly point with, or
flash them in disdain, or lift them up in joy-- but I would never
flaunt them, nor stuff them, and especially, never fluff them...''
</P>
<P>
   Angelou framed the beginning and end of the piece, writing texts
called ''On Youth'' and ''On Maturity.''
</P>
<P>
   A nostalgic, Southern caress suffused her reading of the first --
a child's memory of being poor, alongside a grandmother who is
roasting peanuts in the oven, ''and as the air became perfumed with
the friendly aroma of roasting nuts and my uncle ... began to hum
the old songs of the spirit: the aroma of the nuts, the sound -- the
heavy silk sound of the ancient spirituals, a glass of cold milk in
my hand, my young body -- obedient to my will -- made me rich beyond
measure.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman performed the same words as a larger-than-life
declamation. With her resplendent soprano voice, she gave a
powerhouse performance that also could be as delicate as a whisper.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison, the only African-American woman to win a Nobel Prize
in literature, has her own take on a woman's youth. Norman's
soaring high notes were tense with expectation for ''Edge,'' in
which an infatuated young woman is ''racing to the edge of love/
the bed of love/ the love-me-till-I'm-dead of love.''

   Though the texts are universal, they emanate an American spirit

<HEADLINE> New Mexico Vulnerable to Outages  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD BENKE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Unusually dry weather and too few
electrical transmission lines led to New Mexico's largest-ever
power outage -- and utility officials warn that conditions are right
for it to happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't lie to you -- the system is somewhat vulnerable,'' said
Don Brown, spokesman for Public Service Company of New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, a grass fire -- possibly caused by a tossed
cigarette -- sent thick smoke rising up 60-foot transmission towers.
The electricity-conducting smoke triggered a short-circuit that
shut down all three transmission lines feeding Albuquerque, the
state's largest metropolitan area with 500,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Power also was lost to towns along the Rio Grande, from El Paso,
Texas, to Taos, N.M., and as far west as Gallup, N.M. In all, 1.6
million people were affected, some for up to six hours.
</P>
<P>
   Brown blamed a shortage of power lines in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the main lines stretch side by side along the same
transmission path. When those lines automatically switched off
because of the short-circuit, the third line overloaded and shut
down in a domino effect.
</P>
<P>
   Power company officials maintain that the state needs to build
alternative paths for electricity in case of fire.
</P>
<P>
   But winning public acceptance for new transmission lines has
been a struggle, Brown said. His company has tried for 15 years to
convince New Mexicans of the need, but residents have considered
them an eyesore.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the state remains unusually dry and vulnerable to
fire, with rainfall this season at half its normal rate.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, 187,289 acres of New Mexico have burned,
compared with a little more than 52,000 for all of last year. Dry
weather is forecast through June.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the rest of the West is dry this year, too, but New
Mexico is particularly vulnerable to major outages because many
other Western states have a larger web of transmission lines that
enables utilities to route power around fires.

<HEADLINE> Clinton-Assad Talk Gauged Cautiously  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT, AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAIPUR, India (AP) -- President Clinton's meeting with Syrian
President Hafez Assad is unlikely to produce a timetable for
resuming peace talks with Israel but should provide a sense of
whether a new round of negotiations could result in a settlement, a
senior official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, ending a six-day trip to South Asia, will fly to Geneva
to meet with Assad on Sunday in hopes of restarting Israeli-Syrian
talks that broke off in stalemate in early January.
</P>
<P>
   ''The best case result ... is that we have a sense after the
meeting that there is enough common ground, they're close enough,
that if we actually resume negotiations that you could envision
them ending in success,'' said Sandy Berger, Clinton's national
security adviser, accompanying the president at a resort here.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials say they believe that Assad wants a peace
agreement with Israel but that there is no guarantee the two sides
can strike a deal. Clinton hopes to bolster Syria's and Israeli's
confidence that both sides' needs can be met.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the administration has been playing down expectations of
Sunday's meeting, saying there will be no immediate results. The
expectation is that Assad will return to Syria and Clinton will
brief Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the president also is to see Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the Assad meeting, a senior administration official
said, ''We won't know the outcome, impact of the meeting, for a few
weeks.'' The official, insisting on anonymity, left open the
possibility that ''they're just too far apart and there's no point
in re-engaging.''
</P>
<P>
   A key issue is the extent of Israel's withdrawal from the Golan
Heights, captured in the 1967 Mideast War, and the line to which
Israel pulls back. Another problem is how Israel will make up for
the security advantage it had on the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   A third factor involves what specific pledges Syria would make
in promising peace with Israel. Barak is committed to submitting
any peace deal to a vote in Israel and will have to overcome doubts
about Assad's commitment. ''Israelis want a lot of up-front
manifestations of normalcy,'' the senior official said. Another
factor is the timing and sequence of Israel's withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Another track of Mideast negotiations is under way in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Palestinian negotiators held a third day of talks at
Bolling Air Force Base on Thursday. Neither they nor their U.S.
hosts said anything about the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   On the table are Palestinian demands for a state and for part of
Jerusalem as their capital.

<HEADLINE> For a jury, judge converts porn star into a dancer, model andactress  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge did a makeover on an X-rated movie
star's professional life Thursday, ruling that a jury in an insider
trading case will learn only that she is a dancer, model and
actress whose stage name was ''Marylin Star.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood rejected attempts by prosecutors
to expose more about Kathryn Gannon, a fugitive in a case whose
primary defendant is James McDermott Jr., a former top Wall Street
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Wood made various rulings during a pre-trial hearing Thursday
about what evidence can be shown to the jury at a trial scheduled
to start April 10 in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Her rulings appeared to weaken the government's case against
McDermott, the former chief executive officer at Keefe, Bruyette &AMP;
Woods, and a co-defendant, Anthony P. Pomponio.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had said it was crucial to their case to tell jurors
about Gannon's profession. Assistant U.S. Attorney James J.
Benjamin Jr. also said it was ''absolutely essential'' to tell how
the insider trading caused the cancellation of an initial public
offering by McDermott's company.
</P>
<P>
   Wood said she thought evidence about the public offering would
be confusing for the jury and time consuming but left the door open
to change her mind.
</P>
<P>
   She was unyielding to prosecutors, though, on the issue of what
could be said about Gannon's career, making it unlikely that the
jury will ever learn that Pomponio said in a statement that he
believed Gannon was a prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for McDermott had successfully argued to the judge that
Gannon's career was largely irrelevant to whether she conspired
with McDermott and Pomponio to cheat in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had wanted at least to refer to Gannon as an
''exotic'' dancer and as an ''adult'' film actress. But Wood ruled
that neither of the words would be used in front of the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say McDermott told Gannon about obscure regional
banks that were involved in mergers and acquisitions prior to
public announcements, allowing the trio to gain $170,000 in illegal
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said in court papers and a letter to the judge that
Gannon's profession was crucial to their case because her job
''raises the strong inference that McDermott paid her for sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said they plan to tell the jury that Gannon's
intimate sexual relationship with McDermott was the principal
motive for his crime.
</P>
<P>
   Wood blocked them from their plans to use her status as an adult
film actress to imply that McDermott needed to impress her by

   Wood said the nature of Gannon's profession was irrelevant
because it was possible for prosecutors to show there was a sexual
affair between Gannon and McDermott without revealing her
occupation.

   McDermott, 48, of Briarcliff Manor is charged along with
Pomponio, 45, of North Caldwell, N.J., and Gannon, 30, of Miami,

   McDermott and Pomponio, who have both pleaded innocent, remain
free on bail. Prosecutors are seeking the extradition of Gannon
from her Canadian home.

<HEADLINE> IMF Elects Koehler As New Chief  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER, AP Economics Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund unanimously
elected Germany's Horst Koehler as its new managing director on
Thursday, while the drive to impose radical reforms on the
182-nation lending agency gained momentum in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Koehler, 57, ratified Thursday by the IMF's
24-member executive committee, came only after a bruising
four-month global power struggle which saw the United States
publicly reject Europe's first candidate for the job.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference last week, Koehler said he was ''open to
discussion and dialogue with the U.S. Congress about reforms'' and
pledged to focus the IMF on one of its main missions, preventing
global financial crises from breaking out.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler, a former top official in Germany's finance ministry and
since 1998 the head of the London-based European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development, was put forward by German
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder after President Clinton rejected
Germany's first candidate as lacking sufficient stature for the
job.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF, which took the lead in assembling more than $100
billion in rescue packages during the global financial crisis in
1997-98, has emerged as one of the most powerful financial
institutions in the world. But a host of critics on both the right
and left charge that the IMF is too powerful and secretive.
</P>
<P>
   Various members of the House Banking Committee said Thursday
that the institution must accelerate its efforts to implement
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ''The IMF is in desperate need of structural adjustment. It must
become more accountable,'' said Rep. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. He
said the secretive selection process for Koehler highlighted how
much reform was needed.
</P>
<P>
   The committee heard from members of a congressionally appointed
commission headed by Allan Meltzer, an economist at Carnegie Mellon
University, that recommended a radical downsizing of both the IMF
and its sister lending agency, the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The Meltzer panel said the IMF should be restricted to offering
short-term loans to countries facing financial crisis and get out
of the business of long-term lending. It said the World Bank should
switch from offering loans, which increase the debt of poor
nations, and instead provide grants with more emphasis on such
problems as AIDs.
</P>
<P>
   The Meltzer report, released earlier this month, has won strong
backing from top Republican leaders in Congress, who have vowed to
attach the recommendations to an administration request to reduce
the debt burdens of the world's 40 poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, however, urged the banking
committee to adopt a less sweeping set of administration reform
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   He said adhering to the commission's proposals would have
prevented the IMF from providing critically needed loans to Mexico,
Brazil or South Korea as the battled recent financial crises.
</P>
<P>
   Summers was pressed by some members of the Banking Committee to
defend the IMF's handling of a recently disclosed incident in which
Ukraine's central bank, according to the IMF, engaged in a number
of questionable transactions worth almost $1 billion to generate a
falsely optimistic picture of the country's foreign currency
reserves between 1996 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Summers said the administration was ''deeply concerned'' about
the incident and in particular the fact that IMF staff did not
disclose until recently to its executive board information the
staff had uncovered in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate appearance before the panel, James Healy, the
global head of emerging markets for Credit Suisse First Boston,
said his financial institution had no way of knowing whether the
banking transactions it handled for the Ukrainian central bank
breached agreements the country had with the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not know of any misuse of IMF funds,'' Healy told the
panel.

<HEADLINE> McCain Won't Back FEC Nominee  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Back in the Senate less than a week, John
McCain is also back to making his point that campaign finance rules
need an overhaul. Democrat Al Gore says George W. Bush ought to
follow his Republican colleague's lead.
</P>
<P>
   McCain says he will vote against the confirmation of Republican
Bradley Smith, a Federal Election Commission nominee who opposes
campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the likely Democratic presidential nominee who also
opposes Smith, said in Cincinnati on Thursday, ''I'd like to call
upon Governor Bush to take that same courageous position because
this nominee wants to dismantle all existing campaign finance
laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush defeated McCain in the battle for the Republican
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's comments came as he met Wednesday with his old campaign
finance partner, Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., about new
legislation to fight big money politics.
</P>
<P>
   McCain told reporters he would do everything he could to defeat
Smith on the grounds that he is against tightening fund-raising
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is strongly backed by senior Senate Republicans including
Majority Leader Trent Lott and Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   McCain spokesman Mark Buse said his boss has not procedurally
blocked Smith's confirmation but will vote against any move to
break a Democratic filibuster and bring the matter to a final vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator's opposition indicates that his defeat on
the campaign trail did little to temper his independent streak.
</P>
<P>
   It sets up another confrontation with McConnell, who put McCain
on the defensive on the Senate floor last year by asking him to
name the colleagues that McCain felt had been ''corrupted'' by the
system, and how.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've all been corrupted,'' McCain responded, and he repeated
that phrase in the presidential campaign.

<HEADLINE> Education Head Wants National Tests  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN, AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- National tests in reading and math could
ensure that schools are teaching the essentials without wresting
control of education from states, Education Secretary Richard Riley
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This one-size-fits-all is not the American way of doing
things,'' Riley said in an interview with The Associated Press.
''Americans don't like that. They don't function well like that.
They like competitive systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley, a former Democratic governor of South Carolina, praised
states' efforts to boost student achievement -- including those of
Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the likely GOP presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   He also repeated President Clinton's oft-criticized proposal to
test children nationally. Uniform tests in basic skills would help
Americans measure how well children are prepared to compete in a
global workforce, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Reading is such a basic skill,'' said Riley, whose eight years
under Clinton makes him the nation's longest-serving education
chief. ''If a kid can't read by the fourth grade, somebody ought to
be doing something serious.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed tests -- which also could be made available to
homeschoolers on the Internet -- would measure how well
fourth-graders can read, whether eighth-graders can solve math
problems and whether 12th-graders are ready to graduate, Riley
said. States and schools could use the results to improve their own
standards, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-led Congress has opposed Clinton's efforts to
create national testing, as well as dedicating federal dollars to
hire teachers, repair old school buildings and connect classrooms
to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   This year, conservatives on Capitol Hill again are opposing the
Clinton programs, saying they encroach on states' rights and
responsibilities to educate students.
</P>
<P>
   Riley said the last thing the administration wants to do is
interfere with states' progress. But he said he expected Vice
President Al Gore to push the current Clinton education priorities
in his own campaign for president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush both are running hard on the education issue,
claiming, critics say, far more credit than they are due.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did earn a nod from Riley for promoting better standards,
better schools and loss of federal aid for schools that fail --
ideas Riley said Bush had cribbed from his Democratic predecessors
in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has endorsed OUR program with the exception of vouchers,''
Riley said of Bush's national education proposals.
</P>
<P>
   He opposed Bush's call to give poor students in failing schools
federal vouchers to spend on private schooling: ''It would be a
mistake, and very divisive.''
</P>
<P>
   On other education matters, the 66-year-old grandfather, who
sent his four children to public schools, said:
</P>
<P>
   --public officials should not be required or pressured into
sending their children to public schools.
</P>
<P>
   --all families should have access to free preschool.
</P>
<P>
   --colleges should align their admissions standards with high
school graduation requirements.
</P>
<P>
   --schools cannot combat student violence without tighter gun
controls.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Vs. Yen, Down Vs. Euro  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The euro gained on the dollar, though both
currencies jumped against the yen on Thursday after the latest in a
series of interest rate hikes by Western central banks that have
made Japanese investment returns less competitive.
</P>
<P>
   In late trading in New York, the dollar was quoted at 107.32
Japanese yen, up from 106.90 yen at the same point on Wednesday,
while the euro rose to 97.19 cents compared with the prior day's
quote of 96.02 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank of Switzerland set the tone early in the day
with a surprisingly sharp increase in its short-term lending rates.
</P>
<P>
   The inflation-fighting measure followed rate hikes on Tuesday by
the U.S. Federal Reserve and last week by the European Central Bank
that have made dollar- and euro-denominated investments more
appealing.
</P>
<P>
   In other trading Thursday, the dollar was quoted at 1.6465 Swiss
francs, down from 1.6756; and 1.4697 Canadian dollars, down from
1.4700. The British pound rose to $1.5863 from late Wednesday's
quote of $1.5775.
</P>
<P>
   The currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are
no longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed
rate. Based on Thursday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 2.0121
German marks, down from 2.0370 on Tuesday; 6.7496 French francs,
down from 6.8318; and 1,991.95 Italian lire, down from 2,016.63.

<HEADLINE> Audit: Rural Aids Funds Lacking  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government provides more money for AIDS
patients in big cities than it does for those living outside urban
areas, even as the number of rural AIDS cases is rising, federal
auditors found.
</P>
<P>
   The government spent $3,081 on every AIDS patient in Atlanta,
but only $2,303 each on those living elsewhere in Georgia, the
audit released Thursday said. Atlanta had 6,119 AIDS patients; the
rest of the state had 2,657.
</P>
<P>
   Large cities like Atlanta, Chicago and New York have the largest
AIDS caseloads. But with a dearth of AIDS services outside city
limits and evidence that AIDS is actually on the rise in some rural
areas, activists and rural health experts say it is time to
redirect some money.
</P>
<P>
   ''The few of us who are spending 100 percent of our time on
rural AIDS feel completely excluded,'' said Linda Brandt, executive
director of the Rural AIDS Action Network in Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   About 300,000 people in the United States have AIDS. Hundreds of
thousands are HIV-infected. In 1998 there were 37,696 rural AIDS
cases.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office found that in six states studied,
cities received more money per patient than other areas under the
Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency Act, a
10-year-old program that has provided nearly $8 billion to cities
and states. It is up for reauthorization by Congress this year.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix received $3,133 for 1,670 people with AIDS in 1997,
while areas outside the city received nearly $1,000 less for each
of 760 AIDS patients. In Detroit, there was $3,296 each for 2,765
AIDS patients, compared to $2,170 for 1,285 patients in the rest of
Michigan, the GAO reported.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Claude Earl Fox, head of the Health Resources and Services
Administration, which administers Ryan White grants, said the
agency adopted new formulas passed by Congress in 1996 that
attempted to correct the city-state dollar disparities.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also asked Congress for money to study the problem
further.
</P>
<P>
   Named for the Indiana boy whose battle with AIDS attracted
national attention, the Ryan White program provides money for
health clinics treating low-income AIDS patients, training for
those caring for AIDs patients and money for drugs and other
services.
</P>
<P>
   About $505 million went to the 51 cities with more than 2,000
cumulative AIDS cases during the past five years. States, whose
share is based on residents with AIDS, received $738 million.
</P>
<P>
   The audit found the majority of people served by programs
receiving Ryan White funds are blacks, Hispanics and women, groups
that are hardest hit by the epidemic and that some studies have
found receive poorer care.
</P>
<P>
   The report noted that rural areas offer limited medical and
social services and some rural residents may be traveling to urban
areas to get treatments.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS cases are falling across the country, including in rural
areas, thanks to prevention efforts and drug treatments. But
studies show that rural AIDS cases represent a bigger slice of
total cases and in some areas, AIDS is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Rural AIDS cases represented 7.2 percent of all cases in 1997,
up from 5.4 percent in 1993, according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   In southeast New Mexico, cumulative AIDS cases more than doubled
to 93 from 1993 to 1998. On the central Florida coast, cases
increased from 605 to 1,432, according to a study by Dr. David
Berry of Macon State College in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., who requested the GAO study, said he
would introduce a bill to target more Ryan White money at non-urban
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Jacobs, lobbyist at Aids Action, which represents 3,200
AIDS groups, said more rural funding should not come at the expense
of cities.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a balancing act. We have to find a solution for both
rural and urban needs,'' said Jacobs.

<HEADLINE> Miami's Cubans Have Eye on Elian  </HEADLINE>
By MILDRADE CHERFILS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Members of Miami's large Cuban-American community,
some of them with walkie-talkies, are keeping close watch on Elian
Gonzalez's home and threatening protests if the U.S. government
makes any sudden move to send the boy back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno has set no deadline for the
6-year-old boy's return to his father except to say that she wants
it to happen in an ''orderly, fair and prompt'' manner.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not calling the people out as long as we see that
Elian's case remains in the courts and the government is not moving
to suddenly take Elian back to Cuba,'' said Ramon Saul Sanchez,
head of the Democracy Movement, a Cuban exile organization. ''We
have used civil disobedience in the past, but only when it's been
absolutely necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez was among 17 exile organization leaders who met to
discuss protest strategy Wednesday, a day after a federal judge
affirmed the U.S. government's decision to send Elian back. The
ruling is being appealed. The leaders urged the Cuban-American
community to remain united and alert.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-Americans make up more than 700,000 of Miami-Dade County's
2.1 million people. Many harbor deep hatred of Fidel Castro and
have shown their willingness to take to the streets in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez said preserving Elian's rights and maintaining peace in
the community is a delicate balance.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are things we can control and there are certain things
we can't control,'' he said. ''There are very, very deep emotions
involved here and people will react.''
</P>
<P>
   Dagoberto Aviles, 65, reacted to the court ruling by
establishing a watch outside the boy's home, using a walkie-talkie
to communicate with other volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fidel's arms are very long. To do something bad to this child
or family he has to go through us first -- the Cuban community and
the Cuban organizations,'' Aviles said. He did not specify what he
would do if government officials moved in to take the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez said members of his group also monitor the activity
outside the boy's home. ''We also keep in touch with some of the
authorities that help us discern between the rumors and some of the
steps that are being taken,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials have said they want to avoid
traumatizing the boy or provoking a confrontation with Miami's
Cuban exile community. Government lawyers and attorneys for the
Miami relatives met here Wednesday to negotiate a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush, on the
campaign trail in Orlando, said Thursday he thinks Elian's father
should come to the United States to claim his son.
</P>
<P>
   ''The best solution would be to let that boy's daddy come to
America so he can make the decision having taken a great deep
breath of freedom,'' Bush said. ''Let's make sure he's making up
his mind without a repressive government telling him what to think
and how to act.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic candidate, Vice President Al Gore, has said he,
too, wonders whether the boy's father has been allowed to speak his
true wishes when he repeatedly said in Cuba that he wanted to be
reunited on the island with his son.
</P>
<P>
   In January, hundreds of Cuban-Americans protesting against the
government's decision to send Elian back blocked Miami
intersections and cut off access to the Port of Miami, resulting in
dozens of arrests.

<HEADLINE> Senate Committee OKs Seizure Bill  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation restricting the federal
government's authority to seize private property suspected of being
linked to crime was approved Thursday by the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation seeks to restore balance to a crime-fighting
tool that has allowed the government to confiscate the cars, boats
and houses of drug dealers. But it has led to cases of abuse when
prosecutors seize the property of people who are innocent or didn't
know the property was being used in an illegal act.
</P>
<P>
   The voice vote by the committee came after House and Senate
sponsors from both parties met Wednesday with Attorney General
Janet Reno to work out the final differences.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., top Democrat on the
committee, ''should go a long way toward stemming the abuses that
have so offended Americans across the country'' and across the
political spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said the bill
should reach the Senate floor in the near future for what is
expected to be quick passage.
</P>
<P>
   The main objective of the legislation is to shift the burden of
proof in asset forfeiture cases from the property owner, where it
now lies, to the government.
</P>
<P>
   Under the compromise, the government must make its case ''by a
preponderance of the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The House version of the bill, which passed last June by a
375-48 vote, stated that the government must have a ''clear and
convincing evidence,'' but House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., who has pushed for asset forfeiture legislation for
seven years, agreed to go along with the somewhat less demanding
Senate language.
</P>
<P>
   The administration and some senators had objected to the House
version, saying it would make it too hard for federal prosecutors
to prove their cases.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also enables a judge to release property to the owner
if continued government possession poses a substantial hardship,
extends the time a property owner has to challenge a seizure in
court and ends the requirement that a person seeking to recover
property post a bond with the court.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde has argued that current asset forfeiture procedures, which
are largely based on 19th century admiralty law, are a throwback to
the old Soviet Union where the government can grab property merely
by making charges and without ever convicting a person of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Leahy gave one example from his home state of Vermont where
federal marshals seized the family home and 49 surrounding acres of
a man who, without his wife's knowledge, had pleaded guilty to
growing six marijuana plants. He said that after people in the
state protested the man got his property back.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is supported by a broad range of groups, including the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the American Civil Liberties Union, the
NRA, and the American Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill number is H.R. 1658.

<HEADLINE> Experts Back $1.6B Aid for Colombia  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A panel of experts urged Congress on Thursday
to quickly approve a proposed $1.6 billion counter-drug aid package
for Colombia, saying that such support ''would signal a strong U.S.
commitment to help a troubled country at a critical moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The recommendation was contained in an interim report by an
independent task force sponsored by the Council on Foreign
Relations and the Inter-American Dialogue. The co-chairmen for the
project were Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., and former National Security
adviser Brent Scowcroft.
</P>
<P>
   While giving its backing to the aid proposal, the report said
that over the longer term the administration and the Congress
should give higher priority to supporting Colombian efforts to
remedy its social, economic and institutional problems.
</P>
<P>
   It said future legislation ''should focus more broadly, going
beyond drug fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   The title of the report -- ''First Steps Toward a Constructive
U.S. Policy in Colombia'' -- underscored the authors' view that
success in Colombia is a long-term proposition.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 11, President Clinton asked Congress for a $950 million
emergency supplemental appropriation this year and a total of $1.6
billion through fiscal year 2001. Among other items, the package
calls for 63 helicopters for counter-drug activities. Colombia is
the source of 80 percent of the cocaine and 60 percent of the
heroin used in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the proposal responds to an emergency situation,
expresses a strong U.S. commitment to Colombia and complements
important elements of a comprehensive $7.5 billion three-year plan
announced last summer by President Andres Pastrana. More than half
of that amount would be generated in Colombia itself.
</P>
<P>
   The panel recommended amendments to bolster a regional approach
to the drug problem, calling for additional resources for Bolivia
and Peru to help their successful counter-narcotics efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it also urged an extension for an additional year
of trade preferences given to Andean countries and for the
inclusion of the same countries in pending legislation to grant
trade benefits to Caribbean nations.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-page report was designed to influence the debate in
Congress on the aid package. A final report will be published in
June.
</P>
<P>
   The report was released amid uncertainty over the fate of the
administration's proposal. The House could take up the legislation
next week but there are no assurances of majority support. In the
Senate, there may be no vote until later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombia request is part of a $9 billion bill that also
includes money for operations in Kosovo. The package has run into
opposition from some fiscal conservatives who believe the price tag
is too high and from liberals who are worried the United States
could become ensnared in Colombia's civil war or who believe
efforts to curb drug flows are doomed to fail.
</P>
<P>
   But backers of the package see grave dangers for the United
States in both Colombia and Kosovo if it is not acted on quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen wrote Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, R-Miss., and House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.,
urging quick passage. If the Kosovo peackeeping money is not
available by this summer, Cohen said, the U.S. military will have
to make ''irreversible decisions'' to curtail spending on important
training and maintenance -- moves that would hurt troop readiness
and morale.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the Army faces the tightest pinch; it will have to
cancel exercises at its National Training Center and put off
promotions if the Kosovo money is not available by late April.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sens. Paul Coverdell of Georgia and Mike DeWine of
Ohio said the bill is vital for Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   ''The longer we wait to address the crisis, the greater the
costs will be,'' they said. ''The requested assistance, designed to
curb the devastating effects of narcotics trafficking, is clearly
in our national interest. Too much is at stake not to take action
immediately.''

<HEADLINE> Forest Service Fee Hikes Protested  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HUGHES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- David Mead's patch of paradise is a rustic
cabin his family built 25 years ago atop a steep slope in the
Sawtooth National Forest in Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   For years the vacation home came at a bargain price -- just $390
a year for the half-acre lot. That changed in 1996, when a new
appraisal hiked Mead's fee to $2,500, although a second appraisal
brought it down to $1,750.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the fees are bringing howls of protest from many of the
15,200 cabin owners on Forest Service land in 25 states. They are
backing bills that would overhaul the Forest Service appraisal
system and keep the fees roughly where they were before the new
appraisals began.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of our cabin owners have already bailed out,'' Mead told
a House subcommittee Thursday. ''The 'cash cow' appraisal
objectives that appear to drive the Forest Service are now driving
retired people and average income families out of the forests.''
</P>
<P>
   But Forest Service officials say changes were needed in their
20-year-old appraisals, which had fallen out of line with market
realities. Bills backed by the cabin owners would essentially wipe
out the additional $10 million the agency expects to collect each
year under the new appraisals, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The use of national forest land for private recreation
residences is a privilege afforded to a relatively few number of
persons,'' said Paul Brouha, a Forest Service associate deputy
chief. ''Taxpayers should be adequately compensated for this
private use of their public lands.''
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service since 1915 has allowed Americans to build and
use cabins on forest lands for an annual fee, although the number
of cabins on forest lands has been declining in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The agency in 1988 adopted a new regulation on appraising the
land used by cabin owners and in 1996 launched a five-year effort
to reappraise the tracts.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly two-thirds of the new appraisals complete, four in
10 cabin owners would see their fees at least double, an average
increase of $1,110.
</P>
<P>
   Another 3 percent would see increases of more than 500 percent,
or an average increase of $4,098. Just 12 percent of cabin owners
would see their fees decline.
</P>
<P>
   The increased fees will double the Forest Service's revenue
collections under the program, from $9.6 million in 1998 to more
than $20 million by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Congress in the past two years passed legislation to slow down
the fee increases. But this year Rep. George Nethercutt, R-Wash.,
and Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, want to revamp the process by
requiring the Forest Service to consider factors that would lower
the appraisals.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, families cannot live on Forest Service property
year round or subdivide their lots, Nethercutt said. ''Families are
being unfairly penalized,'' he told the forests and forest health
subcommittee of the House Resources Committee, which held a hearing
on his bill.

<HEADLINE> Mentor Denies FDA Probe on Research  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) -- Trading of stock in breast
implant-maker Mentor Corp. was temporarily halted Thursday when the
shares plunged 50 percent because of a published report that it was
under criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Mentor denied the report that the Food and Drug Administration
was investigating it for alleged research irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   When trading resumed, the stock rebounded and closed at $30.50,
just 10.5 percent, or $3.56 below Wednesday's close.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to an article in USA Today, company officials
confirmed an open FDA investigation into ''manufacturing issues''
in 1998, but said it has nothing to do with how Mentor conducts its
implant studies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have complete confidence in the integrity of our research
and believe that the allegations in the article are entirely
baseless,'' said Anthony Gette, Mentor's president and CEO.
</P>
<P>
   The company has since upgraded its manufacturing facilities, and
two audits found it to be in substantial compliance with good
manufacturing practices, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Mentor makes breast implants filled with saline solution and the
FDA has been examining the safety of these implants. Saline
implants have been the most widely used variety since 1992, when
the agency banned most implants made of silicone gel after
questions arose about whether they caused disease.
</P>
<P>
   FDA spokeswoman Sharon Snider refused to confirm or deny the
existence of an investigation Thursday. More information is
expected to be available once the agency responds to a letter about
the company from Rep. Tom Bliley, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia Republican, who heads the House committee that
oversees the FDA, asked agency Commissioner Jane Henney why a
company under investigation was allowed to participate in a saline
breast implant meeting on March 1, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   Bliley's letter did not name the firm, but a March 9 memo from
the FDA's Office of Criminal Investigations does, the newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, part of the FDA effort examining the safety of saline
implants, ultimately decided Mentor's products were safe and
effective, recommending that they be allowed to stay on the market.

<HEADLINE> Employees Sue TRW Over Work Hours  </HEADLINE>
By KARIN MILLER, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Seven former and current employees of
TRW Inc.'s auto parts plant in nearby Lebanon filed suit Thursday
claiming they were forced to work off-the-clock for about 15
minutes of every work day for a decade or more.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court seeks back wages and
liquidated damages for all current employees and those who worked
at the plant over the past three years. It also seeks a jury trial.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland, Ohio,-based TRW Inc. employs about 650 workers at the
plant, which makes steering gears for trucks and operates 24 hours
a day.
</P>
<P>
   Central to the lawsuit is a written policy posted at the plant
stating an employee must: ''arrive at your work center in your
assigned department prior to the beginning of your shift so that
you and the employee on the job can properly communicate on any
issues and the status of the job.''
</P>
<P>
   It goes on to say that ''This is not a request: it is part of
your job and must be carried out every day.''
</P>
<P>
   David Sanford, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said supervisors
tell workers that those discussions ''do not count toward their
wages'' and they cannot clock in until afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ''They said you can't sign yourself in 'til 7, but you're
supposed to be there at 6:45. We were supposed to work in teams to
improve quality,'' said Robert Huddleston of Lebanon, who worked at
the plant for five months last year and is one of the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleges the company ''willfully, knowingly, and/or
recklessly violated'' federal law.
</P>
<P>
   ''TRW is systematically cheating employees out of thousands of
dollars and increasing their profits, potentially by millions, in
15-minute increments,'' Sanford said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Currently we are only aware of the situation at the Lebanon
plant, but if TRW implements this policy nationwide, or globally,
it has made substantially more millions on the backs of
uncompensated employees.''
</P>
<P>
   TRW spokesman Jay McCaffrey said he is ''not aware'' of such a
policy on pre-shift meetings. He declined to comment on the
lawsuit, saying the company's attorneys had not yet seen a copy.
</P>
<P>
   Plant manager Kenneth Caldwell did not return a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   TRW, which provides products and services for the automotive,
aerospace and information systems markets, has about 118,000
employees worldwide. The company had about $17 billion in sales
last year and reported net income of $469 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has Tennessee auto parts plants in Sevierville,
Rogersville, Vonore and Cookeville.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford said the off-the-clock work was discovered during an
investigation of race discrimination allegations at the plant. His
firm has asked the federal Equal Employment Opportunities
Commission for the right to sue over those allegations.

<HEADLINE> HUD Seeks Wider Housing Integration  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Public housing directors must stop steering
public housing residents with similar earnings or by race to the
same buildings under a new Department of Housing and Urban
Development rule announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Segregation is an ugly part of our past that has no place in
the 21st century,'' said HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo at a news
conference announcing the policy.
</P>
<P>
   Cuomo was joined by Southern Christian Leadership Conference
President Martin Luther King III and fair housing advocates to say
public housing directors must work harder to ensure balanced mix of
residents on their properties.
</P>
<P>
   HUD released a new report citing several examples of segregation
with public housing complexes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a Biloxi, Miss., housing authority was found to have
steered black and Vietnamese applicants to only three of nine
buildings and had no Vietnamese households in its Section 8 rental
assistance program.
</P>
<P>
   A Kaplan, La., housing authority provided lower maintenance
standards but charged more for the service at racially segregated
complexes in 1998. Residents at the white housing were allowed to
have pets and gardens but minority residents couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ''Public housing has all too often done what the private housing
market has done in the U.S., which is to segregate and isolate by
race,'' Cuomo said.
</P>
<P>
   In both the Mississippi and Louisiana case, HUD negotiated
voluntary compliance agreements with the housing authorities to
remedy the discriminatory practices, HUD officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''With this new policy, I think the vision that Martin Luther
King had is finally being brought to reality,'' King III said.

<HEADLINE> McCurry, Fitzwater 'Join' Navy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In their familiar attire of dark business
suits and bright smiles, former White House press secretaries Mike
McCurry and Marlin Fitzwater ''joined'' the Navy on Thursday as
''honorary members.''
</P>
<P>
   In a Pentagon ceremony with Navy Secretary Richard Danzig
presiding, McCurry and Fitzwater were ''adopted'' by the crews of
two sister ships, the destroyers USS Arleigh Burke and the USS
Mitscher.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to expose more of the Navy to prominent civilians
like McCurry and Fitzwater, plus others that Danzig has lined up,
including soccer star Mia Hamm and entertainer Ed McMahon. The
civilians, in turn, are to use their status as ''honorary members''
to act as unpaid goodwill ambassadors for the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a relatively declining percentage of Americans have the
experience of military service, one question that concerns us is:
How do we convey a sense of that experience to the larger American
public?'' Danzig said.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, Danzig believes, is to enlist the help of more
civilians who can help connect America to it military.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry, who as President Clinton's press secretary gained
acclaim as a master at shaping, or ''spinning,'' a public relations
message, said he looks forward to getting aboard ship.
</P>
<P>
   ''The commander and I have already talked about the ship
schedule and where we can go out, and if you will teach me how to
navigate straight and true, I'll teach you how to spin,'' he said
with a laugh.

<HEADLINE> Mint Director Joins Zale.com  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The man who mints the nation's coins wants a
little change.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Diehl, director of the U.S. Mint, said he is leaving the
job he has held since 1994 to enter the dot.com world.
</P>
<P>
   Diehl, who spearheaded online sales of coins and other
collectibles at the Mint, said in an interview Thursday he will
leave the government Sunday and become president of Zale.com, which
sells jewelry online, around early April.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been able to cut my teeth on doing e-tailing at the
Mint,'' Diehl said, adding that he will use those skills in his new
job. ''This was as close to the ideal job that I could find'' he
said of Zale.com.
</P>
<P>
   Diehl also will become senior vice president of Zale Corp.,
parent to the online venture.
</P>
<P>
   The Mint began selling coins online in April and rang up $26
million in online sales during the final three months of 1999,
Diehl said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mint's deputy director, John Mitchell, will take over as
acting director. Set to become the next director is Jay Johnson, a
former Democratic congressman from Wisconsin who now works at the
Agriculture Department as deputy assistant secretary for
congressional relations.
</P>
<P>
   At the Mint, Diehl oversaw the introduction of the new
golden-colored Sacagawea dollar coins and has aggressively marketed
the new coin, particularly mindful of the flop of the Susan B.
Anthony dollar coin.
</P>
<P>
   He launched a $40 million ad campaign to promote the Sacagawea
coin and teamed up with Wal-Mart to use the coins when making
change for customers, a move that annoyed some small banks. He also
launched the popular, new series of quarters commemorating each of
the 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   Diehl has been credited for making the agency more efficient and
profitable. Over the past three years, the Mint's profits, which
flow to the U.S. Treasury, rose to $2.7 billion, six times what
they were in 1997, the Mint said.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Voters Find Bush 'Arrogant'  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Since wrapping up the GOP presidential
nomination, George W. Bush has been sounding like a sore winner,
making acid remarks about Al Gore and dismissing former Republican
rival John McCain. Voters are starting to tell pollsters the Texas
governor is ''cocky'' and ''arrogant.''
</P>
<P>
   With his Texas swagger and a look that some voters describe as a
smirk, the governor's remarks on everything from the election to
executions have renewed questions about whether he's ready for his
prime-time presidential run.
</P>
<P>
   A new Pew Research Center poll suggests Bush is being hurt by it
all.
</P>
<P>
   Among people who now support his Democratic rival, Vice
President Al Gore, the percentage who dislike Bush because of his
personality has jumped from 19 percent in October to 33 percent.
The figure for Gore among Bush supporters is 22 percent, compared
to 24 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
   And 31 percent of all the poll's respondents chose a negative
term when asked the one word that best described Bush, compared to
12 percent who thought of a negative term first a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   While the majority of references to Bush were positive, the most
frequently mentioned negative words were ''arrogant,'' ''dislike,''
''untrustworthy,'' ''wimp,'' ''bad'' or ''cocky.''
</P>
<P>
   The most frequently mentioned negative word for Gore was
''boring,'' and ''dull'' was second, tied with ''politician,''
undefined as to positive or negative. Next on the negative list
came ''dishonest'' and ''incompetent.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Greenstein, a political science professor at Princeton
University, said Bush risks being labeled ''a non gravitas wise guy
-- that is something he has got to put some effort into working on
or walking away from'' if he is to win in November.
</P>
<P>
   Perceived arrogance won't necessarily hurt, said Darrell West,
professor of political science at Brown University, ''if it leads
people to view you as a strong and effective leader.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bill Mayer, a political science professor at Northeastern
University, said that too often Bush's campaign seems to ''show him
off in ways that accentuate the notion that he is not very
substantive ... has no great reason to appear so cocky.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview published Thursday in The Washington Post, the
Texas governor launched into unsolicited and repeated criticism of
the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Asked directly whether Gore has the honesty and integrity to
serve as president, Bush replied: ''That's what I'd like to know
and that's what America would like to know.''
</P>
<P>
   The remarks came a week after Bush got into political hot water
by coming off as dismissive of McCain, his closest rival for the
GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with The New York Times, Bush was asked whether
the Arizona senator had raised his consciousness about reform.
</P>
<P>
   Bush replied, ''No, he didn't change my views.'' Bush also said
he had no intention of making concessions to McCain on campaign
finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   While the governor later softened his remarks about McCain, his
initial criticism mimicked remarks from his press secretary, who
said when asked about negotiating a settlement with McCain,
''Negotiations? Governor Bush won.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush didn't directly address the issue Thursday, but he touched
on his approach to Gore when answering a question about Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know people on the vice president's team don't like me to
remind people that this guy will say anything to get elected, but
I'm going to,'' Bush said at a news conference held after he spoke
to students at Colonial High School here in central Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's the man who said he invented the Internet; he didn't.
He's the man who said during a debate he was responsible for the
Earned Income Tax Credit, yet it was passed two years before his
arrival in the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe I can keep the tone right, because America wants
somebody to lead the country in the future, but I'm going to keep
asking those questions,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Explanations aside, Bush's remarks -- and questions about his
readiness to be president -- have been recurring themes on the
campaign trail:
</P>
<P>
   -- During a debate on Dec. 6 in Phoenix, Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah, took a playful jab at Bush that carried a serious charge:
''I really believe that you need more experience before you become
president of the United States. That's why I'm thinking of you as a
vice presidential candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   -- In that same debate, questions arose about whether Bush was
really reading, as he had previously stated, a biography of Dean
Acheson, President Truman's secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of answering a question about what lessons he had
learned from Acheson, Bush recited sections from the foreign policy
section of his stump speech.
</P>
<P>
   -- During a debate on March 2 in Los Angeles, the governor
laughed when asked about Calvin Jerold Burdine, a Texas death row
inmate who had been ordered freed after 16 years because his lawyer
slept through his trial. Bush said the man's release proved ''the
system worked.''
</P>
<P>
   -- In the run-up to the March 7 Super Tuesday voting, Bush
started running TV ads in New York questioning McCain's commitment
to fighting breast cancer. McCain's sister suffered from the
disease, and when that was brought too Bush's attention, he said it
was ''all the more reason to remind'' McCain of his record.
</P>
<P>
   McCain replied: ''I wonder if someone who would treat a
situation like that is ready for prime time.''

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker introduces bill to ban bear hunt  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   Marilyn Slate has lived at the foot of High Point State Park in
the northwestern corner of the state for 40 years with her husband,
the mountains and the quiet. For the past four years she has also
shared her living space with black bears.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bears come right on our front porch and get in the birdseed,''
said Slate, 62, of Wantage.
</P>
<P>
   ''One little bear, maybe about 150 pounds, was here night before
last. He takes our bird feeders down, even broke our lattice under
our porch to get feed that had spilled onto the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Complaints that the larger and more brazen black bear population
in northern New Jersey have invaded suburban back yards, killed
pets and scared small children prompted the state Fish and Game
Council to vote this week to authorize New Jersey's first bear hunt
since 1971.
</P>
<P>
   The bear population, which numbered fewer than 100 two decades
ago, has reached an all-time high of more than 1,000 in 11 of the
state's 21 counties, the council said. Damage complaints have
soared from 285 in 1995 to 1,659 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our immediate challenge is to achieve a balance between the
number of bears that people are willing to tolerate and the number
of black bears that the habitat can support,'' said council
Chairman John W. Bradway.
</P>
<P>
   Animal rights activists called the council's plan a cruel
punishment for the bears who are doing no harm.
</P>
<P>
   ''What they're doing ... is like shooting into a crowd to stop
crime,'' said Nina Austenberg, a director of the Humane Society of
the United States' regional office in Flanders.
</P>
<P>
   She said the weapons approved by the council, including a bow
and arrow, would likely only injure the animals, and said there was
a danger in killing mothers of bear cubs, who usually travel with
their mothers for 1 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then you have cubs running around,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. C. Louis Bassano, R-Union, introduced a bill Thursday
that would ban the bear hunt. He said the agricultural committee
planned to hold a hearing on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The Fish and Game Council requires no approval to order the bear
hunt. The arm of the state Division of Fish and Wildlife would have
to reapprove the hunt each year.
</P>
<P>
   The council scheduled a public hearing on June 6, after which it
could change or modify its plan. If the plan is adopted, bear
hunting would begin in September and continue until December.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the bear population in residential areas has
grown in part because of residential development in former rural
areas. Hunting seasons in neighboring New York and Pennsylvania may
have also pushed bears to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   State officials have tried ''aversion conditioning'' to scare
off bears with pepper spray or rubber buckshot and urged residents
not to feed the bears and to bring their garbage indoors at night.
</P>
<P>
   But the tactics haven't kept the animals away, says Slate. Her
neighbors have had bears break into their garages and she is afraid
to take her grandchildren for a walk in the woods, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Slate wishes there was another solution to killing the bears,
though.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish there was someplace else they could take them that was
more rural,'' Slate said. ''They are beautiful animals, but there
are just too many of them.''

<HEADLINE> Reform Rabbi: Jews Harsh on Pope  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORCESTER, Mass. (AP) -- Some Jews have been unreasonably harsh
toward Pope John Paul II's statements on the Holocaust, the head of
Reform Judaism's synagogue union said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Eric Yoffie, president of the Union of American Hebrew
Congregations, said the pope ''was expressing his sorrow not only
as head of a billion-member church but, also, as a man who knew
personally so many victims of the slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that Jews everywhere were touched by the ceremony
and by his words, which so clearly came from his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoffie issued the statement just after the pope visited the
Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Many Jewish spokesmen felt the Vatican's 1998 statement on the
Holocaust, and the pope's March 12 apology for Catholic failings,
were inadequate because blame was put on individual Christians
rather than the church as an institution.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech on Catholic-Jewish relations at Assumption College,
a Catholic campus, Yoffie said ''Jewish representatives should have
enthusiastically welcomed the recent statements as an important
step forward.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not criticize any Jewish organizations or individuals by
name.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is surely inappropriate to greet a heartfelt act of
contrition with a pointed reminder of every act of wrongdoing that
I think may have been left off the list,'' he said. ''If every step
forward is greeted with an attack, there is little incentive for
additional steps to be taken.''
</P>
<P>
   He said John Paul has been ''both vigorous and daring'' in
condemning anti-Semitism and promoting friendly relations with
Jews.

<HEADLINE> NYC Cop Shooting a Campaign Issue  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- After several months of largely avoiding even
the mention of each other's name, Senate rivals Hillary Clinton and
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani are attacking each other over a fatal police
shooting that has become an issue of race, politics and decency.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady said this week that the GOP mayor's ''utter
failure of leadership'' was a sign that he couldn't be trusted as a
senator. The Rev. Jesse Jackson said Giuliani's combative response
to the shooting was ''not just meanness, it's mental.''
</P>
<P>
   The shooting of Patrick Dorismond alone would have likely
stirred anger in the city's minority communities. But Giuliani's
release of details about Dorismond's sealed juvenile record and his
suggestions that the victim was responsible for his own death drew
howls of protest.
</P>
<P>
   ''He should be expressing sympathy about the loss of life, and I
think that's the point that the average voter is thinking, 'What's
going on here?''' said Steven Cohen, director of the graduate
program in Public Policy and Administration at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has maintained that the news media are incapable of
covering police shooting cases fairly, so his duty is to emphasize
the police point of view.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani campaign manager Bruce Teitelbaum said Thursday that
criticism from prominent Democrats is simply aimed at aiding
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why is anyone surprised that Hillary Clinton and her
supporters in the Al Sharpton wing of the Democratic Party,
including Jesse Jackson, are shamelessly exploiting this situation
for partisan political gain?'' Teitelbaum asked.
</P>
<P>
   But some Republicans are also wondering what political benefits
lay in Giuliani's refusal to meet with community members, as he has
done during past police shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think she can beat him, but he can beat himself,''
said Rich Bond, former chairman of the Republican National
Committee, who once worked for Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Dorismond, a black security guard, was shot March 16. An
undercover police officer approached him as part of a drug sting
and asked whether Dorismond would sell him marijuana. A scuffle
ensued, backup officers arrived and the gun went off.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting was the fourth of an unarmed black man by
undercover officers in the city in the past 13 months, and came
just a few weeks after a jury acquitted four white undercover
officers in the shooting death of Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   After initially cautioning people to withhold judgment about the
Dorismond case, the mayor criticized Dorismond's character --
including disclosing information about an arrest when Dorismond was
13 years old that was supposed to be sealed.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's something that is not well about his response to
unarmed people being shot by police,'' Jackson said Thursday at a
Manhattan high school. ''This consistent reaction for the police
who shoot unarmed people before even asking for information,
without showing sympathy to the victims ... that sounds like a
disturbed person.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has used the mayor's reaction to underline a theme of
her campaign: That the irritable Giuliani lacks the temperament to
be a senator.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mayor's utter failure of leadership hurts the communities
he won't meet with, and the police who defend the city,'' she said.
''If Rudy Giuliani won't represent all New Yorkers as mayor, how
can we trust him to represent the whole state in the Senate?''
</P>
<P>
   While Giuliani's camp fends off attacks from Democrats, the
mayor also could find himself being challenged from the right.
Anti-abortion activist and Operation Rescue founder Randall Terry
said Thursday he may get into the race because Giuliani, who
supports abortion rights, ''is a threat to the pro-life movement.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I would rather see a pro-abortion Democrat in office than a
pro-abortion Republican,'' said Terry, who lost a 1998 Republican
congressional primary.

<HEADLINE> 8th Death in Day Care Vehicle Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROIS-RIVIERES, Quebec (AP) -- A 4-year-old boy died Thursday of
head and abdominal injuries suffered in a road accident last week
that killed seven other pre-schoolers, including his 2-year-old
sister.
</P>
<P>
   The March 16 accident in a rural community 70 miles north of
Montreal occurred when a minivan transporting the children on a
day-care outing swerved into the path of an oncoming minivan.
</P>
<P>
   Both drivers survived, but seven of the children aged 2 to 5
years old died. The victims included Stacy Roy, whose brother Kevin
died Thursday at Trois-Rivieres regional hospital, a spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Auger, the day-care center operator who was driving the
van, was released from an area hospital Wednesday after being
treated for minor injuries and shock. One of the children killed in
the accident was her 5-year-old son.

<HEADLINE> GOP Seeks Wilderness Study Deadline  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Western Republicans are pushing a bill that
would set a 10-year deadline for Congress to act on wilderness
designation proposals, something that Democrats say could endanger
millions of acres of pristine federal land.
</P>
<P>
   Only Congress can designate wilderness areas, but agencies such
as the Forest Service or Bureau of Land Management can treat remote
areas as if they were wilderness by declaring them ''wilderness
study areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal from Rep. Jim Hansen, R-Utah, stipulates that once
a federal land management agency declares a study area, Congress
has 10 years to act or the area loses its protection.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the lack of any deadline allows federal agencies
to lock up land indefinitely and ban activities such as logging,
mining, building, bicycling and off-road vehicle use.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress never intended that these areas would be studied in
perpetuity,'' said Rep. Rick Hill, R-Mont. ''Congress doesn't get
to act because there's no urgency to act.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and environmentalists say Hansen's proposal would
eviscerate federal wilderness protection.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's clearly an attack on the wilderness system,'' said Larry
Young of the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the Hansen plan say opponents could repeatedly block
wilderness proposals, eventually allowing those areas to be opened
for recreational or other uses.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's a good idea to give the Senate wilderness
study hostages to hold over the House,'' said Rep. Tom Udall,
D-N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has approved several wilderness study plans in recent
years while releasing other study areas, said Udall's cousin, Rep.
Mark Udall, D-Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see why we need a deadline,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A House Resources subcommittee headed by Hansen sent the measure
to the full committee on Thursday, rejecting two Mark Udall
amendments meant to torpedo it. Resources Committee Chairman Don
Young, R-Alaska, is a co-sponsor of Hansen's bill, making it likely
the measure will reach the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   One of Mark Udall's amendments would have changed the bill's
title to the ''Wilderness Study Termination Act'' instead of
''America's Wilderness Protection Act.'' Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash.,
said the current title was too misleading.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we were used-car salesmen, they'd throw us in jail and take
our license for doing something like that,'' Inslee said.

<HEADLINE> Mother pleads as Assembly committee considers changes to sprinklerbill  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- A mother whose son died in a January
dormitory fire at Seton Hall University begged an Assembly
committee Thursday to require fire sprinklers in every school, as
lawmakers weighed changes in the state's $90 million proposal to do
just that.
</P>
<P>
   ''Please don't put a price tag on our children's lives,'' Candy
Karol cried as she testified before the committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly housing and finance committee had met to consider a
bill similar to one passed by the Senate budget committee Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But that bill didn't satisfy the Assembly members, who suggested
doubling the time that schools would have to install sprinklers,
requiring all off-campus housing to add the protective devices and
using state money to fund the project.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers heard from school officials, fire safety inspectors,
sprinkler contractors and campus police, all supporting any measure
that would force colleges and universities to install the automatic
fire suppression systems.
</P>
<P>
   Several students from Seton Hall, as well as their family
members, crowded the front rows of the hearing room. Three students
died and six were critically injured in the Jan. 19 fire at a
dormitory on the school's West Orange campus.
</P>
<P>
   ''Please take a look at their faces. Don't let them be on the
front pages of a newspaper because they died in a fire,'' said
Karol, of Green Brook.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Karol, 18, planned a career in the FBI, his mother said,
but the school's lack of sprinklers cost him his life. Karol also
told lawmakers that more lives could be saved if every freshman in
the state were taught basic fire safety.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill requires sprinklers in every room in every dorm
in New Jersey by 2002, regardless of whether the building is old,
new, public or private. A 1991 law mandated sprinklers installed in
only new student housing units.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Educational Facilities Authority last month
reported that 36,600 beds in college dorm rooms -- about 71 percent
of the total -- have no sprinklers. This included eight colleges and
universities where none of the dorms have sprinklers in students'
rooms, including Rider University, Kean University and Seton Hall
University.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman John V. Kelly, R-Essex, held the lower house
measure, but did promise Karol that the Legislature would act soon.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's proposals would require all of the installation to be
done within four years of the law's passage. The bill also would
cover all off-campus fraternity and sorority houses. Three students
died in a fire Sunday at an off-campus fraternity near Bloomsburg
University in Pennsylvania. Two were from New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly and other members of the committee suggested a sliding
interest rate on the $90 million in loans to the schools.
Institutions that do the work in the first year would be charged no
interest while the rate increased over the term, Kelly suggested.
</P>
<P>
   There was also talk that the state should give the schools
grants to do the work, using budget surplus or money from the
recent tobacco settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would create a $90 million fund to provide
partial loans at discount interest rates. Public colleges would be
obligated to repay half the debt, and the state would cover the
rest, turning it into what would in effect be a cash grant. For
private institutions, the state would cover a third of the debt,
leaving the rest to the college to pay from its tuition or
endowment sources.
</P>
<P>
   A Rutgers University security official told the committee that
school's estimate is $35 million to install the sprinklers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any cost that the sprinkler program brings about will have to
be passed onto the students in the form of rent,'' said Jay Kohl,
the university's executive director for public safety.
</P>
<P>
   One estimate is as high as $190 for each student to cover the
sprinkler tab, Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want to raise any student's tuition rates. We're out
to save their lives,'' said Assemblywoman Carol Murphy, R-Morris.

<HEADLINE> Army Replaced Patriot Missiles  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS, AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army quickly and quietly replaced hundreds
of Patriot air defense weapons in the Persian Gulf and South Korea
after discovering a pattern of problems with the missiles that were
kept constantly on a high state of alert, officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriot, which gained public fame in 1991 in its combat
debut against Iraqi Scud missiles fired on Saudi Arabia and Israel,
is a key to the defense of U.S. and allied forces in the Gulf and
on the Korean Peninsula. Patriots in the Gulf and in South Korea
are kept on high alert because of short warning times.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Paul Kern, a senior Army acquisitions officer, told a
Pentagon news conference that the decision to replace the missiles
with newer ones was made about 10 days ago and the swap-out was
completed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   None of the seven foreign countries that operate U.S.-made
Patriot missile batteries was told about the problem until this
week, Kern said. ''I don't think any of them are angry about the
situation,'' he said. ''They are concerned, probably, the same as
we are, that we find solutions to the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Israel, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the Netherlands,
Germany, Japan and Taiwan were not told about the possible
vulnerability of their Patriot missiles, Kern replied: ''We did
what we thought was a very fair assessment of keeping the security
of our forces and or allies in check, and we think we did it the
right way.''
</P>
<P>
   The technical problem, as described by Kern, appears related to
the way in which the Patriots are used.
</P>
<P>
   Testing has shown that those kept constantly on high alert --
with electrical current keeping them in ''hot status'' ready to
fire -- have developed problems with a component known as the radio
frequency downlink, described by Kern as a ''black box'' that sends
signals back and forth from a ground station to guide the missile
in flight.
</P>
<P>
   Kern said the manufacturer, Raytheon Co., had warranted the
missile to work properly while in ''hot status'' for a maximum of
six months. The Army has kept some Patriots in that status for
years, he said, while swapping 50 to 70 of them a year for testing
and running diagnostic tests on them in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Kern said the cause of the problem has not been found.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, issued a statement saying he had been assured by the
Army on Wednesday that the swap-out of missiles has left U.S.
forces at no higher level of risk.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, I am concerned that these steps are only short-term
and the long-term solution for fixing yet another military
shortfall has not yet been determined,'' Spence said.
</P>
<P>
   The missiles that developed problems range in age from 3 years
to 10 years, Kern said. The components suspected of failing cost as
much as $100,000 per missile, but the replacement effort will cost
more than that. Kern said he could not offer a total cost estimate.
</P>
<P>
   The problem and the swap-out of missiles was first reported
Thursday by The Wall Street Journal. The newspaper said Patriot
missiles were pulled from approximately 11 batteries in South
Korea, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Each battery has about 64 missiles,
although Kern would not confirm specific numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriot is used to defend against aircraft and short-range
ballistic missiles at medium and high altitudes. An upgraded
version, called the PAC-3, is being developed to provide a greater
capability against short-range missiles. Kern said the PAC-3
version is expected to be ready for use next year.

<HEADLINE> Heartburn Drug Removed From Market  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER, AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cisapride, a heartburn drug that has been
associated with 80 deaths, is being voluntarily withdrawn from the
market, the Food and Drug Administration announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Marketed under the brand name Propulsid, the drug has been
prescribed for patients who suffer severe heartburn, or
gastroesophageal reflux disease, and have not responded to other
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Janssen Pharmaceutica of Titusville, N.J., the Propulsid maker,
announced it was withdrawing the drug from the market as of July
14. FDA officials said the agency concurred with the action.
</P>
<P>
   Propulsid was approved by the FDA in 1993, but there has been a
series of increasingly actions to warn against serious side effects
from the drug. In 1998, the agency announced that there had been
some deaths among patients taking the drug and issued a warning
that Propulsid was linked to cardiac problems in some patients. The
drug's label was revised then to reflect this concern.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the FDA issued an even more severe warning. Patients
were urged to undergo tests to make sure the drug had not affected
their hearts. New labels also warned that Propulsid should not be
used by patients with disorders of the heart, kidney or lung, or by
patients who were taking some medications to treat heart problems,
allergies, depression or AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, FDA officials said that 80 deaths and 341 adverse
events have now been associated with Propulsid.
</P>
<P>
   The agency had ordered an advisory board meeting in April to
discuss the problems with Propulsid. That meeting has now been
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Florence Houn of the FDA said that Propulsid had a unique
action that was important to some patients. She said the pill
triggered motility, a wave like action in the gut, that moved
gastric acid away from the esophagus, thus preventing nighttime
heartburn for some patients.
</P>
<P>
   She said Janssen is continuing to offer the drug for another
four months to give patients time to contact their physicians in
order to find alternate therapies.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Janssen Pharmaceutica did not respond to a request
for comment.

<HEADLINE> Man Gets $50,000 for Finding Oscars  </HEADLINE>
By ANTHONY BREZNICAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The 61-year-old junk man who rescued 52
stolen Oscars from a trash heap was given a $50,000 reward Thursday
from the shipping company that lost the statuettes.
</P>
<P>
   ''If anybody says honesty don't pay, send them to me,'' Willie
Fulgear said during a presentation outside police headquarters.
''I'm a poor man and I stumbled across, I guess, gold. And I gave
it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulgear rolled his eyes when police Cmdr. David Kalish called
him a local hero.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't save anybody's life,'' Fulgear said. ''But wait, yes
I did -- Oscar's.''
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, he made a living salvaging discarded machine parts.
Now he hopes his ''golden'' find will get him a book contract or a
movie about his life.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has really turned things around for me,'' he said earlier
at his one-room apartment about a block from the parking lot where
he found the missing Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   Fulgear said he'd like to use the money to make a down payment
on a home for his 22-year-old son, Allen.
</P>
<P>
   Roadway Express, the Akron, Ohio, company hired to deliver the
statues, decided to give Fulgear the money after police concluded
he had nothing to do with the theft.
</P>
<P>
   Roadway Vice President T.J. O'Connor said the original award was
for information leading to arrest and conviction of the thieves.
Fulgear's award was a special gift for simply recovering the
Oscars, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do want to thank him and reward him for his honesty and
important role he played in ensuring that the show goes on,''
O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   A Roadway driver has been charged with stealing 55 Oscar
statuettes from a warehouse March 8. Three of the figures remain
unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences on Thursday
extended Fulgear an invitation to Sunday's awards show,
traditionally the most sought-after ticket in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't wait to go. They're going to fit me up with a tux
tomorrow,'' Fulgear said. ''I'd like to meet Billy Crystal.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen Fulgear, a security guard in the city's fashion district,
was overcome with emotion after learning his father would get the
reward.
</P>
<P>
   ''My Dad has always been a silent hero, the one that nobody ever
talks about. I think the good guy finally wins one here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Fulgear said he hopes the publicity will also help him
find Allen's mother, whom he hasn't seen since they split in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like my son to know his mother,'' he said.

   Today's Highlight in History:
</P>
<P>
   One year ago, on March 24, 1999, NATO launched airstrikes
against Yugoslavia, marking the first time in its 50-year existence
that it had ever attacked a sovereign country.
</P>
<P>
   On this date:
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In 1934, President Roosevelt signed a bill granting future
independence to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944, in occupied Rome, the Nazis executed more than 300
civilians in reprisal for an attack by Italian partisans the day
before that killed 32 German soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, Tennessee Williams' play ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof''
opened on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, rock-and-roll singer Elvis Presley was inducted into

   In 1980, one of El Salvador's most respected Roman Catholic
Church leaders, Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero, was shot to death
by gunmen as he celebrated Mass in San Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the nation's worst oil spill occurred as the
supertanker Exxon Valdez ran aground on a reef in Alaska's Prince
William Sound and began leaking 11 million gallons of crude.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago: Soviet military vehicles rumbled through the
heart of the Lithuanian capital of Vilnius as lawmakers in the
breakaway Baltic republic voted to transfer their power to foreign
soil if they were attacked or arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago: The House of Representatives passed, 234-to-199,
a welfare reform package calling for the most profound changes in
social programs since the New Deal; President Clinton criticized
the bill, saying it was ''weak on work and tough on children.'' For
the first time in 20 years, no British soldiers were patrolling the
streets of Belfast, Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   One year ago: The National Transportation Safety Board concluded
that Boeing 737 rudder problems caused two fatal airline crashes

<HEADLINE> WWII Monument Criticisms Heard  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Objections to the design for a monument to
World War II between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln
Memorial were aired Thursday at a Senate hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism came from Judy Scott Feldman, co-chair of the Task
Force on Memorials at the Committee of 100 on the Federal City, a
private citizens' group.
</P>
<P>
   She objected to 56 columns -- each 17 feet high -- proposed for
the north and south sides of the memorial, to changes in the
reflecting pool that face the Lincoln Memorial, and to restricting
public access to the National Mall through the new structure.
</P>
<P>
   ''No more marches on Washington!'' she said in an interview
after the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Feldman proposed a preview of what the new memorial would be
like by building a full-scale temporary mockup on the site.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Committee of 100 is not opposed to commemorating World War
II,'' she said. ''It is the current design on the Mall location
that is our concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Feldman testified before the subcommittee on National Parks,
Historic Preservation and Recreation of the Senate Committee on
Energy and Natural Resources.
</P>
<P>
   A final design for the memorial has not yet been approved, but
John G. Parsons, associate director of the National Park Service,
said after the hearing that changing the site would be very
difficult.

<HEADLINE> Trimble Challenged for Leadership  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- A Protestant critic of Northern
Ireland's peace settlement announced Thursday he would try to oust
David Trimble from leadership of the province's largest party, the
Ulster Unionists.
</P>
<P>
   Ulster Unionist Martin Smyth, South Belfast member of
Parliament, said he opposes involvement of the Sinn Fein Party in a
Northern Ireland power-sharing government because of the party's
alliance with the outlawed Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein ''still have not been prepared to go forth as bona
fide democrats,'' he told the British Broadcasting Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are hiding behind the figment of imagination that they
actually cannot speak for the IRA when we all know that they are an
inseparable body,'' Smyth said.
</P>
<P>
   Smyth, 69, said he would challenge Trimble at Saturday's meeting
of the Ulster Unionists' 858-member council and that he had the
backing of a ''significant'' number of party supporters.
</P>
<P>
   It is Smyth's second attempt to win the leadership. He lost to
Trimble five years ago when James Molyneaux resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, a central figure in the Northern Ireland peace process,
said he was ''somewhat surprised and a little bit disappointed'' by
the challenge, but that he hoped it would ''finally clear the
air.'' He said he trusted delegates at the council would endorse a
continuation of party policy.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble has struggled to keep the support of party dissenters
throughout negotiations that led to the 1998 peace accord and last
year's establishment of a four-party Catholic-Protestant coalition
administration for the province. He shared a Nobel Peace Prize that
year for his efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The new Cabinet -- which includes Sinn Fein -- was suspended Feb.
11 when Ulster Unionists threatened to resign their posts over the
IRA's failure to hand over any weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair, in Portugal for a European Union
summit, said he backed Trimble's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have got a very great deal of respect for David Trimble and
the enormous courage he has shown in trying to give people a
peaceful future in Northern Ireland,'' said Blair.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional elements within the party have often accused Trimble
of surrendering unionist principles, but the 55-year old lawyer has
won praise and respect from politicians abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Smyth, a Presbyterian minister and a traditionalist, is
uncompromising in his views about how far unionists should go for
the sake of peace.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Molyneaux, the former party leader, committed his support
to Smyth on Thursday, as did prominent anti-agreement Ulster
Unionist Jeffrey Donaldson.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein's Bairbre de Brun, who was health minister in the
suspended Cabinet, said republicans wanted to see if there was an
Ulster Unionist leader ''willing to move forward, who was willing
to implement the Good Friday Agreement and who was willing to
actively work with others to manage change.''

<HEADLINE> Highlights of Fiscal 2001 Budget  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Highlights of the fiscal 2001 budget Republicans were
pushing
through the House on Thursday:
<TEXT>
<P>
   OVERALL: Would spend $1.82 trillion while collecting $2 trillion
in revenue, yielding a $183 billion surplus, the biggest ever. Of
that, $166 billion of the surplus would come from Social Security
revenues and $17 billion from other sources within the budget.
</P>
<P>
   TAXES: Would cut taxes by at least $150 billion over the next
five years, and by as much as about $240 billion. Clinton proposed
$99 billion in tax cuts and $96 billion in tax increases, largely
on tobacco and some businesses. Over those five years, the
government is currently expected to collect $10.7 trillion in
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   DEBT REDUCTION: Republicans and Clinton would use all $1
trillion in expected Social Security surpluses through 2005 to
reduce the national debt. Republicans assign another $107 billion
in non-Social Security surpluses to debt reduction, though most of
it would vanish under their plans to use the money for tax cuts and
a Medicare prescription drug benefit. Clinton's budget has $90
billion in non-Social Security surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   SPENDING: Republicans would spend $307 billion for defense next
year, $1 billion more than Clinton. For domestic programs excluding
Social Security and other automatically paid benefits, Republicans
propose $289 billion -- $29 billion below Clinton. Both sides
propose increases in 2001 over this year's totals for defense,
education, veterans and biomedical research. Over the next five
years, Clinton would spend enough for overall defense and domestic
programs to stay roughly even with inflation. Republicans would
fall about $110 billion below that.
</P>
<P>
   MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY -- Clinton wants to create a new,
voluntary prescription drug benefit for all Medicare beneficiaries.
Republicans set aside money for a more modest version that covers
only lower-income people, or for other changes to the program.
Neither side, however, proposes benefit reductions or payroll tax
increases that many experts say both programs will need to remain
solvent as the baby boom generation begins retiring in a decade.

<HEADLINE> Baptist Minister Convicted of Abuse  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA K. BROWN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOUNTVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A Baptist minister and his wife were
convicted Thursday of abusing a girl they took from an orphanage
and raised as the family servant.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Joseph Combs, and his wife, Evangeline, were also
convicted of kidnapping, among other charges. They hugged and said
''I love you'' to their children after the verdict was read.
</P>
<P>
   Esther Combs, whom the couple took as a baby from an Indiana
orphanage in 1978, sobbed and declined comment. She was considered
kidnapped because the couple took her with the pretense to adopt
her, but never did.
</P>
<P>
   Esther, now 22 and living in another state under a different
name, testified that Mrs. Combs beat her with baseball bats, burned
her with a curling iron and pulled out chunks of her flesh with
pliers -- causing more than 400 scars on her body.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was denied an education, forced to do all the
chores and required to wear clothing that covered her scars.
</P>
<P>
   The Combses' five children testified that Esther wasn't abused.
They said she could read and write well, went shopping without
their parents and chose to wear long dresses.
</P>
<P>
   Combs, 51, denied the allegations and testified that he was
''bewildered'' by Esther's claims. He said the couple meant to
adopt Esther but couldn't afford the financial demands from the
Baptist Children's Home in Valparaiso, Ind. Mrs. Combs, 50, didn't
testify.
</P>
<P>
   The two will be sentenced April 25. Combs faces up to 144 years
in prison and his wife up to 73.
</P>
<P>
   Combs, former pastor of the now-defunct Emmanuel Baptist Church
in Bristol, also was convicted of aggravated assault, aggravated
perjury and rape. Mrs. Combs also was convicted of aggravated child
abuse. They were taken to jail after their convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors and defense attorneys wouldn't comment after the trial.
Prosecutor Greeley Wells said he was relieved.
</P>
<P>
   ''The guilty verdict was thoroughly justified by the evidence in
this case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the two decades of brutal abuse was hidden
until Esther was hospitalized in February 1997 after trying to kill
herself by drinking antifreeze. Doctors found layers of scars on
her body and fractures that had not healed properly, according to
testimony.

<HEADLINE> 2 Killed in N.C. Wall Collapse  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.C. (AP) -- A 26-foot-high cinder-block wall collapsed
at a tire store under construction Thursday, killing two workers
and injuring a third. A gust of wind was thought to be the most
likely cause.
</P>
<P>
   The injured worker was hospitalized in stable condition with a
head injury, said Allison Smith, a supervisor for the Cabarrus
County Emergency Medical Service.
</P>
<P>
   The store was being built for Discount Tire Co. The company's
regional manager in Charlotte did not immediately return messages
left with his office.
</P>
<P>
   Government safety and health inspectors were at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   When all four walls of a building are not complete, the
structure is unstable and concrete blocks can be forced down by
even a light gust of wind, said Scott McAnulty, a county inspector.

<HEADLINE> Compromise on WWII Memorial  </HEADLINE>
BY CARL HARTMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The text of a ''Japanese American Creed''
would be carved on a war memorial to be built near the Capitol, but
it would not be referred to on the monument by that title under a
compromise disclosed Thursday by a National Park Service official.
</P>
<P>
   John G. Parsons, associate regional director of the park
service, sent a letter earlier this week with word of the decision
to the chairman of a foundation backing the memorial.
</P>
<P>
   The text of the creed is to be carved on a memorial to the
Japanese Americans who fought in World War II, and to the Japanese
American civilians who were interned in camps during the conflict.
Presidents since the war have repudiated the internment, and
Congress has voted to compensate those interned. Ground was broken
last October for the memorial between the Capitol and Union
Station.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am proud that I am an American of Japanese ancestry,'' the
creed says, ''I believe in her institutions, ideals and traditions.
I glory in her heritage; I boast of her history; I trust in her
future.''
</P>
<P>
   It was written by the late Mike Masaoka, a controversial figure
in the Japanese American community because of his cooperation with
federal authorities on the internment. He was a leading figure in
the Japanese American Citizens League.
</P>
<P>
   Parson's decision was sent in a letter Tuesday to Melvin
Chiogioji, chairman of the National Japanese American Memorial
Foundation and a retired U.S. Navy admiral.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have received many letters from people expressing concern
at the potential inclusion of any quotations from (Masaoka),
reference to the Japanese American Citizens League or words from
the Japanese American Creed,'' Parsons wrote. ''Whether he is being
mischaracterized for his actions or not, it is clear to us that the
current controversy surrounding him is not going to be resolved if
his name is removed from the memorial ...
</P>
<P>
   ''Thus we believe that including his name and the words from the
Japanese American Creed, but deleting the reference to it, is the
best compromise.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was not aware of any controversy about the other
quotations to be inscribed on the monument.

<HEADLINE> New rules for Megan's Law and sex offender notification  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Acting on orders from a federal court
judge, the attorney general on Thursday issued new statewide
guidelines on how information about sex offenders is made public.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations require anyone who receives notice that a
sex offender lives near their home or school to sign papers saying
they will not disseminate the information. The court order
requiring changes in the law came after the judge said the state's
practice of community notification violated sex offender's limited
privacy rights.
</P>
<P>
   Megan's Law categorizes convicted sex offenders in three levels,
based on the perceived danger that the felon presents. For those
offenders deemed most dangerous, the law allows prosecutors to make
public an offender's name, age and address, as well as his job and
its location.
</P>
<P>
   But the law says only those people approved by a judge can see
that information. Courts have held that the community at-large is
not privy to all of those details once a sex offender is released
from prison.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, in order to get that information, people
must sign a statement that says the material is confidential and
that they ''will submit to the jurisdiction of the court.''
</P>
<P>
   If they don't sign, they don't get all the details, said Roger
Shatzkin, a spokesman for Attorney General John J. Farmer, Jr. One
item left out is the sex offender's street address, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on a class-action lawsuit brought by the state Public
Defender's Office, U.S. District Judge Joseph Irenas in December
said the state failed to implement consistent standards on how
notifications are conducted in all 21 counties.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit cited 45 instances in which rules on privacy and
limitations on spreading information were violated. These cases
include a newspaper that published the information and a school
principal who received a sex-offender warning at home and brought
it to work and photocopied it for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Irenas threatened to ban all future community notifications if
the state did not correct the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''The revised guidelines continue to protect the public's safety
at the same time they address the privacy concerns raised by the
district court,'' Farmer said in a statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will continue to work with county prosecutors and local law
enforcement agencies to ensure that Megan's Law is implemented in a
way that safeguards our most vulnerable populations,'' his
statement read.
</P>
<P>
   All county prosecutors in the state now have the revised
guidelines, Shatzkin said, and notifications will be done in the
same manner, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Different counties had different forms of notification,''
Shatzkin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Defender's Office is reviewing the new guidelines
''and waiting to see what the decision will be,'' said Ed Barocas,
an assistant deputy public defender.
</P>
<P>
   One problem, Barocas said, was that the state still gives out
privileged information, even if a person refused to sign the
waiver.
</P>
<P>
   Recipients are told the name and block number of the street
where an offender lives, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly that breaks the veil of privacy,'' Barocas said.
''Even if it is a huge street, 423 Main St., they will tell you it
is the 400 block of Main Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Megan's Law took effect in 1995, authorities in the 21
counties have registered 6,513 sex offenders and have issued
community notifications for 1,042 of them. Of these, 110 of the
offenders were classified as high risk, triggering door-to-door
notification of neighbors and residents likely to encounter the
offender. The rest were more limited notifications to schools, day
care centers and other facilities with custody of children.
</P>
<P>
   Megan's Law is named for Megan Kanka, a 7-year-old Hamilton
Township girl who was raped and murdered in July 1994 by a
convicted sex offender who lived across the street from her Mercer
County home.

<HEADLINE> First Lady's Travel Costs Targeted  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans released documents Thursday
showing Hillary Rodham Clinton reimbursed only a fraction of her
taxpayer-funded campaign travel, a move Democrats claimed was aimed
at embarrassing the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign paid back only about a fifth of
the costs of the trips she took to New York on government jets,
according to figures compiled by the GOP from White House
documents.
</P>
<P>
   The 26 trips Mrs. Clinton took between June 9 and Dec. 14, 1999,
cost $182,471. She reimbursed taxpayers $32,878, according to the
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton flies on government aircraft on the advice of
Secret Service and reimburses the government the same way
presidential candidates do: at the rate of a first-class commercial
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   The practice, though legal, has been criticized by her
Republican rival for the Senate, New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, who says Mrs. Clinton should reimburse all the money.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's amazing that Mrs. Clinton has only reimbursed the
taxpayers a little over $30,000. Something is clearly wrong,''
Giuliani campaign spokeswoman Kim Serafin said.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Jim Kennedy said policies regarding the
first lady's travel on military planes date to the 1980s. He handed
out memos signed by former Republican chiefs of staff James Baker
and John Sununu endorsing the policy.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing by the House subcommittee that oversees the White
House budget, Republicans said the laws governing White House
travel were never intended to cover a political campaign by a first
lady.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in new waters and charting new territory here today,''
said Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz. and the subcommittee chairman. ''It is
unprecedented for a first lady to use government aircraft for her
own political purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats assailed the hearing as an extension of the Giuliani
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a political hearing, make no mistake about it,'' said
Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md. ''We're here to score political points.''
</P>
<P>
   As evidence, they pointed out the hearing was announced
Wednesday by the Republican National Committee, which had claimed
the first lady's taxpayer-funded travel expenses topped $900,000.
</P>
<P>
   RNC staffers stood by the higher figure Thursday. They said the
subcommittee had not been given all the pertinent data by the White
House. During the hearing, RNC officials distributed their own
tally, which included trips taken on Air Force One with the
president.
</P>
<P>
   While the White House supplied information on the travel dates
and who was on the flight, it did not provide costs. Republicans
estimated those based on the $3,705 per hour the Air Force says it
costs to fly a C-20. Republicans noted that aircraft is less
expensive to fly than the C-9, which the first lady is believed to
use on occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Peterson, R-Pa, urged the White House to release the
first lady's travel costs and reimbursements on a monthly basis.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lyle, White House director of office administration,
said that would be ''burdensome'' and was unnecessary because Mrs.
Clinton has followed all laws and regulations involving travel.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's campaign spokesman, Howard Wolfson, claimed the
hearing was an attempt by Republicans to deflect attention from
Giuliani's response to last week's fatal shooting of an unarmed
black man by New York police.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real issue in this campaign is Rudy Giuliani's
irresponsible rush to judgment'' in the case, Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who has stood by the officers, ordered the release of
the dead man's police record, showing a juvenile charge that later
was dropped and two guilty pleas in the mid-1990s to disorderly
conduct.

<HEADLINE> Aggressive tuberculosis control program a big success in NJ  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Aggressive tuberculosis control efforts are
paying off in New Jersey, especially in Newark, which has seen a 43
percent drop in cases to only 47 last year and a 71 percent decline
over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, the number of reported cases of the often-deadly,
airborne respiratory disease dropped 11 percent in 1999 to 571, or
7 per 100,000 residents. It was the third straight year that New
Jersey posted a double-digit decline in cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rates are going down nationally, but this is huge,'' said Dr.
Lee B. Reichman, executive director of the New Jersey Medical
School National Tuberculosis Center at the University of Medicine
and Dentistry of New Jersey in Newark. ''43 percent doesn't happen
in many cities, especially cities like Newark.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the credit goes to a program that ensures that TB
patients are cured -- by supplying antibiotics and having health
workers observe patients taking their pills daily for six months,
Reichman said Thursday, the eve of World TB Day, in a telephone
interview from Siberia, where he is helping evaluate a TB control
program.
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Organization, which declared tuberculosis a
global emergency in 1993, gave this year's observance the theme
''Forging New Partnerships to Stop TB'' in an effort to get more
health and government groups to join the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Tuberculosis, especially strains that have become resistant to
multiple antibiotics, is an increasingly serious health threat in
about two dozen foreign countries. It remains the most deadly
infectious disease in the world, each year sickening 8 million
people -- who each can infect 10 to 15 other people -- and killing 2
million.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one-third of the world's population has been infected by
the bacteria, and about 10 percent of them eventually will become
sick from it. Symptoms include coughing up green or yellow sputum,
sometimes streaked with blood, night sweats and shortness of
breath.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the number of tuberculosis cases soared
from 1985 to 1992, until the federal government restored funding
for TB control that had been eliminated in the previous decade.
Health officials blamed the resurgence on that lack of funding,
immigration and increased foreign travel, and the epidemic of AIDS,
which makes people more susceptible to tuberculosis. Last year, the
number of U.S. tuberculosis cases fell 5 percent to 17,528 and the
disease killed about 1,100 people.
</P>
<P>
   Just seven years ago, Newark had the second-highest rate of
tuberculosis cases among major U.S. cities and New Jersey had the
seventh-highest rate among the states; the state's rank has since
dropped to 12th. Last year, the state's case rate, 7 per 100,000
residents was barely half 1993's: 12.6 per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Like New Jersey, New York City on Thursday reported its seventh
straight year of declining TB cases, a 6 percent drop to 1,460
cases.
</P>
<P>
   The disease, which is spread by airborne secretions when sick
people cough or sneeze, killed 32 New Jersey residents in 1997, the
most recent figure available from the state Department of Health
and Senior Services.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Shilkret, manager of the department's tuberculosis program,
said the biggest decreases in TB cases have been in New Jersey
cities that have nurses and outreach workers visit patients each
day at their home or workplace and literally watch them take their
medication. Those programs, operating at Reichman's model center in
Newark and in local clinics in Jersey City, Elizabeth and Passaic,
also serve patients from surrounding communities, Shilkret said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, he said, county health departments operate similar
programs but normally perform Directly Observed Therapy (DOT) only
for the first two weeks, then check on patients periodically. About
$8.5 million in state and federal funds covers the cost of the four
medications patients must take, salary for health workers and
administrative and other costs.
</P>
<P>
   The DOT program serves about 75 percent of New Jersey's
tuberculosis patients.
</P>
<P>
   It's crucial because without it some patients stop taking
medication when they begin to feel better and go on to develop a
drug-resistant strain, which then requires treatment for 18-24
months with stronger antibiotics, said Dr. Bonita Mangura, director
of clinical studies at the Newark TB center. Those can cause side
effects from diarrhea to deafness and psychotic behavior, she said.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage patients to complete their entire treatment, she
said, the center periodically gives them incentives such as
nutritional supplements and provides bus tickets to patients who
don't want health workers coming to their home or office.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been rewarding because we're seeing the numbers come
down,'' Mangura said. ''That means reducing transmission across the
board.''

<HEADLINE> Long-Term Bond Yields Dip Further  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Prices of 30-year Treasury bonds moved higher
and the yield dipped further below 6 percent Thursday as investors
moved money out of agency bonds into the safety of Treasurys.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the long-term Treasury bond rose 25/32 point, or
$7.81\ per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the
opposite direction, fell to 5.91 percent from 5.96 percent late
Tuesday. The yield, which dropped below 6 percent for the first
time in six months on Tuesday, is now at the lowest level since the
5.90 percent of Aug 26, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst of the flight into Treasurys was congressional
testimony Wednesday by Treasury Under Secretary for Domestic
Finance Gary Gensler, which dashed hopes among some investors that
agency bonds will replace Treasurys as safe-haven investments.
</P>
<P>
   Gensler recommended that Congress eliminate a never-used line of
credit at the Treasury that so so-called ''government-sponsored
enterprises'' such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Home
Loan Bank System may tap on an emergency basis.
</P>
<P>
   Treasurys later reduced their advances and the shorter-term
notes ended lower due to concerns that the Federal Reserve would
need to raise interest rates again in May. The Fed raised rates on
Wednesday by a quarter point, the fifth hike since June.
</P>
<P>
   In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities
were down 1/32 point to 1/16 point, and intermediate maturities
rose by 1/16 point to \ point, reported Bridge Telerate, a
financial information service.
</P>
<P>
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.87 percent as the
discount fell 0.04 percentage point from Wednesday to 5.70 percent.
Six-month yields were 6.12 percent, as the discount rose 0.01
percentage point to 5.85 percent. One-year yields were 6.20 percent
as the discount rose 0.01 percentage point to 5.85 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the
discount is the interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between
banks, rose to 6.06\ percent from 6 percent on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds rose 9/32 point to 95 5/16. The average
yield to maturity fell to 5.98 percent from 6.00 percent.

<HEADLINE> Resolution Would Reunite Families  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE RIZZO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers announced a resolution Thursday that
seeks to help parents who have been cut off from their children
because foreign courts fail to recognize U.S. custody orders.
</P>
<P>
   ''Children belong with their natural parents and they belong in
the country of their citizenship,'' Rep. Nick Lampson, D-Texas,
said in announcing introduction of the resolution asking America's
allies to abide by a treaty that was supposed to resolve
international custody disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Lampson pledged to use any opportunity to ''embarrass them, if
necessary, point the finger, call the names of Germany and Sweden,
anyone else that is not living by the agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., said the U.S. government needs to
put more pressure on countries that fail to adhere to the treaty,
called the Hague Convention on Civil Aspects of International Child
Abduction.
</P>
<P>
   ''The State Department has been utterly impotent in their
ability to get these contracting parties to live up to their
obigations,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Chabot, R-Ohio and lead sponsor of the resolution,
warned against comparing the cases his measure seeks to address and
the Elian Gonzalez case.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cuba is not a signatory of the Hague Convention,'' he said.
''Germany, Austria and Sweden are supposed to be our allies. In
this particular instance they are not acting like civilized
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Sylvester of Cincinnati said he won every court action in
the United States and Austria, where his daughter Carina was taken
by her mother in 1995. But Austrian courts later said the child
should remain in her familiar environment.
</P>
<P>
   ''The child was not returned because the order was not enforced;
now the order would not be enforced because the child was not
returned,'' Sylvester said. ''For me, the Hague Convention failed
miserably.''
</P>
<P>
   Chabot said Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has promised
to meet with Sylvester, which would send ''a strong signal to all
of those governments who consistently stonewall our efforts to
bring our children home.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Department says there are about 1,100 cases involving
American children taken overseas by a parent. The agency does not
intervene in foreign judicial proceedings but helps American
parents make contacts in the countries where their children have
been taken, and helps parents file applications.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Weiss, director of the Austrian Press and Information
Service, said Sylvester's was a single case that was litigated up
to the Austrian Surpeme Court and ''settled in the favor of the
child.''
</P>
<P>
   ''From that one case to say that Austria does not apply the
Hague Convention is totally false,'' he said. ''To draw from one
case and say there is a pattern of noncompliance is simply not the
case.''

<HEADLINE> McCain Targets College Gambling  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain, a longtime supporter of
legalized gambling, is taking on Nevada's powerful gambling
industry in one of his first battles since returning to Congress
from the presidential campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   Securing a lead role in the effort by colleges to ban betting on
amateur sporting events, the Arizona Republican scheduled a hearing
on the issue next Wednesday before the Senate Commerce Committee he
chairs.
</P>
<P>
   McCain introduced his own legislation this week out of fears
that another bill he is cosponsoring will never see the light of
day if left to the Senate Judiciary Committee, according to an
aide. He copied the language of that measure, added a provision for
more research on the use of performance-enhancing drugs and
introduced the package as a new bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''Betting on college and amateur sports corrupts the integrity
of competition and places our young athletes at the mercy of
bookies and bettors,'' the senator said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuver puts McCain in the forefront of efforts by the
National Collegiate Athletic Association and other groups to outlaw
betting on amateur sports, a form of gambling now legal only in
Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   But it also puts him at odds with colleagues from both parties
who say Nevada's sports-betting industry should not be blamed for
point-shaving scandals and illegal betting on college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would outlaw betting on Olympic, college or high
school athletic events. Though there is little legal betting on the
Olympics and none on high school sports, Nevada's gambling industry
does accept bets on college sporting events that do not involve a
Nevada school.
</P>
<P>
   A ban on college sports betting was first proposed Feb. 1 by
Sens. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., and Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. McCain signed
on as a cosponsor. That bill was assigned to the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the committee said Thursday that hearings are
planned, though not yet scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ''It became very apparent to Senator McCain that the
(Brownback-Leahy) bill was going to receive, at best, very bad
treatment in the Judiciary Committee and likely would die in the
Judiciary Committee with no action at all,'' said David Crane, who
works for McCain on the Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Brownback, who sits on the Commerce Committee, said he supports
McCain's move.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., who lobbies for casinos as president of
the American Gaming Association, said his group will try to
convince the Commerce Committee that ''the real problem is illegal
wagering on college campuses, not legal betting in Nevada.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, McCain has been viewed as friendly to gambling
interests. He has defended Indian tribal casinos and, according to
Fahrenkopf, has been a frequent spectator at professional boxing
matches in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas casino executives Steve Wynn and J. Terrance Lanni
each gave $1,000 to McCain's unsuccessful campaign for the GOP
presidential nomination.

<HEADLINE> Gore To Visit Mich. School  </HEADLINE>
By SANDRA SOBIERAJ, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- When Claudia and Donald Amboyer got the shocking
phone call that Al Gore wanted to sleep over, they insisted he take
their bedroom. But Gore wanted no special treatment.
</P>
<P>
   So the vice president of the United States was slumbering
Thursday night among their son's toy airplanes -- and studying up on
America's westward expansion from an eighth-grade history textbook.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the latest phase of his presidential campaign --
''getting as close to the grass roots as one can get as a
presidential candidate,'' as one top aide described it -- Gore
bunked with the Amboyers at their Macomb, Mich., home outside of
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, Gore was getting up early to go to work with
Mrs. Amboyer, a sixth-grade language arts teacher at the L'Anse
Creuse Middle School North, where he was due to chat up teachers
and janitors alike, have lunch in the cafeteria and help teach
Diane Pesha's history class.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to show him a normal school day,'' said principal
John Davia. The school twice has been designated as a Michigan Blue
Ribbon school for excellence.
</P>
<P>
   Davia said he was glad the vice president wanted to visit.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't look at mixed motives or any other thing,'' he said.
''Even if he were just here for an hour, it's something they'll
probably remember for their whole lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ''School Days'' is what the Gore camp has dubbed his latest
means of reaching out to voters in novel, attention-getting ways as
he battles Republican George W. Bush for the title of Education
Candidate.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore told Democratic contributors this week, in order to
improve schools, ''We need to listen to the people where the rubber
meets the road -- the teachers and the principals and the parents
and give them the help by making it a national priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides called ahead to L'Anse Creuse this week and asked for
copies of Pesha's lesson plans and the textbook pages about the
Western frontier that her students were currently studying. He
planned to huddle with her for 15 minutes before braving the
chalkboard. (It was at a classroom chalkboard, after all, that Dan
Quayle infamously instructed a young spelling student to put an
''e'' at the end of potato.)
</P>
<P>
   The Amboyers, both Democrats, got the call about their VIP
houseguest with less than 24 hours' notice. Davia said he chose the
couple because they were ''empty nesters'' whose grown children
left spare bedrooms behind. Gore's Secret Service detail and
military aide also would be nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Amboyer, a retired sheriff and administrator at Macomb
Community College, expected that Gore, arriving late after
collecting $700,000 at two nighttime fund raisers, would want to
talk to Mrs. Amboyer about education policy and hopefully watch the
Syracuse-Michigan State game.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're big Michigan State fans,'' Mr. Amboyer said.
</P>
<P>
   His wife was too busy Thursday afternoon to come to the phone,
Mr. Amboyer said, but not terribly stressed with vacuuming and
dusting, though.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're neat people so the house is pretty clean. We're really
not sure what to expect, we're just so honored,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It just so happens that Mr. Amboyer is one of those voters Gore
has hotly pursued in recent weeks: A ''crossover'' Democrat who
voted in Michigan's Republican primary for John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Amboyer said he has since decided he's all for Gore. ''It
seems to me he has a message for everyone -- not just the elite.''

<HEADLINE> Colombia Cops Arrest Murder Suspect  </HEADLINE>
By VIVIAN SEQUERA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Colombian police Thursday arrested a man
they identified as the guerrilla commander responsible for the
kidnap-slayings of three Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect was captured in Saravena, the northeastern city near
where the three Americans were abducted in February 1999 and put to
death by leftist rebels, police spokesman Carlos Perdomo told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   He was identified as Nelson Vargas. Police first gave Gildardo
Gonzalez as his name, later changing it without providing an
immediate explanation.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, police said Vargas was being taken to Bogota
along with a man arrested with him, Leonardo Rodriguez of
Argentina. It wasn't immediately clear if Rodriguez was a suspect
in the killings.
</P>
<P>
   Activists Terence Freitas, 24, of Los Angeles, Ingrid
Washinawatok, 41, of Wisconsin, and Lahe'ena'e Gay, 39, of Hawaii,
were kidnapped and later killed while visiting a Colombian Indian
tribe based near the border with Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Their bound and bullet-ridden bodies were found in a cow pasture
March 4, 1999, just inside the Venezuelan border.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC,
admitted days later that one of its units carried out the killings,
prompting the U.S. government to cut its contacts with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels asked for forgiveness and blamed the act on a
''rogue'' local squad leader it identified as Commander Gildardo.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. and Colombian officials suspected a low-ranking rebel
may have been taking the fall for a more senior commander.
</P>
<P>
   Colombian prosecutors last year issued arrest orders against
German Briceno, the regional FARC chieftain and brother of the
powerful guerrilla movement's second-ranking commander, Jorge
Briceno.
</P>
<P>
   In severing contacts with the rebels, the U.S. government said
relations could only resume if the rebels turn over its guilty
fighters to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The FARC said it would never do so, and instead pledged to
conduct a ''revolutionary trial'' and mete out justice internally.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has been involved in the criminal probe, but the U.S.
Embassy had no comment on Thursday's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   In apologizing for the slayings, a senior rebel leader said the
Americans might have been mistaken for CIA operatives or undercover
drug agents in the country that has become a major U.S. military
aid recipient.
</P>
<P>
   The three activists were in Colombia working with the embattled
U'wa, an 8,000-member tribe which has campaigned internationally to
keep U.S.-based Occidental Petroleum Corp. from drilling on
territory the tribe considers part of its sacred ancestral lands.
</P>
<P>
   Washinawatok's Native American tribal leader in Wisconsin said
he was heartened by news of the capture, but wants Gonzalez to
stand trial in a U.S. court for the murders.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll tell you what would really make me happy, if I hear the
Colombian government say they are going to extradite this guy,''
Chief Apesanahkwat told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ''If that's going to happen then I think the families may see
some justice.''
</P>
<P>
   But Colombian President Andres Pastrana, who is engaged in peace
talks with the 15,000-member FARC, has said he would refuse to
extradite any rebels captured in connection with the killings.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say there are no extradition requests pending,
even though more than 30 Colombians are wanted by U.S. authorities
for drug trafficking.

<HEADLINE> Mexicans Doubt Resolution of Murder  </HEADLINE>
By KEN GUGGENHEIM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- On the sixth anniversary of Mexico's most
notorious political assassination in recent history, most Mexicans
are skeptical about government efforts to resolve the case,
according to two opinion polls published Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Only one person -- convicted gunman Mario Aburto -- is in custody
in the March 23, 1994, killing of Luis Donaldo Colosio,
presidential candidate for the long-governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party.
</P>
<P>
   Colosio, who would have been almost assured of winning the
presidency, was killed at a campaign rally in the border city of
Tijuana. It was the biggest political killing in Mexico since
president-elect Alvaro Obregon was killed in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   The motive for the killing remains unclear. A special prosecutor
in the attorney general's office continues to investigate whether
Colosio had been the victim of a conspiracy, possibly involving
drug traffickers or political enemies.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of the investigation remains large. The prosecutor's
office has an annual budget of $520,000 and a staff of 100, the
newspaper Reforma reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the two opinion polls show many Mexicans critical of the
government's efforts. A Reforma poll found 68 percent of those
surveyed said the government has had little or no success in
investigating the case and only 16 percent said it had at least
some success. The poll of 1,510 Mexicans had a margin of error of
2.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   A smaller survey, by the newspaper Universal, found that only 19
percent believe there's a real interest in solving the case, while
81 percent think authorities want the case forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Universal said 90.7 percent of those surveyed believed Colosio
was the victim of a conspiracy. That survey, of 508 people, had a
margin of error of 5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Colosio's campaign was struggling in the months before the
assassination, but in death he has become almost a legendary
figure, with even opposition politicians praising him as a
political reformer dedicated to helping the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The front-runner in the 2000 presidential race, governing party
candidate Francisco Labatida, frequently cites Colosio in his
speeches. Labastida laid a wreath Thursday at a Colosio statue in
Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   The main opposition candidate, Vicente Fox of the center-right
National Action Party, on Wednesday announced he had won the
backing of a tiny party named after the candidate, the Closest
Revolutionary Party. Fox also criticized government efforts to
resolve the case.

<HEADLINE> Senate passes bill reimbursing hospitals, doctors, for HMOfailures  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- The state Senate on Thursday easily passed
legislation partially reimbursing hospitals and doctors who were
owed $150 million after two managed care companies went bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which has already passed the Assembly, would make
whole the providers who cared for patients insured by the
now-defunct HIP Healthcare of New Jersey and the American Preferred
Provider Plan.
</P>
<P>
   The state would use $50 million in tobacco settlement funds, and
surviving HMOs would also put up $50 million, under the bill. The
doctors and hospitals have agreed to forgive the last $50 million
of the sum owed them.
</P>
<P>
   The state owes it to the providers to make sure they are paid
for the care they provided in the weeks after HIP went bankrupt
last spring, bill supporters said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this happens again, how would hospitals feel if we said we
didn't care about their debt?'' asked Sen. Jack Sinagra,
R-Middlesex.
</P>
<P>
   But the lone bill opponent said it should be up to the parent
companies of the failed HMOs to pay the providers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Taxpayers should not be forced to bail out profit-hungry,
corporate con artists,'' said Sen. Shirley Turner, D-Mercer.
</P>
<P>
   Even a bill supporter chided the governor's oversight of HIP's
demise. State regulators approved a deal in July 1997 to have HIP
turn over most of its assets to a for-profit company, PHP
Healthcare Corp. Within eight months of the transaction, though,
PHP stopped paying health care providers, leaving HIP heavily in
debt.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the state Department of Insurance was on the job, we
wouldn't be here today,'' said Senate Democratic Leader Richard J.
Codey, D-Essex.
</P>
<P>
   The managed care industry lobbied furiously against the bill,
launching an advertising campaign against it and threatening to sue
if it becomes law. HMOs say the measure is unconstitutional because
it forbids them from passing the costs onto ratepayers.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Langevin of the New Jersey Association of Health Plans said
after the 34-1 Senate vote that his group is interviewing lawyers
to take the state to court.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to have to seek a different venue to get some
fairness,'' he said. ''Our message is not resonating in the
Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the head of the New Jersey Hospital Association
said hospitals are pleased that lawmakers agreed with their cause.
</P>
<P>
   ''This sets the groundwork to make sure the patients' needs are
being met,'' said Gary Carter.
</P>
<P>
   The bill now goes to Gov. Christie Whitman.

<HEADLINE> LAPD Scandal Convictions Overturned  </HEADLINE>
By BART JONES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A judge threw out six more criminal
convictions Thursday as part of an ongoing probe into the city's
police corruption scandal, bringing the total to 46.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Larry P. Fidler dismissed the six cases at
the request of the district attorney's office, which said the
convictions were obtained after officers falsified evidence,
committed perjury and employed other illegal practices.
</P>
<P>
   After Fidler announced the ruling, one of the six defendants,
Charles Edward Harris, broke into a grin. ''The whole thing was a
setup,'' Harris said outside court.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal -- one of the worst in the department's history --
erupted in the Rampart area near downtown last year when former
officer Rafael Perez turned informant after he was caught stealing
eight pounds of cocaine from a police evidence room.
</P>
<P>
   Since then he has given investigators a litany of wrongdoing in
the Rampart station's anti-gang unit, saying fellow officers
repeatedly falsified evidence, framed innocent people and lied
under oath to win convictions.
</P>
<P>
   At least 29 officers have been relieved of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Perez helped make the arrests in all six cases overturned
Thursday. Harris, 42, a construction worker from South Central Los
Angeles, said Perez planted drugs and guns in his car after pulling
him over in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Harris pleaded guilty and served a year and a half in prison for
possession of cocaine base for sale. He was released last October.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities now say officers attributed statements to Harris
that he did not make and illegally searched his vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The other five overturned cases involved two men and three
juveniles convicted of drug and weapons charges. Both men served
two years in prison, while the juveniles served time in youth
rehabilitation camps.

<HEADLINE> AM-NJ--Megan's Law, 1st Ld-Writethru,680  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Acting on orders from a federal court
judge, the attorney general on Thursday issued new statewide
guidelines on how information about a sex offender is to be
disseminated to select residents of a neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations require anyone who receives notice that a
sex offender lives near their home or school to sign papers
promising to keep the information secret. The court order requiring
changes in the law came after the federal judge said the state's
practice of community notification violated sex offender's limited
privacy rights.
</P>
<P>
   Megan's Law categorizes convicted sex offenders in three levels,
based on the perceived danger that the ex-convict presents. For
those offenders deemed most dangerous, the law allows prosecutors
to provide an offender's name, address and photo to residents
living in a carefully defined area.
</P>
<P>
   Courts have held that the community at-large is not privy to
those details.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, in order to get that information, people
must sign a statement that says the material is confidential and
that they ''will submit to the jurisdiction of the court.''
</P>
<P>
   If they don't sign, they don't get all the details, said Roger
Shatzkin, a spokesman for Attorney General John J. Farmer. One item
left out is the sex offender's street address, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on a class-action lawsuit brought by the state Public
Defender's Office, U.S. District Judge Joseph Irenas in December
said the state failed to implement consistent standards on how
notifications are conducted in all 21 counties.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit cited 45 instances in which rules on privacy and
limitations on spreading information were violated. These cases
include a newspaper that published the information and a school
principal who received a sex-offender warning at home and brought
it to work and photocopied it for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Irenas threatened to ban all future community notifications if
the state did not correct the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''The revised guidelines continue to protect the public's safety
at the same time they address the privacy concerns raised by the
district court,'' Farmer said in a statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will continue to work with county prosecutors and local law
enforcement agencies to ensure that Megan's Law is implemented in a
way that safeguards our most vulnerable populations,'' his
statement read.
</P>
<P>
   All county prosecutors in the state now have the revised
guidelines, Shatzkin said, and notifications will be done in the
same manner, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Different counties had different forms of notification,''
Shatzkin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Public Defender's Office is reviewing the new guidelines
''and waiting to see what the decision will be,'' said Ed Barocas,
an assistant deputy public defender.
</P>
<P>
   One problem, Barocas said, was that the state still gives out
privileged information, even if a person refused to sign the
waiver.
</P>
<P>
   Recipients are told the name and block number of the street
where an offender lives, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly that breaks the veil of privacy,'' Barocas said.
''Even if it is a huge street, 423 Main St., they will tell you it
is the 400 block of Main Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Megan's Law took effect in 1995, authorities in the 21
counties have registered 6,513 sex offenders and have issued
community notifications for 1,042 of them. Of these, 110 of the
offenders were classified as high risk, triggering door-to-door
notification of neighbors and residents likely to encounter the
offender. The rest were more limited notifications to schools, day
care centers and other facilities with custody of children.
</P>
<P>
   Megan's Law is named for Megan Kanka, a 7-year-old Hamilton
Township girl who was raped and murdered in July 1994 by a
convicted sex offender who lived across the street from her Mercer
County home.

<HEADLINE> Daily News appoints new top editors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Daily News has named Edward Kosner
as editor in chief and Michael Goodwin as senior executive editor,
chairman and co-publisher Mortimer B. Zuckerman announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Kosner, who was the editor of the News' Sunday edition, replaces
Debby Krenek, who had been editor in chief since 1997. Zuckerman's
announcement said Krenek recently informed him she wished to pursue
other opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin has been editorial page editor since 1995. No
replacement was announced for that position.
</P>
<P>
   Zuckerman credited Kosner with revitalizing the Sunday edition
over the past year and added: ''I know he will bring the same
energy, creativity, focus and integrity to every day's edition of
the paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Kosner, 62, began his career on the New York Post and worked 16
years for Newsweek magazine, serving as editor from 1975 to 1979.
He also was editor of New York magazine for 13 years and editor in
chief of Esquire magazine for four years. He joined the Daily News
as Sunday editor in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Daily News has always been a part of my life in New York.
It's an honor and a thrill to be asked to edit the paper I have
been reading as long as I can remember,'' Kosner said.
</P>
<P>
   Zuckerman praised the job that Krenek did as editor, noting she
oversaw investigative projects that exposed the city's most sued
doctors and revealed the depth of the problem of asthma in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Krenek started at the News as a deputy managing editor in 1987
and served as managing editor and executive editor before being
named to the top post.
</P>
<P>
   The News won numerous awards during her tenure, including a
Pulitzer Prize to Mike McAlary for disclosing the Abner Louima
police brutality case.
</P>
<P>
   The early 90s were turbulent years at the paper, which struggled
to publish during a bitter strike that ended when it was sold in
1991 by the Tribune Co. of Chicago to English press lord Robert
Maxwell. Later that year he committed suicide at sea as his
financial holdings collapsed in scandal.
</P>
<P>
   This put the News into bankruptcy proceedings before Zuckerman,
a real estate magnate, purchased it early in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Krenek issued a statement saying it had been an honor to edit
the News. ''I leave with some sadness and regret but pride in our
accomplishments over the last couple of years. We got the subway
fare lowered, by God, and that's what this paper is all about,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The paper crusaded for discounts that became part of the
Metrocard system for subway fares.
</P>
<P>
   Goodwin, 50, who had been city hall bureau chief for The New
York Times, joined the News in 1993 as deputy editor of the
editorial page. As editor he oversaw a series of editorials on
reviving the famed Apollo Theater that won the 1999 Pulitzer Prize.
</P>
<P>
   The Pulitzer board praised the News' ''effective campaign to
rescue Harlem's Apollo Theater from financial mismanagement.''

<HEADLINE> Catchers Like Expos Starters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JUPITER, Fla. (AP) -- Catchers Lenny Webster and Charlie O'Brien
have seen a lot of good arms in their careers, and they both share
the same enthusiasm about the Montreal Expos' starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal pitchers Dustin Hermanson, Javier Vazquez, Hideki
Irabu, Carl Pavano and Jeremy Powell are a combined 10-1 in spring
training, with a 2.00 ERA (17 ER in 72 2-3 innings) in 17 starts.
</P>
<P>
   With Expos manager Felipe Alou's preference of carrying three
catchers, O'Brien and Webster, both non-roster invitees, are likely
to make the team as backups for starter Chris Widger. Both have
been impressed with the staff's teamwork and desire to learn.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I see is they're feeding off of one another,'' Webster
said. ''If one guy goes out and does well, the other guys say: 'I
want to go out and have a good start too.' I think that's the
reason why they've pitched so well this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Webster, a 35-year-old who is trying to win a spot in his third
go-around with Montreal, has handled such standouts as Curt
Schilling, Mike Mussina and Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien's list of battery mates is even more impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ''Success builds confidence,'' says O'Brien, 38, who has caught
Cy Young winners Greg Maddux, John Smoltz, Tom Glavine, Pat Hentgen
and Roger Clemens in his 12-year career. ''When you have both of
them together it plays a big hand in how you handle the tough
times.''
</P>
<P>
   With the 30-year-old Irabu the only pitcher in the group over
27, O'Brien realizes how important it is for members of a young
staff to react constructively to a tough outing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think to be successful in this game you've got to handle the
down times and learn how to bounce back from them,'' O'Brien says.
''Forget them and come back the next time out and put together a
quality start when you go out there.''
</P>
<P>
   That certainly hasn't been a problem for Montreal this spring as
Powell notched the Expos' sixth straight win Thursday over
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only time I've been back there that we've had bad days,
our pitchers have just missed their spots,'' Webster said. ''As
long as they're down and around the zone, they've been great.''
</P>
<P>
   And they've been willing to accept the advice the two veteran
catchers have to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we get now -- and I'm sure Charlie would say the same
thing -- is you see a lot of hungry kids on the mound, and they want
to do everything right,'' Webster said. ''They see a veteran back
there and they know that they just have to throw the ball where we
want them to throw it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hermanson, 27, who fell to 9-14 with a 4.20 ERA last season
after posting a team-high 14 wins in 1998, has impressed O'Brien
with his bulldog-type attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hermanson is a great competitor,'' O'Brien said. ''He's got
the makeup to be a very consistent pitcher in this game if he
learns to control his emotions. He's got to learn to channel them
in the right direction because his emotions can help him, but they
can hurt in certain situations.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien is also high on Vazquez, 23, who pitched a one-hitter at
Los Angeles last Sept. 14.
</P>
<P>
   ''Javier has got probably as good stuff as anybody in the
National League,'' O'Brien said. ''It's one of those things where I
don't think he understands how good he can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Webster caught Pavano's last outing, five shutout innings
against Los Angeles on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was the first time I've had a chance to catch him and
he's sharp,'' Webster said. ''A 24-year-old hitting spots -- that's
painting. It's very rare you see a young kid with that kind of
ability.''

<P>
   MONROEVILLE, Pa. (AP) -- Two people were shot to death Thursday
and a woman was wounded inside a home that caught fire, authorities
said. The wounded woman rushed bleeding into a neighboring
business.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe it to have been sparked by a domestic violence
situation,'' said George Polnar, police chief in Monroeville, 15
miles east of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe a man may have killed his girlfriend and wounded
a woman, then set the house on fire and killed himself, Polnar
said, but he couldn't yet confirm that scenario.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who had been shot ran into The Money Tree, a mortgage
company next door to the house, and asked employees to call 911.
</P>
<P>
   ''She said, 'This guy shot me,''' said Diana Kugliari, a
mortgage consultant. ''She said he said, 'I'll let you live.'''
</P>
<P>
   Another Money Tree employee, Tony Nicolazzo, said the woman,
with blood on her face and hands, ''told us that the boyfriend of
the girl who lived next door was in the house and shot the girl.''
</P>
<P>
   ''She apparently got out of the house through a window and came
over here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The victim, Jennifer Filar, 23, was treated for gunshot wounds
to her neck, face and hands and was awake and alert in a Pittsburgh
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The house sat alongside a four-lane road in a middle-class
neighborhood of homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Police and emergency workers were called to the address in
February, when one person there was hospitalized for a psychiatric
evaluation, said Doug Cole, assistant Monroeville police chief. He
declined to say whether that person was killed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The dead were identified as Anne Lazzara, 25, and Nigel Francis,
33.

<HEADLINE> China Spy Case Lawyers Subpoenaed  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate Judiciary Committee, over the
objections of its Democrats and the Justice Department, on Thursday
voted to subpoena two federal attorneys to discuss the light
sentence given a scientist suspected of spying for China.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., demanded the subpoenas of Justice
Department Criminal Division line attorney Michael Liebman and
former attorney Jonathan Shapiro, saying ''we have been
extraordinarily, exhaustively patient'' with the department but
''we've had precious little cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 10-6, along party lines. Specter plans to hold a
hearing next Wednesday on the case of Taiwanese-American scientist
Peter Lee, who reached a plea bargain with the Justice Department
and escaped prison time despite reports that he had passed advanced
radar technology secrets to China.
</P>
<P>
   Specter said he wanted to find out why a plea bargain was struck
before a full damage assessment of the alleged espionage was
completed.
</P>
<P>
   But Assistant Attorney General James Robinson, in a letter to
Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, Thursday, argued
that the department had discussed the case extensively with the
Senate and that subpoenaing two line attorneys who did not make
final prosecution decisions in the Lee case would have a ''chilling
effect'' on prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said Liebman is currently in New Mexico helping with
the prosecution of Wen Ho Lee, the Los Alamos scientist also under
suspicion of passing secrets to the Chinese, and forcing him to
return to Washington to testify could disrupt that investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, ranking Democrat on the
committee, said the department had supplied Specter with
''voluminous information'' on the Peter Lee case and going to the
extraordinary step of subpoenaing career prosecutors was
unwarranted. ''The argument could be made that it's nothing more
than grandstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said he too was worried about the precedent of issuing
subpoenas but was supporting the action because ''I think Arlen's
been jerked around enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee in late 1997 pleaded guilty to filing a false statement
about a 1997 trip to China and to revealing classified laser data
during a 1985 trip. He was sentenced to a year in a halfway house
with three years' probation and a $20,000 fine. The New York Times
last year reported that Lee, while working on a classified Pentagon
project, had given the Chinese technology to detect and track
submarines.

<HEADLINE> Colleagues Laud New House Chaplain  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE ZIEGLER DIZON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The first Roman Catholic appointed U.S. House
chaplain is a master at diplomacy and a stellar representative of
the church, his colleagues say.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Daniel P. Coughlin, 65, was sworn in Thursday as
chaplain, ending a four-month dispute over who would take over as
the minister to House members and their families. Some Democrats
suggested evangelical Republicans had stonewalled the appointment
of a priest as chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin, a 40-year veteran of the Chicago archdiocese, called
his appointment ''terribly unexpected.'' He was most recently the
archdiocese's vicar for priests -- a representative of the church
who intervenes when a priest is having difficulties and gives
spiritual and professional guidance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Father Coughlin has served the diocese well in parishes and in
specialized ministries. He is one of our most deeply respected
priests,'' said Cardinal Francis George, the archdiocesan leader.
''I pray that Father Coughlin -- and the pastoral gifts he brings --
will be well received by those who serve our nation in the House of
Representatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin started in the ministry in 1960 as associate pastor of
St. Raymond Parish in Chicago. In 1969, he was named director of
the archdiocese's Office for Divine Worship, a position he held for
15 years.
</P>
<P>
   He took a one-year sabbatical in 1984-1985 to study East-West
religions, serve with missionaries in India and teach at North
American College in Vatican City. He returned to the Chicago area
as a pastor and ran a retreat house for the church before his
appointment as vicar for priests.
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin grew up on the city's Northwest Side, and his mother --
at 85 -- is an usher at Wrigley Field, home of the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Edwin Conway, who went to the seminary with Coughlin and
has worked with him for 40 years, called the priest ''a smart,
sharp man with a great sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He holds to his principles, but he's very sensitive to others'
needs,'' Conway said.
</P>
<P>
   Coughlin's colleagues were pleased to hear of his new post.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a fine speaker and he's a diplomat, so I think he'll fill
that role quite well,'' said the Rev. Henry Kricek, a priest at St.
Peter's Catholic Church in Skokie, a suburb north of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. John McNalis of St. Gabriel Catholic Church in Chicago
called Coughlin an excellent choice to represent the church on a
national level.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'll do a very good job,'' McNalis said. ''He's articulate,
and since they've never had a priest, I think what he says when he
delivers a prayer ... he's not going to embarrass the church. He's
not going to be fumbling over words.''
</P>
<P>
   McNalis questioned the political motives behind the choice --
Catholics make up more than 25 percent of the electorate -- but said
he was gratified to finally see a Catholic priest as chaplain.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it's to get the political vote, as least they made a good
choice,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Muslim officers get to grow beards for now  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- A federal court judge has signed an order
temporarily blocking the state Department of Corrections from
establishing a new policy that bans prison guards from growing
beards.
</P>
<P>
   District Court Judge Faith Hochberg signed the order on
Wednesday to prohibit the state, the Department of Corrections and
Commissioner Jack Terhune from dismissing or disciplining prison
guards who refuse to shave pending a hearing on April 4.
</P>
<P>
   The order came after 33 Sunni Muslim officers filed a civil
rights suit claiming the policy infringes on their religious
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ''Despite the fact the U.S. Supreme Court last year let stand
two federal court rulings that struck down a similar ban on beards
among Newark police, the state has imposed its own policy, which
threatens my clients with disciplinary action and dismissal if they
do not shave,'' Robert Cannan, the officers' lawyer, told The
Star-Ledger of Newark for Thursday's editions.
</P>
<P>
   Although 33 senior officers and sergeants filed the action,
Cannan said more officers stand to be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who filed the action have more than 20 years of
service and all claim to be devout followers of Islam, which
mandates the wearing of beards.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent letter filed to his superiors at South Woods State
Prison in Bridgeton, Officer Samuel Shelton Webster called the
policy an illegal intrusion on his right to freedom of religion.
</P>
<P>
   ''The implication here is that you must prove to the DOC that
you remain steadfast in your faith,'' Webster wrote. ''Monitoring
our religious life from year to year on the job is harassment.''
</P>
<P>
   Six months after taking office in March 1998, Terhune rescinded
a longtime policy that permitted prison officers to grow beards.
Enforcement of the policy didn't go into effect until March 1, when
a revamped grooming and uniform policy was enacted.
</P>
<P>
   The officers' action draws upon the Newark police case, in which
federal courts ruled the city had no ''compelling governmental
interest'' in banning beards for religious reasons. The department
had allowed medical exemptions for beards for officers with skin
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The police department's lawyers had argued that the no-beard
policy was intended to present a professional and dignified image
to the public, and to establish discipline and solidarity within
the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the U.S. Supreme Court sided with the lower courts
against the Newark Police Department policy. Unlike the Newark
police policy, provisions for both medical and religious exemptions
are included in the new corrections grooming standards.
</P>
<P>
   However, the exemptions are not automatic or long-standing. The
policy requires Muslim officers to enter annually in an application
process that offers no guarantees of approvals and no appeals
process for denials, according to Cannan.
</P>
<P>
   The policy requires officers to provide the department's Office
of Employee Relations with a certificate from a religious leader,
which ''states that the maintenance of a beard or some type of
facial hair is a necessary component of your faith.''
</P>
<P>
   The policy also gives an officer up to a 60-day grace period
during the application process or whenever the application is
decided upon.
</P>
<P>
   ''But the application can be rejected in less than 60 days, and
the officer is then faced with having to immediately shave his
beard or face disciplinary proceedings,'' Cannan said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Department of Corrections defended their
policy.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter dated Feb. 21 to several officers, Terhune and Mary
Cupo-Cruz of the department's Equal Employment Opportunity Division
dismissed interoffice claims of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ''The grooming policy applies to all custody staff. It is not
directed solely to Muslims or to black employees,'' they wrote.
''Those with medical exemptions must refile each six months. Those
who qualify for religious exemptions must file annually. The fact
is that medical conditions change and persons may also change their
religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Carden, a spokesman for the Department of Corrections,
would not comment on the order.
</P>
<P>
   ''The department and its legal counsel at the attorney general's
office is reviewing the complaints and we are prepared to go
forward with our case,'' Carden said.

<HEADLINE> N.J. Issues New Megan's Law Rules  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Acting on orders from a federal judge, the
state attorney general Thursday issued new guidelines to make sure
information about sex offenders isn't disseminated as widely under
the so-called Megan's Law.
</P>
<P>
   The new regulations require anyone notified that a sex offender
lives near their home or school to sign papers saying they will not
disseminate the information. The judge who ordered changes in the
law said sex offenders' privacy rights were being violated under
the old system.
</P>
<P>
   Megan's Law is named for Megan Kanka, a 7-year-old New Jersey
girl who was raped and murdered in 1994 by a convicted sex offender
who lived across the street from her home. Every other state has
some type of sexual offender law modeled after Megan's Law, but
many have come under fire.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to reinstate
Pennsylvania's sexual-predator law, which was thrown out by that
state's highest court on the ground that it violated defendants'
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Megan's Law categorizes convicted sex offenders in three levels,
based on the perceived danger they present. For those offenders
deemed most dangerous, the law allows prosecutors to disclose an
offender's name, age and address, as well as his job and its
location.
</P>
<P>
   But the law says only people approved by a judge can see that
information. Under the new rules, in order to get that information,
people must sign a statement that says the material is confidential
and that they ''will submit to the jurisdiction of the court.''
</P>
<P>
   If they don't sign, they don't get all the details, said Roger
Shatzkin, a spokesman for Attorney General John J. Farmer, Jr. One
item left out is the sex offender's address, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on a class-action lawsuit brought by the state Public
Defender's Office, U.S. District Judge Joseph Irenas in December
said New Jersey failed to implement consistent standards on how
notifications are conducted in all 21 counties.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit cited 45 instances in which rules on privacy were
violated. These cases include a newspaper that published the
information and a school principal who received a sex-offender
warning at home and brought it to work and photocopied it for
everyone.

<HEADLINE> Republican drops out of Senate race to seek House seat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Unable to gain traction in the Republican race
for Senate, former state lawmaker Brian T. Kennedy said Thursday he
will run instead for House by challenging Rep. Frank Pallone in the
6th congressional district.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, an attorney who lives and works in Sea Girt, said
Monmouth County GOP leaders encouraged him to challenge Pallone,
D-Long Branch, who is in his sixth term. The 6th district includes
parts of Monmouth and Middlesex counties.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many in his party, Kennedy favors more federal
involvement in public schools. He has said schools should be
required to teach ''character development'' to address ''the lack
of values and the problems of drug abuse and teenage pregnancies
and suicides in our schools.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he supports federal projects that protect New
Jersey's beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy represented Monmouth County in the state Senate from
1978 to 1983. Pallone, then a member of the Long Branch City
Council, defeated him in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy then ran unsuccessfully for House in 1984 and 1986
against Democrat James Howard. Pallone won the seat in 1988 after
Howard's death.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy declared last fall that he would seek the Republican
nomination to succeed retiring Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   He said he started too late to mount a successful challenge to
four other Republicans in the race -- Rep. Bob Franks, R-Berkeley
Heights; state Sen. William Gormley of Atlantic County; college
professor Murray Sabrin; and Essex County Executive James
Treffinger.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Michael Ferguson, who ran against Pallone in 1998,
had planned a second run this year but chose instead to move to the
neighboring 7th district to seek the seat being vacated by Franks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kennedy has some company in the 6th district.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Cerrato, an Edison stamp dealer, said he is seeking the
GOP nomination. So is Charles Hutchins of Piscataway, a corporate
attorney. A third Republican, Paul DiLorenzo, appeared before a
screening committee in Middlesex County, according to the state
party.
</P>
<P>
   The primary is June 6.

<HEADLINE> Judge Turns Porn Star Into Dancer  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A judge did a makeover on an X-rated movie
star's professional life Thursday, ruling that a jury in an insider
trading case will learn only that she is a dancer, model and
actress whose stage name was ''Marylin Star.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood rejected attempts by prosecutors
to expose more about Kathryn Gannon, a fugitive in a case whose
primary defendant is James McDermott Jr., a former Wall Street
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Wood made various rulings during a pre-trial hearing Thursday
about what evidence can be shown to the jury at a trial scheduled
to start April 10 in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Her rulings appeared to weaken the government's case against
McDermott, the former chief executive officer at Keefe, Bruyette &AMP;
Woods, and a co-defendant, Anthony P. Pomponio.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had said it was crucial to their case to tell jurors
about Gannon's profession. Assistant U.S. Attorney James J.
Benjamin Jr. also said it was ''absolutely essential'' to tell how
the insider trading caused the cancellation of an initial public
offering by McDermott's company.
</P>
<P>
   Wood said she thought evidence about the public offering would
be confusing for the jury and time consuming but left the door open
to change her mind.
</P>
<P>
   She was unyielding to prosecutors, though, on the issue of what
could be said about Gannon's career, making it unlikely that the
jury will ever learn that Pomponio said in a statement that he
believed Gannon was a prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for McDermott had successfully argued to the judge that
Gannon's career was largely irrelevant to whether she conspired
with McDermott and Pomponio to cheat in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had wanted at least to refer to Gannon as an
''exotic'' dancer and as an ''adult'' film actress. But Wood ruled
that neither of the words would be used in front of the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say McDermott told Gannon about obscure regional
banks that were involved in mergers and acquisitions prior to
public announcements, allowing the trio to gain $170,000 in illegal
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said in court papers and a letter to the judge that
Gannon's profession was crucial to their case because her job
''raises the strong inference that McDermott paid her for sex'' and
that Gannon's intimate sexual relationship with McDermott was the
principal motive for his crime.
</P>
<P>
   Wood said the nature of Gannon's profession was irrelevant
because it was possible for prosecutors to show there was a sexual
affair between Gannon and McDermott without revealing her
occupation.
</P>
<P>
   The judge had said at an earlier hearing that she worried that
some jurors might hear Gannon's profession and think the defendants
were ''sleazy.''
</P>
<P>
   McDermott, 48, of Briarcliff Manor is charged along with
Pomponio, 45, of North Caldwell, N.J., and Gannon, 30, of Miami,
Fla., with conspiracy and securities fraud.
</P>
<P>
   McDermott and Pomponio, who have both pleaded innocent, remain
free on bail. Prosecutors are seeking the extradition of Gannon
from her Canadian home.

<HEADLINE> NEA Seeks $150M From Congress  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Chairman Bill Ivey asked Congress on Thursday
for $150 million to support the National Endowment for the Arts in
the year beginning Oct. 1, a $52 million increase over this year's
appropriation.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's budget has dropped 59 percent since 1992, he said.
Members of Congress have attacked the NEA for supporting projects
they called obscene and blasphemous, but bipartisan support for the
agency frustrated an attempt by the Republican leadership to
abolish it.
</P>
<P>
   Ivey said $49 million of the proposed increase would go to a
program called Challenge America, which Congress refused to fund
for the current year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It engages the arts to offer young people creative, positive
learning opportunities during the most vulnerable times of their
day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He explained a study had shown that violent juvenile crime
triples in after-school hours when many teen-agers have often have
little constructive to do and no adult supervision.
</P>
<P>
   Ivey reported that last year NEA projects reached more than 5
million children, supported about 7,500 concerts and performances
and 200 fairs and festivals, helped more than 1,000 artist
residencies, backed creation of more than 400 works of art,
benefitted nearly 4,000 locations beyond actual recipients and
conserved over 3,000 works of art, artifacts and collections.
</P>
<P>
   He was testifying before a subcommittee on the Interior
Department and related agencies of the House Appropriations
Committee.

   MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- A firefighter accused of killing his wife,
setting their house ablaze and opening fire on police and fellow
firefighters sat silently Thursday during his first court
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Williams, 41, was brought into court in a wheelchair
for his arraignment on charges of murder, attempted murder and
arson. He was shot in the groin and the leg during the gun battle
March 8.
</P>
<P>
   Williams did not make any comments, and was not asked to enter a
plea.
</P>
<P>
   He is charged with killing his wife, Stacey, 32, Shelby County
sheriff's Deputy Rupert Peete, 45, and firefighters Javier Lerma,
41, and William Blakemore, 48. Mrs. Williams was found dead inside
the house.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Joyce Broffitt set April 6 for Williams' next court
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives have told authorities that Williams was suffering from
emotional problems prior to the shootout. Authorities said he had
called in sick for work the day of the shootings.

Alberta Promises To Protect Medicare
</P>
<P>
   CALGARY (AP) -- Alberta has pledged to protect the principles of
medicare within its new private health bill, Prime Minister Jean
Chretien said Thursday after meeting the Alberta premier.
</P>
<P>
   ''(Ralph Klein) said to me very clearly to me that he wants to
respect the five conditions of medicare,'' Chretien said.
</P>
<P>
   Chretien refused to comment specifically on Alberta's Bill 11,
which will allow for-profit clinics to do minor surgeries and keep
patients for overnight stays, until after it has passed.
</P>
<P>
   Tension between the two leaders seemed evident. Klein
interrupted Chretien several times as the two took questions from
reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Klein said he found Chretien more conciliatory during Thursday's
meeting than federal Health Minister Allan Rock, who has suggested
the Alberta Tories should scrap the bill.

Murderer McGray Says He Killed More
</P>
<P>
   HALIFAX, Nova Scotia (AP) -- Michael Wayne McGray claimed
responsibility for 16 slayings Thursday, some as far away as
Seattle, and said the urge to kill remains in him like a hunger.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm getting very, very strong urges again,'' McGray said
during a phone interview with The Canadian Press from his

<P>
   ''From the moment I wake up, every time I'm around people, all I
want to do is lash out. I need to hurt somebody in order to satisfy
me. It's like (a) high for me.''
</P>
<P>
   McGray, a 34-year-old drifter, received a life sentence Monday
with no chance of parole for 25 years after pleading guilty to
slitting the throat of Joan Hicks in Moncton, New Brunswick
</P>
<P>
   McGray said he is responsible for at least 16 killings in cities
across Canada and the United States.

Defence Rests in Case of Teen Accused of Murder
</P>
<P>
   VANCOUVER (AP) -- A teenaged boy in jail for killing Reena Virk
told a fellow inmate Kelly Ellard would be blamed for the crime and
everyone else would go free, a witness testified Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old woman, who met Warren Glowatski in a youth
detention center, was among the last of 31 witnesses called at
second-degree murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   The jury didn't hear from Glowatski, who is serving a life
sentence with no chance of parole for seven years for his role in
Virk's death.
</P>
<P>
   The defence concluded its case Thursday. The jury will hear
final arguments Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ellard, 17, is the last of eight teens charged in Virk's death.
</P>
<P>
   She turned 15 shortly before Virk's death, but has been raised
to adult court due to the seriousness of the crime. The trial has
been moved to Vancouver from Victoria because of pre-trial
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Virk was 14 when she was swarmed by a group of teens under a
bridge on a suburban Victoria waterway called the Gorge on Nov. 14,
1997. Police found her battered, half-naked body eight days later.

Judge Grants Bail To Egyptian Accused of Terrorism
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- A judge granted bail Thursday to an Egyptian
refugee suspected of being part of an alleged plot to bomb Israeli
government buildings in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Bernard Grenier said the Crown did not sufficiently prove
that Tarek Adealy Khafagy needs to be kept behind bars to protect
the public.
</P>
<P>
   Khafagy, 30, was charged March 4 with three explosives-related
charges after police found explosives hidden in his bathroom
ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and co-workers have agreed to post $5,000 bail for
Khafagy's release. He will return to court April 25 for a
preliminary hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Grenier also ordered Khafagy to obey a curfew when he's not at
work, report to RCMP twice a week and remain in Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   A third suspect, Kim St-Louis, of Hull, Quebec, faces two
explosives charges.

<HEADLINE> Black Caucus Seeks Aid for Africa  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL SHEPARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional Black Caucus members called on
U.S. lawmakers to forgive the debt of flood-ravaged countries in
southern Africa and help the nations rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are witnessing a tragedy of catastrophic proportions,''
said Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., at a news conference Thursday that
also drew ambassadors from several African nations.
</P>
<P>
   Caucus Chairman James Clyburn, D-S.C., said the widespread
flooding -- which has hit Zimbabwe, Swaziland, Madagascar and South
Africa -- threatens progress made by the hardest-hit country,
Mozambique, to end internal warring and feed its people.
</P>
<P>
   Clyburn said last year was the first year the impoverished
country didn't request international food aid.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want to see the gains washed away with the flood
waters,'' Clyburn said.
</P>
<P>
   This week alone, low-lying southern Mozambican towns are at risk
of being flooded for the second time in less than a month as heavy
rains upstream in South Africa drove up water levels in local
rivers.
</P>
<P>
   More than a month of floods, the worst on record in the
southeast African nation, have displaced more than 1 million people
nationwide, according to the caucus.
</P>
<P>
   In Madagascar, flooding has killed more than 1,500 people and a
cholera outbreak brought on by the deluge has infected more than
25,000 others.
</P>
<P>
   The confirmed death toll of 492 is expected to rise.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have been among the 1,400 aid workers, 1,000 soldiers
and 53 aircraft from eight separate armies to descend on the
southeast African nation this month.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., however, recalled that the
international response to another African tragedy, the 1994
genocide in Rwanda, was ''inexcusably slow.'' She said she plans to
introduce legislation to forgive the debts and provide
reconstruction aid for eight southern African countries damaged by
flooding.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said last week the U.S.
Agency for International Development already has provided $7
million in emergency food aid and $5.7 million in disaster
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   She said the Treasury Department is moving to forgive the $4.9
million debt owed by Mozambique to the U.S. government, and
assistance is going to Zimbabwe, Botswana and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has already forgiven nearly all the debt owed
by Mozambique. But legislation is necessary to coordinate that debt
relief with other nations and to bestow U.S. approval for
international lending agencies like the International Monetary Fund
to engage in debt relief.
</P>
<P>
   Mozambique owes $87 million to creditors this year, of which
approximately $58 million is owed to countries and $30 million to
international institutions.
</P>
<P>
   On March 9, the House passed a resolution expressing support for
humanitarian assistance.

<HEADLINE> Cos. Want To Reduce Cow Flatulence  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- It sounds like a joke, but an agreement
signed Thursday to reduce cow flatulence -- a source of one of the
greenhouse gases that cause global warming -- is no laughing matter,
a Canadian electric company insists.
</P>
<P>
   TransAlta, Canada's largest private power provider, reached the
multimillion-dollar agreement with Global Livestock Group, a U.S.
company, to produce a feed supplement for cattle in Uganda that
would reduce their belching and flatulence.
</P>
<P>
   Sprayed on the cattle's hay and feed, the supplement would ease
the animals' digestion to minimize expulsions of methane gas and
produce more and better meat and milk, according to TransAlta.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, the decrease in methane gas expelled would be
equivalent to 30 million tons of carbon dioxide, company spokesman
Tim Richter said.
</P>
<P>
   ''People tend to snicker at the obvious joke, but when they look
at the size of the emissions we're talking about here, they say,
'Wow, that's a lot,''' Richter said from Vancouver, where the
announcement was made at an international environmental business
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, trap
heat in the atmosphere and are believed to contribute to global
warming. They are largely produced from burning oil, coal and gas.
</P>
<P>
   TransAlta's agreement is part of a strategy intended to help it
conform to requirements of the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, an
international treaty for industrialized nations to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
   TransAlta says it wants to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions
to a net equivalent of zero by 2024. Though the company's plants
will still produce gases, those emissions could be offset by
credits for eliminating gases elsewhere through the Uganda deal and
other planned projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups question the validity of the strategy.
</P>
<P>
   John Wellner of Pollution Probe said TransAlta generates much of
its power by burning coal, which releases toxins that contribute to
smog and acid rain.
</P>
<P>
   If programs like the Uganda agreement eventually allow them to
increase business and operations in Ontario and Alberta, ''the
other pollutants that go along with that production are going to
increase,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Oil Smugglers Said Sought $3.15M  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Three businessmen who were arrested in a sting
operation, including a ranking member of Thailand's top opposition
party, plotted to earn about $3.15 million by illegally buying
Iraqi oil and selling it in Asia, U.S. officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Each has been charged with conspiring to violate U.N. sanctions
with a scheme to buy more than $20 million in Iraqi oil.
</P>
<P>
   They came to San Diego this week to make final arrangements to
purchase the oil, said John Mallamo, a U.S. Customs agent in San
Diego. They expected to meet an executive of an international
trading firm, but the executive really was a Customs agent.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities on Tuesday arrested Amnard Vorachard, 58, of
Thailand; Surasak Nanaukool, 56, a member of Thailand's opposition
New Aspiration Party; and Simon Tan, 44, of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   The oil smuggling investigation began four years ago when
Vorachard, who represents Thailand-based Action Dynamic Enterprises
Group, was under surveillance for another matter that has been
closed.
</P>
<P>
   The men, who made an appearance in federal court Wednesday but
did not enter pleas, were being held without bond. A detention
hearing was scheduled for Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq can sell oil only under U.N. financial controls, with the
proceeds used for financing humanitarian programs and Gulf War
reparations. The sanctions, imposed after the invasion of Kuwait in
1990, cannot be lifted until the U.N. Security Council certifies
Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   A court-appointed lawyer representing Tan said the undercover
agent lured the three men to California under false pretenses.
''All three of them thought they were involved with a legitimate
representative of the U.S. government,'' said defense lawyer Mark
Chambers. ''They would not have come here had it not been for the
agent's misrepresentation of what he could do.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Shares Rise in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar slipped against the yen early Friday as
investors adjusted their dollar positions ahead of the weekend.
Tokyo's benchmark stock index rose moderately.
</P>
<P>
   The dollar bought 107.28 yen, down 0.10 yen from late Thursday
in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 107.32.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 27.31
points, or 0.14 percent, to 19,731.91 points in the first 30
minutes of trading. On Thursday, the average closed down 28.99
points, or 0.15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In currency dealings, traders said the dollar edged lower
against the yen as investors squared their dollar positions ahead
of the weekend in the absence of major market-moving news.
</P>
<P>
   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 104.05 yen, up from
103.32 yen late Thursday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   On the stock market, prices were mixed in early trading as many
institutional investors avoided making significant moves before the
fiscal year-end book closing.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's new fiscal year begins on April 1.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 253.16 points
to 11,119.86 at Thursday's close.
</P>
<P>
   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 4.00 points, or 0.24 percent, to 1,647.55
points. The TOPIX closed down 6.77 points, or 0.41 percent, the day
before.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond was
unquoted in early trading. On Thursday, it settled at 1.8450
percent and its price stood at 100.47.

<HEADLINE> School Driver Accused of Molesting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDERSON, Ind. (AP) -- A school bus driver has been charged with
repeatedly molesting a 9-year-old passenger.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Lee Holding appeared before a judge Thursday to face
seven child molestation charges, punishable by 20 to 50 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested Wednesday and remained in jail in lieu of
$100,000 bond. Holding was fired after the girl told school
officials about the alleged abuse two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Holding, 46, of Muncie, is accused of molesting the girl during
a seven-week period that began early this year.
</P>
<P>
   The girl was the first stop on Holding's morning route,
authorities said. After picking her up, Holding allegedly pulled
the bus to the side of a road, walked back to her seat, sat beside
her and molested her, according to court documents. Holding then
would drive on to his next stops, picking up the rest of his
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Holding has denied molesting the girl, court documents say.
</P>
<P>
   A background check done by Madison Bus Co., which employed
Holding, showed he had no criminal history, said Larry Arms, the
school district's transportation director.

<HEADLINE> Corzine, Florio appear together but speak separately  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Jim Florio came out swinging Thursday but
his opponent, Jon Corzine, had already left the ring.
</P>
<P>
   The former governor and former Wall Street banker are facing off
in the Democratic primary for U.S. Senate, and they appeared
together at Thomas Edison State College for a political forum set
up by the nonpartisan Partnership for New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The forum kept the two candidates apart. Florio said he wanted a
direct, side-by-side debate, something he has been hammering at
since last summer, while Corzine said the opportunity to speak to
the audience separately without rebuttals suited him just fine.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine took the first turn at the podium with some 100 business
officials who were enrolled in a leadership conference. He
patiently explained details of his positions on Social Security,
health insurance coverage, a larger role for the federal government
in public education, and pharmaceutical benefits for elderly
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those in the audience, Martin Hirsch of Montclair and
Mary Wachter of Trenton, were complimentary. ''I was very impressed
with his presentation. I thought his thoughts and ideas were
good,'' Hirsch said.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine did not mention Florio at all until afterward when
reporters asked him about the former governor's criticism of him.
</P>
<P>
   When Florio took his turn with the audience, he skirted the
issues and keyed on his experience, his credibility, and spent a
lot of time criticizing his wealthy opponent's inexperience and
reluctance to defend his proposals man-to-man.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would have been a much better program if the two of us
could have sat up here, given our views of things, and then had the
opportunity for you to ask questions, and to have give-and-take
between the two of us, my ability to respond, his ability to
respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Florio said Corzine in his unchallenged speeches was tapping
into issues everyone knows are popular.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you get to this point, you can memorize 15 minutes on
anything,'' Florio said. ''Part of the dilemma of not having (a
debate) between candidates is there is no opportunity to hear or
ask those penetrating, tough questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Florio said New Jersey needs a tested, forceful senator to
protect Northeast urban states from the conservative Republicans
running Congress and distorting federal funding.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who do you want to send down there to stand up for you and
your children and the values that you all have? Amateur or
professional, knowledgeable or not knowledgeable, forceful or not
forceful. That is the set of choices that people have. I am not
going to need any on-the-job training.''
</P>
<P>
   Florio attacked Corzine for what many expect will be high
spending, claiming Corzine rejected an agreement capping spending
at $9 million for the whole campaign. ''If you can't sell a message
for $9 million, maybe there is something wrong with the message,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking privately with reporters, Corzine said he was tiring of
Florio's constant attacks, saying no one wants that kind of a
campaign. ''I am presenting myself to the voters, and I presenting
myself on the issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every one of the ads (by Florio) that I read says Jon Corzine
favors Social Security privatization, and that is nonsense,'' he
said, adding his plan was the same as President Clinton's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine said he would debate the former governor later in the
primary campaign but that he did not see urgency.
</P>
<P>
   ''He says I am unwilling to debate when I have been on the same
forum with him... a whole series of times,'' Corzine said. ''There
will be time for debates, and we will make sure they happen.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the viewers, Hirsch said, ''I suppose I was impressed
with the forcefulness, the depth of views, the experience that Gov.
Florio conveyed today.''
</P>
<P>
   Wachter said, ''I don't think (Corzine) was as deep on the
issues as Florio was. Obviously, he lacks the experience.''
</P>
<P>
   But she added that Corzine ''definitely has a genuineness about
him that is appealing.''

<HEADLINE> AM-NY--Got Steer?, 1st Ld-Writethru,470  </HEADLINE>
By VICKI SMITH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHEELING, W.Va. (AP) -- Airing the tape-recorded execution of a
900-pound steer on a nationally syndicated radio show may have done
more to help animal rights causes than sign-waving protesters ever
could have, an activist said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Friedrich, vegetarian campaign coordinator for the
Virginia-based People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, said
New York talk show host Mike Gallagher should have gone one step
further with his broadcast, showing video of Old Blue's death on
television.
</P>
<P>
   And Gallagher should have watched instead of turning away as
meat-packer Bill Bledsoe fired a .22-caliber Magnum bullet into the
steer's furry white head, Friedrich said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I only wish you'd had the integrity to watch,'' he said by
telephone during Gallagher's live broadcast from the Capitol Music
Hall. ''It might have made an impression on you.''
</P>
<P>
   The steer was killed on Gallagher's orders in a concrete and
cinderblock room at a remote Marshall County slaughterhouse
Wednesday evening. The stunt, devised as a way to protest PETA's
recent anti-milk campaign, was intended to ''give them a taste of
their own medicine,'' the conservative Gallagher said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, PETA withdrew its ''Got Beer?'' campaign after
Mothers Against Drunk Driving and conservatives like Gallagher
charged the anti-milk promotion encouraged underage drinking.
</P>
<P>
   The irreverent campaign was intended to be a humorous way to
discourage the consumption of beef and milk, both of which PETA
argues are unhealthy and foster animal cruelty.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher didn't watch Old Blue's execution but he remained
unrepentant about it Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mankind has dominion over animals,'' he said. ''This is sort
of the circle of life. ... I'm not cruel. I'm not a sadist or
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   He did have second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   When the time came for Old Blue to enter the killing room, the
steer balked. It took five men and a long yellow rope to drag him
into his cubicle.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm seriously thinking maybe we shouldn't do this. ... I
really can't bail out now, can I? Would people be mad if I backed
out?'' Gallagher asked his producer. ''Maybe we can give him a
reprieve.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Old Blue went out with a bang and a shudder.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Dave Hall got a check for $850, charities and shelters in
the Northern Panhandle will get some 500 pounds of meat, and
Gallagher got the satisfaction of pulling a stunt against the
activists he likes to call ''kooks.''
</P>
<P>
   Protesters picketed Gallagher's New York studio as he left the
city Wednesday, threatening to chain themselves to the front door
as he took a freight elevator to the basement with his gun-toting
bodyguard.
</P>
<P>
   But none showed up when he arrived at the airport or the music
hall, despite Gallagher's claim that he has had two dozen death
threats in the past week.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Vows Taxes on Oil Nations  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT LINDLAW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Taking a hard line on a pocketbook issue,
Reform Party presidential candidate Pat Buchanan promised Thursday
to slap new tariffs on oil-producing nations that systematically
withhold their product to ''gouge the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   With gas prices rising dramatically since last summer and
expected to cost $2 per gallon by summer, Buchanan charged a global
conspiracy'' by these countries to inflate prices.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference here, he pledged to cut financial aid,
including World Bank and International Monetary Fund loans, to any
country he deemed part of a plot to ''withhold oil and gouge the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's rivals for the White House -- Republican George W.
Bush and Democrat Al Gore -- also have weighed in on the issue, and
with different approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Bush said he was considering calling for the
suspension of a 4.3 cents-per-gallon increase in the federal gas
tax to combat the rising prices. Gore disagrees with that proposal
and said the solution is ''tough negotiating'' with the
organization of oil-producing countries.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan is in California for a swing of public appearances and
fund-raisers, although he said he did not know how much money he
would raise.
</P>
<P>
   ''All we need is enough to keep me and (wife) Shelly on the road
until our convention, and then thanks to the generosity of the
American taxpayer we're going to get $12.5 million, which will be
enough to run our bus across the country,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The UEFA Cup semifinals will have some fresh faces after
Turkey's Galatasaray, France's Lens, and English teams Leeds and
Arsenal reached the final four Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Galatasaray, motivated by a bill in parliament that would pay
the club $5 million for reaching the semifinals -- and $9 million
for winning the cup -- beat Mallorca 2-1 and advanced 6-2 in the
home-and-home, total-goals series. It's unclear when the bill will
be debated.
</P>
<P>
   Galatasaray became the first Turkish team to reach a European
cup semifinal since it did so in the 1989 Champions Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Leeds, which won the UEFA Cup in 1968 and 1971, lost 2-1 at
Slavia Prague but advanced on a 4-2 aggregate.
</P>
<P>
   Arsenal defeated Werder Bremen 4-2 on three goals by Ray Parlour
to advance 6-2. The Gunners, who won the UEFA Cup in 1970, are
hoping to win Europe's No. 2 club competition after being
eliminated from the first phase of the Champions Cup.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Mavs' Nelson Back in Front Office  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MARSHALL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Don Nelson's job as general manager and coach of
the Dallas Mavericks had been in question since Internet mogul Mark
Cuban purchased controlling interest of the club in January.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson got the answer he had hoped for Wednesday when Cuban, an
owner-in-waiting until the league approves the sale, said he wants
Nelson back next season.
</P>
<P>
   While making his first public statement regarding Nelson's
return, Cuban created another question. Will Nelson coach the
Mavericks again?
</P>
<P>
   Cuban said he would like to keep Nelson in the front office; he
has three years left on his $1.65 million contract. However, he
also might try to persuade the 22-year veteran to coach another
season. Nelson has contended this season would be his last on the
bench, but said Thursday he would at least be receptive to what
Cuban had to say.
</P>
<P>
   ''From a personal standpoint, I don't think that would be what
is best for the team, but if, for whatever reason, he wants me to
come back, I'm sure going to talk to him,'' said Nelson, who turns
60 in May. ''I want whatever is best for the Mavericks.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban promised changes when the sale of the team was announced
and Nelson, who has won 35 percent of his games in three-plus
seasons, was thought to be on is way out. But the more Cuban worked
with Nelson, including their agreement to bring Dennis Rodman to
Dallas, it became apparent Nelson would stick around.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't known for a long time, but the bottom line was how
well Nellie and I communicate,'' Cuban said. ''The most important
part is that Nellie puts winning ahead of everything else. He puts
winning ahead of ego, which is not usual in this business.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban said bringing Nelson back as the coach was not a priority,
but he would like Nelson as part of what he calls a ''brain
trust.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Cuban has hired Brad Davis, Garfield Heard and
Del Harris as assistant coaches, creating a football-style staff
atypical to the NBA. Cuban said he envisions Nelson as the
experience part of the brain trust.
</P>
<P>
   ''The idea is to try to get more brains into the group,'' Cuban
said. ''The players in the league are much younger, in general, and
I think it's important to have a balance in terms of how you relate
to players. Nellie obviously gives us the experience factor, so
we're looking to balance that side, potentially.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said he got the feeling Cuban wanted him back, but was
not sure until he actually heard the words.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never asked because I didn't think it was my place to, but I
was happy to read it in the paper,'' Nelson said. ''If he thought
it was best for the team to get rid of me, then I would have
accepted it. I'm really happy he wants me back. I want to be
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Mavericks find a new coach or bring back Nelson, it
will be with input from the players. Cuban said he plans to poll
the players after the season before deciding. Nelson says its a
good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think Mark will be asking the players for specific
names of coaches, but more along the line of what qualities they
want in a coach,'' Nelson said.

<HEADLINE> AP Awarded for No Gun Ri Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Associated Press on Thursday won the 1999
SAIS-Novartis International Journalism award for its efforts to
uncover the truth about Korean civilians killed by American troops
at the start of the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   The story of No Gun Ri, where U.S. soldiers gunned down hundreds
of helpless South Korean civilians, had never been reported. The
award is shared by AP Special Correspondent Charles J. Hanley,
reporters Martha Mendoza and Sang-hun Choe, and researcher Randy
Herschaft.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their work has had a major impact,'' said Paul Wolfowitz, dean
of the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies of
The Johns Hopkins University. ''The AP reports have also added new
fuel to the debate over the nature of modern warfare and war
crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   The AP journalists and researcher will be honored on April 26 in
Washington, D.C. In addition to the award, the winners will also
receive a $15,000 prize.
</P>
<P>
   The first runner-ups in the international news competition are
Nate Thayer and Nic Dunlop of Far Eastern Economic Review for their
work tracking down the chief executioner of the Khmer Rouge regime.
The journalists found him living a new life as a born-again
Christian aid worker in Cambodia and obtained a detailed confession
of his crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Marla A. Ressa, Jakarta bureau chief for CNN International,
placed third in the competition for her eyewitness video reports on
the conflicts in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The award program is funded by a grant from the Swiss health
care corporation Novartis.

<HEADLINE> Ramseys Make Promotional Push  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- After their fifth straight appearance on the
''Today'' show Friday, John and Patsy Ramsey's television tour
takes them next to an unprecedented two nights in front of Larry
King's microphone on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   JonBenet Ramsey's parents -- suspected of being involved in her
murder by some who follow the case -- are getting an extraordinary
amount of attention with their decision to break their public
silence and promote their new book about the case.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the ratings, it has proved compelling to many viewers
and discomfiting to others.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have a really hard time with it,'' said Karen Krieze, a
Montclair, Calif., woman whose daughter was murdered five years
ago. ''I started to look at one interview, but I decided I didn't
want to watch the rest of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys' interview with Barbara Walters on ABC's ''20/20''
March 17 earned the newsmagazine its highest ratings of the season.
''Today'' drew an extra 400,000 viewers beyond its season average
Monday for Katie Couric's chat with the Ramseys.
</P>
<P>
   That boost is consistent with the story's history. The
sensational case has been a staple of television newsmagazines
since 6-year-old JonBenet's body was found in the Ramseys' Boulder,
Colo., home on Dec. 26, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second most-covered newsmagazine story in 1997,
topped only by Princess Diana's death, and the third most popular
story in 1999, according to NewsTV Corp., which monitors news
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is getting harder and harder to have a story that could be
claimed appointment television,'' said Russ Ptacek, president of
NewsTV. ''JonBenet Ramsey is a proven appointment-setting segment
where viewers are going to change their schedules for a new
development. And the Ramseys talking is a new development.''
</P>
<P>
   Giving the Ramseys five days to talk is unusual but not
unprecedented, said Jeff Zucker, ''Today'' executive producer. The
show also had a four-part interview with Regis Philbin this week.
''Today'' devoted about as much airtime to the Ramseys as
''20/20,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the core, it's a dramatic story,'' Zucker said. ''Everyone
sees something different in this story and everyone reads their
answers differently. And that's drama.''
</P>
<P>
   In their interviews, the Ramseys have professed their innocence
and promoted the theory that an intruder killed their daughter.
</P>
<P>
   In Boulder, Colo., on Thursday, Police Chief Mark Beckner said
his department is discussing the conditions for giving the Ramseys
a lie-detector test since they volunteered to take such a test in
the media interviews. They told ABC's Walters they were never asked
to take a lie detector test.
</P>
<P>
   Beckner has said he doubts the couple will follow through on the
offer. But on Wednesday he met with investigators to discuss the
ground rules if a test is given.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys said they had no doubt they would be able to pass a
lie detector test.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would expect it to be fair, we would expect it to be
administered independently, and we would like the results to be
released publicly,'' John Ramsey told Denver's KUSA-TV. ''And if
the Boulder police would like to come to Atlanta and do that we
would be happy to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Boulder police investigator Steve Thomas, who himself has
a book coming out on the case, says he asked the Ramseys to take a
lie detector test shortly after the body was found in their
basement.
</P>
<P>
   They are scheduled to appear Monday and Tuesday on CNN's ''Larry
King Live.'' It is the first time guests not involved in a breaking
news story have been given two straight nights on King's program, a
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   National news programs spend far more time on crime stories than
they did a decade ago, said Robert Lichter, president of the
Washington-based Center for Media and Public Affairs. The networks
figured they needed to mimic local news and tabloid shows to
survive, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Ramseys also fill a sudden news vacuum created with the
presidential nominees all but decided, Lichter said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This story is everything that's wrong about television
newsmagazines,'' Ptacek said, ''and at the same time, it's exactly
what the newsmagazines are supposed to be doing -- telling dramatic
stories about dramatic people.''
</P>
<P>
   The heated ratings competition in the morning has something to
do with ''Today'' giving the interview five days, said Steve
Friedman, executive producer of CBS's competing ''The Early Show.''
Friedman, who has read the Ramseys' book, understands the
motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't seen any news that I didn't know before,'' he said.
''But if they had come to us, I would have put them on.''
</P>
<P>
   Krieze, for one, is sick of it. She resents the attention the
Ramseys get when other murders are all but ignored. She also
wonders why the Ramseys are spending time writing a book and
talking on television.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it was my child,'' she said, ''I would not spend one minute
other than looking for the killer of that child.''

<HEADLINE> Syria Called Upon To Vacate Lebanon  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Critics of Syria's dominant role in
Lebanon called Thursday on Damascus to begin withdrawing its army
from the country, fearing a Middle East peace settlement could
strengthen Syria's position in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The calls came ahead of a Sunday meeting in Geneva between
President Clinton and Syrian President Hafez Assad that could lead
to the resumption of stalled Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   A peace accord between Syria and Israel likely would lead to a
deal between Israel and Lebanon, where Syria dominates with 30,000
troops. Critics of Syrian policy fear Damascus could end up with
even more clout in Lebanon because its troops could be used to help
the Lebanese government implement any peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In a front-page commentary, the leading Beirut daily An-Nahar
called on Syria on Thursday to begin withdrawing its troops from
Beirut and coastal parts of Lebanon in line with a peace agreement
that ended the 1975-90 civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Gebran Tueni, An-Nahar's managing director, said many Lebanese,
mainly Christians, rejected the Syrian control over their country.
</P>
<P>
   ''The demands of the Lebanese for the redeployment (of Syrian
forces) do not make them traitors or enemies. They are suppressed
citizens waiting for answers that will dispel justified fears,''
Tueni said in an open letter to Col. Bashar Assad, the influential
son of the Syrian president. Assad also is Syria's heir apparent
and the man in charge of policy on Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Syrian troops first entered Lebanon in 1976, ostensibly as
peacekeepers to put a stop to civil war. The Lebanese government,
split equally between Christians and Muslims, has supported
continued Syrian military presence and political involvement as a
stabilizing factor during the nation's recovery from the war.

<HEADLINE> Bush Security Costs Up to $3.9M  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS WILLIAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texans have spent $1.3 million so far this
year on security for Gov. George W. Bush while he campaigned for
president, according to figures released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The amount is more than four times the $286,000 that it cost to
protect Bush and his family in 1998, when he was not a candidate
for president, according to previously released numbers.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, the state has spent $3.9 million on security for
the Bushes in the 15-month period beginning in January 1999,
according to new figures from the Texas Department of Public
Safety.
</P>
<P>
   The DPS released the information in response to several
requests, said spokeswoman Tela Mange. In keeping with policy, it
did not provide a detailed breakdown of how the money was spent due
to concerns that the information would compromise Bush's security,
Mange said.
</P>
<P>
   Previously released figures show the state spent $2.65 million
on Bush's security in 1999, or about $221,000 a month. The costs
have risen to about $432,000 per month this year.
</P>
<P>
   Mange said her department expects the costs to decrease now that
the federal Secret Service is now handling security for Bush. The
DPS still protects his family, however, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We will not have the volume of expenses that we did earlier
this year,'' Mange said.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Edwards, a spokeswoman for Bush, said the state was
required by law to pay for his security, whether he is in or out of
state, until the Secret Service took over.

<HEADLINE> Swimmers To Use 'Fastskin' Bodysuit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A controversial neck-to-ankle swimsuit promising
faster times is expected to be worn for the first time in official
competition this weekend in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Speedo International, maker of the ''Fastskin'' suit, gave the
go-ahead Thursday for Australian swimmers Michael Klim and Grant
Hackett to unveil the new swimwear Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Klim will swim in Sydney and Hackett will compete in Queensland.
</P>
<P>
   Speedo spokeswoman Gina Curry said the company decided to launch
the suit Sunday ''rather than hold off closer to the Olympics''
partly because of the publicity -- and controversy -- generated over
the past 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian Olympic Committee has asked for a hearing in the
Court of Arbitration for Sports prior to Australia's Olympic trials
in May.
</P>
<P>
   The bodysuits have been sanctioned by FINA, the world governing
body of swimming. But the AOC wants a ruling to ensure swimmers who
wear the suits in the Olympics are not subject to legal challenges
from swimmers who don't have them available because of sponsorship
deals.
</P>
<P>
   Speedo has agreed to participate in the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Speedo president Joe Fields said most swimmers at the recent
world short-course championships in Athens, Greece, where 15 world
records were set, had worn bodysuits.
</P>
<P>
   Speedo unveiled its ''Fastskin'' bodysuit in Athens, saying it
reduces glide time by 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Fields said the suit complied fully with FINA rules, which
prohibit any device which aids a swimmer's speed, buoyancy or
endurance during competition.

<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Sam Cassell scored 30 points and Ray Allen
added 26 as the Milwaukee Bucks beat the Indiana Pacers 105-84 on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Bucks, who also got 21 points from Tim Thomas, held the
Pacers to 38 percent shooting in snapping a six-game road losing
streak.
</P>
<P>
   Cassell, who hit 11 of 16 field goals and all eight free throws,
scored 13 points in the first half to help the Bucks build a 62-40
lead at the break.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee handed Indiana its fourth loss in 35 games at Conseco
Field House. Jalen Rose led the Pacers with 22 points, while Reggie
Miller had 16 points as the Pacers lost for just the fourth time in
35 home games.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee hit 51 percent of its field goals, while Indiana hit
just 37.5 percent. The Bucks had a 47-36 rebounding edge.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Pacers shot 71 percent in the third quarter -- 10 of
16 from the field -- they still trailed the Bucks 85-68 entering the
fourth quarter.
Notes: Milwaukee won for just the sixth time in its last 20 games.
... Indiana center Rik Smits, who hit 50 percent from the field and
averaged 18 points during the Pacers' four-game winning streak, was
just 1-of-5 Thursday, scoring two points. ... Ray Allen, the only
Bucks' player to start all 68 games this season, has scored double
figures in 71 straight games. ... As a starter in the Pacers' last
six games, forward Austin Croshere has led his team in rebounding,
averaging 11.2 per game. ... Tim Thomas is averaging 18 points in
his last 11 games.

<HEADLINE> Panthers 3, Bruins 1  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD ULMAN, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Mark Parrish and Cam Stewart scored 2:51 apart in
the third period as the Florida Panthers overcame a sluggish start
and beat the Boston Bruins 3-1 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The game was scoreless through two periods and Boston held NHL
goal-scoring leader Pavel Bure, who led the NHL with 321 shots,
without a shot until five minutes remained in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Then Boston's Cameron Mann and Parrish traded goals in the first
six minutes of the third, and Stewart got the game-winner at 8:48
of the period. Bure added an empty-netter, his 52nd goal, with 1:02
to play.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Vernon solidified his probable role as Florida's playoff
goalie over Trevor Kidd by stopping 32 shots. Boston began the
night five points out of the Eastern Conference's last playoff spot
and has eight games left. It had won four of its previous six.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second straight comeback win for the Panthers, who
overcame a 3-1 deficit to beat the New York Rangers 4-3 Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's ninth goal of the season was set up by Scott Mellanby,
who beat Andre Savage to the puck behind the Boston net and carried
it out to the right of goalie John Grahame. Mellanby passed across
the slot to Stewart, who tipped the puck into the open left side.
</P>
<P>
   Mann nearly tied it, but his shot hit the post with 3:52
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   He gave the Bruins a 1-0 lead at 4:12 of the third with a short
back-hander between Vernon's legs. It was Mann's third goal in his
last six games and sixth in 24 games this season.
</P>
<P>
   But less than two minutes later, Parrish tied it with his 24th
goal at 5:57. Again, the play began behind the Bruins net as Viktor
Kozlov carried the puck out and shot from the circle to the right
of Grahame. He stopped it, but Parrish swept in the rebound. In a
5-1 victory over Boston on Feb. 12, Parrish had two goals and an
assist.
</P>
<P>
   His goal Thursday ended Boston's shutout streak at 106 minutes,
26 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The first 40 minutes were a defensive stalemate as Vernon
stopped 19 shots and Grahame 16.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers played their second straight without Peter Worrell,
who suffered headaches, dizziness and nausea after being hit on the
helmet with a stick by New Jersey's Scott Niedermayer on Sunday
night. Niedermayer was suspended for 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   But Worrell, known more as an enforcer than a scorer, may have
been held out of Thursday's game because the Bruins don't play a
physical style.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Wants To Crush Thirsty Insect  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER KERR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Lawmakers have proposed spending more
than $14 million to eradicate a thirsty, half-inch-long brown
insect new to California that is threatening the state's grape
crop.
</P>
<P>
   ''California's table, raisin and wine grape industries must be
protected from the insects and bacterium that have the potential to
destroy portions of that industry,'' Gov. Gray Davis said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with representatives of California's $33 billion
wine industry, Davis announced his support of a bill that would
spend $7 million a year for two years on research to fight Pierce's
Disease.
</P>
<P>
   The disease is caused by a bacterium and is spread by a
plant-sucking insect known as a sharpshooter.
</P>
<P>
   Small versions of the bug have been around for decades, but a
larger cousin, the glassy-winged sharpshooter, has been spreading
through California since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had Pierce's Disease for a hundred years, but it's never
been this aggressive and this voracious,'' said John DeLuca,
president of the Wine Institute, which represents 91 percent of
California's wineries.
</P>
<P>
   Eight counties in southern California and part of Kern County
are infested with the insect, state officials say. It has caused $6
million damage to wine grapes in Riverside County's Temecula Valley
in two years.
</P>
<P>
   The insect also threatens dozens of other crops, including
citrus fruits, peaches, plums, avocados, almond trees and alfalfa.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Worker Charged  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A man whom the Defense Department had recently
offered a job on its police force was charged Thursday with falsely
claiming to be an officer of the U.S. government after being
arrested with weapons, ammunition and bomb-making manuals in his
car, Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The man, identified in a Defense Protective Service affidavit as
Anthony Premo of Granada Hills, Calif., was arraigned in U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit said the man, who was arrested after running a
stop sign in a Pentagon parking area on Wednesday evening, had two
rifles, two knives, an unspecified quantity of black powder, 20
rounds of .40-caliber ammunition and an empty manufacturer's box
for a 1911-model Colt .45-semi-automatic pistol.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit said Premo also had in his car survivalist
literature, freeze-dried food and manuals for manufacturing and
using bombs and booby traps, according to Navy Capt. Timothy
Taylor, a Pentagon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Another Pentagon spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, said he was not aware
that Premo had made any kinds of threats.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said Premo was on an Office of Personnel Management list
of prospective federal hires and had been offered a job as a
Pentagon policeman, to start on March 27. The job offer has been
withdrawn, Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   The affidavit said that Premo told the Pentagon officer who
stopped him Wednesday evening that he had a weapon with him, and he
showed the officer a document he claimed was a concealed handgun
permit. He also showed the officer unspecified identification from
Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Premo originally told the arresting officer that he was an
employee of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, but he
later said he had left the INS in 1994.

   WASHINGTON (AP)-- BP Amoco will halt exporting Alaska crude oil
and divert the 60,000 barrels a day to California if it gets
approval for its merger with Atlantic Richfield Co., the
British-based oil company said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The company made its intentions known in a letter to Rep. Don
Young, R-Alaska, chairman of the House Resources Committee, who
pushed legislation five years ago that allows Alaska oil to be
exported.
</P>
<P>
   The BP Amoco decision was hailed by Rep. George Miller,
D-Calif., as ''the right thing to do'' and a ''welcomed
announcement'' at a time when oil shortages are causing gasoline
prices to soar, especially on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   But BP Amoco spokesman Tom Koch emphasized that the decision to
end exports after the current export contract expires is contingent
on government approval of the BP-Amoco purchase of Atlantic
Richfield, or Arco as it is commonly called.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of this is contingent on the FTC giving us approval,''
said Koch in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission is reviewing a revised proposal
that would have Arco sell all of its Alaska petroleum holdings to
Phillips Petroleum Co., as a condition for the merger with BP
Amoco. The FTC had rejected and challenged in court an earlier
proposal because it said the combined company would dominate oil
production in Alaska's North Slope.
</P>
<P>
   It's not known when the FTC will make a decision, although it's
widely anticipated the merger now likely will go through.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter to Young, BP Amoco said once the current export
contract expires at the end of April ''we do not have subsequent
plans to export.'' The company accounts for all of Alaska's current
60,000 barrels of day that are being sent to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once our acquisition of Arco is complete, we would expect to
run all of our Alaska crude through Arco's excellent West Coast
refining and marketing network,'' wrote Larry D. Burton, BP Amoco's
vice president for U.S. governmental affairs.
</P>
<P>
   A half dozen West Coast lawmakers last week called on President
Clinton to halt Alaska oil exports, arguing the oil is needed in
California, Oregon and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Congress approved the exporting of Alaska oil in 1995 after
extensive lobbying by Alaska's lawmakers and the oil industry. The
Clinton administration supported the exports at the time.
</P>
<P>
   White House Chief of Staff John Podesta said the administration
was reviewing the idea of suspending exports. Administration
officials have said privately that it's unlikely any formal action
against exports would be taken.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco is based in London, while Atlantic Richfield has its
headquarters in Los Angeles.

   Jim Edmonds finally is leaving Anaheim, Adrian Beltre is staying
in Los Angeles, and Al Martin made a difficult return to the San
Diego Padres clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   After months of speculation, the Angels sent their two-time Gold
Glove outfielder Edmonds to the St. Louis Cardinals on Thursday for
18-game winner Kent Bottenfield and second baseman Adam Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ''When it started to become apparent that we might be able to
fill two of our needs, it was such an attractive deal that it just
made a lot of sense to us,'' Angels GM Bill Stoneman said.
</P>
<P>
   Starting pitching has been a major question mark for the Angels,
who lost ace Chuck Finley to the Cleveland Indians via free agency
during the offseason. Bottenfield gives them a proven starter.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield went 18-7 with a 3.97 ERA last season, and made the
NL All-Star team. He entered last year having won just 18
big-league games.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds hit .250 with five homers and 23 RBIs in just 55 games
last season after being sidelined until August while recovering
from surgery on his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you get an opportunity to get a guy of Edmond's stature,
you can't pass it up,'' Cardinals GM Walt Jocketty said.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre agreed to a $5.05 million, three-year contract with the
Dodgers, ending a three-month dispute and assuring he'll remain as
the team's third baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was my first choice to be here, and I appreciate that I'm
going to stay here,'' Beltre said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for the players' association to dismiss the
grievance filed against baseball seeking free agency for Beltre.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Bud Selig ruled in December that the Dodgers signed
Beltre before his 16th birthday in 1994, and fraudulently altered
documents to make the signing appear legal under baseball rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel as if a major cloud has been lifted,'' Dodgers chairman
Bob Daly said.
</P>
<P>
   At Peoria, Ariz., Martin returned to the Padres for the first
time since being jailed Monday night and went 2-for-2 as San Diego
beat Arizona 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, charged with assault in a domestic violence case,
singled to right in the first inning and hit a ground-rule double
to right-center in the third, both off Armando Reynoso, before
leaving the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was good to come out and get back to doing something that
you do naturally,'' Martin said. ''Being around the guys, they were
absolutely great.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Yankees outfielder Tim Raines, who stole 807 bases in
his 21-year career before being sidelines with Lupus, announced his
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess we all have an alarm for when it's time for your
career to end, and I felt like my alarm went off two weeks ago,''
Raines said.
</P>
<P>
   New York got some good news when Ramiro Mendoza threw five
shutout innings as the Yankees snapped a six-game losing streak
with a 2-0 win over the Boston Red Sox in Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza, bidding for the No. 5 spot in the Yankees' rotation,
gave up three hits, struck out three and hit a batter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish I get the opportunity to be the fifth starter,''
Mendoza said. ''If the teams decides to sent me back to the
bullpen, I'll do the best I can.''
</P>
<P>
   In other games:
</P>
<P>
Cardinals 16, Marlins 0
</P>
<P>
   At Jupiter, Fla., Mark McGwire homered in his third consecutive
game and Larry Sutton hit a grand slam for St. Louis. McGwire went
2-for-3, raising his spring average to .382 in 13 games. He has 16
RBIs and has four homers after a slow start.
</P>
<P>
Reds 9, Pirates 7
</P>
<P>
   At Sarasota, Fla., Ken Griffey Jr. hit his sixth spring homer,
hitting a two-run homer in the first off Pete Schourek, who got hit
hard in an important outing for the left-hander.
</P>
<P>
Expos 7, Orioles 1
</P>
<P>
   At Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Vladimir Guerrero homered twice and
drove in five runs. Rondell White also homered for the Expos, who
have won eight of nine.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Blazers' Sabonis Out Indefinitely  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Portland Trail Blazers center Arvydas
Sabonis is out indefinitely after severely spraining his right foot
against the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sabonis fell and got his right leg twisted underneath him after
he was bumped by Detroit's Christian Laettner with four minutes
left in the third quarter. The Blazers led 75-64 at the time, but
the Pistons shot 64 percent after the injury and won 104-95.
</P>
<P>
   X-rays and a CAT scan were negative for Sabonis, but he won't
travel with the Blazers for Friday night's game at Golden State.
Sabonis, 35, has been relatively durable the past two seasons,
missing only five games, but the foot may take a few games to heal.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're probably looking at starting Jermaine O'Neal, with
Rasheed (Wallace), and then going accordingly based on the teams we
play,'' Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy said after Thursday's practice.
</P>
<P>
   Portland also will consider bringing Brian Grant and 38-year-old
center Joe Kleine off the injured list Friday. Kleine, who
postponed retirement to sit the bench just for this type of
emergency, has played in just seven games. Grant has missed the
last eight games with inflammation of the fascia in his right foot
but worked out hard Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers also could use 6-foot-11 Antonio Harvey off the
bench, but he hasn't played more than one or two minutes since
early January and is recovering from arthroscopic surgery on his
right knee. Harvey was at the hospital Thursday -- with his wife,
who is scheduled to give birth soon.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage of big men comes at a bad time for the Blazers, who
dropped six games behind the Los Angeles Lakers in the Pacific
Division and have all but given up hope of catching them for
homecourt advantage throughout the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   With or without the 7-3 Sabonis, the Blazers have been
inconsistent lately. They played well in a 97-96 win at Seattle on
Saturday, but on three days' rest, they turned the ball over eight
times in the third quarter against the Pistons, who were playing on
consecutive nights.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're really disappointed with our second-half performance,''
said O'Neal, who goes against the Knicks' Patrick Ewing and Marcus
Camby on Sunday. ''It's almost like we gave up a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers have been on autopilot much of the time since a Feb.
29 home loss to the Lakers, when both teams shared the league's
best record at 45-11.
</P>
<P>
   Portland has gone just 5-5 since that defeat, and has lost four
of six at home after winning 16 straight. The Blazers blew
fourth-quarter leads to Minnesota and Detroit, and a 19-point loss
to Toronto was their worst of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to bounce back, because teams are crawling up our
backs right now,'' O'Neal said, even though the Blazers are
comfortably six games ahead of Phoenix for the No. 3 playoff spot.
''We're not concerned about really catching (the Lakers), we're
just concerned about winning games.''

<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Jay McKee and Miroslav Satan scored in the
final 2:08 to lift the Buffalo Sabres into eighth place in the
Eastern Conference with a 4-2 victory over the Calgary Flames on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Satan, who ended a 13-game goal drought, had two goals while
Geoff Sanderson also scored for the Sabres, who moved one point
ahead of the idle Montreal Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Bureau and rookie Jeff Cowan scored for the under-manned
Flames, who were missing three regulars, including second-leading
scorer Jarome Iginla, who injured his knee in Wednesday's 2-2 tie
at Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The Flames' playoff hopes grew slimmer, as they remain in 11th
place in the West, six points behind the eighth-place San Jose
Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   Maxim Afinogenov, who had with two assists, set up McKee's
go-ahead goal. Working his way around the Flames net, Afinogenov
hit McKee at the left point with a pass. Turning toward the net,
McKee blasted a shot that beat goalie Fred Brathwaite on the short
side.
</P>
<P>
   Satan sealed it, scoring on a breakaway 57 seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   After Cowan put the Flames ahead eight minutes into the third,
Sanderson tied it with 10:14 left in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Each team scored on its first shot.
</P>
<P>
   Bureau, on a 2-on-1 break, converted Valeri Bure's pass to open
the scoring 75 seconds into the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres tied it on Satan's goal less than two minutes later.
It was Satan's 30th goal of the season and 100th as a member of the
Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   The goal inspired a curious celebration from Satan, who flipped
off his glove and smashed it a few times with his stick.
</P>
<P>
   The Flames were also missing Phil Housley, their defensive
scoring leader, who was home in Minnesota after his mother died
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres welcomed back two regulars to their lineup: captain
Michael Peca, who missed seven games with a dislocated shoulder,
and Alexei Zhitnik, who missed six with a broken finger.
</P>
<P>
   Peca, among the NHL's hardest checkers, did not shy away from
physical play. In the first, he hammered Bureau behind the Sabres
net. Bureau needed help to get off the ice and did not return.
</P>
<P>
   Then, six minutes into the second, Peca briefly sent Bure to the
dressing room after being leveled with a right forearm to the chin.
</P>
<P>
   The Flames were down to 10 reserve skaters before Bure returned
to the bench about three minutes later.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Jozef Stumpel scored the tying goal late in
the third period, and had the game-winner in overtime as Los
Angeles beat Philadelphia 3-2 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Stumpel, who tipped in Craig Johnson's shot from the front of
the net to tie the game 2-2 with 2:15 left in regulation, helped
the Kings snap a four-game winless string. (0-3-1)
</P>
<P>
   His wrist shot from high in the slot trickled between the pads
of Flyers' goalie Brian Boucher at 1:20 of overtime for the
game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's Gino Odjick tapped in a rebound of Kent
Manderville's shot to give the Flyers a 2-1 lead with 9:27 left in
the third, just 57 seconds after Luc Robitaille's power-play goal
tied it for the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Jody Hull scored Philadelphia's other goal in a game
overshadowed by center Eric Lindros comments about the treatment of
his second concussion of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, which had lost its last five games in Philadelphia,
snapped the Flyers' two-game winning streak. Philadelphia was 3-1-1
in its previous five.
</P>
<P>
   Boucher, who shut out Nashville 2-0 on Tuesday, had not allowed
a goal in 141 minutes, 27 seconds before Robitaille scored to tie
Dave Andreychuk for 16th place on the NHL's career goal scoring
list with 551.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles goalie Stephane Fiset, making his first appearance
since suffering a groin injury against Nashville on March 4,
preserved the tie when he made a brilliant glove save on Mark
Recchi's shot from the crease with 33 seconds left in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Hull gave the Flyers a 1-0 lead at 13:38 of the second when he
redirected Manderville's tip of a shot from the left boards by
Odjick. The assist was Manderville's first point since being
acquired from Carolina on March 14.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Lindros blamed himself and also criticized
the Flyers organization for its handling of the circumstances
surrounding his Grade II concussion that will sideline him for the
rest of the regular season. Lindros suffered the injury against
Boston on March 4, but played in four games after that.
</P>
<P>
   The severity of Lindros's fourth concussion in two years wasn't
diagnosed until the Philadelphia captain was examined in Chicago
this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers issued an ''organizational statement'' before
Thursday's game in which they defended the ''integrity and skill''
of their training team and medical staff.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to missing Lindros, the Flyers played without rookie
Simon Gagne, who has the flu.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers also announced that coach Roger Neilson was released
from Philadelphia's Hahnemann University Hospital on Thursday.
Neilson, suffering from cancer, underwent a stem cell transplant on
Mar. 10 and is ''doing extremely well,'' according to his
physician, Dr. Isadore Brodsky.

<HEADLINE> J &AMP; J Halts Propulcid Marketing  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER, AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The maker of Propulsid, a popular heartburn
drug that has been associated with 80 deaths, will stop marketing
the medication in the United States by July but will continue to
make it available on a limited basis to certain patients, the
company and federal regulators announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Known chemically as cisapride, the drug has been prescribed for
patients who suffer severe heartburn, or gastroesophageal reflux
disease, and have not responded to other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturer Janssen Pharmaceutica of Titusville, N.J., said it
no longer would market the drug as of July 14. The company, a
subsidiary of Johnson &AMP; Johnson, acted in consultation with the
Food and Drug Administration ''that continued general U.S.
prescription access to the drug poses unacceptable risks,'' the FDA
said.
</P>
<P>
   Janssen said it will make Propulsid available on a limited basis
for certain patients who can enroll in a special program beginning
May 1. Other therapies must not be effective for these patients,
who must meet criteria being established in collaboration with the
FDA.
</P>
<P>
   The drug will continue to be distributed until July 14 and will
remain in pharmacies until mid-August, Janssen said in an announced
posted on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Patients who are now taking Propulsid are advised to speak with
their doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Propulsid, one of J&AMP;J's top selling drugs, was approved by the
FDA in 1993. But there has been a series of increasingly strong
actions to warn against serious side effects from the drug.
</P>
<P>
   As of Dec. 31, 80 deaths and 341 heart rhythm abnormalities have
been associated with Propulsid, FDA officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Janssen maintained in its announcement, ''Propulsid remains safe
and effective for the vast majority of patients when used according
to the approved prescribing information.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the FDA announced that there had been some deaths among
patients taking the drug and issued a warning that Propulsid was
linked to cardiac problems in some patients. The drug's label was
revised then to reflect this concern.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the FDA issued an even more severe warning. Patients
were urged to be tested to make sure the drug had not affected
their hearts. New labels also warned that Propulsid should not be
used by patients with disorders of the heart, kidney or lung, or by
patients who were taking some medications to treat heart problems,
allergies, depression or AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Janssen said that despite the warnings, ''some inappropriate use
has continued'' in the United States. The best solution, the
company said, was limiting access to the drug ''while ensuring that
appropriate patients who have exhausted other treatment options can
still benefit from it.''
</P>
<P>
   The FDA had ordered an advisory board meeting in April to
discuss the problems with Propulsid. That meeting has now been
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Florence Houn of the FDA said that Propulsid had a unique
action that was important to some patients. She said the pill
triggered motility, a wave like action in the gut, that moved
gastric acid away from the esophagus, thus preventing nighttime
heartburn for some patients.
</P>
<P>
   J&AMP;J said Propulsid sales were about $950 million worldwide last
year but that it expects sales this year to drop to $250 million.

<HEADLINE> 'Millionaire Gets Its Third Winner  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER, AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A lowly moth was worth a million dollars to an
aspiring screenwriter on ABC's ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Trela, a 25-year-old customer service representative for a
computer company, became the third contestant to win the big prize
on an edition of ABC's hit game show that aired Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Cal Tech graduate was fortunate to get a $1 million question
that was about computers. He was asked what insect shorted out an
early supercomputer and inspired the term, ''computer bug.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to choose between a moth, roach, fly or Japanese beetle,
he correctly identified the moth as the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was lucky, which I guess was good enough,'' he said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Trela certainly wasn't pressured into rushing his way through
the game. He took nearly 15 minutes -- although it was edited down
for broadcast -- to identify which baseball player appeared in the
most World Series games.
</P>
<P>
   ''The producers were getting kind of cranky with me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he had won $32,000, Trela had used all three of his
lifelines. That meant he had to answer the big-money questions
without help from a friend or the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Trela, from Gilroy, Calif., is the youngest person to win the
game. The show now airs in 52 countries, and there's been only one
top prize winner outside of the United States. A contestant in
South Africa won earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Trela, who is a bachelor, hopes to landscape his mother's
backyard with the money, and maybe visit a friend in England. He
won't say whether he plans to quit his job, but figures the money
will give him the freedom to finish a science fiction screenplay
he's been writing.
</P>
<P>
   Since he promised on the broadcast to pay his brother's tuition
at Notre Dame, Trela figures he better follow through.
</P>
<P>
   And Alex Trebek will love this: Trela is a ''Jeopardy'' reject.
He said he tried out for ''Jeopardy'' several times but was never
invited on the show.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jeopardy'' host Trebek recently mocked ''Millionaire'' for its
easy questions, but reportedly declined an invitation to appear in
a celebrity version of the game.

<HEADLINE> BP Amoco To Halt Alaska Oil Exports  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP)-- BP Amoco will halt exporting Alaska crude oil
and divert the 60,000 barrels a day to California if it gets
approval for its merger with Atlantic Richfield Co., the
British-based oil company said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The company made its intentions known in a letter to Rep. Don
Young, R-Alaska, chairman of the House Resources Committee, who
pushed legislation five years ago that allows Alaska oil to be
exported.
</P>
<P>
   The BP Amoco decision was hailed by Rep. George Miller,
D-Calif., as ''the right thing to do'' and a ''welcomed
announcement'' at a time when oil shortages are causing gasoline
prices to soar, especially on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   But BP Amoco spokesman Tom Koch emphasized that the decision to
end exports after the current export contract expires is contingent
on government approval of the BP-Amoco purchase of Atlantic
Richfield, or Arco as it is commonly called.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of this is contingent on the FTC giving us approval,''
said Koch in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission is reviewing a revised proposal
that would have Arco sell all of its Alaska petroleum holdings to
Phillips Petroleum Co., as a condition for the merger with BP
Amoco. The FTC had rejected and challenged in court an earlier
proposal because it said the combined company would dominate oil
production in Alaska's North Slope.
</P>
<P>
   It's not known when the FTC will make a decision, although it's
widely anticipated the merger now likely will go through.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter to Young, BP Amoco said once the current export
contract expires at the end of April ''we do not have subsequent
plans to export.'' The company accounts for all of Alaska's current
60,000 barrels of day that are being sent to Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once our acquisition of Arco is complete, we would expect to
run all of our Alaska crude through Arco's excellent West Coast
refining and marketing network,'' wrote Larry D. Burton, BP Amoco's
vice president for U.S. governmental affairs.
</P>
<P>
   A half dozen West Coast lawmakers last week called on President
Clinton to halt Alaska oil exports, arguing the oil is needed in
California, Oregon and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Congress approved the exporting of Alaska oil in 1995 after
extensive lobbying by Alaska's lawmakers and the oil industry. The
Clinton administration supported the exports at the time.
</P>
<P>
   White House Chief of Staff John Podesta said the administration
was reviewing the idea of suspending exports. Administration
officials have said privately that it's unlikely any formal action
against exports would be taken.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco is based in London, while Atlantic Richfield has its
headquarters in Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> Baby Wipe Warmers Recalled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some 152,000 faulty baby wipe warmers are
facing federal recall because they may pose an electric shock risk.
</P>
<P>
   The device, an electric appliance that warms baby wipes, may
have cracks in the interior tub that allow water to come in contact
with electrical components.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong-based Advance Thermo Control, in cooperation with the
Consumer Product Safety Commission, is recalling warmers
distributed by Prince Lionheart Inc., of Santa Maria, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The recall involves Prince Lionheart Baby Wipe Warmers with the
style number 0224 and date codes 9803 and 9901 with cracked tubs.
The warmers are white plastic boxes with an orange light on the
front that indicates whether it is on or off.
</P>
<P>
   The style number and date code can be found on the bottom of the
units, along with the words ''Santa Maria, CA USA'' and ''MADE IN
CHINA.'' The words ''PRINCE LIONHEART'' can be found on the lid.
</P>
<P>
   Toy, department and baby specialty stores nationwide, as well as
mail order catalogues, sold the warmers from February 1998 through
December 1999 for about $25 each.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers should immediately stop using the warmers, remove the
wipes, and check to see if the interior tub is cracked. If it is,
they should call ATC at (888) 843-8718 between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.
for information on receiving a free replacement unit.
</P>
<P>
   If the tub is not cracked, the unit is not part of the recall,
and consumers can continue to use it.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Warns U.N. on Funding Needs  </HEADLINE>
EDITH M. LEDERER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke warned
Thursday that it will be impossible to fund increases in U.N.
peacekeeping operations unless the United Nations makes the payment
system fairer.
</P>
<P>
   He said that without a chance, the United Nations will be unable
to carry out its most important responsibility: dealing with
peacekeeping challenges from Africa to Kosovo and East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ''We face a potential train wreck between our aspirations for
successful peacekeeping, especially in Africa, and our current
system for funding those same peacekeeping efforts -- an antiquated
and inequitable system that will no longer bear the burdens and
obligation placed upon it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke's warning came in his first appearance before the
General Assembly's finance committee since Congress voted in
December to pay $926 million in U.N. arrears over three years --
provided the United Nations meets about two dozen conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Two key conditions call for a reduction in the U.S. share of the
U.N. peacekeeping budget from the current 31 percent to 25 percent,
and in the regular budget from 25 percent to 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke used his committee appearance to justify the
Congressional demands, arguing that the scale of assessment for
peacekeeping operations was established in 1973 to fund a single
mission in the Sinai -- with about 90 percent of peacekeeping costs
paid by less than 10 countries.
</P>
<P>
   During the past few months, Holbrooke has been lobbying the 187
other U.N. members to agree to the revamped payment scale, most
recently the leaders of China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been little sympathy for the U.S. effort, because
most U.N. members blame the U.N. financial crisis on the U.S.
failure to pay its dues on time and without conditions, as called
for in the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said agreement on a revised scale is particularly
important now since the peacekeeping budget is expected to double
to $2 billion this year and grow even larger next year because of
the expected expansion of the peacekeeping operation in Congo. But
he said the United Nations doesn't have the management structure or
financial system to support such an expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Before addressing the committee, Holbrooke joined Russia's U.N.
Ambassador Sergey Lavrov in announcing that Moscow and Washington
would intensify cooperation to try to get all U.N. members behind
the reforms.

<HEADLINE> Report: Accused Killer Said Insane  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- An eminent psychiatrist hired by the
prosecution concluded a schizophrenic accused of stabbing his
pregnant girlfriend to death was insane at the time, defense
lawyers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor's conclusion, filed in court Thursday, gives lawyers
for Michael Laudor a major weapon to buttress his insanity defense.
</P>
<P>
   None of the parties would release the two-page report by Dr.
Park Dietz of Newport Beach, Calif. But defense attorney Andrew
Rubin said it confirms what defense experts have already concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is what we've expected from the beginning,'' he said.
''This case was a terrible tragedy and here's their own doctor
confirming what our doctors have found, that Michael was not
responsible for his actions.''
</P>
<P>
   If the District Attorney decides to accept an insanity plea
rather than go to trial, Laudor would remain institutionalized
until he's no longer a danger to himself or others. The
prosecutor's office did not return phone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Laudor's girlfriend, Caroline Costello, 37, was found slashed to
death two years ago in the kitchen of the Hastings-on-Hudson
apartment she shared with Laudor. Laudor, who fled in her car, was
tracked to Ithaca and charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   He had been considered a role model for victims of schizophrenia
who control the disease with medication. Laudor, 37, had a law
degree from Yale and had sold book and movie rights to his story.
But friends said that before the killing he had been troubled by
his father's death and his inability to finish his book, and may
have stopped taking his medication.
</P>
<P>
   Dietz, who has been involved in the cases of John Hinckley,
Jeffrey Dahmer, Theodore Kaczynski and Lyle and Erik Menendez,
refused to comment on his report.

Taiwan President Leaves Party Post

   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Taiwan's president resigned as leader of the ruling
Nationalist Party on Friday, becoming the biggest victim of the opposition's
stunning upset in Taiwan's presidential elections. Since the party's humiliating
defeat in Saturday's election, protesters have demonstrated outside the
Nationalists' headquarters, demanding that President Lee Teng-hui resign
immediately as party chairman. Lee, who has led Taiwan for 12 years, had offered
to step down in September. Then on Thursday, he told party leaders he would
resign Friday.

Study: World's Oceans Warming

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists have discovered a significant, even surprising,
warming of the world's oceans over the past 40 years, providing new evidence
that computer models may be on target when they predict the Earth's warming. The
broad study of temperature data from the oceans, dating to the 1950s, shows
average temperatures have increased more than expected -- about half a degree
Fahrenheit closer to the surface, and one-tenth of a degree even at depths of up
to 10,000 feet. The findings were reported by scientists at the National Oceanic

government. The sales could not be federally subsidized, and Helms said that
will protect U.S. ''moral and national security interests.'' The Cuba provision
was included in a foreign assistance bill that also authorizes $600 million in
debt relief to developing countries and $300 million in aid for victims of the

$3,081 on every AIDS patient in Atlanta, but only $2,303 each on those living
elsewhere in Georgia, the audit released today said. Atlanta had 6,119 AIDS
patients; the rest of the state had 2,657. Large cities like Atlanta, Chicago

Bush is ''cocky'' and ''arrogant,'' according to a new Pew Research Center poll
that suggests he is being hurt by it. Since wrapping up the GOP presidential
nomination, Bush has been sounding like a sore winner, making acid remarks about
Al Gore and dismissing former Republican rival John McCain. Among people who now
support his Democratic rival, Al Gore, the percentage who dislike Bush because
of his personality has jumped from 19 percent in October to 33 percent.

'Smart Scalpel' Would Find Cancers
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- A so-called ''smart scalpel'' -- a computerized
fiber-optic laser device -- is being developed to analyze cells and determine
instantly if they're cancerous, helping patients avoid additional biopsies.
Sandia National Laboratories with help from the University of New Mexico medical
school is working on the dime-sized device. It's not actually a scalpel -- it
would be used in conjunction with a surgeon's scalpel. The device contains a
microscopic spectrometer that analyzes protein density in a cell and a tiny
vacuum that sucks cells through microchip-connected sensors for analysis during
surgery. Fiber-optics feed the information into a computer to provide ''instant
feedback to the surgeon,'' Sandia physicist Paul Gourley said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Kenny Inge scored 17 points and Damien
Wilkins added 16 Thursday night as North Carolina State advanced to
the semifinals of the NIT with a 77-54 victory over Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   N.C. State (20-12), in its fourth straight NIT, reached the
semifinals for the first time since 1978, when the Wolfpack lost to
Texas in the title game.
</P>
<P>
   N.C. State will play the winner of Friday's California-Wake
Forest game.
</P>
<P>
   N.C. State reached 20 victories for the first time since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolfpack went ahead 3-2 on Anthony Grundy's 3-pointer a
minute into the game and never relinquished the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Ole Miss (19-14) trimmed the lead to 40-31 after Jason
Harrison's 3-pointer with 16:59 remaining and then to 43-36 after
Rahim Lockhart's putback with 13:26 to go, only to have a technical
foul derail the comeback.
</P>
<P>
   After Wilkins hit two free throws, Ole Miss' Marcus Hicks was
given a technical for slamming the ball after a foul was called.
Archie Miller hit both free throws and Wilkins dunked Miller's miss
for a 49-36 lead.
</P>
<P>
   N.C. State jumped to a 23-7 lead with 10:57 to go in the first
half after Inge made two free throws and maintained a double-digit
lead the rest of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Flanigan hit consecutive 3s to cut N.C. State's lead to 32-22
with 1:33 left in the first half, but the Wolfpack held the Rebels
scoreless after that to lead 38-22 at halftime.

<HEADLINE> Purdue 75, Gonzaga 66  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Gonzaga is gone, done in by defense and
rebounding, and Purdue coach Gene Keady is one victory from his
first trip to the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue slowed the game to a half-court pace and pestered
Gonzaga's guards into a miserable shooting night to beat the
Bulldogs 75-66 on Thursday night in the West Regional semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Jaraan Cornell, whose season-long shooting slump came to an end
when the NCAA tournament began, scored 18 points for the
sixth-seeded Boilermakers (24-9), who play the winner of the
LSU-Wisconsin game in Saturday's regional final.
</P>
<P>
   In Keady's 20 seasons at Purdue, the Boilermakers have been to
the round of 16 five times, including the last three years. But
this will be just their second appearance in a regional final in
that span. Purdue lost to Duke in the Southeast final in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Carson Cunningham added 14 points, Greg McQuay scored 11 and
Brian Cardinal had 10 for Purdue. Cardinal had eight rebounds, and
Cornell and McQuay grabbed seven apiece as Purdue dominated the
boards 44-33, 20-13 on the offensive end.
</P>
<P>
   Casey Calvary scored 20 points and Axel Dench had 14 for No. 10
seed Gonzaga (26-9). Richie Frahm scored 14 but nearly all came
late in the game. He was 1-for-5 from 3-point range. Matt
Santangelo, like Frahm in his final collegiate game, was 4-for-18
from the field, 1-for-7 on 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga, a small Jesuit college in Spokane, Wash., captured the
heart of basketball fans last season with its run to the West
final, where the 'Zags gave eventual champion Connecticut a major
scare. This year, the Bulldogs were at it again, until they were
shut down by the Boilermakers.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga made several runs at Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   Down 61-45 with six minutes to play, the Bulldogs scored eight
in a row, the last six by Calvary, to cut it to 61-53 with 3:35
remaining. But after a timeout, Cardinal scored inside, then batted
the ball to the backcourt to a teammate after Cornell's missed free
throw. Mike Robinson scored on a goaltending call against Calvary,
and Gonzaga's tournament magic had run out.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue took control in the first half with a 17-2 run that put
the Boilermakers up 30-17 on Cardinal's two free throws with 5:03
left. Six Purdue players scored during the surge. Cornell and
McQuay had four points apiece, Cunningham hit a 3-pointer, Robinson
had a fast-break basket and Kenny Lowe had a driving layup.
</P>
<P>
   Frahm got off only three shots in the first 20 minutes, and
missed them all, including an embarrassing airball from 14 feet
that led to Robinson's inside basket early in Purdue's big run.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs made four of their first five shots en route to a
10-4 lead, but they made just five of 21 after that and went 4{
minutes without a point.
</P>
<P>
   The Boilermakers had a 25-13 rebounding advantage in the first
half, including 10-3 on the offensive boards.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 35-22 at the half, Gonzaga outscored Purdue 10-2 to
start the second half to cut it to 37-32 when Frahm made one of two
free throws with 16:08 to play. But the Boilermakers scored the
next 10 points, including 3-pointers by Chad Kerkhoff and Cornell
to pull ahead 47-32 with 12:17 to play.
</P>
<P>
   Purdue has made it to the Final Four twice -- in 1969 and in
1980, the year before Keady became the team's coach.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Jeff Halpern scored two goals, and Olaf Kolzig
made 27 saves to lead the Washington Capitals to a 4-1 victory over
the New York Rangers on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Oates had a goal to extend his scoring streak to eight
games, and Chris Simon scored for the Capitals who are 10-2-1 in
their last 13.
</P>
<P>
   Mike York scored for the Rangers, who are 1-4-1 in their last
six.
</P>
<P>
   Kolzig was brilliant in making tough saves on Tim Taylor and
Brian Leetch at the end of 3-on-1 breaks and robbing Leetch on a
power-play point shot with less than six minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Simon gave Washington a 1-0 lead at 8:05 of the first period
with his 28th goal of the season. Simon took a pass from Glen
Metropolit in the left corner and wristed a shot from 10 feet out
that beat Rangers goalie Kirk McLean high to the stick side.
</P>
<P>
   York tied it 1-1 with a power-play goal at 10:33 of the second.
Adam Graves gained control of the puck along the boards and sent it
behind the net to Theoren Fleury, who fed York for a close-range
one-timer. York leads all rookies with 25 goals.
</P>
<P>
   The assist was Graves' 479th for the Rangers, moving him past
Camille Henry into 11th place on New York's career points list.
</P>
<P>
   Oates took a pass out from behind the net by Joe Murphy at 15:45
of the second period and stuffed it past McLean to put the Capitals
ahead for good with his 14th goal at 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Oates has two goals and 10 assists during his streak, and the
Capitals are 10-2-1 in their last 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   Halpern made it 3-1 with a short-handed goal at 15:10 of the
third period, then added an empty-net short-handed goal at 19:01 to
seal it.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has the NHL's best record since Jan. 1 at 27-7-5.

   The company is said to have followed McCarty to a bar and a
grocery store, looked into his bank records and tapped into his
telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the company said it ''is deeply disappointed by
what it believes are politically motivated actions against a proven
and professional management team.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Bankers acknowledged in the very beginning that the
investigation may have been inappropriate and publicly apologized
but was advised that nothing illegal was done by Bankers or its
management.''
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Insurance has 21 days to request a hearing on the
complaint, or face a penalty ranging from a fine to the suspension
or revocation of its license to do business in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers allegedly hired the private investigator after it lost a
$16-million contract with Florida's Joint Underwriting Association,
the group that acts as the state insurance pool for homeowners who
cannot get coverage on the open market.
</P>
<P>
   McCarty supervised the JUA at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson pursued the charges after a judge earlier this month
released court records from a civil case McCarty earlier brought
against the insurance company. That case is still pending.
</P>
<P>
   According to the insurance commissioner's office, McCarty first
learned he was being followed in August 1995, when an FBI agent
told him his phone was tapped.

<HEADLINE> First Alliance Files for Chapter 11  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif., (AP) -- First Alliance Corp., which lends money
to home buyers with poor credit, filed for bankruptcy protection
Thursday and said it will lay off 85 percent of its staff and stop
making loans.
</P>
<P>
   The Irvine-based company said it would close all its branches,
located in 10 states, and will lay off approximately 300 people.
</P>
<P>
   The company is being investigated by the U.S. Department of
Justice and seven state attorneys general because of complaints
about its lending practices. The company also faces lawsuits filed
by stockholders and customers, also alleging deceptive business
practices.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the company was the subject of an
investigative article in The New York Times and a segment of the
ABC News program ''20/20.''
</P>
<P>
   Company Chairman Brian Chisick blamed the recent ''unwarranted
negative publicity'' for the decision to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection.
</P>
<P>
   ''These unfair and inaccurate stories have devastated the
company's 30-year reputation and acutely hindered the company's
relationships with businesses, consumers and regulators,'' Chisick
said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
   In its annual report, filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on March 13, the company cited a number of lawsuits and
investigations and said it was discussing settlement of a suit
filed in 1998 by the American Association of Retired Persons and
one filed in 1998 by the attorney general of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   The company also said it was cooperating with the Justice
Department in its inquiry. It also discussed a class-action lawsuit
filed in 1998 by a group of the company's stockholders, alleging
the company conspired against the stockholders by ''failing to
disclose known material adverse conditions in making certain public
statements about the company's growth prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   Those prospects have been less than healthy in recent years. The
company's annual earnings have been dropping steadily since 1995.
In 1999, the company reported net income of $3.8 million, down from
$14.2 million in 1998 and $32.7 million in 1997, according to its
annual report.
</P>
<P>
   The company has branches in California, New York, New Jersey,
Illinois, Arizona, Colorado, Maryland, Oregon, Utah and Washington.

<HEADLINE> Senators 3, Maple Leafs 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANATA, Ontario (AP) -- Radek Bonk scored the go-ahead goal
midway through the third period to lead the Ottawa Senators to a
3-2 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Zamuner and Andreas Dackell also scored for the Senators,
who trail the Maple Leafs by three points in the Northeast
Division. Ottawa is attempting to catch Toronto and repeat as
division champions with nine games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Yanic Perreault and Nik Antropov each had a goal and an assist
for Toronto, which lost the season series with Ottawa 3-1-1.
</P>
<P>
   With the game tied 2-2 and Ottawa on the power play, Sami Salo's
shot from just inside the blue-line hit Danny Markov's skate and
Bonk fired the rebound over a sprawling Curtis Joseph with 9:48
remaining for his 20th goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The game was Toronto's first at the Corel Centre since March 11,
when Marian Hossa swung his stick at a loose puck during Toronto's
4-2 win and inadvertently struck Toronto defenseman Bryan Berard,
who may lose the vision in his right eye.
</P>
<P>
   Zamuner opened the scoring on a 2-on-1 rush 5:02 into the game,
firing Daniel Alfredsson's rebound past Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   Dackell intercepted a pass by Markov and beat Joseph with a
back-hander from close range at 13:08 to give Ottawa a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Antropov buried Sergei Berezin's rebound past Ottawa's Tom
Barrasso with 55 seconds left in the first to make it 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph, among the league leaders in all major goaltending
categories, made strong saves on Hossa and Vinnie Prospal as Ottawa
built a 13-3 shot advantage during the first. Ottawa outshot
Toronto 36-27 overall.
</P>
<P>
   Perreault tapped Antropov's rebound into the open side to tie it
with the only goal of the second period at 12:19.
</P>
<P>
   Barrasso made big saves on Antropov, Mats Sundin and Berezin in
the last four minutes to preserve the win.

<HEADLINE> Court gives phyisician another chance to reclaim license  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL GORMLEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The state must consider restoring the
medical license of a physician who lost his practice for
''negligent and incompetent'' abortions nine years ago in which one
woman later died, state officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The state Appellate Division reversed a lower Supreme Court
ruling and sent the case of Dr. Andre Nehorayoff back to the state
Board of Regents. The Board of Regents must reconsider restoring
the physician's license from when he worked at the Manhattan
Women's Health Center, according to the decision released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Nehorayoff's license was suspended in 1991 for negligence and
incompetence, according to state Health Department spokeswoman
Claire Pospisil.
</P>
<P>
   One 18-year-old woman died of what a medical examiner described
as ''hemorrhage due to incomplete abortion,'' according to the
state Attorney General's Office. A 36-year-old woman had an
emergency hysterectomy after suffering a lacerated uterus and a
portion of an 18-year-old woman's bowel was delivered through her
cervix, the court record stated.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 months later, the Regents revoked the license for
''negligent treatment of five patients'' from 1983-90 and poor
record keeping, court records stated.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, he tried to get his license back. Two years later, he
appeared before the Peer Review Committee, which concluded
Nehorayoff had ''sufficiently fulfilled the standards of remorse,
rehabilitation and re-education'' to practice again with three
years' probation. Another professional review by the Committee on
Professions also recommended the doctor return to medicine, but
with 10 years probation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the state Board of Regents found the recommendations
weren't enough. The board didn't return the license because of the
seriousness of the offense and ''a lack of an appropriate degree of
concern'' by the physician. The board also noted the concerns of a
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Nehorayoff took the Regents to court, but the
Supreme Court sided with the Regents.
</P>
<P>
   The Appellate Division court, however, ruled the lower court
failed to make a balanced review of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate justices said the physician was contrite, accepted
punishment and attended class to improve his skills and knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   In a dissenting opinion, Appellate Division Justice Thomas
Mercure said his colleagues shouldn't have overruled the lower
court because the Regents decided restoring the license would pose
a risk to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Nehorayoff couldn't be found Thursday for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The state Attorney General's Office is considering an appeal to
the state's highest court.

U.S. Sales of Food to Cuba OK'd
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate Foreign Relations Committee agreed to allow
sales of food and medicine to Cuba today after the chairman, Sen. Jesse Helms,
dropped his opposition to easing the 40-year-old embargo on the communist
government. The sales could not be federally subsidized, and Helms said that
will protect U.S. ''moral and national security interests.'' The Cuba provision
was included in a foreign assistance bill that also authorizes $600 million in
debt relief to developing countries and $300 million in aid for victims of the
African AIDS epidemic.

Study: World's Oceans Warming

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists have discovered a significant, even surprising,
warming of the world's oceans over the past 40 years, providing new evidence
that computer models may be on target when they predict the Earth's warming. The
broad study of temperature data from the oceans, dating to the 1950s, shows
average temperatures have increased more than expected -- about half a degree
Fahrenheit closer to the surface, and one-tenth of a degree even at depths of up
to 10,000 feet. The findings were reported by scientists at the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration.

Audit: Rural AIDS Funds Lacking
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government provides more money for AIDS patients in
big cities than it does for those living outside urban areas, even as the number
of rural AIDS cases is rising, federal auditors found. The government spent
$3,081 on every AIDS patient in Atlanta, but only $2,303 each on those living
elsewhere in Georgia, the audit released today said. Atlanta had 6,119 AIDS
patients; the rest of the state had 2,657. Large cities like Atlanta, Chicago
and New York have the largest AIDS caseloads.

party's humiliating defeat in Saturday's election, protesters have demonstrated

immediately as party chairman. Lee, who has led Taiwan for 12 years, had offered
to step down in September. Then on Thursday, he told party leaders he would

'Smart Scalpel' Would Find Cancers
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- A so-called ''smart scalpel'' -- a computerized
fiber-optic laser device -- is being developed to analyze cells and determine
instantly if they're cancerous, helping patients avoid additional biopsies.
Sandia National Laboratories with help from the University of New Mexico medical
school is working on the dime-sized device. It's not actually a scalpel -- it
would be used in conjunction with a surgeon's scalpel. The device contains a
microscopic spectrometer that analyzes protein density in a cell and a tiny
vacuum that sucks cells through microchip-connected sensors for analysis during
surgery.

New Stimulation Helps Schizophrenia
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Schizophrenics who hear voices could gain some relief from
magnetic stimulation of the brain, preliminary research suggests. A study
outlined this week in The Lancet medical journal found that when patients were
given magnetic therapy on the part of the brain responsible for perception of
speech, they experienced less frequent and quieter vocal hallucinations than
when they had a fake treatment that felt the same. If confirmed in subsequent
studies, the findings may advance understanding of how the hallucinations occur
and how they can be curtailed.

<HEADLINE> Boy Held Classmates At Gunpoint  </HEADLINE>
By THOMAS J. SHEERAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Ohio (AP) -- A 12-year-old who told authorities he wanted
to be with his mother in jail briefly held his sixth-grade class at
gunpoint Thursday before a teacher persuaded him to give up the
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   No one was hurt and no charges were immediately filed against
the boy, who was taken into custody.
</P>
<P>
   The boy said ''his biological mother was in jail and he wanted
to visit her, be with her,'' said Anthony Krukowski, superintendent
of Lisbon schools.
</P>
<P>
   Police Sgt. Fred Carlisle confirmed the boy wanted to reunite
with his mother. ''Yes, that's what he told a teacher and one of
the police officers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's father told police the weapon -- a loaded, 9 mm
semiautomatic -- had been stored on a dresser top with a fully
engaged trigger lock.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief John Higgins, who would not disclose the boy's name
because he is a juvenile, said the boy apparently found the key and
removed the trigger lock.
</P>
<P>
   About 8:45 a.m., the boy stood up in his classroom at McKinley
Elementary School, pointed the gun at the floor and told his fellow
students and teacher to get down, Higgins and Krukowski said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seemed like forever we were sitting on the ground. It was
probably a few minutes,'' said the teacher, Dan Kemats, 24.
</P>
<P>
   A student in the hall overheard the exchange and summoned
another teacher, Linda Robb, Krukowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Robb stood in the doorway of the classroom and asked the boy if
she could talk to him. The two walked out into the hallway and
hugged, and the boy handed the gun over to Robb, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The student was taken into custody by police in this city, which
is about 25 miles south of Youngstown in northeastern Ohio, near
the West Virginia and Pennsylvania state lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Vindicator of Youngstown reported that the boy was on
crossing duty with another sixth-grader, Katie Hartman, on Thursday
morning. The girl said that at the end of their duty the boy told
her: ''Goodbye, Katie. I won't be back.''
</P>
<P>
   She asked what he meant, but he didn't answer.
</P>
<P>
   Sixth-graders were sent home, but the other students were kept
in class because the district didn't want younger children going
home without making sure their parents knew, Krukowski said.
</P>
<P>
   The school, which has about 650 students from kindergarten
through sixth grade, will be closed on Friday but will be open for
student counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ''Naturally the students were shook up, any time you have an
incident like that,'' Krukowski said.
</P>
<P>
   Krukowski said he wasn't very familiar with the boy and was
unaware of any behavior problems.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, campaigning at a Cincinnati elementary
school, said the incident ''once again raises the question that has
confronted us so often in the past year or two or three. That is,
how can we all come together to give our children better values?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said the student's access to a firearm points out the need
for gun control measures such as child-safety trigger locks.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican nominee,
said the government should provide mentoring and support programs
for the 1.3 million sons and daughters of people in prisons.

<HEADLINE> Coast Guard Orders 10 Pct. Cut  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- The Coast Guard's top admiral in the
Atlantic, citing overworked crews and equipment, has ordered his
cutters and aircraft to reduce operations by 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is time to achieve an understanding among the American
people and in Congress, that the Coast Guard is losing its edge,''
Vice Adm. John E. Shkor said Thursday before a chapter of the Navy
League of the United States. ''New missions, without new resources,
have cut too deep and have taken their toll.''
</P>
<P>
   From now on, he said, ''we will operate our assets to the level,
and only to the level, that can be sustained by the systems which
support them.''
</P>
<P>
   Shkor said his order means:
</P>
<P>
   -- fewer ships and airplanes on counter-drug patrols and ''more
cocaine on our streets.''
</P>
<P>
   -- fewer ships and airplanes securing maritime borders against
alien smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   -- less of a presence on offshore fishing grounds and enforcement
of fishing regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Shkor said the Coast Guard will still rush to search and rescue
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to make a more conscious effort to keep people and
equipment fresh for the emergencies we know will come,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard's 35,000 active duty personnel, 5,700 civilians
and 7,000 reservists ''are straining to keep up,'' said Shkor, who
has headed the Atlantic Area command since September.
</P>
<P>
   He is responsible for operations in 40 states, all inland waters
east of the Rocky Mountains and Atlantic coastal waters from Maine
to the Caribbean Sea, including the Gulf of Mexico.

Lindros Loath To Disappoint Team   
By ROB MAADDI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Eric Lindros' strained relationship with the
Philadelphia Flyers grew more tense Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since it was revealed that Lindros has a more
serious concussion than originally believed, the Flyers captain
discussed his injury and questioned the competence of the team's
medical staff.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew that things were not good, and I tried to convey that
through my symptoms. But I was not going to pull myself out of the
game,'' Lindros said. ''I wanted the team to pull me out. I was
hoping as the week went on that they would do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindros will be sidelined 4-6 weeks, past the April 12 start of
the Stanley Cup playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old center played four more games after being hit in
the jaw by Boston's Hal Gill on March 4. He missed a March 13 game
at Phoenix and was hospitalized two days later for tests. He was
released Friday, but barred from practicing pending another
examination.
</P>
<P>
   Before examining Lindros, team doctor Jeff Hartzell said the
player did not have a concussion, but was suffering from a
migraine. Carl Lindros, the player's father and agent, said he
believed his son was suffering from a migraine caused by stress.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros was examined Tuesday by Dr. James Kelly, a neurologist
at Northwestern University Medical Center in Chicago. Kelly
determined Lindros had a Grade II concussion, which can cause
memory loss and requires a longer recovery time. He said he would
see Lindros again in 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to admit I wasn't pounding down the notion that I was
experiencing real bad headaches,'' Lindros said. ''I had missed
five games, and I wanted to keep playing. That's the mentality of a
player.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindros also said he did not want to reveal his injury for fear
it would jeopardize the chances of the team acquiring Ray Bourque,
the longtime Boston defenseman who ultimately was traded to
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   But those weren't the only reasons Lindros hid his injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''Another reason why I kept playing is because the environment
here is interesting,'' Lindros said. ''The last time I had a
concussion, I didn't talk to Clarke (general manager Bobby Clarke)
for three weeks. Then he said off the record that my agent was a
fool and disruptive for insisting the team follow return-to-play
guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindros said he hasn't spoken to Clarke or Flyers chairman Ed
Snider about this injury.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Snider nor Clarke was available for comment before or
after the Flyers' 3-2 loss to the Los Angeles Kings on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   However, the team issued an organizational statement, which
read, ''Based upon Eric Lindros' comments today, it is obvious that
he and the Philadelphia Flyers have different perspectives
concerning the medical judgments that are made following his most
recent injury. However, this in no way impacts the high level of
confidence we have in the integrity and skill of our training staff
and medical team.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarke last week angrily denied reports that the team mishandled
Lindros' injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Eric feels he has a headache, we didn't know he had a
concussion. If he has a headache, what are we supposed to do about
it?'' Clarke said.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros, a restricted free agent after the season, made it clear
he is not happy with his situation.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of things that go on here that are good and
there's a lot that goes on that isn't good,'' Lindros said.
''There's a lot of stress. Hockey shouldn't be like that. Hockey
should be you just strap on the skates and go out and play. You get
injured, you heal and get back out and play. All this other stuff
is really frustrating. I haven't said anything in the past. I'm
real unhappy with what's gone on here.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said the injury is not career-threatening. But this is
Lindros' fourth concussion since March 1998. His younger brother,
Brett Lindros, was forced to retire from the NHL in 1996 after
suffering three concussions with the New York Islanders and an
undetermined number of concussions in juniors.

   The Predators dominated the Red Wings in the first period,
outshooting them 18-7 and outscoring them 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald scored on a rebound at 8:16, but Roest briefly tied
it on another rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Then Yachmenev put the Predators up 2-1 with a slap shot that
seemed to handcuff Red Wings goalie Ken Wregget. Kjellberg
connected on a two-man advantage to give Nashville a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Wings, who looked sluggish at first after playing an
overtime game the night before against Calgary, stormed back in the
second on Thursday. They scored three goals on five shots in the
first 9:23 to take a 4-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Dandenault connected at 1:40 off a rebound, and Murphy scored
off Pat Verbeek's cross-ice pass behind Predators goalie Tomas
Vokoun at 4:28 to tie it. Fedorov finally put Detroit ahead 4-3 on
a breakaway at 9:23.
</P>
<P>
   Holmstrom continued Detroit's scoring spurt at 15:38, poking the
rebound of Fedorov's shot past Vokoun to give the Red Wings a 5-3
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Gilchrist scored the final goal into an empty net at 18:53 of
the third.
</P>
<P>
   One night after collecting his 500th NHL goal, Verbeek had a
pair of assists to give him 509 for his career.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit's Brendan Shanahan sat out with the flu.

<HEADLINE> SMU Suspends Two Hoop Players  </HEADLINE>
By ALEX LYDA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Two SMU basketball players face possible expulsion
from school for alleged inappropriate behavior during a hotel party
two weeks ago, hours after the team was ousted from the Western
Athletic Conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Citing student privacy laws, SMU athletic director Jim Copeland
refused to identify the two players, but a police report identified
them as Jeryl Sasser, a 6-6 first-team all-conference guard, and
Renaldo Bratton, a 6-foot reserve guard. Neither returned telephone
messages left by The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Sasser was SMU's leading scorer this season. Both players are
juniors.
</P>
<P>
   SMU described what it called ''inappropriate and disruptive
behavior involving a few students'' in the early morning of March
10. Two members of the SMU Spirit Squad also were suspended.
</P>
<P>
   An SMU cheerleader told police in Fresno, Calif., site of the
WAC tournament, that the two players ''touched her through her
clothes with their hands.'' She did not want to file charges, the
police report says.
</P>
<P>
   The cheerleader, who wasn't identified, appeared intoxicated
when police talked to her, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The university is investigating possible violations of SMU's
code of conduct, including documentation of under-age drinking. The
Fresno report said a 21-year-old player gave vodka to a 20-year-old
squad member.
</P>
<P>
   The incident occurred hours after the Mustangs were eliminated
from the WAC tournament by Hawaii 87-82. A Fresno Police Department
report said Sasser and Bratton were questioned about incidents that
took place at a party in their hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Fresno police report, Sasser and Bratton denied
touching the cheerleader inappropriately. Several players and
cheerleaders said they had been drinking, but denied the woman had
been assaulted, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically, there was no criminal, sexual, rape, whatever,
no,'' Sasser told Dallas television KTVT on Thursday. ''We are
totally innocent in this situation, and people are going to find
that out.''
</P>
<P>
   SMU spokesman Bob Wright confirmed Thursday that three
investigations are under way -- one by Fresno police, one by the
team and one by SMU's office of student affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The student affairs investigation could lead to punishment
ranging in severity from probation with counseling to expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   Bratton and Sasser were with the team as SMU lost 77-64 to
Southwest Missouri in the NIT.

<HEADLINE> Texas Goes After 7th Swim Title  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Troy Dumais won the 1-meter springboard and
the 400-meter medley relay team collected a title Thursday night as
Texas took a 22-point lead over defending champion Auburn after the
first day of the men's NCAA swimming and diving championships.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a big thing,'' said Dumais, who won the diving title by
accumulating 605 points. ''Last year, we were down 30, 40 points
after one day. It's a big up for us to be in the lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas had 173 points to 151 for Auburn, which has been first or
second the last four years, and 114{ for Arizona. Texas is bidding
for its third title in 10 years and seventh overall.
</P>
<P>
   The team of Tom Hannan, Russell Chozick, Nate Dusing and Bryan
Jones won the 400 medley relay in 3 minutes, 31.23 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona senior Ryk Neethling, a native of South Africa, picked
up his eighth NCAA championship by winning the 400 freestyle in
3:40.47.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a little disappointed with my time, but it's more
important for the team to get 20 points,'' Neethling said. ''I want
to be the best in the world. I'm not yet, so there's room for
improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Auburn's Matthew Busbee, Aaron Ciarla, Oswaldo Quevedo and
Gregory Busse won the 200-meter freestyle relay in 1:25.14.
</P>
<P>
   Former Hungarian national team member and Olympic gold medalist
Atilla Czene, a freshman at Arizona State, made his NCAA
championships debut by winning the 200 individual medley in
1:54.65.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's much more fun here,'' said Czene, who won the gold medal
in the 200 IM in the 1996 Olympics at Atlanta. ''In Europe, there's
much more pressure. I like it here.''

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Denounces NATO Nations  </HEADLINE>
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- President Slobodan Milosevic branded
NATO countries Europe's new fascists Thursday as he laid a wreath
on a memorial to mark the first anniversary of the 78-day allied
bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let there be eternal glory for the heroes of our fatherland
who died in the defense of freedom and dignity of our country and
its people from new fascism,'' Milosevic wrote in a memorial book
at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier on Mount Avala, 10 miles outside
Belgrade. A television tower on the mountain was repeatedly
targeted by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav government plans rallies Friday to mark the
anniversary of the air campaign, launched March 24, 1999, to stop
Milosevic's crackdown against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   State-sponsored rallies are scheduled in Serbia's capital,
Belgrade, in Montenegro's capital, Podgorica, and throughout the
two republics that now form Yugoslavia. The ceremonies will include
a marathon along a course that will take runners past bombed-out
government buildings in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the celebrations and triumphalism are in bad taste because
there is nothing to celebrate,'' opposition leader Zoran Djindjic
said Thursday. ''Everyone has lost, Serbia most of all.'' Another
opposition figure, Goran Svilanovic, called the government
festivities ''perverse.''
</P>
<P>
   An anti-Milosevic student group -- Otpor, or Resistance -- has
scheduled its own protests for Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to resist the irrational actions of the international
community, but also resist the aggression carried out by the regime
against its own citizens,'' Otpor said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   But Serb supporters didn't wait for Friday to protest. In
Athens, Greece, more than 5,000 demonstrators, chanting ''NATO out,
Greece is no protectorate'', marched through the city center to the
U.S. embassy Thursday to mark the anniversary. Smaller rallies were
also held in other Greek cities. Despite their country's NATO
membership, most Greeks condemned the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   In the Montenegro capital of Podgorica Thursday, about 2,000
pro-Serb protesters gathered to demand that U.S. leaders be tried
for the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The NATO bombing campaign forced Milosevic to withdraw his
forces and hand Kosovo over to NATO peacekeepers and U.N.
administrators, who now find themselves struggling to end reprisal
attacks by ethnic Albanians against the province's dwindling Serb
community.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's secretary-general, Lord Robertson, and its military
commander for Europe, Gen. Wesley Clark, are due to visit Kosovo on
Friday to mark the anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's grip on power remains unshaken a year after the
bombing campaign. Yugoslavia's divided opposition has failed to
mount a serious challenge to his rule or to respond effectively to
a growing crackdown on dissent.
</P>
<P>
   In a preface to a book on police and military casualties
published by the government to mark the anniversary, Milosevic
repeated his claim that that his forces defeated NATO.
</P>
<P>
   ''In that undeclared war, all our people were the target of the
aggressor: children in maternity wards, sick people in hospitals,
soldiers in their trenches,'' Milosevic said in the book, entitled
''Heroes of the Fatherland.''
</P>
<P>
   The book includes names and biographies of 1,002 Yugoslav
policemen and soldiers killed during the NATO airstrikes. The
government has never released an official toll on the number of
civilian casualties, despite Milosevic's promise to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ''With their courage and with the support of the population, the
members of the Yugoslav army and the police proved that they are
invincible,'' Milosevic wrote in the preface.
</P>
<P>
   The allied bombing campaign -- which destroyed oil refineries and
much of Yugoslavia's other infrastructure -- provided Milosevic with
a scapegoat for the country's economic and social decay.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's self-imposed isolation after the raids also gave
Milosevic a free hand to crack down on opposition leaders and the
media.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leader Zarko Korc said Friday is ''a sad anniversary
of the same policies that have triggered the war.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The people who are responsible for the tragedy and isolation
of Serbia are still in power and they are now conducting a war
against their own citizens,'' he said. ''The regime is trying to
portray March 24 as the day of its triumph, but it is the day of
Serbian tragedy.''

<HEADLINE> Mexican Official Gunned Down  </HEADLINE>
By AMPARO TREJO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Gunmen opened fire on an ex-federal agent
reportedly accused of having drug ties and three others at a Mexico
City hotel on Thursday. One person in the group was killed and
three others wounded.
</P>
<P>
   One of those shot was Cuauhtemoc Herrera Suastegui, formerly
with the Mexican attorney general's anti-crime unit. Officials
first said he had been killed, but later said he might be among the
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Herrera was entering the Imperial Hotel with his body guard and
two women when four gunmen opened fire, officials from the Mexico
City attorney general's office said.
</P>
<P>
   One person in the group died at the scene and three others were
hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to clarify the conflicting reports on who was killed, Hugo
Lenoardo Vera, assistant attorney general for Mexico City said,
''We can't confirm anything at this point. We are investigating in
order to be able to give truthful information.''
</P>
<P>
   Visible next to the body that lay in the hotel lobby was a
folder containing Herrera's resume and a black briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   Six people were detained, including the hotel manager.
Authorities believed a seventh had fled the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Herrera, who resigned from the attorney general's office on Jan.
14, was under investigation for possible links to the powerful
Juarez drug cartel, the daily newspaper La Cronica reported Monday
and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Herrera was linked to the cartel by the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration's chief of international operations, La Cronica
reported.
</P>
<P>
   One of the women accompanying Herrera identified herself to
police as a court official in northern Mexico. The other was an
agent in the anti-drug unit of the federal attorney general's
office, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting comes on the sixth anniversary of the assassination
of Luis Donaldo Colosio, then-presidential candidate for Mexico's
governing party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party.

<HEADLINE> UN Ends 1999 With Surplus  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations ended 1999 with more
than $1 billion to spare but expensive U.N. operations in Kosovo
and East Timor may eat up budget surpluses in 2000, the top U.N.
financial official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, however, the financial situation of the organization is
much improved over the past several years -- largely because of
increased payments by the United States, the U.N.
undersecretary-general for management, Joseph Connor, told the U.N.
budget committee.
</P>
<P>
   He urged Washington to pay its bills for 2000, as well as its
more than $1 billion in outstanding dues, so that the United
Nations can continue to improve its viability and fund new
peacekeeping missions this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''In 1999, the United Nations took a step back from the
financial brink,'' Connor said. ''The year 2000 has the potential
to overturn the progress made in 1999, to slip back once more to
the brink.''
</P>
<P>
   Connor told the committee that the United Nations ended 1999 on
a positive note, with $1.1 billion in surplus cash, compared with
$736 million a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the past four years, the United Nations didn't have to
borrow money from its peacekeeping account during the lean months
before the United States made its payment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And when the United States did pay, it made a much larger
contribution than in previous years. In 1999, Washington sent
checks for nearly 150 percent of its regular budget bill. In 1995,
the United States paid just under 50 percent of what it was billed.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations is counting on having cash surpluses in 2000,
but that prediction is based on Washington making a contribution
similar to what it paid in 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is billed 25 percent of the U.N. budget and 31
percent of its peacekeeping budget -- the most of any U.N. member
state. But Washington has withheld partial payment for the past
several years and last year made payment of $926 million of its
outstanding bills conditional on agreement by the other 187 U.N.
member states to reduce its share.
</P>
<P>
   Connor said the U.N. administrations in Kosovo and East Timor
pose the biggest financial challenge to the United Nations in 2000
and may warrant a special review since funding so far has been slow
and unpredictable.

<HEADLINE> McCain Mich. Delegates Up for Grabs  </HEADLINE>
By KATHY BARKS HOFFMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- As Michigan Republicans begin meeting to
choose delegates for the Republican National Convention, some
backers of John McCain worry that George W. Bush's supporters will
get the seats that should go to them.
</P>
<P>
   McCain spokesman Todd Harris suspected Thursday that Gov. John
Engler -- one of Bush's biggest advocates in the state -- may be
trying to get Bush supporters into some of the delegate spots that
McCain earned by winning Michigan's GOP presidential primary on
Feb. 22.
</P>
<P>
   McCain picked up 52 of the state's 58 national convention
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   But two-thirds of voters who identified themselves in exit polls
as Republicans backed Bush in the primary. So McCain supporters
attending GOP county and district conventions held to elect
delegates could find themselves in the minority.
</P>
<P>
   Engler spokesman John Truscott said there was no move afoot to
challenge McCain supporters vying for delegate spots.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing like that is happening in the state,'' Truscott said.
''There is no talk of stealing McCain delegates.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's spokesman was skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ''They could not beat us in their own primary, so they are now
attempting after the fact to defeat our delegates in small party
caucuses and behind closed doors,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's Michigan co-chairman, state Sen. John Schwarz, plans to
sit down with Engler and state GOP Chairman Rusty Hills on Monday
to discuss Michigan's delegation to the July 31-Aug. 3 GOP
convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ''Could the Bush people make mischief for the McCain delegates?
Yes,'' said Schwarz, the only lawmaker in Michigan to openly back
McCain before the primary. ''The people who voted for McCain would
be pretty upset if they think their vote for McCain delegates
didn't go to that purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Truscott said it's likely that some Bush supporters may get some
of the delegate spots won by McCain, but they would have to vote
for McCain at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz said that's not necessarily true. He said the fact that
McCain suspended his campaign after the March 7 elections could be
interpreted by Bush backers as a meaning they're not obligated to
vote for McCain on the first ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Unless state party rules are changed, Engler would have to
attend the convention as a McCain delegate. The governor is
expected to be one of 10 statewide delegates McCain won in addition
to the 42 delegates he picked up in congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said Thursday that at the convention he would free the
more than 230 delegates he won during the primaries so they could
vote for any candidate. And, for the sake of party unity, he said
he would not allow any move to nominate him as the GOP presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think that's necessary at all,'' McCain said during a
joint interview, with his wife Cindy, on CNN's ''Larry King Live.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz, meanwhile, blamed some of the friction over delegates
on the chilly relationship between Bush and McCain. Although McCain
has suspended his campaign, he has not endorsed Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over delegates ''could be solved very amicably if
Governor Bush and Senator McCain would sit down and communicate, or
it could be something less than amicable if we have to go into an
aggressive mode to claim the delegates which we won the right to
elect in the primary,'' Schwarz said.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica Public Workers Strike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) -- About 20,000 people marched in the
streets of the Costa Rican capital Thursday, the first day of a
strike by public employees protesting plans to end the state
electric and telecommunications monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Strikers blocked streets and highways and paralyzed the state
oil refinery and the country's two ports. Some public hospitals
canceled appointments and schools failed to open.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how many workers participated in the strike.
</P>
<P>
   Costa Rica has had daily protests leading up to and following
the National Assembly's approval of a bill Monday to divide the
Costa Rican Institute of Electricity into two businesses -- one for
telecommunications, the other for electricity -- and open them to
private investment. The bill will be reviewed by the Constitutional
Court before being submitted to another vote.
</P>
<P>
   Unions claim it would result in job losses and high rates for
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of serious violence or major clashes with
police.

<HEADLINE> State agency's final approval on hold  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A judge's ruling Thursday will delay the
expected state approval of a controversial $500 million mall in New
Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Jerry Wagner ruled the state Office of
Policy and Management cannot issue it's final decision until he
decides whether there should be a new public hearing on the
proposed mall at Long Wharf.
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend the new mall would take as much as 28 percent of
downtown New Haven's retail sales, and up to 23 percent of some
suburban retail business. They went to court seeking the new public
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's budget office was expected on Friday to give
final approval to a report that found no significant impact from
the mall on traffic, the environment or the regional economy. The
approval is one of several needed to free up about $28 million in
state financing for the project by the end of April.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said he will make his decision on a public hearing by
April 12.
</P>
<P>
   New Haven Mayor John DeStefano Jr. took the latest delay in
stride.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a big project and we've been at it for three years. So
another couple weeks aren't going to cause me to lose any sleep,''
DeStefano told The Associated Press Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Mall supporters say the project will provide thousands of new
construction and retail jobs and give the city and region a major
economic boost.

<HEADLINE> Docs Tell Olajuwon To Stop Playing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- The Houston Rockets decided the best place for
ailing Hakeem Olajuwon is on the sidelines for 2-3 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon has an asthma-like condition, which prevents him from
breathing properly during games, and coach Rudy Tomjanovich is
pleased the Rockets' star is taking time off.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel relieved that he's in a safe situation because I don't
want to see anything happen to him,'' Tomjanovich said. ''This
isn't a surprise, because he's been struggling with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon, officially placed on the injured list Thursday, missed
22 games this season recovering from hernia surgery and has had his
playing time slowed by the respiratory problem. He played 16
minutes in Tuesday's loss to Cleveland with two points and four
rebounds but was fatigued early.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets reactivated forward Matt Bullard from the injured
list to replace Olajuwon. The 6-foot-10, 235-pound Bullard missed
the last 10 games with back spasms. He averages seven points and
2.8 rebounds per game.
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich said Olajuwon ''has had moments where he looked like
he was recovering and making strides and then in that last game at
the first time-out, he just couldn't catch his breath. At that
point, I started thinking 'just for his welfare, are we doing the
right thing by having this guy out there?'
</P>
<P>
   ''Because he's been through so many different ailments ... it
just hit me as concern for him as a person.''
</P>
<P>
   Team physician Dr. James Muntz wouldn't speculate if Olajuwon
would return this year or next season, the final year of his
contract. The regular season ends April 19.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to answer that now,'' Muntz said. ''What we'd like
to do is have him take off and see if he gets to feeling better. He
had some side effects from his previous medication, so we want to
try some things out.''
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon, 37, was diagnosed March 1 with a disease that
restricts the flow of air through his bronchial passages during
heavy exercise, causing spasms in his lungs. He has been taking
medicine for the condition.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hakeem Olajuwon came in for a follow-up for his respiratory
status, and as you can see he's having some problems, so we asked
him to take some time off,'' Muntz said.
</P>
<P>
   Muntz said Olajuwon's condition had not worsened, but had not
gotten better since the first diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   The breathing problem limited Olajuwon's playing time -- he has
played as much as half a game only once since the diagnosis. He is
averaging 24 minutes a game for the season, 13.4 below his career
average.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he was not playing basketball, he would not even know he
has this condition,'' Muntz said.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon, the NBA's career leader in blocked shots and the
Rockets' leader in virtually every offensive category, said next
season will be his last. It also is the last of his contract, which
is worth $16.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Olajuwon's career averages were 23.6 points and 11.8 rebounds
beginning this season. He is averaging 10.3 points and 6.2 rebounds
this season.

<HEADLINE> Search Continues For Mass. Kids  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WORTHINGTON, Mass. (AP) -- State and local authorities were
searching Thursday night for four missing girls who took a walk in
the late afternoon and failed to return.
</P>
<P>
   A 12-year-old baby sitter and three girls -- ages 3, 4 and 5 --
went for a walk at about 5 p.m. in a rural, wooded area, said state
Trooper Michael Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said the kids promised to be back in half an hour and
didn't return.
</P>
<P>
   State police Lt. Paul Maloney said that by late evening about
100 people had converged on the search site in western
Massachusetts, along with police dogs and two police helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's certainly concern,'' Maloney said. ''The temperatures
could certainly drop.''

<HEADLINE> Car Suspect May Face More Charges  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN PARROTT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Police said the suspect in a car wash massacre
could face an additional charge of capital murder now that
authorities have confirmed a body found in a ditch is that of a
woman who disappeared in November.
</P>
<P>
   Police were led to the body after interviewing Robert Wayne
Harris, who is being held for the Monday shooting deaths of five
car wash employees in Irving. Another worker remains in critical
condition.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas County Medical Examiner on Thursday used dental
records to identify the body as that of Sandra Gaye Scott, an
Irving woman missing since Nov. 29. Scott, 37, died of a gunshot
wound to the neck, said Charles Gaylon, a field agent for the
medical examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Irving police spokesman David Tull said investigators have
prepared five capital murder charges and one attempted capital
murder charge in the car wash killings. He said Harris had been a
suspect in Scott's disappearance and could be charged in her death.
</P>
<P>
   Funerals were held Thursday for two of the car wash victims.
Services were held in Irving for Dennis Lee, the 43-year-old
manager of Mi-T-Fine Car Wash; and in Lipan for Rhoda Wheeler, the
45-year-old cashier.
</P>
<P>
   Harris was fired from the car wash just days before the
shootings. He told KXAS-TV that he ''snapped'' when he went to the
business on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm deeply sorry for what I did and for all the pain that I
caused everybody involved,'' he told the station Wednesday during a
telephone interview from jail.

<HEADLINE> 3d World Debtors Club Proposted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Business officials meeting here for talks in
advance of next month's Third World summit on Thursday proposed the
creation of a debtors' club to help negotiate their country's debts
with wealthier nations.
</P>
<P>
   The group also proposed creation of a new banking institution
for developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   Wrapping up the meeting of about 200 businessmen from 30
countries, Cuban Commerce Minister Ricardo Cabrisas called for
reforms in the World Trade Organization that would allow developing
countries to improve their economies through increased
international trade.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals will be presented later to the heads of state from
around the globe who attend a summit by the Group of 77 in Havana
April 10-14. The gathering is aimed at by helping put developing
nations in the mainstream of the global economy and the technology
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The group was established in 1964 by 77 developing countries and
has increased its membership to 133 nations. It is the largest
Third World coalition at the United Nations, promoting the economic
and social interests of the world's poorer nations.
</P>
<P>
   Next month's ''South Summit'' will examine growing
globalization; access to knowledge and technology; improving
dialogue between countries in the south and the richer developed
nations in the north; and increasing cooperation, investment and
trade among the southern nations.

<HEADLINE> House Debates $1.82 Trillion Budget  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite unrest by some conservatives,
Republicans drove a $1.82 trillion budget for 2001 toward House
passage on Thursday, mapping out deeper tax cuts and lower domestic
spending than President Clinton wants.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next five years, the measure would set aside at least
$150 billion for tax cuts and the entire $1 trillion in projected
Social Security surpluses for debt reduction, Republicans said. It
would also leave the door open for creating a prescription drug
benefit for Medicare recipients with a price tag of up to $40
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're for the reform agenda, you're going to support this
budget,'' said House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio,
echoing a campaign theme of apparent GOP presidential nominee
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In a replay of last year's budget fight, Democrats accused
Republicans of squandering surpluses from non-Social Security
programs on tax breaks for the wealthy, and doing little to
buttress Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Likening the Republican budget to a television game show, Rep.
Brad Sherman, D-Calif., asked, ''Who wants to risk Social Security
to give huge tax breaks to multi-multi-multi-millionaires?''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the GOP plan embraces spending cuts so severe
that Congress would never approve, and they challenged the GOP's
numbers, saying the Republican plan would eat into Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans denied that, with Kasich saying that to arrive at
that conclusion, Democrats had to ''cook numbers and make things
up.''
</P>
<P>
   The budget, which does not need the president's signature, sets
overall tax and spending targets for the fiscal year that begins
Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP plan would match or exceed Clinton's proposals for
defense, schools and veterans, and calls for tax cuts for many
married couples and for health care and other expenses. But such
details are advisory only, and lawmakers will shape specific
programs in later bills.
</P>
<P>
   Reiterating administration opposition to the GOP plan, White
House budget chief Jack Lew wrote congressional leaders that it is
''fundamentally flawed and fails to provide a balanced and workable
economic plan. In the past, this approach has delayed, rather than
expedited, action on'' subsequent budget legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans supported the proposal. But eight conservatives
voted ''no'' on an early procedural vote because they said it
lacked controls to ensure that spending remained within budget.
</P>
<P>
   ''It means we'll spend $25 billion to $30 billion more than what
we say,'' said Rep. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., a leader of the
discontented group. ''It's another wink and nod from Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   With the GOP's wafer-thin 11-seat House margin, their defections
could jeopardize the budget's final passage. Party leaders labored
throughout the day to quell the uprising, and succeeded after
promising efforts to prevent spending bills from growing as they
move through the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative disaffection was mirrored in the Senate. There,
Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., has yet to
even try pushing a similar plan through his panel because
conservatives want to hold spending down.
</P>
<P>
   At issue was the $596.5 billion the budget would set aside for
jet fighters, road building and every other federal function but
automatically paid benefits like Medicare and interest on the debt.
</P>
<P>
   Of that amount, $307 billion would be for defense, $1 billion
more than Clinton's request. Its $289 billion for domestic programs
is almost $30 billion below the president's plan.
</P>
<P>
   In early votes, the House overwhelmingly rejected five rival
budgets by black, progressive and conservative Democrats,
Democratic leaders and conservative Republicans.	   As they did when Kasich
pushed the plan through his committee
last week, Republicans blocked a Democratic effort to force a vote
on the $483 billion, five-year tax cut Bush has proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's proposal and the congressional tax cut are not directly
comparable because they cover different five-year periods.
Nonetheless, the Bush plan would eat into Social Security surpluses
as projected by Congress, and few Republicans would be comfortable
voting to do that.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposed $99 billion in tax cuts over the next five
years, nearly offset by $96 billion in higher cigarette and some
business taxes.
</P>
<P>
   House conservatives won a promise from GOP leaders to pursue at
least $4 billion more in debt reduction this year.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, they dropped budget language that would have
prohibited spending any of this year's projected $27 billion
surplus. In effect, that would have killed a separate $9 billion
measure financing anti-drug efforts in Colombia, U.S. troops in
Kosovo, and aid to victims of Hurricane Floyd and other domestic
disasters.
