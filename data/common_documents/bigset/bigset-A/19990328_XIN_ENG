<HEADLINE> Jiang Puts Forward Proposals On New World Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BASEL, Switzerland, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President
Jiang Zemin Saturday urged the international community to
establish a new world order to meet the changes of the times, and
put forward five fundamental principles for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Swiss business community, Jiang said that
first it was essential to adhere to the principles of mutual
respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-
aggression and non-interference in each other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Second, it was essential to adhere to the principle of the
peaceful settlement of international disputes.
</P>
<P>
He said that "Disputes between countries and conflicts within a
region should be fairly and rationally resolved step-by-step
through peaceful negotiations and consultation based on equality,
rather than through frequent resort to force or threat of force on
the strength of one's military advantages."
</P>
<P>
He called for a complete abandonment of the Cold War mentality
and various forms of power politics.
</P>
<P>
Third, it was essential to adhere to the principle of sovereign
equality of all countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that countries, big or small, rich or poor, strong
or weak, were equal members of the international community and had
the right to participate in world affairs on an equal footing.
</P>
<P>
"No country or bloc of countries have the prerogative to
override the international community," he note. "It is essential
to fully respect and give play to the positive role of the United
Nations in safeguarding world peace and stability."
</P>
<P>
Fourth, it was essential to adhere to the principle of
respecting the national conditions of each and every country and
seeking common ground.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president stressed that "Every country is entitled
to choose its social system, road to development and way of life
independently in line with its own national conditions."
</P>
<P>
He said that the differences between countries in historical
background, cultural tradition, social systems and values should
be respected and should not become obstacles to the development of
normal state-to-state relations, even less should they become
excuses for interfering in other countries' internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Fifth, it was essential to adhere to the principle of mutually
beneficial cooperation and common development.
</P>
<P>
He called on both developed and developing nations to work
together for their common development on the basis of equality and
mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also warned that no country should make use of its
economic, technological and financial advantages to damage the
economic security and development of other countries.

<HEADLINE> NATO Will Not Go Beyond Air Strikes in Yugoslavia: France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- NATO's use of military force in
Yugoslavia was currently restricted to air strikes, a senior
French military officer said here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
General Xavier Delcourt, the Assistant Chief of Operation of
the General Staff of the French Armed Forces, ruled out a NATO
ground troop intervention in Kosovo from Macedonia, where up to 10,
000 troops, including 2,400 French soldiers, were "in a state of
waiting".
</P>
<P>
An entry by ground forces would not be possible before the
signing of a political agreement with Yugoslavia, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that NATO was re-evaluating the situation in Yugoslavia
on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether NATO has begun attacking Serb tanks and ground
forces in Kosovo, he said, "Not yet."
</P>
<P>
NATO has made it a principle to avoid the loss of human life,
both civilian and military, when bombing targets in Yugoslavia,
the officer said.
</P>
<P>
But he refused to comment on some reports by Western media that
Kosovo Albanians had been under severe attack and reprisals from
the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
He also declined to make a comparison between the bombing of
Yugoslavia and the "Desert Storm" operation by the U.S.-led
coalition force against Iraq, saying that the political and
military situations of the two wars were totally different.
</P>
<P>
French Defense Minister Alain Richard said in an interview with
the daily Le Figaro that the objective of NATO remained to "reduce
the capacity (of Yugoslav President Milosevic) to harm his own
people".
</P>
<P>
"For France and for its partners, the objective of the air
campaign is to reduce and then paralyze the offensive potential of
the Serb forces and their capacity to take on civilian population,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
But the essential objective of NATO was to force the Yugoslav
president to return to the negotiating table, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the 40 warplanes of France, including Mirage 2000
fighter jets "entered the action in the turn of their role
according to the missions to accomplish."

<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Maria Butyrskaya of Russia beat
defending champion Michelle Kwan to win the women's title at the
World Figure Skating Championships here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Butyrskaya needed to finish at least second in the free skating
to be sure of the title, no matter what Kwan did.
</P>
<P>
She completed seven triples with mature artistry to gain marks
of 5.7 and 5.9 from the judges. After her strong performance, Kwan
was clearly out of the running when she took the ice.
</P>
<P>
A chance to win the free skating evaporated for Kwan when she
stepped out of her opening triple lutz. Later she only had a
single axel, worrying about the jump that she missed in the short
program when she fell and dropped her to four.
</P>
<P>
Julia Soldatova of Russia finished third.
</P>
<P>
Butyrskaya's victory gives Russia a sweep of all four titles,
the first time a country has taken all four at the world
championships.

<HEADLINE> Force Will Not Resolve Kosovo Crisis: Romanian Senate Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Romania's Senate Speaker Petre
Roman said Friday evening that military strikes against Yugoslavia
would not resolve the Kosovo crisis and Romania could not afford
to become involved in it.
</P>
<P>
Roman insisted that Romania, which is not a member state of
NATO, could not respond to the Kosovo crisis as a NATO member.
</P>
<P>
If the country had to act in the crisis under the pressure of
circumstances, the parliament should have a say in the matter.
</P>
<P>
In recent days, many party leaders have criticized Romanian
authorities which has supported NATO.
</P>
<P>
The country's newspapers have condemned the U.S.-led NATO for
its air strikes against Yugoslavia, saying NATO had violated the
principles of international law.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Vows to Continue NATO Attack on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Saturday the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) will
continue attack on Yugoslavia until President Solbodan Milosevic
"accepts peace."
</P>
<P>
"Our military operation has been under way for several nights
now. In this time, Serb troops have continued attacks on unarmed
men, women and children," Clinton said in his weekly radio
address.
</P>
<P>
"This is all the more reason for us to stay the course. We
must, and we will, continue until Serbia's leader, Slobodan
Milosevic, accepts peace or we have seriously damaged his capacity
to make war," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he was "deeply impressed by the solidarity" of the
19 NATO countries who signed off on the mission and thanked U.S.
military personnel for "risking their lives to protect peace in
the Balkans."
</P>
<P>
He said he committed U.S. forces to the mission to "save the
lives of innocent civilians in Kosovo from a brutal military
offensive; to defuse a powder keg at the heart of Europe" and to
"prevent a wider war we would have to confront later."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Defense Department said Friday intelligence
information gathered about alleged ethnic cleansing will help
direct NATO airstrikes, which began Wednesday and are expected to
continue Saturday against Serbian military targets across
Yugoslavia and also focus inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
NATO airstrikes were led Friday night by B-52 bombers that can
launch satellite-guided cruise missiles. Air Force F-117A stealth
fighter-bombers also took part in the attacks, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
A Navy ship fired one cruise missile during the day Friday, the
only daytime NATO assault so far, aiming at what Pentagon
spokesman Kenneth Bacon called "a target of opportunity."
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia delivered a surprise of its own Friday when two
MiG-29 jets flew into Bosnia, where there are NATO peacekeepers,
including nearly 7,000 U.S. troops. Two U.S. Air Force F-15
fighters shot down the two aircraft. The encounters brought to
five the number of MiG-29s destroyed since NATO's air campaign
began -- one-third of the Yugoslav Air Force's 15 top-line MiGs,
according to Pentagon officials.

<HEADLINE> Aung San Suu Kyi Issues Statement on Husband's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Aung San Suu Kyi, general
secretary of the National League for Democracy (NLD) of Myanmar,
issued a statement here Saturday night to express thanks to all
those around the world who supported her husband, Michael Aris,
during his illness.
</P>
<P>
She also expressed her thanks to all those who have given her
and her family love and sympathy.
</P>
<P>
"I feel so fortunate to have had such a wonderful husband, who
has always given me the understanding and support I needed.
Nothing can take that away from me," she said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, Aris passed away on Saturday in
Oxford, Britain, of prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
Before his death, Aris had requested a visa to Myanmar to see
his wife which the government said it was reviewing. But the
government pointed out that it would be a difficult trip for him
on account of his health condition and had not granted him the
visa.
</P>
<P>
Aung San Suu Kyi was married to Aris, a British citizen, in
January 1972 in England and they have two sons. She returned to
Myanmar to see her then dying mother, Daw Khin Kyi, former Myanmar
ambassador to India, in 1988 when the country was in a political
crisis and has since resided in the country.
</P>
<P>
She was put under house arrest by the Myanmar authorities from
July 20, 1989, to July 10, 1995, for allegedly endangering the
state.

Deputy Health Minister Enerst Mwansa, at the celebration of the
World TB Day in Lusaka on Saturday, noted that TB has become a
major health problem in his country which also has a high rate of
HIV infections.
</P>
<P>
Mwansa said that delayed treatment at the first symptoms has
led to unnecessary deaths.
</P>
<P>
He called on his countrymen to seek early treatment whenever
they were first infected with this contagious disease.
</P>
<P>
The health official said that the government has no resources
to buy expensive drugs that are needed when patients become
resistant to medications.
</P>
<P>
World Health Organization country representative Edward Magami
said earlier the burden of TB is still overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
He said the situation has become serious because 30 percent of
diagnosed TB is related to the HIV/AIDS pandemic.
</P>
<P>
According to a WHO report, one person is infected every minute
by the disease which has affected more than 1.9 billion of the
world's population.

<HEADLINE> Protest Against NATO Attacks Staged in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- About 400 protesters gathered
Saturday afternoon outside the U.S. embassy in Nicosia, demanding
an immediate end to the air strikes against Yugoslavia by the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavs living in Cyprus and Greek Cypriots joined the
demonstration, which was organized by the Cyprus-Yugoslavia
Friendship Association.
</P>
<P>
Protesters pinned a petition, which the U.S. embassy refused to
accept, on the barbed wire around the embassy, condemning "most
strongly the criminal acts committed by the NATO against the
sovereign and peace-loving state of Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
The petition stresses that the people of Yugoslavia have the
right to decide for themselves their own future and nobody can
force them to accept foreign military troops on their territory.
</P>
<P>
The protesters, holding banners denouncing the U.S. and
Britain, threw eggs, tomatoes, red paint and bottles against the
embassy building. They burned an American flag.
</P>
<P>
Police sealed off the area and took extra security measures to
avert any accidents.
</P>
<P>
The NATO forces have launched daily air attacks on Yugoslavia
since Wednesday after Belgrade refused to sign a peace deal with
Kosovo Albanians which would allow NATO troops to be deployed on
Yugoslav soil.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanians have been fighting for independence in the
Yugoslav province of Kosovo, where they make up 90 percent of the
population.

BRUSSELS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) said here Saturday that the
NATO forces will not stop conducting air strikes in Kosovo until
NATO's main objectives could be met for helping produce a
political solution.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Jamie Shea, told a press briefing that the NATO
military operations for the time being have to continue "until we
meet those crucial objectives" which had been outlined by NATO.
</P>
<P>
Referring to further NATO military operations, the NATO press
official said "we will be increasingly in a good position to
severely disrupt and hinder systematic operations" of Serbs in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
At the same time in the NATO headquarters, NATO's British Air
Commodore David Wilby denied reports that some NATO aircraft were
probably shot down by Serb forces in Kosovo. He told reporters
that the allied forces have not lost any aircraft so far.
</P>
<P>
The air commodore also said the allied forces have made every
effort to minimize any collateral damage to civilian life or
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
When briefing reporters about the updated operation development
in Kosovo, Wilby said the NATO forces have shot down five military
aircraft of Yugoslav forces.

<P>
LONDON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said Saturday said NATO air strikes in Kosovo would continue.
</P>
<P>
"The air strikes have to continue until we reach our
objective," Blair said in an interview with a British television
program.
</P>
<P>
He also warned Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic that if he
attacked NATO forces elsewhere in the Balkans, "the retaliation
will be swift and very, very severe."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, who was seriously criticized in Britain for
taking part in the attacks, repeated again his own allegation that
"the air strikes are the only chance."
</P>
<P>
That statement was made in his latest television appearance to
spell out and justify NATO's case in the three-day-old conflict.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the split among NATO countries on the question of
whether the strikes should be ended soon, Blair insisted that NATO
allies were united behind the military campaign.
</P>
<P>
NATO's air strikes on Yugoslavia have produced mixed reactions
in Britain. Leading politicians and historians have began to
question the wisdom of the alliance's move.
</P>
<P>
In a debate carried by the British Daily Telegraph newspaper,
Lord Carrington, former Conservative defense secretary and foreign
secretary of Britain, said: "I believe that the policy which has
led to us being where we are now is both mistaken and
ill-conceived."
</P>
<P>
"What worries me is that I do not think that we have learned
the lessons of the two wars: the Serbo-Croat war and the Bosnian
war," Carrington said.
</P>
<P>
"Those two wars showed what a mistake it is to intervene, in
particular militarily, to keep a peace which does not exist and in
a situation where we do not wholeheartedly support one side or the
other," he said.
</P>
<P>
Malcolm Rifkind, former Conservative defense secretary and
British foreign secretary, said: "There is a very considerable
degree of confusion as to exactly what NATO's objectives are."

<P>
DUBAI -- The United Arab Emirates' Ministry of Finance and
Industry said that 30 percent of the investors from the Gulf
states come from Saudi Arabia and two thirds of them deal in trade
activities and the rest in industrial ones.

The country has to avoid in the long run every thing that could
affect highly-skilled and half-skilled labor. It will tend to
reduce the low-skilled labor and will get rid of 250,000 of them

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Condemns NATO Airstrikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami on Saturday called the ongoing air strikes on Yugoslavia
by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization as "an illegal action."
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with the new Armenian ambassador to Tehran,
Khatami said the current NATO actions will benefit not the Islamic
Albanian Kosovars, but the big powers who want to dominate the
Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president was referring to the Western countries,
particularly the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Khatami noted that Iran, the current president of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference, would not tolerate any
encroachment on the rights of Muslims in Kosovo and the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The NATO forces on Wednesday started air strikes on Yugoslavia
after peace talks failed to settle the dispute between Belgrade
and the autonomy-seeking ethnic Albanians who make up 90 percent
of the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Khatami also criticized Belgrade for declining to recognize the
rights of Kosovo Albanians, thus giving a pretext for the
intervention of foreign forces.
</P>
<P>
He said that recognition of the people's rights in that region
is one of the main prerequisites for settling the current crisis
and the Belgrade government bears a great responsibility in this
regard.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabweans Need Traditional Values: Mugabe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Addressing the Youth League National Assembly of the ruling
Zanu (PF) party in Harare, Mugabe said divisions within the party
and within the nation should not be carried into the future as the
party was preaching national unity.
</P>
<P>
The president said although the government provided education,
health care and jobs, people needed to work for their families.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the people were unemployed because industry
could not absorb so many people, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is much more room in agriculture and the best way of
empowering people is to give them land and help them till it,
that is why the land question is vital. The British have
everything in their power to try and disorganize us in this
exercise," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe accused the Americans and the British of reneging on
their Lancaster House Talks promise of helping to settle the land
question.
</P>
<P>
"I believe we can resolve this issue this year and not next
year. What can move into next year is probably the issue of
inputs to develop the land.
</P>
<P>
Let us politicize ourselves and recruit the young ones," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He gave the delegates a detailed history of how the struggle
for independence began and Zimbabwe's position in the region and
the world.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Opposition  Rejects Govt Proposals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's National Convention for
Change (NCC) Saturday rejected the government constitutional
proposals, saying they reflect a clear desire by President Robert
Mugabe to manipulate the process of constitutional change.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the group called for an all party
constitutional conference composed of representatives from
political parties, civic groups,
</P>
<P>
labor unions and various groups from which the constitutional
reform should proceed.
</P>
<P>
It said if the ruling Zanu (PF) wanted to proceed with
constitutional reforms on the basis of a commission of inquiry
appointed by Mugabe, it should have submitted its concerns to an
all party conference which would accept or reject the proposals.
</P>
<P>
The NCC, a grouping of opposition political parties, human
rights groups, farmers and women's organizations, among others,
have also rejected the the idea of a constitutional commission
chosen by Mugabe, alleging that it will be manipulated, the local
news agency Ziana reported.

<HEADLINE> Russia Hopes for Political Solution to NATO's Attack Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said on Saturday that his country hopes to seek a political
solution to NATO's attack against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
But if such attempts fail, he told an emergency session of the
State Duma, or lower house of the parliament, that Russia would
resort to "other measures considered necessary."
</P>
<P>
Russia is considering to provide humanitarian aid to Yugoslavia,
he said, adding the contents of aid depends on the situation there.
</P>
<P>
But he pointed out that Russia will not be sucked in to war.
</P>
<P>
By upholding Yugoslavia's state sovereignty, Russia is
safeguarding the world from the spreading of the new colonialism
bearing NATO's mark.
</P>
<P>
NATO's attack on Yugoslavia posed a challenge to the whole
world and the atmosphere of partnership and trust, he said, adding
the action was designed to the ensuring of a uni-polar world
pattern for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Duma should ratify the START II nuclear arms
reduction treaty signed with the United States in 1993, but it is
not the right time to do it now.
</P>
<P>
The treaty calls for the two countries to halve their nuclear
arsenals to 3,000-3,500 warheads each.

<HEADLINE> NATO To Consider Attacking Tanks in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- NATO Saturday said it could soon
begin attacking moving ground targets in the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
A Reuters report quoted a spokesman for NATO as saying in
Brussels that Yugoslav heavy armor would be targeted in Kosovo as
soon as NATO military chiefs are satisfied that Yugoslav air
defenses have been neutralized and the risk to slower
ground-attack aircraft is minimized.
</P>
<P>
The new move of attacking moving targets on the ground would
require low-flying, tank-buster planes and helicopters to take out
Serb armor.
</P>
<P>
NATO admitted the air power employed so far in Phase One of
Operation Allied Force -- mostly pilotless cruise missiles and
high-level bombing -- could not destroy the moving targets on
ground.
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to strike at heavy weapons. And this is what we aim
to get on with as soon as the first set of targets has been
effectively covered," a NATO spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
So far, NATO maintains that it has no plans for introducing
ground forces to Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
There are about 12,000 NATO troops stationed in Macedonia, very
close to the southern border with Yugoslavia, equipped with small
numbers of main battle tanks, armored fighting vehicles, tracked
artillery and attack helicopters.
</P>
<P>
But NATO says this force is part of a peacekeeping force, and
would only be used when the Yugoslav government signs the peace
treaty and invites them into Kosovo to monitor the peace
implementation.

<HEADLINE> (Urgent) NATO Launches 4th Day of Attacks on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) launched a fourth day of attacks on Yugoslavia
Saturday, a senior NATO official in Washington said.
</P>
<P>
Reporters in Belgrade heard air raid sirens and a heavy impact.
Shortly thereafter, the senior NATO official confirmed the new
assault using Tomahawk cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
The use of Tomahawk missiles in the fourth consecutive day of
strikes on Yugoslavia signals that NATO remains wary of
Yugoslavia's air defense network.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a senior U.S. defense official said Saturday's
strikes, expected to intensify after dark in Yugoslavia, would
shift to some extent toward targets in the Kosovo province, where
Serb forces have been conducting "operations against the ethnic
Albanian population."
</P>
<P>
NATO warplanes and cruise missiles would continue to hammer
away at Serb air defense radars and batteries, which have become
more active as the air campaign wears on, the official said.
</P>
<P>
And fighter planes specializing in air-to-air combat will
remain on alert for Serb fighters. Five of Yugoslavia's 15 highly
capable MiG-29 fighters have been shot down by NATO aircraft so
far, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The NATO raids that began Wednesday are intended to force
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to agree to a peace deal in
Kosovo already accepted by the province's ethnic Albanian
majority.
</P>
<P>
Friday's overnight bombing was the most intense action around
Belgrade since the airstrikes began Wednesday. There were
conflicting reports of leaks of toxic substances because of bomb
damage.
</P>
<P>
The Tanjug official state news agency reported a radio and
television transmitter was hit by NATO fire near Loznica, 110
kilometers southwest of Belgrade, before dawn. It also reported
missiles hitting Prizren, Kosovo's second-largest city, while
independent media said missiles also hit Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
Serbian TV reported four NATO planes had been shot down and two
pilots captured, but NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said at the
Brussels NATO briefing Saturday all aircraft returned safely to
their bases for the third straight night.

<HEADLINE> Romanian Justice Minister to Run Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Justice Minister
Valeriu Stoica was named Saturday to run the government for the
week ending April 2 after Prime Minister Radu Vasile was
hospitalized for a mild heart attack.
</P>
<P>
Valeriu Stoica is also one of the two state ministers (deputy
prime ministers) in the government.
</P>
<P>
According to Adriana Saftoiu, spokeswoman for the government,
the decision was made personally by Prime Minister Radu Vasile
after consultations with President Emil Constantinescu.
</P>
<P>
After falling ill Friday at government headquarters with a
"prolonged angina crisis," Radu Vasile was admitted late in the
evening at Elias Hospital in Bucharest. Doctors said the prime
minister's health condition is good at present.
</P>
<P>
"I am angry with my friends, the doctors, holding me in
hospital, to watch the match of our national squad on TV, instead
of letting me go to the stadium," complained Radu Vasile, a
well-known soccer fan. "However, I wish success to Romania's
national team," he added.
</P>
<P>
A commission was established under an order by the health
minister to supervise the health condition of the prime minister.
The doctors did not say how long the prime minister would have to
stay in hospital.
</P>
<P>
The mandate of Valeriu Stoica will be continued by Victor
Babiuc, state minister and concurrently defense minister, in case
that the prime minister is not restored to health on April 2.

President Jiang, accompanied by President Dreifuss, reviewed
the Swiss army after the national anthems were played.
</P>
<P>
This has been the first visit by a Chinese head of state to
Switzerland. President Jiang went on with his tour to Austria,

<P>
ROME, March 27 (Xinhua) -- There has been no signal of any sort
from Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, and it is too soon for
a resumption of talks on Kosovo as long as the NATO bombing is
still underway, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It remains to be seen if there is "any re-thinking, any
willingness" to resume negotiations, he told the national
newspaper Corriere della Sera.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, possible interlocutors for such talks are already
standing by, and they are "those who worked during the
negotiations that took place at Rambouillet in France, that is,
the members of the Contact Group," Dini said.
</P>
<P>
However, it is "premature" to speak of Contact Group talks
"until the bombardments achieve their goal which is to strike at
the Yugoslav military apparatus and destroy Belgrade's war
potential," Dini added.

<HEADLINE> Italy Ready to Send Boats for War Refugees in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Italy is ready to send boats across
the Adriatic Sea to pick up Kosovo war refugees, Italian Interior
Minister Rosa Russo Jervolino said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Italy's current policy is to provide on-the-spot support to
refugees as they arrive in northern Macedonia, the preferred
escape route, and if large numbers should head for Albanian ports
in search of a passage to Italy, the government will not abandon
them, Jervolino said.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Italian government declared a state of emergency
ahead of the expected arrival of refugees from Kosovo in the wake
of NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
Italy's Civil Protection department has said that facilities
will soon be ready to provide shelter to 25,000 refugees from the
war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Jervolino also admitted that the influx of war victims would
put considerable strain on the country, especially the
southeastern region of Puglia which looks Yugoslavia across the
Adriatic, where most are expected to arrive.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reported
Thursday night that almost 5,000 people have been driven from
their homes since NATO began its strikes on Yugoslavia on March
24.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Macedonian authorities estimate that there are now
about 20,000 Kosovars taking refuge in their territory.

VIENNA, Austria, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang
Zemin arrived in the Austrian capital of Vienna Saturday
evening for a state visit at the invitation of Austrian President
Thomas Klestil.
</P>
<P>
This is the first visit by a Chinese head of state to Austria,
which is also the third and last leg of President Jiang's Europe
tour after Italy and Switzerland. Klestil visited China in 1995.
</P>
<P>
At eight o'clock local time, the special plane, which President

</P>
<P>
In a written statement delivered at the airport, President
Jiang said that he sent cordial greetings and best wishes to the
Austrian people on behalf of the Chinese people at his first step
on the beautiful land of Austria.
</P>
<P>
China puts great emphasis on its relationship with Austria,
Jiang said. The exchange of friendly visits between the two
peoples has been with a long history although the two countries
are far away from each other geographically.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Jiang said, there has been a strong momentum
for the development of the Sino-Austrian relations. The visits
between the two peoples have increased. There have been fruitful
achievements in trade and economic cooperation and cultural and
scientific exchanges.
</P>
<P>
It is in the interest and the mutual wish of the two peoples to
further strengthen the cooperation between China and Austria in
all fields on the current basis, the Chinese president said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed the hope that his visit would help increase the
mutual understanding and friendship between China and Austria and
the two peoples and further expand the bilateral cooperation.

KAMPALA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
Saturday condemned the murder of Prince Happy Kijanangoma who was
gunned down in cold blood in the western town of Fort Portal
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
In a message of condolence to His HIghness Oyo Nyimba Iguru of
Tooro kingdom, the president extended his deepest condolences to
the king, the entire royal family and all the people of Tooro on
this tragic loss, a press release issued Saturday by the
President's Office said.
</P>
<P>
Museveni condemned the murder of the prince as a "brutal and
primitive act" and called on the police to follow up the case to
its conclusion and bring the culprits to book.
</P>
<P>
The prince was shot dead by one unidentified gunman who had
been trailing the prince for a long time. The assailant said to be
wearing a white shirt and black trousers got out of a salon car
and shot at the prince at a bar.
</P>
<P>
The prince was struck by 12 bullets in the back. Security
officers said the killing was planned. Just before the attack,
power was cut off in the town. Investigation is still under way as
to why the blackout occurred.
</P>
<P>
Tooro is located in western Uganda. It's one of the few feudal
kingdoms the Ugandan government maintained in the country. Since
republicanism was introduced in the country in 1967, kingdoms have
maintained its institutional unity, but not with the former
administrative powers.

JOHANNESBURG, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Serbs staged a
protest against NATO air strikes on their country at the British
consulate-general in Johannesburg Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
Angry protesters burned flags of the United States, Britain,
France and Albania, as well as portraits of U.S. President Bill

</P>
<P>
People held candle lights, whistled, and shouted repeatedly
"Kosovo je (is) Serbia."

Many people wore black bands at the chest as a sign of mourning
for those who were killed in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
NATO troops were compared to Nazis. "Mr Stalin, you must be
ready; Hitler has come," one placard read.
</P>
<P>
Western media were also attacked. "CNN is pushing World War
III", "CNN stop lying" and "CNN, BBC Nazi media" were among the
slogans.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky
did not escape the scrutiny of the protesters.

"(British Prime Minster Tony) Blair and NATO Clinton's helping
hand for latest 'blow job'," one placard said.
</P>
<P>
"Kosovo is NOT available, try Monica," a placard held by a

serious crimes, and take tougher stance toward corruption within
and outside its party.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls show that the ANC is likely to win majority in
South Africa's second democratic election, scheduled for June 2.
The party is far and away the leader of the polls, with a margin
of more than 40 percentage points between it and its closest
rival.
</P>
<P>
The ANC's manifesto promised to introduce tougher gun controls
and reduce the number of guns in circulation.
</P>
<P>
"We will enforce strict measures, without fear or favor, to
root out corruption in the public and private sectors, in our own
organization, and in society as a whole," said Mbeki, the
country's deputy president who is expected to succeed President
Nelson Mandela after the election.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has one of the world's worst rates in murder and
rape.
</P>
<P>
The ANC promised to improve the government's efficiency and to
bring about a better life for the previously disadvantaged.
</P>
<P>
The party said it would speed up the subsidy programs, improve
social security management and public transport system, and
introduce more health care programs.
</P>
<P>
On the economy, Mbeki said the ANC was committed to achieve
growth with equity by speeding up job creation and developing
skills training.

<HEADLINE> NATO Report: Phase Two of Military Operation to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 27 (Xinhua) -- NATO is very close to moving into
Phase Two of its military action against Yugoslavia and will
center air strikes against Serb forces directly involved in the
repression of Kosovo, according to Italian press reports quoting
NATO sources.
</P>
<P>
The decision to move into the second phase could be made during
Saturday's meeting of ambassadors from the 19-nation Atlantic
alliance, the NATO sources said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The request to move into the next phase was said to have been
made directly by the allied commander, General Wesly Clark, to
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana.
</P>
<P>
Phase One, still in progress, was focused on knocking out air
defenses and Belgrade's centers for command, control and logistics
in order to make low altitude strikes safer.
</P>
<P>
Phase Two will be focused on lower altitude attacks which would
be aimed at taking out Serb tanks and heavy equipment.
</P>
<P>
NATO spokesman Jamie Shea said in Brussels Saturday that the
shooting down of two Yugoslav Mig-29 fighters in Macedonia was "a
clear indication" of how NATO would respond if Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic attempted any aggression towards neighboring
countries.

<HEADLINE> UN Panel Recommends Continuing Monitoring, Inspection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 28 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations panel, in
charge of reviewing Iraq's disarmament record, had recommended
that the United Nations need to continue to monitor, inspect and
investigate Iraq's weapons program, The New York Times Reported
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The panel, set up in accordance with the January 30 note by the
United Nations Security Council, aims to make recommendations on
how to reestablish an effective disarmament/ongoing monitoring and
verification regime in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
According to The New York Times, the report, which the panel is
expected to present to the Council and the U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Sunday or Monday, says the United Nations Special
Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency had been
effective in uncovering and destroying many elements of Iraq's
proscribed weapons program in accordance with the mandate
provided by the Council.
</P>
<P>
The report recommends that the Council consider some changes in
the nature and structure of the inspectors' group and the
commission that oversees its activities, for example, the
commission meet four times every year instead of twice and it more
closely monitor the inspectors' activities.
</P>
<P>
The report said effective inspection depends on full and free
access to suspect sites and it stresses that international
inspectors must be given unimpeded access to all such sites,
including those of military facilities.
</P>
<P>
The report also said information collected during inspections
should be assessed strictly on the basis of its credibility and
relevance to the mandate, and exchanges information between the
monitoring group and various governments should be "one-way only".
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has been sharply divided on its policy
towards Iraq after the U.S.-led military air strikes against Iraq
last December.

WASHINGTON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- A U.S. F-117A stealth fighter went down over Yugoslavia on
Saturday as NATO warplanes again pummeled the country with bombs
and missiles. The pilot was rescued by U.S. forces hours later and
flown to safety.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. and its allies face the limits of air power. Arnold
Kanter, former undersecretary of state for President George Bush,
said Clinton's overwhelming preference to rely on air power, as
well as the dread of casualties that drives it, leads to "a
doctrine of immaculate coercion."
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- NATO officials in Brussels announced on Sunday that allied
fighter-bombers were shifting to a second phase to intensify
attacks on the Yugoslav tanks, troops and artillery that are
gouging an offensive through Kosovo. But senior Clinton
administration officials challenged that claim, accusing NATO
diplomats of raising expectations that allied fighter-bombers
might not be able to deliver -- right away or ever.
</P>
<P>
-- Residents of Belgrade said that large explosions had
occurred in the city before air raid sirens sounded, giving
credence to NATO assertions that Yugoslavia's integrated air
defense system has been damaged, even around the capital.

MOSCOW, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The shootings on the U.S. embassy
in Moscow were condemned Sunday by an aide of Russian President
Boris Yeltsin who labeled the incidents as "an anti-national act
undermining state-to-state relations."
</P>

Yeltsin's press secretary Dmitri Yakushkin said the attacks
against the U.S. embassy earlier in the day were not conducive to
the efforts being made by Russia to resolve the Yugoslavia crisis.

Speaking with a Moscow television station, Yakushkin said
Yeltsin had discussed the incidents with Interior Minister Sergei
Stepashin, adding that such incidents should be prevented from
reoccurring.
</P>

The Russian police have tightened security around the U.S.
embassy, which was attacked by submachine gun and grenade
launchers in two separate incidents. No one was hurt in these
incidents.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Government Condoles Over Aris' Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar government sent a message
of condolences Sunday over the death of Michael Aris, husband of
Aung San Suu Kyi who is general secretary of the National League
for Democracy.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Myanmar is deeply saddened to hear of Mr.
Michael Aris' demise and sends its sincerest condolences and
sympathy to the bereaved family in this time of grief," an
official Information Sheet said Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
"While the government is assisting Ms. Suu Kyi in enabling her
to carry out her husband's funeral and religious rites in Yangon,
the government continues its offer and stands ready in providing
Ms. Suu Kyi with all possible assistance if she desires traveling
to England to attend the funeral rites and family affairs at this
time of family bereavement," it stated.
</P>
<P>
Aris died of prostate cancer on Saturday in Oxford, Britain.
</P>
<P>
Before his death, Aris had requested visa to Myanmar to see his
wife in Yangon which the government then said it was reviewing.
The government pointed out that it would be a difficult trip for
him on account of his health condition and had not granted him the
visa until his death.
</P>
<P>
Aung San Suu Kyi issued a statement here Saturday, expressing
thanks to all those around the world who supported her husband
during his illness and gave her and her family love and sympathy.
</P>
<P>
Aung San Suu Kyi had also rejected earlier Myanmar government's
offer to allow her to leave the country and join her then dying
husband in England.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that once Aung San Suu Kyi leaves
Myanmar, there is rare chance for her to return to the country.
</P>
<P>
Aung San Suu Kyi was married to Aris, a British citizen, in
January 1972 in England and they have two sons. She returned to
Myanmar to see her then dying mother, Daw Khin Kyi, former Myanmar
ambassador to India, in 1988 when the country was in a political
and economic crisis and has since then resided in the country.
</P>
<P>
She was put under house arrest by the Myanmar authorities from
July 20, 1989, to July 10, 1995, for allegedly endangering the
state since she then won popular support politically in the
country.

<HEADLINE> China Spends Big Money Saving Plateau Lake From Pollution (1) </HEADLINE>

KUNMING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has spent
3.5 billion yuan (about 400 million US dollars) and will invest
some eight billion more in the next decade to clean up a seriously
polluted lake in the southwestern province of Yunnan, a local
official said here today.
</P>

"Over the past eight years, various projects to clean up
Dianchi Lake have cost the country 3.5 billion yuan, while new
projects with a total investment of over two billion yuan are
still under construction," said Li Jiating, governor of Yunnan
Province. Located on a high plateau and covering 306 square
kilometers, Dianchi, which literally means "the pond of Yunnan,"
is China's sixth largest freshwater lake. The lake plays a vital
role in balancing the ecological environment in Kunming, capital
of Yunnan and venue of the upcoming '99 World Horticulture
Exposition.

However, the lake's water has become murky because of the great
amount of industrial and domestic waste discharged into it over
the past 20 years, and fast-increasing algae, whose growth is
fueled by the chemicals and warm waters from sewage and factories,
is also clogging it up.
</P>
<P>
A report from the local environmental monitoring department
shows that each year as much as 200 million tons of waste-water is
discharged into Dianchi and that water in the worst-polluted part
of the lake is even unsuited for farmland irrigation.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the Chinese government listed Dianchi Lake as one of
the key projects to be tackled in the "three rivers and three
lakes" project, which also covers Liaohe, Huaihe and Haihe rivers
and Taihu and Chaohu lakes.

The director also revealed that China and Japan recently signed
an agreement, according to which both countries will invest more
than three billion yuan to build a reservoir on the northern
outskirts of Kunming which will inject 30,000 tons of clean water
into the lake each year.
</P>
<P>
With the horticulture exposition around the corner,
environmental protection departments in Yunnan also ordered the
253 industrial enterprises that release pollutants into Dianchi to
meet discharge standards before May 1. Those failing to do so will
be closed immediately, said Wu.
</P>
<P>
"Now I can see fish in the lake again," said Zhang Lao'er, who
lives by the lake and makes a living by rowing a tourist boat. "As
the water gets increasingly clean and no longer smells, my
business will undoubtedly become better and better."
</P>
<P>
However, according to Provincial Governor Li, completely
restoring a healthy ecological environment to Dianchi remains an
arduous task.
</P>
<P>
"A major headache is the algae in the lake water, which
currently we can only remove with machines," he said. "We hope to
develop some biological technology to solve this problem, and
we're looking forward to some international assistance."

"When the Dianchi cleanup project was initiated in 1992, the
government only planned to invest three billion yuan in the 18-
year period from 1993 to 2010. Now the planned investment has been
expanded to 11.7 billion yuan," said the governor.
</P>
<P>
The investment increase has helped speed up the cleanup
endeavor, thus creating a better ecological environment for the
horticulture exposition which will open on May 1, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu Xiaoqing, director of the Yunnan Provincial
Environmental Protection Bureau, the cleanup project has achieved
remarkable success, with pollutant discharges into Dianchi
effectively controlled and water quality gradually improving.
</P>
<P>
Four sewage treatment plants have been built in Kunming, which
are able to purify some 60 percent of the city's waste water, said
Wu. Two more plants capable of handling 200,000 tons of sewage a
day are being built, and will raise the city's sewage disposal
rate to 80 percent once they're completed.
</P>
<P>
Last October, the Kunming city government also banned the sale
and use of detergent containing phosphorus, Wu added.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, some 66,000 hectares of trees have been planted
around Dianchi, raising the forest coverage in the lake area to 40.
6 percent from 15.5 percent in 1987, and effectively reducing soil
erosion.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini has ruled out an immediate end to NATO air strikes on
Yugoslavia's military facilities and threatened speeding up NATO
military attacks.
</P>
<P>
Dini was quoted as saying by the daily La Repubblica on Sunday
that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) would probably
step up its action starting last Wednesday to push for a
compromise from Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"I think that NATO action will intensify in the next few hours
and days in order to make it definitive. We must achieve the
objective of destroying Yugoslavia's military capabilities that we
set ourselves when we undertook this action," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Dini said Italy still wishes for peaceful negotiations
with Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic, confirming that his
country, through its embassy in the Yugoslavian capital, and some
other countries are maintaining contacts with Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The Italian embassy remained open and ready to act as a channel
for mediation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Italian parliament passed a motion Friday demanding that
the government request an end to the NATO air strikes as soon as
possible and that it support all efforts to end the crisis through
diplomatic means.
</P>
<P>
Dini denied that Italy has any immediate plans to send
diplomatic missions to Belgrade.

<P>
MOSCOW, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. embassy in Moscow was
attacked by gunfire and grenade launchers Sunday in two separate
incidents, the Russian Interior Ministry and witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
At 13:45 local time (0945 GMT), a white jeep driving by the
embassy was seen firing at the compound, the Interior Ministry's
local bureau in Moscow said. Witnesses said two to three people
were seen in the jeep.
</P>
<P>
The jeep was later abandoned and found by police who acted
swiftly to pursue the gunmen, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
An official of the U.S. embassy confirmed the shooting incident
but did not say what weapons were used by the attackers, Itar-Tass
news agency reported. According to the official, no one were hurt
in the attack.
</P>
<P>
Less than two hours later, witnesses said, a young man raked
the U.S. embassy building with submachine gun after having failed
to launch two grenade launchers at the building. The shooting left
11 holes in the building, they said.
</P>
<P>
The two incidents occurred as anti-American mood is surging
among the Russians. After the attacks, more than 1,000
Muscovites held rallies around the U.S. embassy in protest against
NATO's military intervention in Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Claims Foiling Eritrea's Attempts to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian government
Spokesperson Selome Taddesse announced here Sunday that the
Ethiopian defense forces have foiled repeated attempts by the
Eritrean forces to regain the disputed Badme, a
390-square-kilometer scrubby border land.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the office of Ethiopian government
spokesperson said that the Eritrean forces incurred "enormous
losses" in their attempts to recapture Badme as their repeated
offensives between March 17 and 26 were decisively crushed.
</P>
<P>
"During the engagement near the Mereb River, over 13,700 enemy
soldiers were killed, wounded or captured, 15 tanks were destroyed
and four others were captured, two batteries of long range heavy
artillery were destroyed and over 30 trucks were destroyed," said
the statement.
</P>
<P>
This is the first announcement made by the Ethiopian side on
the result of fighting near Mereb River since March 17.
</P>
<P>
The disputed Badme area was taken back by Ethiopian forces
after the "Operation Sunset" launched from February 23 to 26.
</P>
<P>
The Badme area was occupied by the Eritrean forces in May 1998
and the framework agreement of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) called for the withdrawal of Eritrean troops from the
disputed Badme area and resuming the Ethiopians civil
administration there, according to the Ethiopian side.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the office of Ethiopian government spokesperson also
 announced that between March 13 to 16, the Ethiopian forces in
the engagement at the Zalambessa-Egela front killed and wounded
9,000 Eritrean soldiers, destroyed 36 tanks and demolished three
cannon batteries.
</P>
<P>
However, the Eritrean side claimed to have inflicted heavy
defeat on the Ethiopians killing thousands of soldiers and
destroying over 50 tanks, according to an earlier announcement
from Asmara.

(IMF) has approved on the three-year loan arrangement amounting to
349 million U.S. dollars for Zambia to support the government's
1999-2001 economic and financial program.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Times of Zambia quoted the IMF as saying in a statement
released Friday "the government's 1999 program aims at restoring
macro- economic stability and promoting sustainable growth by
reducing inflation, strengthening the external position and
emphasizing the critical role of the private sector."
</P>
<P>
The loan to Zambia would be available in six installments,
provided the economy met targets agreed with the IMF. The first
payouts will be made on March 31, the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
The international financial institution said that it expected
Zambia to record four percent growth in 1999, rising to 4.5
percent in 2000 and five percent in 2001. Inflation would fall to
 20.5 percent this year and 11.3 percent in 2000 from 23.1 percent
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's gross domestic product (GDP) fell two percent last
year amid poor weather conditions, lower copper prices and a steep
fall in domestic revenues. The local currency, kwacha, fell 39
percent and reserves tumbled to 44 million dollars at the end of
1998, enough to fund just two weeks of imports.
</P>
<P>
The IMF gave no forecasts for the kwacha's future exchange, but
it said gross reserves should rise to 165 million dollars by the
end of this year and to 306 million dollars by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the program underpinning the loan envisaged
further privatization in the key mining sector and elsewhere.

<HEADLINE> Two Killed in Fighting in Somali Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 28 (Xinhua) -- At least two people were killed
and more than nine others were wounded Sunday afternoon when
unidentified gunmen ambushed a Toyota pick-up passing through the
junction of Bakara market in Somali capital.
</P>
<P>
The eyewitnesses said about a dozen gunmen on board the Toyota
pick-up had also returned fire and passed through a group of
gunmen before again falling into another ambush just about 100
meters away.
</P>
<P>
Heavy exchange of fire between the two sides has terrified the
business community of Bakara market, forcing many of them
especially those in the animal market to close down their
business.
</P>
<P>
The wounded in the ambush include three officials supporting
faction leader Hussein Mohamed Aidid. Mohamud Mohamed Ali better
known as Siganeh, the chief commander of Hussein Aidid's
militiamen, was among the wounded who was hit by two bullets, one
in the kidney and another in the leg. The wounded also include
Sharrif Ali Dhabaney, the especial military advisor of Hussein
Aidid, and Abdullahi Mire Alala who was only a few days ago
nominated as the chief of operations.
</P>
<P>
The wounded also included a seven-year-old boy who was hit by a
bullet in the mouth and nose crushing all his teeth, the chin and
cheeks.
</P>
<P>
The number of people being killed, wounded or robbed in the
chaotic Somali capital has since last month been increasing.

<HEADLINE> NATO Missiles Hit Airports Near Belgrade, Capital Calm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By Wu Zhiqiang
</P>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) continued its air raids on Yugoslavia Sunday
but the streets of Belgrade appeared calm as many were buoyed by
the downing of a NATO F-117 stealth bomber.
</P>
<P>
The Batajnica military airport outside Belgrade was hit again
at around 08:00 a.m. local time (0700 GMT) in the fifth straight
day of NATO's bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
Two missiles fell near the capital's civilian airport at Surcin,
the Tanjug news agency reported, citing witness accounts.
</P>
<P>
A third missile landed on the area of Jakovo, just west of
Belgrade across the Sava River.
</P>
<P>
Despite the continued air campaign, Belgraders, buoyed by the
downing of a U.S. F-117 stealth bomber, were going about their
business almost as usual.
</P>
<P>
At an open-air market near Generala Khanrica street, peddlers
were selling fruits, vegetables, meat and dairy products, but
cabbages were no longer available as exports from neighboring
Macedonia were halted by the NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
Air-raid sirens sounded at 07:00 a.m. (0600 GMT) but none of
the customers were deterred from coming out.
</P>
<P>
"Afraid of the bombs? Hell, no, not a bit," said Velizer
Drebjrachebich, a retired colonel.
</P>
<P>
"The missiles are nothing, just like heads of garlic thrown
into water," the 75-year-old World War Two veteran said, picking
one from the stall and smashed it on the ground.
</P>
<P>
"We're really great. We shot down the F-117 yesterday. We made
it!" Drebjrachebich said. "We are the first to shot down one.
Nobody could do it before."
</P>
<P>
"We're afraid of nobody because we are defending ourselves, our
freedom and independence," the veteran guerrilla said. He fought
Nazi Germany when he was 16.
</P>
<P>
At the nearby "Star" supermarket, only several customers were
sifting through the shelves.
</P>
<P>
"The Americans are robbers," said cashier Draginia, 45, whose
son is serving in the Army.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanovic, the 49-year-old manager, said there was no problem
with supply and a truck will bring in more goods to his store on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Some taxis could be seen running in the streets as authorities
now allow every cab to have a daily ration of 10 liters, rather
than none at all as was the case in the previous days.

<HEADLINE> China's "Spring City" Saving its Springs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The city of Jinan, dubbed "Spring
City" in east China's Shandong Province, has recently started
construction of two large reservoirs on the outskirts of town in a
bid to revitalize its 100-plus natural springs.
</P>
<P>
The reservoirs, scheduled for completion in four years, are
expected to help cut underground water use in the city by 80
percent.
</P>
<P>
"By slashing the exploitation of underground water, we'll
assure that spring water gushes continuously once again," Mayor
Xie Yutang said.
</P>
<P>
Jinan boasts more than 160 springs attracting many visitors,
and the city has been known for them for over 2,000 years.
</P>
<P>
However, because of dry weather and excessive exploitation of
underground water, most of these springs stopped flowing in the
1970s, and water only comes from some of them between August and
February.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the 1990s, the local government has
taken a series of measures to solve this problem, including
limiting the consumption of underground water.
</P>
<P>
The city has also launched a massive campaign to clear the
springs and the Daming Lake into which the springs flow, and all
six polluters who had been discharging wastewater into the lake
have been closed down.

<HEADLINE> Wage Talks Resume in Israel Amid Nationwide Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from Israel's
labor federation, or Histadrut, and the Treasury resumed talks on
the wage dispute Sunday as some 400,000 employees in the public
sector renewed a nationwide strike suspended over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
At a weekly cabinet meeting, Finance Minister Meir Sheetrit
called on the Histadrut to work with the government for a fair
wage plan which will include taxing adjustment and budget cuts,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Government departments, hospitals, post offices and some
state-run companies continued to close or open in a limited
schedule. Flight departures at the Ben-Gurion International
Airport were delayed in the morning due to sanctions by customs
officers. Bank employees joined the strike Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet meeting authorized local authorities to issue
back-to-work orders to sanitation workers to clean up the garbage
piled up on the streets.
</P>
<P>
During talks between the two sides Saturday night, the
Histadrut and the Treasury were still far apart on their
positions over the wage dispute which triggered the nationwide
strike last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Histadrut has demanded a salary hike of 14 percent for 1998
and 1999 to offset the wage erosion by inflation, which stood at
8.6 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
But the Finance Ministry insisted that it would not go higher
than a 3.85 percent increase, which it said is enough to maintain
the natural growth of wages.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the strike has cost the economy 130 million
shekels (about 32.5 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has assailed the Histadrut
of "robbing the public coffers on the eve of elections."
</P>
<P>
Histadrut Chairman Amir Perez retorted that the government is
responsible for the strike, calling on Netanyahu to "shake off
political considerations and intervene to end the strike."
</P>
<P>
Labor Party leader Ehud Barak, a major rival of Netanyahu for
premiership in the May 17 elections, said the strike was another
sign that the Likud government "is stuck in every possible field."

<HEADLINE> Britain Says Sending Four More Harrier Jets to Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 28 (Xinhua) - Britain announced on Sunday that it
was sending four more Harrier jump jets to join in the NATO
airstrike forces bombing Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary George Robertson said at a news conference
Britain was also sending eight other warplanes to join stepped up
air operations in the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said Britain had also agreed to a United States request to
base more B-52 bombers at British bases.
</P>
<P>
The Harrier GR7s, which can take off vertically, are regarded
as the best bombers in British Royal Air Force. There are already
eight British Harriers involved in the NATO force bombing
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Britain admitted that none of its Harrier
warplanes that played part in the first round of strikes on
Yugoslavia had hit their designated targets in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the Defense Staff Charles Guthrie told a Thursday news
conference that six British ground-attack Harrier jets armed with
laser-guided bombs had been sent to attack an ammunition bunker
outside the Kosovo regional capital Pristina on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
" Our Harriers had difficulty in seeing and maintaining lock on
their targets....Bombs from our first aircraft lost lock once they
were in flight and fell short of the target on open ground. As a
result, the following Harriers aborted their attack and returned
to base with their weapons," said Guthrie.

<HEADLINE> Measles Hits Refugee Camp in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- A measles outbreak has hit Kaputa
transit refugee camp in Northern Province of Zambia with five
confirmed cases reported in the last 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, cholera has also broken out in Nsumbu, a nearby post
in the area, Sunday Times of Zambia newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
A joint emergency vaccination exercise of 2,484 children under
five years by United Nations International Children's Emergency
Fund (UNICEF) and the World Health Organization (WHO) and the
Zambian government has been initiated to contain the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia Red Cross Society (ZRCS) has sent a team of health
experts with emergency cholera kits to help control the cholera
outbreak. Ten unconfirmed cases of cholera have been reported.
</P>
<P>
ZRCS acting general secretary, Kelvin Chiposwa, who confirmed
the development said in an interview in Lusaka on Saturday that
he was concerned that cholera might spread into the refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
Chiposwa said with Pweto, a town of about 200,000 people across
the border in the Democratic Republic of Congo, coming under
increased rebel attack, the Red Cross anticipated more refugees
to cross the border.
</P>
<P>
According to latest statistics, a total of 15,294 Congolese
refugees have been settled in the transit camp. More than 5,000
Congolese nationals were living amongst Zambians but they
registered with refugee authorities when they ran out of food,

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Increase Small Holder Homestead Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
said Saturday afternoon that the government should do more to
improve the incomes of small holder farms.
</P>
<P>
Museveni made the pledge when addressing a public rally in the
eastern district of Busia, a press release from the President's
Office said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The president acknowledged that despite significant growth in
the economy, homestead incomes for small holder farms have
remained low.
</P>
<P>
This low income was attributed to lack of funds for
development. As a move to increase farmers' incomes in the coming
years, the government will allocate more funds to the farmers
there, making sure that the funds will benefit all people in the
community.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said that the government has managed to ensure
continuous peace in the country for over a decade, resulting in
significant growth in the economy, especially in agriculture and
infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Footballers Paid Allowances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Zambian government paid the Under-
20 national team all the outstanding allowances owed by the
finance-strapped Football Association of Zambia (FAZ), local
newspaper reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sunday Mail quoted Assistant Press Liaison Officer in the
Sports Ministry, Boniface Mbuzi, as saying that the government is
aware that the Under-20 soccer players were owed allowances hence
the need for the government to pay them.
</P>
<P>
But some players said they have not been paid as much as
promised.
</P>
<P>
Some claimed they have received two million kwacha (less than 1,
000 U.S. dollars) but Sports Ministry sources said all the players
received three million kwacha (over 1,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Ten days ago the government said it would settle the allowances
owed by FAZ to the members of the Zambia under-20 soccer team
going to the World Youth Cup finals to be held in Nigeria next
month.
</P>
<P>
Sport Minister William Harrington said on March 18 that the
money would be paid directly to the players to keep morale high
and each of them would get 4.5 million kwacha (about 2,000 U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The money is for camping allowances going back to November of
last year and bonuses for qualifying for the World Cup. This will
be Zambia's first ever appearance in a world soccer championship,
according to another newspaper, Times of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The FAZ has been going through financial difficulties since the
government withdrew support to show its displeasure with the
association's national executive led by Teddy Mulonga.
</P>
<P>
Following Zambia's poor performance at the Africa Cup finals in
Burkina Faso in February of 1998, the FAZ executive was removed in
April of 1998 on the charge of misapplication of more than 500
million kwacha (over 200,000 U.S. dollars) the government released
for the campaign.
</P>
<P>
FIFA, reacting to what it saw as government interference in the
running of soccer, was on the verge of banning Zambia from
international football activities when the government reluctantly
restored in office the FAZ executive led by Mulonga.
</P>
<P>
The government allowed in September in 1998 Mulonga and his
team back in office but it imposed a financial squeeze on the
association in a bid to force the current executive out.
</P>
<P>
The estrangement of the FAZ executive has cast a shadow on the
future of Zambian football given the fact the association is
dependent on the government financial support to fulfill its
various international engagements.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday government spokesman Newstead Zambia said that
the government is waiting for a new FAZ executive to be elected
before it could once again begin to provide the financial, moral
and logistical support it withdrew from the FAZ last year.

<HEADLINE> February Manufacturing Output Increases In Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Manufacturing output rose by
2.8 percent on year-on-year basis in February in Singapore,
continuing to grow since gyrating from negative to positive
territory in December last year, the Economic Development Board
(EDB) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Cumulative growth for the first two months of 1999 was 6.1
percent compared to the same period in 1998, EDB added.
</P>
<P>
Output in the electronics cluster grew 3.1 percent over February
1998 with cumulative growth for the first two months of 1999
reached 13.8 percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
EDB attributed the high growth to the increase in production of
cellular hand phone in the telecommunication equipment segment as
well as disk drives, computer peripherals, PCBAs, semiconductors
in the computer segment for the January-February period compared
to that in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The chemicals cluster saw a hefty growth of 28.3 percent in last

manufacturing sector, running up 149.1 percent and 63.9 percent in
February and the first two months of 1999 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The petrochemicals industry also witnessed a 6.2 percent hike in
February and 9.6 percent growth in the first two months on a
year-on-year basis.
</P>
<P>
The petroleum industry increased by 3.5 percent over February
last year but sank 0.8 percent in the cumulative output for the
first two months from the level produced in the same period of
1998.
</P>
<P>
Output of engineering cluster in February of 1999 declined by
12.5 percent from February of the previous year, leading to a
cumulative decline of 7.1 percent in the first two months of 1999
compared to the same period in 1998 .
</P>
<P>
The decline cut across all the three major sub-clusters on
year-on-year basis with the precision engineering producing 16.7
less , the process engineering segment falling by 20.8 percent and
the transport engineering segment dipping by 4.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Softens Tone over Israeli Non-Implementation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States appeared to
have accepted the position of Israel that it need not resume
military pullout from the West Bank until the Palestinians meet
their obligations under the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
This is a sharp contrast to the former U.S. stance, which
blamed Israel for freezing the Wye agreement signed last October
in Washington and agreed that the Palestinians had done their part
of the deal.
</P>
<P>
But Washington expects Israel to fulfill other obligations,
such as releasing the Palestinian prisoners, without further
Palestinian actions.
</P>
<P>
Quoting a senior U.S. official who asked not to be named, the
local Ha'aretz daily reported on Sunday that the shift of
U.S. stance was the result of contacts in the last several weeks
between Israel's top negotiator Yitzhak Molcho and special
U.S. Mideast peace coordinator Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
Washington accepted such an Israeli position because Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been pressing for a
U.S. statement to ease Israel's diplomatic isolation that deepened
since its mid-December halt of the implementation of the Wye
accord, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Wye peace deal asks Israel to withdraw its troops from
another 13.1 percent of the West Bank in three stages in 12 weeks.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official told Ha'aretz that "the Israeli position
throughout the negotiations has consistently been that the
redeployment from the West Bank should only sequentially follow
Palestinian steps each of the three phases and not occur in
parallel to them."
</P>
<P>
"The United States does not oppose this Israeli position and
therefore a second redeployment is not required at this
point...yet land is not only element of Wye," he argued.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official said however it is inaccurate to say, as the
Israeli government does, that Israel will only act when the
Palestinians do everything first.
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that the Palestinians have adhered to at least
some of their commitments, including revoking their charter, so
Israel should implement those commitments immediately, such as
releasing prisoners," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the Wye deal, Israel was to release 250 Palestinian
prisoners at each of the three phases, but it has only released
the first third, most of whom were common criminals, not political
prisoners as required.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official also disputed the Israel view that
Palestinian political prisoners have been let out of prison.
</P>
<P>
The Central Intelligence Agency, which the Wye installed in
Gaza as an official observer, said that none of 15 Palestinian
political prisoners who were on the list prepared at Wye have
been released as Israel contends, the official said, adding that
60 others were let go, but they were not on the Wye list.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Enjoys Advantage in Expanding Exports of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has better chances to
expand exports of agricultural products which have higher
competitive advantage than that of many other countries, the
Commerce Ministry said in a statement received Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Thai agricultural products will be
beneficial under an agreement on agricultural trade liberalization
of the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Thai farm products averagely have the Revealed Competitive
Advantage (RCA) index of over one point, which means that the
country's agricultural products have high potential to penetrate
international markets, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
This is because Thailand has abundant agricultural resources
that can fundamentally and sustainably serve the full-circle of
agro-industries in the economy with lower costs of production,
according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
The competitive advantage with higher RCA would also ensure
that Thailand would have high potential to expand the production
and exports of its farm products when the WTO's agricultural trade
liberalization accord takes effects, while those of countries with
lower RCA would become importers to enjoy lower prices with more
supplies, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Thai agricultural products can be classified into three major
categories. They are primary products: rice, rubber, tapioca,
tobacco, fruits and vegetables, and frozen chicken, processed
products; sugar, rubber products, rice products, and canned food;
and products relying on imported raw materials: animal food and
alcoholic beverages, namely whisky, wine and beer.
</P>
<P>
Exports of Thai agricultural products have steadily increased
more than three times over the past decade, from 96.03 billion
baht (2.6 billion U.S. dollars) in 1987 to 304.49 billion baht
(8.2 billion dollars) in 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, Thailand, however, still has to
improve its cost effectiveness by developing and upgrading
production technologies, as well as research and development
projects to continually reduce costs of production and increase
productivity.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus has unofficially agreed
to represent Yugoslav interests in Britain through its High
Commission in London, local Sunday Mail newspaper reported on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides said on Saturday
that Nicosia had told Yugoslav officials of its decision during
their informal contacts.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia had sounded Nicosia out through its ambassador to
Cyprus on whether Cyprus was prepared to represent it in Britain,
Kasoulides said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia has broken diplomatic relations with Britain,
France, Germany and the United States over the massive air strikes
by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization on the country.
</P>
<P>
Greece is representing Yugoslav interests in Germany and
Russia is doing likewise in France.
</P>
<P>
An overwhelming number of Cypriots oppose the NATO strikes
and have strong sympathies with Yugoslavia. There are about
3,000 Yugoslavs living in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Although not openly condemning the NATO strikes, the Cypriot
government has called for a political solution with greater
involvement of the United Nations.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The East African
Cooperation (EAC) member states, Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda, have
stressed the need to have a political commitment toward reviving
their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Concluding a two-day seminar in Tanzania's northern town of
Arusha Saturday, the EAC ministers also underscored the need to
establish a common market, according to a seven-page resolution
available here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The three neighboring countries have agreed to cooperate in
trade and investment by raising the level of domestic savings to
attract more direct investment.
</P>
<P>
"The ministers resolved to increase expenditure on agriculture
research, to mobilize resources for development of
infrastructures, and to harmonize education and training," said
the resolution.
</P>
<P>
They also endorsed to establish mechanisms for attracting high
quality tourism in the region to maximize returns.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Permanent Tripartite Commission of the EAC,
Eriya Ketegaya, called for the harmonization of fiscal and
monetary policies, urging to address payment of domestic arrears
in order to release funds for private sector capacity growth.
</P>
<P>
The EAC ministerial seminar was aimed at speeding up the member
states' efforts to reach a treaty for a higher cooperation -- the
East African Community.
</P>
<P>
Ketegaya, who is also the first Deputy Prime Minister and
Foreign Minister of Uganda, earlier told the EAC ministers,
principal secretaries and head of institutions that it is time to
move forward in providing the regional organization with a solid
institutional framework -- a treaty.
</P>
<P>
He said that the regional integration will create wealth
through increased production, trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
According to the EAC schedule, the envisaged treaty is expected
to be inked on July 1, this year.
</P>
<P>
Since its foundation in 1996, the EAC has tried to address the
shortcomings inherent in the past cooperation initiatives.

<P>
CANBERRA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Angry Serbian demonstrators
hurling stones smashed window panes at the United States
consulate-general building in Melbourne Sunday as part of
nationwide protests by 13,000 Serbian Australians against NATO air
strikes on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In Australia's second largest city Melbourne, an estimated
7,000 protesters called for Yugoslavia to "defend Kosovo", the
Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported.
</P>
<P>
They also called for Australian Prime Minister John Howard to
end Australia's support for the air strikes,
</P>
<P>
A group of young men let off crackers, danced and waved their
arms in the air, as they burned an American flag then spat on the
ashes with some hurling eggs and fruit at the consulate.
</P>
<P>
A window in a building next door to the consulate also had a
window shattered, the Australian Associated Press (ABC) reported.
</P>
<P>
Steve Pajic, spokesman for the Serbian National Council, told
the crowd: "We are gathered here today to protest against NATO's
aggression and bombardment of Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
In Sydney's central business district, about 6,000 Serbian
protesters erupted in wild cheers at reports that Yugoslavia had
downed a NATO plane.
</P>
<P>
The protesters smashed shop windows, pelted police with chunks
of concrete and torched an American flag.
</P>
<P>
Riot police were called in when demonstrators began throwing
lumps of concrete at officers, setting off firecrackers and
smashing windows at the MLC Center where offices of the United
States Consulate General are located.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Telephone Tariffs Adjusted In India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government unveiled
new telephone tariffs on Saturday, which substantially increased
fixed phone rentals and local call charges, but reduced rates for
international calls, leased circuits and Internet leased circuit
charges.
</P>
<P>
The Hindu daily reported Sunday that the new rates would remain
in force for one year by then the Communications Ministry would
conduct a "more scientific" study and revise the tariffs again.
</P>
<P>
While 10.8 million phone users all over the country would not
pay more than what they were paying at present, according to the
new arrangements, the other 10.2 million including the government,
the middle class and the corporate sector would have to pay
rentals and local call charges.
</P>
<P>
In the case of urban users which account for 85 percent of
phones, those making more than 200 calls a month will pay
bi-monthly rental of 140 rupees (3.3 U.S. dollars) from April 15.
</P>
<P>
Users in exchanges of over 100 to 30,000 lines will pay 240
rupees (5.7 U.S. dollars) every two months and in 30,000 to
100,000 capacity, the new rental will be 360 rupees (8.5 U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Charges for long distance calls, international as well as
national, will go down by 22 to 30 percent depending on the
distance and the exchange capacity.
</P>
<P>
The adjustment followed a quarrel between the government and
the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
TRAI announced here on March 9 that basic telephone rentals in
urban areas would go up by 30 percent, or from 190 rupees to 250
rupees per month and cellular monthly rentals would be increased
from the current 156 rupees to 600 rupees, a hike of 400 percent.
</P>
<P>
TRAI also announced that domestic long distance charges would
be reduced by 45 percent while international call charges will be
cut by 50 percent beginning April 1.
</P>
<P>
But the government shelved the TRAI decision the following day
after stiff opposition by several parties including a major ally
of the coalition led by the Bharatiya Janata Party, Trinamool
Congress, whose members staged a walkout and decided to boycott
then on-going parliament proceedings.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges Yugoslavia to Respect Muslim's Right </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Iran has called on Russia to exert
influence on Yugoslavia into respecting the rights of the Muslim
ethnic Albanians in the Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversations with his Russian counterpart Igor
Ivanov Saturday evening, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi
said that Islamic countries could no longer witness the violation
of the Muslims in Kosovo, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that Iran, the current president of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference, is prepared to take any
initiative to curb the current crisis and safeguard the rights of
the Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Condemning the ongoing attacks by the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) on Yugoslavia as illegal, Kharrazi also took
aims at the Belgrade government for its "stubbornness" and lack of
guarantee to safeguard the rights of Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said in reply that Moscow believes the talks between
Kosovo and Belgrade should go on and the rights of ethnic
Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the Kosovo population, should
be respected through a high degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
However, he underlined the NATO military action is not
sanctioned by the United Nations Security Council and should be
stopped.
</P>
<P>
Following the NATO airstrikes on Yugoslavia and the
intensified clashes between the Kosovo Albanians with Serbian
forces, the Iranian Foreign Ministry on Friday summoned the
Yugoslav charge a'affaires to Tehran to protest the killings of
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo by Serb forces.

In a letter to Zvobgo, the opposition parties which had
initially written a letter of acceptance stated that "first and
foremost, there must be convened an all-party constitutional
conference which should bring together all political parties,
trade unions, human rights groups, industrial unions and lawyers,
so that these can decide on matters relating to the new
constitution".
</P>
<P>
They also demanded that the all-party conference, if called,
must establish a transitional government of national unity which

<HEADLINE> Manila Sees Brighter Prospects For Mindanao Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Sunday the prospects for Mindanao peace have become brighter with
its suspension of military operations against a rebel group, which
is expected to release five hostages.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, the government negotiation panel
urged "all persons of peace and goodwill" at all levels of the
government and the anti-government National Democratic Front (NDF)
"to do everything in their power" to ensure the successful release
of the five military and police officers.
</P>
<P>
The negotiation team called for an end to all acts of
hostilities that would once again threaten the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The government panel said that the suspension of military
operations against the rebels, which started Sunday, will bring
peace to Mindanao residents who are "tragically caught in the
crossfire of the armed conflict" between the warring parties.
</P>
<P>
"Until all five men are released, we will be preparing to
propose an agenda and venue for the resumption of the talks," the
peace panel said.
</P>
<P>
"As many Filipinos prepare to commemorate the Holy Week and
celebrate Easter, we look forward as well as to the resurrection
of brighter hopes for a just and lasting peace for our people,"
the peace panel added.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada indefinitely suspended the formal
peace talks earlier this month with the NDF after the group's
abductions of military and police officers.
</P>
<P>
The NDF announced later that it will release the five officers
between March 22 and April 19.
</P>
<P>
In response, Estrada ordered the suspension of military
operations effective Sunday, as a sign of goodwill and to boost
confidence-building measures.

DAR ES SALAAM, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Some 20,000 Rwandan
refugees in Tanzania will constantly get information about the
situation in their hometowns, which is helpful for them to decide
whether to return or not.
</P>
<P>
The governments of the two neighboring countries and the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) have agreed on the

</P>
<P>
The newspaper reported that the three sides plan to organize
exchange visits between refugees in Tanzania and Rwandan
returnees, many of whom had been refugees in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The planned information campaign will be carried out from April
15 to May 7. After that, an assessment will be made on the
response of the refugees at an extraordinary tripartite commission
meeting in Tanzania's northwestern Ngara Region.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Feature: A Nightmare For Little Milica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GNJILANE, Kosovo, Yugoslavia, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Timid five-
year-old Milica Momcilo and her brother Nikola were awaken by a
loud bang, so loud that they thought they were still in a
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
What they saw in their house: huge holes on walls and stairs.
</P>
<P>
Through them, blew in chilly winds only to make Milica shudder
in coldness and fear.
</P>
<P>
A NATO cruise missile had just drilled through their house
before landing on their neighbor's courtyard, fortunately without
explosion.
</P>
<P>
The wings and movable tail fins of the dumb missile were cut
off by the walls and dropped inside the house while its main body
perched on the wooden fence of a pig sty.
</P>
<P>
The missile, identified as Warranted Item and serial numbered
BSU-60A/B-3000 3ASSY-704AS4890 MFR96214(D) S/N REZ606064, had this
small village Silovo of some 200 households in southeast Kosovo
stirred up. But none of them had the slightest idea why NATO chose
their village as the target as there were no military facilities
in the village, not even in its surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
The villagers could just tell them, "Let's not let down the
Americans and we hug the missile as such," because they knew the
dumb NATO missile represented the western democracy, freedom and
humanitarianism.
</P>
<P>
Though the grown-up villagers were courageous and joked about
the missile, little Milica had to hide behind her brother and
wondered why someone would use such a monstrous thing to frighten
her in dream. She had always been good and always go to bed on
time. Then what for? she thought.

WASHINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon confirmed late on
Saturday that a U.S. F-117A stealth fighter crashed in Yugoslavia
on Saturday, but the pilot was rescued.
</P>
<P>
"He and the combat rescue team that picked him up are all safe,
" Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said at a news conference. He
said he could not provide more details.
</P>
<P>
But Serb officials claimed earlier that the radar-evading
fighter jet had been shot down by them.
</P>
<P>
Bacon, dodging questions from reporters about how the plane was
shot down, only said he could not tell what had caused the
warplane to crash -- whether it was shot down or malfunctioned.
</P>
<P>
Rescue came several hours after Serbian television showed the
burning wreckage outside Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton soon praised the pilot and the rescue
team.
</P>
<P>
He said despite the risk, the NATO operation will "go forward
as planned."
</P>
<P>
Before Pentagon spokesman Bacon confirmed the crash of the
warplane, a senior officer at Hollomon Air Force Base in New
Mexico, where the stealth fighters are based, confirmed the downed
plane was from his squadron.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force has 54 F-117s, at a cost of 45 million U.S.
dollars each.
</P>
<P>
Because of the risks, the Pentagon has sent numerous search-and-
rescue teams to the region, including the 24th Marine
Expeditionary Unit.
</P>
<P>
The F-117A Nighthawk, which carries a one-man crew, is armed
with laser-guided bombs. Its Stealth technology uses curved or
angular surfaces to reduce radar reflection, and when combined
with radar-absorbing composite materials, the plane's 43-foot
wingspan displays an electronic cross-section the size of a
bumblebee.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Paraguayan President Raul
Cubas fired his national police chief Nino Trinidad Ruiz Diaz
Saturday after violent clashes, naming Ricardo Ramon Caballero as
new police chief.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Carlos Cubas, brother of the president, said
Ruiz's security force had failed to intervene in the clashes
between Cubas' foes and supporters outside the Congress, which
left four people dead and dozens injured.
</P>
<P>
The clashes were the most violent in a series of confrontations
that followed the gunning down of Vice President Luis Maria Argana
on March 23, who was a political rival of Cubas.
</P>
<P>
The Paraguayan trade unions went on strike on March 24,
demanding Cubas' resignation over Argana's death.
</P>
<P>
However, Lino Oviedo, commander of Paraguay's army under former
President Juan Carlos Wasmosy, said on March 25 the murder of
Argana was a part of plot against him and Cubas, local reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Oviedo, accused of leading an abortive coup in 1996, was said
to be a close ally of Cubas.
</P>
<P>
Cubas has ordered to close Paraguay's borders to track down the
killers since the death of Argana.

MOSCOW, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Russia's State Duma (lower house)
on Saturday demanded an immediate halt to NATO airstrikes on
Yugoslavia, describing it as a rude violation of the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
Angered by NATO military action against Yugoslavia, the State
Duma issued a statement urging President Boris Yeltsin and the
government to improve the country's security plan and readjust its
relationship with NATO.
</P>

The statement called on the Russian president and government to
make every effort to help stop NATO airstrikes and reopen the
Kosovo talks in order to seek a peaceful solution on the basis of
respecting Yugoslavia's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Saying that NATO military action has posed a serious threat to
Russia' state security, the statement suggested that President
Yeltsin and the government reconsider whether the Russian-NATO
framework document should be abolished.
</P>
<P>
The Russian lawmakers once again voiced Russia's firm support
to Yugoslavia who keeps a traditionally friendly relationship with
Russia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they also called for an emergency meeting of the U.N.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's currency real has
started to recover its value against the U.S. dollar after its
sharp devaluation at the beginning of the year which shocked the
world.
</P>
<P>
The dollar started this week at 1.85 reals and ended at 1.77, a
more than 4 percent drop. This was the lowest rate registered by
the dollar since February 3, when it reached 1.75 reals.
</P>
<P>
The drop in the dollar price was attributed to the interest
rate reduction adopted by the Central Bank, which diminished them
last Wednesday from 45 percent to 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
With the outlook of the drop of the Brazilian interests,
foreign investors want to take advantage of the moment when the
rates are still attractive to investment, Analyst Joaquim Kokudai
of Lloyds Bank said.
</P>
<P>
The drop in the dollar rate has caused expectations that the U.
S. currency will stay between 1.70 and 1.80 reals, which seems to
be the point of equilibrium.
</P>
<P>
However, Finance Minister Pedro Malan warned that it is too
early to feel safe for the country is still likely to go through
six months of turbulence.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Former Chicago Bulls star
Michael Jordan is negotiating to buy a share of the Charlotte
Hornets, NBA commissioner David Stern revealed on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Stern said Jordan has been discussing with Charlotte owner
George Shinn about purchasing a 50-percent share of the American
National Basketball Association club.
</P>
<P>
"There have been preliminary discussions about Michael and
George becoming equal partners in the ownership and operation of
the Hornets," Stern said in a statement released by the league.
</P>
<P>
"Those discussions are ongoing but are not near an agreement."
</P>
<P>
Shinn said he was hopeful of completing a deal with Jordan, who
retired from the Bulls earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
"There have been preliminary discussions about Michael Jordan
possibly becoming an ownership partner with me," Shinn said.
</P>
<P>
"Our hope over the next few meetings is to work out a
partnership that will benefit the Hornets and the entire community.
"
</P>
<P>
Neither Jordan nor his agent, David Falk, could not be
immediately reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
Shinn, who was part of the original ownership group when the
Hornets joined the league in 1988, has come under increasing

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Crude Oil Basket Price Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan oil basket rose 0.
94 dollars per barrel between the week that ended Friday and the
previous, from 11.01 dollars to 11.95 dollars per barrel, the
Mines and Energy Minister (MEM) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
MEM director Ali Rodriguez announced a stage of less mobility
of the prices after the increases since March 12 when the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and
independent producer Mexico were recommended to cut production by
a total of 2.1 million barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
Then on March 23, OPEC ratified a cut of 1.7 million barrels a
day in a meeting in Vienna, Austria. The cut will start on April 1
for a whole year while Mexico, Norway, Oman, and Russia will
reduce their production by 125,000, 100,000, 67,000 and 100,000
barrels a day, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The goal is to have an average price of 12 dollars per barrel
this year, to reduce by 2.5 percent the budget deficit, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan oil output will be 2.72 million barrels a day
after the 125,000 barrels a day cut.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan basket averaged 9.37 dollars per barrel, 37
cents more than the average sale price estimated in the national
budget for 1999.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said that it will take 80 days starting April 1 for
the inventories and warehoused products to return to their normal
levels.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the negative impact of a drop of income for the OPEC
producers (50 billion dollars in 1998) because of the lesser price
of the crude, Venezuela recommended the member countries to
calculate bottom prices in their budget estimations. The
Organization must also define a ceiling price to maintain its
quota of participation in the market.

<HEADLINE> Blue Sheep Protected in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Scientists in northwest China's
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region have successfully bred 13 blue sheep
through artificial insemination after 16 years of research to
improve the strains of wild animals under state protection.
</P>
<P>
The blue sheep is mainly found in the Tibet and Ningxia Hui
autonomous regions and Qinghai and Sichuan provinces. The bones of
the animal can be used to treat diseases.
</P>
<P>
By cooperating with Yinchuan Zoo for the past six years, the
research team, which was led by Ren Qingfen, an associate
professor at the Ningxia Agricultural College, found ways to cure
epilepsy. The team has also found ways to solve the problem of a
lack of trace elements in lambs.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia has blue sheep nature reserves on Helan Mountains and
in the Tianjing Mountain area. Since the 1960s, the number of
these animals has been declining because of excessive logging,
poaching, a decrease in forest areas, and the deterioration of the
environment.
</P>
<P>
The number of blue sheep in the Helanshan Mountain nature
reserve had fallen to about 5,000 last year from 10,000 in 1997.
Ningxia dealt with 2 cases of poaching that involved dozens of
blue sheep in 1997.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Added with New Information U.S. Official Says American F-117A Fighter Has Been Downed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Air Force officer said
that an American F-117A stealth fighter was shot down in
Yugoslavia on Saturday. Latest reports said that the pilot has
been rescued.
</P>
<P>
"One of our jets down," said a senior officer at the Hollomon
Air Force Base where the stealth fighters are permanently based.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, another U.S. senior defense official said the downed
plane in Yugoslavia shown on Serb TV appears to be a U.S. F-117A
stealth fighter.
</P>
<P>
The official said he has no official confirmation from NATO
authorities that a plane was down. But U.S. officials examining
the videotape of the wreckage said the markings on the plane
indicated that it was an American F-117A, said the official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The F-117As, based at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico
State, have been flying out of Aviano, Italy, as part of NATO's
Operation Allied Force. The Air Force has 54 in all, at a cost of
45 million U.S. dollars each.
</P>
<P>
Officials at Aviano had no comment, but Italy's undersecretary
of defense, Massimo Brutti, said on Italian state TV that "I have
had confirmation that one plane did not return."
</P>
<P>
The boomerang-shaped F-117A Nighthawk, which carries a one-man
crew, is armed with laser-guided bombs. Its stealth technology
uses curved or angular surfaces to reduce radar reflection, and
when combined with radar-absorbing composite materials, the
plane's 15-meter wingspan displays an electronic cross-section the
size of a bumblebee.
</P>
<P>
A senior officer at the 49th Fighter Wing at Holloman said
markings on the aircraft shown on Serbian television suggested it
was one from the Holloman's 8th Fighter Squadron better known as
the Black Sheep.
</P>
<P>
NATO air strikes continued against Serb targets in Yugoslavia
for a fourth night Saturday. NATO forces have shot down several
Yugoslav MiGs, but the downed F-117A would be the first allied
aircraft lost.
</P>
<P>
The attacks were launched after Serbs refused to enter into a
peace agreement with the majority ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, the
largest Serb province, that called for NATO troops. The agreement,
which has been agreed to by the ethnic Albanians, calls for NATO
troops to be based in Kosovo to keep the peace.
</P>
<P>
The twin-engine F-117A is about the size of an F-15 Eagle. It
typically is used against heavily defended targets and was a
workhorse in the allied air campaign against Iraq in the 1991 Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
The first F-117A, developed in total secrecy, was delivered to
the Air Force by Lockheed, the builder, in 1982, and the last
delivery was in the summer of 1990. The only F-117A unit, the 49th
Fighter Wing at Holloman, was declared operational in October 1983.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Signs WTO Financial Services Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has signed a World
Trade Organization (WTO) agreement on financial services to
liberalize the sector, the Sunday Times reported.
</P>
<P>
The landmark agreement, also signed by 52 other governments,
is part of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) which
came into effect from March 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The agreement brings trade in this sector - worth trillions of
dollars - under the WTO's multilateral rules on a permanent and
full most-favored-nation basis, said the report.
</P>
<P>
It said the combined commitments of the 53 governments cover
more than an estimated 95 percent of the world's financial
services and eliminate or relax current restrictions on commercial
presence of foreign financial services suppliers.
</P>
<P>
The commitments, which cover all three of the major financial
services sectors of banking, securities and insurance, also reduce
current limitations on service suppliers.
</P>
<P>
The paper said Sri Lanka is not a major exporter of financial
services, but has great potential and expects to grow in the
future.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, commercial banks incorporated
outside Sri Lanka were permitted to open any number of branches in
the country.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the Banking Act, non-nationals are permitted to
hold only up to 49 percent of equity in any institution providing
financial services in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
However, Sri Lanka retains the right to subject approval,
registration and licensing relating to banks and other financial
institutions to an economic needs test.
</P>
<P>
In the insurance sector, offers were made in three subsectors:
life insurance, non-life insurance and reinsurance.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Enters Productive Activity Recession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Argentine Deputy Economy
Minister Pablo Guidotti admitted that the country's productive
activity entered a recession period, which would cause a gross
domestic product (GDP) drop of between 1 and 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We estimate the retraction of the economy for this year will
be between 1 percent and 2 percent of the GDP," Guidotti told the
press Saturday.
</P>
<P>
This was the first public admission by the government of the
consequences generated in Argentina by the Brazilian economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Argentine Economy Minister Roque Fernandez said at the time of
real crisis (Brazil currency), "all the necessary measures to
diminish the effects of the crisis had been taken."
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the economic growth for this year will be 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
Guidotti said that the state loses some 450 million U.S.
dollars in tax revenue for every point the GDP drops, and warned
that to remedy this "we are not going to introduce new taxes nor
to increase the ones in force now."
</P>
<P>
"But the idea is to reduce public spending," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed the possibility of reducing the salaries of the
highest-ranking government officials, a measure adopted with
little success four years ago at the time of the Mexican crisis.
</P>
<P>
Guidotti explained that the drop of the resources from tax
revenue, associated with the lesser productive activity, will also
require a new definition of the goals already agreed on with the
International Monetary Fund.

within 60 days. If not, the borrower has to pay 10 percent of the
principle each month if the repayment starts within 3-6 months.
</P>
<P>
Only urban residents of Wenzhou at 20 or older with a steady

organized by 20 travel agencies designated by the Wenzhou city
tourism administration bureau are eligible for the loans, the bank
official explained. And they are required to provide a guarantee.

BUCHAREST, March 27 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 Romanians
staged a protest Saturday in Timisoara, a town 60 kilometers from

LONDON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Johnny Nelson won the
World Boxing Organization (WBO) cruiserweight title when he beat
compatriot Carl Thompson in the fifth-round in Derby, England, on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
It was the 32-year-old Nelson's third title bid. He drew a
World Boxing Council (WBC) showdown against Carlos De Leon in 1990
and was beaten on points for the International Boxing Federation (
IBF) crown by James Warring 28 months later.
</P>
<P>
He took his chance against Thompson, controversially stopping
the former champion Thompson after one minute 42 seconds of round
five.
</P>
<P>
Many thought the decision of referee Paul Thomas was premature,
although Nelson had floored Thompson in the fourth and then landed
with a series of big rights in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
Thompson, who twice fought and beat former world champion Chris
Eubank in punishing marathons, could not keep Nelson out.
</P>
<P>
Nelson stinged Thompson with jabs and right hands from the
first bell, while Thompson had some good spells in the second
round and had Nelson under pressure on the ropes.

The result sees Spain move up to third in their qualifying
group, three points behind leaders Cyprus and one back from
Austria, both of whom have played a game more.
</P>
<P>
After a shaky start, which saw them lose 3-2 to Cyprus and then
edge out Israel 2-1, Spain still have a lot to do if they are to
qualify for the Euro 2000 finals in Belgium and Holland -- a fact
recognised by a humble Raul as the game ended.
</P>
<P>
Spain, prompted intelligently by midfielders Pep Guardiola and
Juan Valeron, were simply outstanding in a game that saw Austria
offer nothing going forward and turn in a display in defence.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian backline was breached as early as the fifth minute
as Raul opened the floodgates, turning home a measured cross from
Sergi Barjuan on the left.
</P>
<P>
Raul's second owed a little more to luck as he dinked a shot
over hapless Austrian keeper Franz Wolfahrt. Defender Roman
Maehlich had ample opportunity to clear but chose to let the ball
hit the post, giving Raul ample time to run in and stab in.
</P>
<P>
Athletic Bilbao Urzaiz forward then got in on the act, heading
home his first from a pinpoint cross from Fran and, after Hierro
had made it 4-0 from the spot, giving his side a five-goal
advantage at the interval with a left-foot drive from 20 metres.
</P>
<P>
Raul clinched his hat-trick with an acute finish three minutes
into the second half, again taking advantage of hesitation in the
visiting defence, and he headed a fourth midway through the second
half.
</P>
<P>
Raul was influential, too, in his side's eighth as his cross
was deflected in by defender Arnold Wetl.

<HEADLINE> EDS-URGENT URGENT: U.S. Official Says F-117A Fighter is Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Defense official said
Saturday that an American F-117A fighter jet is missing.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, another senior U.S. defense official said the downed
plane in Yugoslavia shown on Serb TV appears to be a U.S. F-117A
stealth fighter.
</P>
<P>
The official said he has no official confirmation from NATO
authorities that a plane was down. But U.S. officials examining
the videotape of the wreckage said the markings on the plane
indicated that it was an American F-117A, said the official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.

<HEADLINE> China Expected to Revamp Gold Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- China's gold mining industry is
hoping to become more competitive by slowing its rate of growth
and by reforming business practices, reported today's "Business
Weekly".
</P>
<P>
The government has set the 1999 gold output goal at 175 tons,
up only 1.5 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
China has 397 tons of gold in reserve, accounting for less than
3 percent of 145 billion US dollars in total foreign exchange
reserves. China's heavy reliance on gold reserves has been reduced
significantly as its capability to earn foreign exchange has
increased greatly.
</P>
<P>
"The situation allows gold mining enterprises more time to
adjust strategies based on market requirements," said Liu Shan'en,
an analyst with the Gold Economic Development Research Center.
</P>
<P>
The price of gold calculated in renminbi has fallen by 15
percent compared to 1993 because of flat international gold price
levels and the strong value of renminbi.
</P>
<P>
Therefore,, less profitability makes the present an
inauspicious time for gold mining enterprises to raise production.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, about half the gold output was generated by
small-scale collectively-owned mines. But outdated equipment, a
lack of expertise and backward management constitute a potential
threat to long-term growth in the industry.
</P>
<P>
Some new investors may enter the industry since existing
production still falls short of demand.
</P>
<P>
Demand in the fourth quarter last year on the Chinese mainland
and in Hong Kong and in Taiwan totaled 78.3 tons, 25 percent less
than a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Demand on the mainland was less affected by the Asian crisis.
For all of 1998, 191.6 tons of gold were sold, 10 percent less
than in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In view of this, Albert Cheng, area manager of Asia Under World
Council, said: "The more auspicious Year of the Rabbit should help
to boost sales."
</P>
<P>
This, coupled with the festive atmosphere surrounding advent of
a new millennium, during which a lot of retailers are already
planning big promotions with gold as the perfect symbol for
eternity, Cheng projected that gold sales should bounce back to
levels seen prior to the Asian Crisis.

<HEADLINE> Economy in Southwest Romania Suffers From NATO Air Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The economy in southwest
Romania has been affected greatly by the NATO air strikes against
Yugoslavia with some enterprises moving on the edge of bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
Since the air strikes started on March 24, Romanian-Yugoslav
border trade has been cut and many enterprises in Romania's Timis
and Caras-Severin have failed to fulfill the contracts signed with
their Yugoslav counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Traffic on the border has also been cut and both cargo and
passenger transport on the Danube halted.
</P>
<P>
Since the United Nations imposed sanctions against Yugoslavia
in 1992, Romania has suffered an estimated loss of 7 billion U.S.
dollars in trade with the country, though trade volume between
them amounted to 180 million U.S. dollars last year.

<HEADLINE> EDS-1st Lead US stealth bomber reported shot down over Serbia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 28 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. F-117 stealth fighter
bomber was shot down over Serbia overnight Saturday, Serbian
television, RTS, reported, showing close-up pictures of the
burning wreckage.
</P>
<P>
The footage given by the RTS showed pictures of identification
number of the downed plane, which is "AF82" and in larger figures
the number "806". An emblem on the wreckage was clearly visible
with two bird's wings separated by a sword and bearing the
inscription "Air Combat Command".
</P>
<P>
RTS said the plane was hit between the town of Sabac and Ruma,
about 60 kilometers (40 miles) west of Belgrade and crashed near
the village of Budjanovci about 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of
here.
</P>
<P>
Tanjug news agency, quoting a local radio, had announced
earlier that a NATO warplane was shot down Saturday shortly before
09:00 p.m. (2000 GMT) in the same area.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. television channel CNN said a plane shot down over
Yugoslavia was a U.S. F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighter. It said the
two pilots were captured.
</P>
<P>
At NATO headquarters in Brussels, officials said they had "no
information" on the loss of a NATO plane.
</P>
<P>
The NATO allied forces headquarters at Mons in southwest
Belgium, which is responsible for conducting the air strikes over
Yugoslavia, was unavailable to comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon is looking into the reports of the shootdown,
spokesman Kenneth Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
"We're not confirming anything," Bacon said. "We're aware of
the reports and we're looking into them."
</P>
<P>
"They are clearly reports that we have to take seriously," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The F-117 is a radar-evading long-range fighter bomber.
</P>
<P>
CNN reported that two pilots from NATO warplanes were captured,
according to Serb sources claiming that additional aircraft had
been shot down.
</P>
<P>
Since NATO air strikes began on Wednesday, Serbian authorities
have claimed several times that their forces have shot down NATO
warplanes. Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Zoran Lilic said in an
interview Saturday, that Yugoslav forces had shot down or damaged
nine NATO planes taking part in the air strikes against his
country.
</P>
<P>
NATO said that it intended to jack up its military intervention
in Yugoslavia, passing from phase one to phase two. The broader
campaign will involve attacks on heavy weapons, command posts and
headquarters facilities of armed forces on territory of Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> 450,000 TB Cases Annually in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The incidence of Tuberculosis
(TB) in Indonesia is estimated at 450,000 cases a year, making the
disease the third biggest killer after heart and respiratory
ailments, a senior health official said.
</P>
<P>
"This means that there are 220 TB sufferers among every 100,000
Indonesians," Antara News Agency Sunday quoted Dr. Achmad Sujudi,
director general for communicable diseases eradication at the
Health Ministry, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government, Sujudi said here Saturday, was making all-out
efforts to combat the disease. But a major impediment in its
efforts was patients' non-compliant attitude toward medical
treatment and the high prices of medicine.
</P>
<P>
"These problems, in addition to the prolonged economic crisis,
have created other difficulties, namely lack of medical treatment
and resistance to medicine," he said.
</P>
<P>
To reduce the number of TB sufferers, nation-wide efforts
should be made to socialize the strategy of DOTS (direct observed
treatments short course), he said.
</P>
<P>
The program has been carried out in Indonesia since 1995/96
fiscal year but not yet to maximum extent.
</P>
<P>
DOTS is a method to monitor patients' behavior in taking
medicine and submitting to therapy. The program normally provides
an 85 percent possibility of recovery.
</P>
<P>
It also prevents the patients from developing drug-resistant
viruses, Sujudi said.

<HEADLINE> BASF to Increase Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Germany's chemical giant BASF has
decided to increase its investment in China, Business Weekly
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"We believe China's chemical market will pick up during the
next several years, although the current market is in oversupply
and exports have shrunk as a result of the Asian financial crisis,
" Bernd Kremmling, managing director of BASF China Ltd., told the
Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
BASF and its Chinese partners, China Petrochemical Corp and
Yangzi Petrochemical Co Ltd, are working on a contract and a joint
feasibility study report on a new petrochemical site in Nanjing,
which demands a total investment of 5 billion German marks (2.8
billion U.S. dollars), according to Kremmling.
</P>
<P>
The report said that BASF will hold a 50 percent share in the
joint venture, and the proposal of the project has been approved
by China's State Council.
</P>
<P>
BASF has recently signed a letter of intent with ICI
Polyurethanes, Nippon Polyurethane Industry, and four Chinese
partners to set up a plant with an annual capability of handling
160,000 metric tons of crude MDI in the new Shanghai Chemical
Industry Park in Caojing, according to Erich Binckli, president of
BASF East Asia.
</P>
<P>
BASF and its Chinese partners will establish a 130,000-metric-
ton-per-year TDI plant at the same site, the president said.
</P>
<P>
"We are also considering a site for the production of
intermediates for nylon fibers and their precursors at Dongfang in
Hainan Province," Binckli told the paper.
</P>
<P>
However, the bulk of the investment is expected to be made
after 2003, the report noted.

<HEADLINE> Garment Exports to Remain Weak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Industrial experts say China's
garment exports are not likely to bounce back within this year,
Business Weekly reported today.
</P>
<P>
The garment industry will face a tough year because of
shrinking exports and weak domestic demand, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
China's garment exports decreased 5.5 percent to 30 billion U.
S. dollars worth last year, according to statistics from the China
Commercial Information Center.
</P>
<P>
This is the second decline in garment exports, following the
first one in 1995 due to a falling export rebate rate.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed last year's drop to the world's economic
stagnation, especially the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
China's garment exports has witnessed an average annual growth
of 17.7 percent during the past 2 decades and now accounts for
more than 15 percent of the world market share.

<HEADLINE> Exam Finds Flaws with Imported Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- A recent selective examination of
imported electrical appliances indicates that a large proportion
of imported products have security and labeling problems,
Business Weekly reported today.
</P>
<P>
Of 14 mobile phones inspected, 12 were found to have security
problems. The plugs of the adapters were not up to international
requirements. Pressure experiments also showed unsatisfactory
results. Other minor problems were lack of specifications in
Chinese and Labels indicating the origin of production.
</P>
<P>
The examination, carried out recently by the State
Administration for Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine (SAIQ) and
the State Administration of Industry and Commerce, checked eight
kinds of imports in Guangdong and Zhejiang provinces, Beijing and
Shanghai municipalities.
</P>
<P>
The majority of flawed mobile phones were the Hyundai HGC-110
manufactured in South Korea, U.S.-originated Qualcomm Q-800,
France-produced AEG TP9050 and the 3DS00165AAA by Alcatel Co.
</P>
<P>
The examination also looked into 119 bottles of 13 brands of
imported mineral water. Nineteen bottles of mineral water were
found to contain defective mineral water produced by companies
from Taiwan and France.

<HEADLINE> Cross-Straits Trade Grows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Trade and economic cooperation
across the Taiwan Straits reached 20.5 billion U.S. dollars last
year, up 3.3 percent from a year earlier, despite a fallout from
Asia's financial turmoil, Business Weekly reported today.
</P>
<P>
The mainland's exports to Taiwan grew at a higher rate than
its imports, but Taiwan's trade surplus with the mainland was as
high as 12.76 billion U.S. dollars last year. By the end of 1998,
the mainland's cumulative trade deficit with Taiwan had topped 90
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The essential reason for the huge trade imbalance between the
mainland and Taiwan lies in unreasonable restrictions imposed by
the Taiwan authorities on mainland products," an official from the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) told
Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan authorities have banned imports of large items and high-
value-added products from the mainland, only allowing indirect
imports of some mainland agricultural and industrial materials and
semi-processed products.
</P>
<P>
Last year, mainland's exports to Taiwan increased by 13.9
percent to 3.87 billion U.S. dollars. The dramatic increase was
due to the enhanced competitiveness of mainland products and
Taiwan's mounting demand for them, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from trade concerns, many Taiwan business people have
come to invest on the mainland because they hold an optimistic
view towards the mainland's economic prospects.

BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- A central government report is
calling for the combined use of active fiscal and monetary
policies to further stimulate domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
In view of a continuing drop in domestic demand anticipated for
the first quarter, the report of the State Information Center
proposes that state and local coffers allocate funds to subsidize
bank-loan interest to stimulate investment.
</P>
<P>
It is also suggested that banks increase short-term loans to
improve the liquidity of funds and to increase floating funds much-
needed by enterprises.
</P>
<P>
It also proposes the expansion of open bond-market transactions
between the central and commercial banks to better adjust currency

LONDON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Germany, the 1996 European
champions, kept its title defense alive as Marco Bode fired two
goals to pace Germany for a 3-0 victory over Northern Ireland in

and Turkey to qualify from Group Three.

Bode opened the scoring when he headed home a perfect cross
from Oliver Nevuille and notched his second goal in the 42nd
minute with a kick from 30 meters.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Hungarians protested
against the NATO air strikes against Yugoslavia Saturday outside
the U.S. embassy here.
</P>
<P>
Thurmer Gyula, chairman of the Hungarian Workers' Party --
organizer of the protest, said at the protest the air strikes have
violated the UN Charter and international laws.
</P>
<P>
Criticizing the air strikes as being unjust and shameful, he
pointed out NATO's final aim is to gain hegemony over the Balkan
region.
</P>
<P>
The protesters called on the Hungarian congress to reconsider
its resolution allowing NATO to use Hungary's airspace and
military airports.
</P>
<P>
Demanding the leave of U.S. troops from Hungary, they expressed
the hope for a peaceful, safe and independent Hungary "without
NATO."

Reports said other parties and social organizations in Hungary
plan to hold such protests against the NATO air strikes in the

<HEADLINE> Mixed Responses to Serbian TV Report on Downed NATO Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Serbian TV report on
Saturday on downed U.S. F-117A stealth fighter with pictures of
the flaming wreckage has been confirmed by Italy but unconfirmed
by the U.S. and the NATO headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The F-117As, based at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico,
have been flying out of Aviano, Italy, as part of NATO's Operation
Allied Force against Yugoslavia. Italy's undersecretary of defense,
Massimo Brutti, said on Italian state TV that "I have had
confirmation that one plane did not return."
</P>
<P>
The downed plane in Yugoslavia shown on Serb TV "appears" to be
a U.S. F-117A stealth fighter, a senior U.S. defense official said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The official said he has no official confirmation from NATO
authorities that a plane was down. But U.S. officials examining
the videotape of the wreckage said the markings on the plane
indicated that it was an American F-117A, said the official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The boomerang-shaped F-117A Nighthawk, which carries a one-man
crew, is armed with laser-guided bombs. Its stealth technology
uses curved or angular surfaces to reduce radar reflection, and
when combined with radar-absorbing composite materials, the
plane's 43-foot wingspan displays an electronic cross-section the
size of a bumblebee.
</P>
<P>
A senior officer at the 49th Fighter Wing at Holloman said
markings on the aircraft shown on Serbian television suggested it
was one from the Holloman's 8th Fighter Squadron better known as
the Black Sheep.

World Cup winner France was held to a 0-0 draw by Ukraine in a key

<HEADLINE> Tiny Zoo Shows How Tibetans Love Animals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Norbu Lingka, an ancient site,
has become one of the most attractive tourist attractions in Lhasa,
the capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
But, it has something more than scenic, historic, and religious
value for visitors, especially those from rural areas -- it has a
zoo.
</P>
<P>
Norbu Lingka's zoo is much smaller than other zoological
gardens in China, with only about 160 animals in all, from 16
types like the black-neck crane, white-lip deer, Tibetan monkey,
and brown bear. But, it may be one of the oldest in the country.
</P>
<P>
It was started in 1922 with a few imported animals or animals
donated by ordinary people.
</P>
<P>
In 1959, the government spent over 100,000 yuan increasing the
zoo's size by adding a yard for monkeys caught by Tibetan
villagers.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the authorities spent 330,000 yuan remodelling it and
improving the living conditions of the animals who have mostly
been donated by local people.
</P>
<P>
Local sources say that Tibetan villagers do not kill wild
animals that are caught because they damaged crops or attacked
livestock. Instead, they either send the animals back to the wild
or give them to the zoo.
</P>
<P>
"Tibetans, who are mostly Buddhists, are great lovers of
animals and of flowers," says one local.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Colombia and the United

eradication of illegal drug cultivation in this country, announced
Saturday Ruben Olarte, official in charge of Colombian National

He said an impasse in the bilateral cooperation plan on the war
against drugs has been overcome after the visit this week to

</P>
<P>
"The impasse is being overcome. We have decided to jointly
advance a program of verification of the illicit cultivation, with
a joint methodological design, a satellite evaluation system, and
joint field tests to measure the degrees of effectively," said
Olarte.
</P>

He said that "in less than two months there will be a realistic
figure" about the plantations destroyed of coca plant and opium
poppy.

WASHINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Dutchman Richard Krajicek
savored his first title in the United States since 1993, beating
unseeded Frenchman Sebastien Grosjean 4-6, 6-1, 6-2, 7-5 in the
final of the Lipton Championships in Florida on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Krajicek, 27, who beat Pete Sampras for the fourth consecutive
time en route to the title, will climb to a career-best fourth in
next week's ATP Tour rankings, while Grosjean, 20, will jump from
74th into the mid-40s after reaching his first ATP Tour final.
</P>
<P>
The women's title will be decided in a much-anticipated sibling
showdown Sunday between Venus and Serena Williams. It's the first
all-sister women's final since the Open era began in 1968.
</P>
<P>
Krajicek who served 24 aces, struggled in the opening set and
was broken for only the third and fourth times in the tournament.
Topping out at 209 kph, he lost only nine of 61 points on his
first serve.
</P>
<P>
"He served on the line all the time, too fast," Grosjean said.
"When he was tired, he served better than in the first set."
</P>
<P>
Grosjean, still looking fresh 2 1-2 hours into the match, held
a set point at 5-4 in the fourth set. But Krajicek saved that game,
then broke serve at 5-5 and closed out the victory with his final
ace on championship point.
</P>
<P>
While Grosjean couldn't compete with Krajicek's power, the
Frenchman had the edge in baseline rallies and came up with the
shot of the match, retreating to chase down a lob and then
whirling to smack a forehand winner.
</P>
<P>
Krajicek earned his 17th ATP Tour career title and his second
this year. He last won a U.S. tournament in Los Angeles six years
ago.

<HEADLINE> China's Furniture-Making Sector Grows Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- China's furniture-making industry
is expected to maintain a rapid growth during the next several
years, which will result in increased timber imports, today's
China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
"Economic development and people's enhanced consumption will
allow the industry to grow at a rate of 10 percent this year," the
English newspaper quoted Cao Yingchao, secretary-general of the
China National Furniture Association, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the industry's exports and output value were 1.4
billion US dollars and 87 billion yuan (10.5 billion US dollars),
up 17 percent and 12 percent from 1997 despite effects of the
Asian financial crisis, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
This year, the Chinese government set the national economic
growth rate at seven percent and will take more active monetary
and fiscal policies to expand domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
However, Cao told China Daily that a logging ban implemented by
the government last summer will lead to a supply deficiency for
furniture timber material in the domestic market for the next few
years.
</P>
<P>
To meet the demand for raw materials, the furniture industry is
expected to expand timber imports from foreign countries including
the United States, Russia, Australia, and countries in Africa,
South America and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said that the government is also taking measures
to encourage timber imports, as import taxes on logs and boards
have been decreased to zero since January this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, industrial experts said that a lack of foreign
exchange held by domestic furniture manufacturers is going to
restrict imports.
</P>
<P>
They propose that foreign timber suppliers should help Chinese
furniture enterprises promote exports to earn enough foreign
exchange to make payments for timber imports, said China Daily.

<HEADLINE> Scholes Gives Keegan Winning Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Paul Scholes kicked off Kevin
Keegan's reign as England manager in triumphant fashion, with a
superb hat-trick to secure victory over Poland in the Euro 2000
clash at Wembley on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Manchester United star claimed two goals in the first half -
the second in controversial style - before adding a third to
secure the win 20 minutes from time.
</P>
<P>
It was the first hat-trick for an England player since Ian
Wright grabbed a treble against San Marino in a World Cup 94
qualifier.
</P>
<P>
Scholes' individual efforts aside, it was a far from vintage
display from England - but Keegan will be unconcerned after his
side got their European Championship challenge back on track.
</P>
<P>
England, who had to win the game after some disappointing
results under Keegan's predecessor Glenn Hoddle, appeared nervy at
times and unable to stamp their authority on the opposition - but
they were still able to create a host of chances and were always
on top of a scrappy affair.
</P>
<P>
Andy Cole, making his first start, missed a number of openings,
but he linked well up front with strike partner Alan Shearer,
while Tim Sherwood had an impressive debut in midfield.
</P>
<P>
Defensively, though, England looked shaky at times and Keegan
will not have been impressed at the ease with which Poland were
able to force their way back into the contest at 2-1.
</P>
<P>
Alan Shearer came close to scoring a typically spectacular goal
after eight minutes, but his thumping volley from Gary Neville's
cross faded just wide.
</P>
<P>
Graeme Le Saux's high-ball from the left was tapped back by
Andy Cole on the edge of the area for Shearer.
</P>
<P>
The England captain lost the ball under pressure from a posse
of defenders, but it broke for Scholes, who calmly slotted it past
on-rushing Polish keeper Adam Matysek.
</P>
<P>
The second goal was crafted on the Old Trafford training pitch,
as three Manchester United players combined after 21 minutes to
finish off a sweet move.
</P>
<P>
The livewire Cole sent David Beckham clear on the right with a
clever reverse pass and the midfielder put over a stunning first-
time cross which Scholes flicked into the far corner of the net.
</P>
<P>
The sweeping build-up was England's best moment of the first
half - even though TV replays questioned the legitimacy of the
goal, with the ball appearing to deflect off Scholes' arm.
</P>
<P>
Poland had their first genuine chance two minutes later when
the England defence failed to pick up Miroslaw Trzeclak from a
corner, but he sent his shot blazing over the bar.
</P>
<P>
England had not seen the warning signs, though, and Poland were
back in the game after 28 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Trzeclak roasted Neville on the left flank and cut the ball
back from the byline for his captain Jerzy Brzeczek, who beat the
back-tracking defence and put a left-foot shot past a despairing
David Seaman into the bottom corner.
</P>
<P>
England could have re-established their two-goal advantage five
minutes after the second half stuttered into life, but first
Shearer's far-post prod was saved on the line and then Cole
swivelled and fired over the bar from 12 yards.
</P>
<P>
Center-half Martin Keown proved a surprise play-maker with a
run deep into Polish territory before slipping the ball to Cole on
the edge of the area - but instead of shooting first time, the
United striker took one touch too many and put a weak shot into
the side netting.
</P>
<P>
With 20 minutes left Arsenal midfielder Ray Parlour was given a
debut in place of the ineffective Steve McManaman.
</P>
<P>
Within seconds of the change England had scored again - and
Scholes had his hat-trick.
</P>
<P>
Shearer got his head to a long-throw and flicked the ball deep
into the Polish box, where Scholes thumped a powerful header past
Matysek.
</P>
<P>
A slip by Le Saux almost allowed Poland to make it 3-2, but
substitute Kowalczyk failed to take advantage of his blunder and
fired across the face of goal.
</P>
<P>
Cole went close with a near-post header, Scholes almost claimed
his fourth with a long-range drive and Sherwood headed just over
in the last minute of the game.
</P>
<P>
The day belonged to Keegan and, in particular, Scholes who was
given a standing ovation when he was replaced in the dying minutes
- before returning at the final whistle to claim his match ball.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The jet fighter shot down in
Yugoslavia, which has been shown on Serb TV, appears to be a U.S.
F-117A stealth fighter, a senior defense official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The official said he has no official confirmation from NATO
authorities that a plane was down. But U.S. officials examining
the videotape of the wreckage said the markings on the plane
indicated it was an American F-117A, said the official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
The F-117As, based at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico,
have been flying out of Aviano, Italy, as part of NATO's Operation
Allied Force.

<HEADLINE> Keegan Sticks to Caretaker Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Kevin Keegan said on Saturday he
would still be in charge of England for just four matches, despite
leading his new team to a morale-boosting 3-1 win over Poland in
his first game as coach.
</P>
<P>
He said he had enjoyed his first taste of international
management, but would not reverse his decision to take the job on
a caretaker basis.
</P>
<P>
"I really enjoyed it," he said. "I've only got four games and I
am going to enjoy every one of them."
</P>
<P>
England now have a chance of qualifying for Euro 2000 - but
Keegan said if they do he would only be there as a TV commentator.
</P>
<P>
"This turns it round a bit but there is a lot of football left,
" he added.
</P>
<P>
"We all want to be in the European Championships. I want to be
there with the TV people, the fans want to be there, but most
importantly the players showed today how much they wanted to be
there."
</P>
<P>
Keegan paid tribute to the vociferous Wembley support and to
Manchester United's Paul Scholes, who scored all three goals to
secure victory for England.
</P>
<P>
"The fans were fantastic today and kept us going at times when
the game got very stretched." said Keegan.
</P>
<P>
"You never know with Paul Scholes what he's going to do, he is
a very impressive player who lets his football do the talking.
</P>
<P>
"They usually knight you if you score a hat-trick here - it
should be Sir Paul Scholes.," he said.

<HEADLINE> Birds Back as Hunters Give Up Guns in Yunnan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Rare white herons are returning
to the Xinshuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, in southwest
China's Yunnan Province, since the local ethnic people surrendered
their hunting guns to the government last year.
</P>
<P>
The birds fled in huge numbers from their original home for
fear of slaughter but last April the local government launched a
hunting ban and confiscated all firearms.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, bird cry was hardly heard here but now it is
everywhere," said an old man happily while doing his morning
exercise.
</P>
<P>
Xishuangbanna, one of the most beautiful tourist sites in China,
is home to many kinds of rare animals and birds including 109
endangered species.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the hunting ban and other government efforts to
protect wildlife, the number of wide animals in the prefecture has
been increasing and there are now over 250 elephants and over 600
head of cattle.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, a number of major tourist facilities have been
built in Xishuangbanna, including the Wild Elephant Valley, the
Primitive Forest Park and the Bird Garden.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, more than two million tourists visited the prefecture
and spent as much as 1.3 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Some local restaurants which used to profit from making dishes
with wild birds and animals might be the only losers in the
government drive to turn the prefecture into a paradise for
wildlife.
</P>
<P>
"I'm considering changing to another form of businesses," said
a local restaurant owner.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pledges to Continue Airstrikes Against Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said in a weekly radio address Saturday the United States and its
allies are determined to "defuse a powder keg at the heart of
Europe," but military officials questioned whether air power alone
could stop Yugoslavia's "attacks on its ethnic Albanian minority in
Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
Minutes after the broadcast of Clinton's address, a U.S. Navy
ship fired two Tomahawk cruise missiles at what a defense official
called "targets of opportunity" near Belgrade, touching off the
fourth consecutive day of airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
"Serb troops have continued attacks on unarmed men, women and
children -- that is all the more reason for us to stay the course,"
Clinton claimed.
</P>
<P>
"We must and we will continue until Serbia's leader, Slobodan
Milosevic, accepts peace or we have seriously damaged his capacity
to make war," he said.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with his foreign policy team, Clinton spoke with
the leaders of key NATO allies Italy, Germany, Britain and France
and agreed to proceed with the next phase of airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
"There was total allied unity in moving forward with the
planned air campaign," National Security Council spokesman David
Leavy said. "All the leaders agreed that the campaign had been
affected thus far and that it was time to broaden or deepen the
attack."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair told Clinton that Britain would
increase its contribution of air power to the NATO airstrikes,
according to a statement released by Downing Street.
</P>
<P>
The White House, meanwhile, moved to dampen speculation that
Yugoslavia's accelerated operations in Kosovo had sparked planning
for sending in U.S. and allied ground forces.
</P>
<P>
Leavy said Clinton's national security team shares the
president's judgment "that we can accomplish our objective through
air power." The White House again ruled out the use of American
ground troops.
</P>
<P>
But that conclusion was challenged by the former supreme allied
commander in Europe. Now-retired Army General George Joulwan,
architect of the U.S. peacekeeping mission in Bosnia, said that it
was time to begin precise targeting of Serb personnel in Kosovo
and for NATO leaders to develop a strategy for using troops.
</P>
<P>
What always happens is the political decision (to use ground
troops) always comes late," Joulwan said on CNN.
</P>
<P>
He said the Clinton administration and NATO should approve
"prudent planning for a ground campaign... so when that time
comes, we're ready."
</P>
<P>
Some 12,000 NATO ground troops, including 400 Americans, are in
Macedonia training for entry into Kosovo as part of a peace
settlement, but not as an offensive force intended to do battle.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Clinton also ordered 100 combat-equipped Marines
dispatched to guard the U.S. Embassy in Macedonia. More military
personnel are needed in that country, neighboring Serbia, he told
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
"Sound military planning may also call for sending a limited
number of additional U.S. military personnel to Macedonia in
support of ongoing operations," Clinton added.

<HEADLINE> Cook Says Yugoslavia Must Withdraw From Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said Saturday that Yugoslavia would have to start withdrawing
troops from Kosovo before NATO considered ending the bombing
raids.
</P>
<P>
Cook told CNN in an interview that a verbal assurance by
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to halt his offensive in
Kosovo would not be enough to end NATO's airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
"He would have to show he was serious about it, he would have
to start withdrawing some of his troops," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary made the remarks shortly after NATO
announced it was stepping up the range of its air raids.
</P>
<P>
Cook said the object of attacks was to make it impossible for
Milosevic's forces to carry out actions against ethnic Albanians
in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Business Start-Ups Fall 7 Percent in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The number of U.S. business
start-ups fell 7 percent in 1998, according to an annual study
conducted by Dun &AMP; Bradstreet Corp., the business-information
service.
</P>
<P>
The study said that the total number of start-up companies fell
to 155,141 in 1998 from 166,740 in 1997. The number of jobs
created by new businesses declined 3.5 percent to 906,105 from
939,310 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
It said the economic expansion has provided U.S. workers with a
strong sense of job security. The Labor Department said more than
3.1 million jobs were created in the U.S. last year, while the
current unemployment rate of 4.4 percent hovers near a 28-year
low.
</P>
<P>
The number of start-ups declines in almost every sector, the
study said. The service sector, which accounts for roughly 80
percent of the U.S. economy, had a 4 percent drop in the number of
new businesses. The number of jobs created by service start-ups
fell 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The retail sector saw a 9 percent drop in start-ups last year,
as employment from retail start-ups fell 7 percent. Manufacturing
and wholesale-trade sectors posted declines in the number of
new businesses of 10 percent and 11 percent respectively.

<HEADLINE> Thousands Protest in German Cities Against NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 27 (Xinhua) -- More than 15,000 people protested
Saturday on a central square of Berlin against the NATO air raids
on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In other German cities, there were also anti-NATO rallies.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators in Berlin carried placards reading, "Don't
force peace with weapons," German television reported.
</P>
<P>
Several demonstrators pelted police officers with bottles while
others chanted "No violence!" and some were arrested after the
scuffles.
</P>
<P>
Members of the German Democratic Socialism Party (PDS), which
organized the rally, called on the demonstrators to leave the
square, while other demonstrators called the policemen "Nazis."
</P>
<P>
PDS Chairman Lothar Bisky said that NATO air raids against
Yugoslavia were "criminal," and the PDS parliamentary fraction
chief Gregor Gysi charged NATO with violating international law
and the North Atlantic Treaty.
</P>
<P>
And, by participating in NATO air strikes, the German
government violated the German constitution, Gysi said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, police in Hanover evicted demonstrators who
had been occupying an office of the Greens Party to protest the
party's support for the NATO bombardment.
</P>
<P>
Some 3,000 Serbs held a rally in the southern city of Stuttgart
to support Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. The Serbs living
in Germany demonstrated in Nuremberg and Bielefeld, too.

BRUSSELS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Chief of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) said here Saturday that he had ordered
the 19-member alliance to launch a "broader range of air
operations in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia," which the west

</P>
<P>
"With this aim in mind, the broader range of operations will

forces," he said.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief said that he had directed NATO Supreme Commander
General Wesley Clark to undertake the phase II operation aimed to
further strike targets of the Yugoslav army, such as tanks,
artillery and other military weapons.
</P>
<P>
He also said the bloc's "ultimate objective remains to
contribute to the achievement of a political solution to the
crisis in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
However, Solana still blamed Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic for his refusal both "to stop his violent action in
Kosovo" and "to negotiate in good faith." He reiterated that "NATO
is not at war with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia" and said
the responsibility of the current crisis rests only with the
Yugoslav leader.
