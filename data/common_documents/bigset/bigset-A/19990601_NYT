SPORTS COLUMN: BIRD REMAINING CALM AFTER PACER MELTDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Without much worry, Larry Bird calmly fielded
inquiries on Monday about how to fix things for his basketball
team. Reflecting his stoic sideline demeanor, Coach Bird addressed
the Pacers' problems with all the exuberance of a farmer watching
wheat grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to win four games,'' Bird deadpanned of his team's
0-1 plight against the New York Knicks in the Eastern Conference
finals. ``If we lose tomorrow, I'll be saying the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   About an hour later Jeff Van Gundy, his Knicks having seized the
home-court advantage from the hottest team in the league, took time
after practice to speak in defense of Patrick Ewing. Animated,
stubborn, the Knick coach would not waver in his opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast was surreal. You lose Game 1 in New York, the coach
is in trouble, the franchise center needs to be shipped out, and
the season _ no, Gotham _ is in peril.
</P>
<P>
   In the heartland, Bird yawns and says, ``The Knicks played
pretty good,'' and life returns to normal.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded about what motivational wisdom he imparted to the
Pacers, he smiled and said, ``I told them to take it easy and have
a good day.''
</P>
<P>
   Some crisis mode they go into here in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the Pacers are in imminent danger of
getting knocked out by the Knicks, whether Indiana is 48 minutes
away from falling into an 0-2 abyss in the four-of-seven-game
series. Yet with Game 2 approaching on Tuesday night, the sense is
that Bird is looking at his team's Game 1 loss as an aberration
rather than real trouble.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, it is encouraging to see someone shrug his
shoulders about his team's meltdown in the final minutes, as if it
does not faze him that in the history of the National Basketball
Association, the team that has lost the first game of a seven-game
playoff series has gone on to lose the series 79.2 percent of the
time. On another level, the Pacers are beginning to show their
gray.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Miller, Mark Jackson, Chris Mullin and the oft-injured
Rik Smits are closer to the end of a career than its prime, and the
Knicks made them look awfully old at times on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Bird saw this rejuvenated Knick team up close in Game 1. He
watched Allan Houston create his own shots, whereas Reggie Miller
could not. When the Pacers were trying to slow the tempo and pound
the ball inside, Bird watched Latrell Sprewell bring adrenaline
onto the floor and take off in the open court.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing about Houston is, he can face you up, freeze you and
go right up with it,'' Bird said. ``Reggie, to get his shots he has
to rely more on screens and he's got to rely more going to the
basket and shooting floaters. Really, they're not the same type of
offensive players.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the Knicks, he added: ``They're focused, they're
playing harder and they're playing for something now. Whereas in
the regular season, somewhat like us, guys were complaining about
their playing time, they didn't have their unit really set, they
were trying out new things. But they're fine now.''
</P>
<P>
   Perception can change so quickly in this game. For all the
tumult and uncertainty surrounding the Knicks and Van Gundy this
season, Indiana's best and perhaps last chance to win a
championship is now.
</P>
<P>
   Bird's ability to swoop down and improve a gifted veteran team
may go for naught if the Pacers can't solve the Knicks in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry's message was that it's going to be a long series and
we're going to have to look at it that way,'' said Jalen Rose, the
reserve guard who struggled in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   Bird said he planned to use Dale Davis more down the stretch
instead of having the bruising power forward languish on the bench
in the fourth quarter. He said he wanted to get Miller more shots,
preferably about 18 a game. Having played for much weightier stakes
than a Game 2 in his playing career, however, Bird never went
further than the usual between-game adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, he is almost beyond reproach. The Pacers'
president, Donnie Walsh, often likens Bird's popularity in Indiana
to ``proportions reaching DiMaggio.'' He is a source of great pride
for the Hoosier State, its own Larry Legend who came home to roost.
</P>
<P>
   Bird finally absorbed criticism this season for his unemotional
approach on the sideline _ callers to a radio program wanted to
know why the Pacers coach stood there with his hands in his pockets
as his team was imploding on the floor. He responded by saying no
one knew how badly he wanted to win internally, that his
competitive juices flowed more freely than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he is not watching the wheat grow. Maybe Larry Bird, in
his infinite playoff wisdom, knows more about handling post-season
pressure than anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, only a few certainties have emerged so far: the
Knicks look good, Bird is unconcerned, and Van Gundy, well, he
still can't sleep. &QL;

SABRES EARN A RARE TRIP TO THE FINALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ For the first time in 24 years and for the second time
in their history, the Buffalo Sabres are going to the Stanley Cup
finals. They clinched the Eastern Conference championship on Monday
night in the Air Canada Center with a 4-2 victory over the Toronto
Maple Leafs, winning the four-of-seven-game series by 4 games to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo will play the winner of the Western Conference finals
between Dallas and Colorado. The Avalanche leads that series by 3-2
with Game 6 in Denver on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres last made the trip to the championship round in 1975,
when they were defeated by the Philadelphia Flyers during the era
of the Broad Street Bullies.
</P>
<P>
   Although they have changed uniform styles, arenas, coaches,
general managers and owners in the past two seasons, the Sabres
have been on a steady rise. They reached the third round last
season before losing to Washington. This spring, the Sabres are at
least one step higher but will probably be the underdog against the
Western winner.
</P>
<P>
   When the Prince of Wales trophy was presented to the Sabres'
captain, Michael Peca, he shook hands with the National Hockey
League executive Colin Campbell but refused even to touch the
trophy. It was not a sign of disrespect, but a gesture that
symbolized how the Sabres have bigger trophies in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get hot, we can be a pretty good team,'' Peca said.
``We're a young team, and we're having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Peca was asked which opponent he would prefer in the finals.
Like most people around hockey, Peca has enjoyed watching the
Western series, one of the classics of the decade. ``It's been fun
watching their series,'' Peca said, refusing to choose a favorite
for a foe. ``Whoever comes out will be a deserving team.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo broke a 2-2 tie at 11 minutes 35 seconds of the third
period on a goal by Erik Rasmussen, who finished a rush by knocking
in a rebound past Leafs goalie Curtis Joseph after Joseph made a
save on the initial shot by Brian Holzinger.
</P>
<P>
   Although defenseman Tomas Kaberle was near Rasmussen, he did not
check him. Kaberle is a rookie and, like many of his teammates, is
inexperienced at this level. Toronto missed the playoffs in the
previous two seasons but enjoyed a successful regular season with
an entertaining, high-scoring style before beating Philadelphia and
Pittsburgh in the first two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Quinn, the Toronto coach, said: ``These guys never griped
and kept battling. Nothing in the tank right now. I don't know if
we hit the wall. We believed we had a chance. That's obviously gone
now. We'll remember it all our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Peca did not score or assist on Monday night, he played
well and made a key check. Early in the third period, with the
score still tied, he rammed Toronto's Sergei Berezin into the
boards, putting Berezin out of the game with an undisclosed injury.
Berezin was one of Toronto's prime scoring threats on a team that
has lost several forwards to injuries in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon Ward made it 4-2 by scoring into an empty net with 1:02
remaining after Toronto had pulled Joseph for an extra attacker
during a Leafs power play.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo's other goals were scored by Curtis Brown at even
strength and Vaclav Varada on the power play. Toronto's goals were
scored by Steve Sullivan on the power play and Kris King at even
strength. Each team had a goal disallowed after video review.
</P>
<P>
   Dominik Hasek, Buffalo's goalie, stopped 20 of 22 Toronto shots
while playing his third consecutive game after missing the first
two in the series with a groin injury.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek showed a flash of temper that is considered one of his
vulnerabilities, however. After being slashed by Toronto's Mike
Johnson in the second period, Hasek threw his big blocker glove,
flung his stick to the ice, purposely knocked his net askew, picked
up his stick and then fired the water bottle that had been on top
of his net across the ice. No penalty was called. Hasek's groin
injury and his temper _ along with the talent that has made him the
most valuable player in the league for the past two seasons _ could
become critical factors in the pressure of the championship round.
</P>
<P>
   The first period was well played and scoreless. The second was
wildly eventful and ended in a 2-2 tie.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto scored first, at the 33-second mark, a goal credited to
Sullivan, whose long shot was swiped at by Toronto's captain, Mats
Sundin, on its way to the net. Although Sundin was originally
credited with the goal, he apparently missed the puck, which seemed
to hit the stick of a Buffalo defenseman before fluttering over
Hasek's shoulder and across the line.
</P>
<P>
   The Leafs seemed to make it 2-0 on a power play at 2:38, but the
goal, by Berezin, was nullified after a video review because Sundin
was in the crease.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo made it 1-1 on a goal by Brown at 7:14. The Leafs took a
2-1 lead at 12:54 on a goal by King, who knocked in a rebound of a
Sundin shot that hit the goal post. This goal was also reviewed
because Tie Domi was prone, partly in the crease, after being
checked, as the puck crossed the line. But this one counted after
video viewing.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes before, Domi appeared to be stunned when run into
the boards by Richard Smehlik, headfirst. Domi remained on the ice
for a few moments for medical attention, but he skated to the bench
and recovered quickly.
</P>
<P>
   With Toronto's Garry Valk in the penalty box for roughing,
Buffalo tied the score at 2-2 at 16:44 when Varada knocked in his
own rebound from close range after Joseph sprawled while making the
first save. &QL;

ASTROTURF BOUNCES BEFUDDLE DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Artificial turf does strange things to a baseball
game, like control the outcome. That's what the Dodgers are saying.
</P>
<P>
   The fake stuff allowed Pittsburgh's Jason Kendall to double on a
ball hit in front of Dodgers left fielder Gary Sheffield. The fake
stuff was also the reason Kendall scored on Warren Morris' bloop
single to center field that Devon White short-hopped.
</P>
<P>
   That combination in the eighth inning pushed the Pirates to a
5-4 win against the Dodgers at Three Rivers Stadium on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in an inning in which the Dodgers were protecting a
one-run lead, it was the turf that had the biggest say in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just AstroTurf,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said.
``AstroTurf does funny things. The ball hits in front of you and
bounces, (so) you have to play deep. Funny things happen here. I've
never seen basehits in front of guys that are doubles.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, perhaps until Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers (26-24) led 4-3 heading into the bottom of the
eighth and were four outs away from their first three-game winning
streak since April 27 through May 1. Then reliever Jamie Arnold
(2-1) walked Kevin Young. Kendall hit a soft liner in front of a
deep Sheffield, who backed off the ball to play the high bounce and
try to keep Young from scoring.
</P>
<P>
   However, Young was running on the pitch and beat Mark
Grudzielanek's relay throw home to score the tying run. Kendall
advanced to third.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make decisions you don't normally make on
(grass),'' Sheffield said. ``You tell yourself on balls not hit
hard, `Should I go for it and dive on the hard turf or play
conservative and hopefully have the pitcher bail you out by making
a pitch?' . . . When you play with no sleeves, (you can get nasty)
rug burn. I've never dove on it in the outfield. When I played
infield I did, but not in the outfield on turf. You don't want to
risk injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield has been banged up by the Dodgers' recent schedule on
artificial turf. During the Dodgers' recent three-game series in
Cincinnati, Sheffield experienced discomfort in his back from the
hard artificial turf and wore different shoes when he batted than
we he played the field.
</P>
<P>
   The artificial-turf syndrome reared its head again when Morris,
the former College World Series hero for Louisiana State, batted.
He looped a single to center which White chose to short-hop instead
of trying to dive and make an inning-ending catch.
</P>
<P>
   Two innings earlier White committed his first error of the
season when he tried to short-hop Al Martin's basehit. It scored
Abraham Nunez from second, Martin wound up on third and scored on
Ed Sprague's double to make it 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I misjudged that ball and it got under my glove,'' White said.
``The (Morris) situation, I'm not making any excuses. The ball was
placed perfectly. That's how it goes.''
</P>
<P>
   After watching the Dodgers lose the first of a three-game series
for the fifth straight time, Johnson was visibly frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't even short-hop the ball because you don't know where
the ball is going to go,'' Johnson said. ``Maybe on a normal field
(Sheffield) catches it chest high. Devo's the best. If that ball
falls in front of him, it falls in front of him. Those balls are
normally outs. Here, they're doubles and triples.''
</P>
<P>
   The judgments in the field weren't the only ones that didn't
work out the Dodgers' way. The second inning was cut short when
Eric Young tried to get to third on an RBI double and was thrown
out.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Mondesi met a similar fate on his RBI single in the eighth
which scored Sheffield and gave the Dodgers a 4-3 lead. Mondesi was
thrown out when Young cut the ball off and threw to second.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also hit into three double plays, and after going 1
for 32 with runners in scoring position in winning two of three at
Atlanta, they were 2 for 5 against the Pirates. Even if one was an
infield single.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough game to lose,'' Dodgers first baseman Eric Karros
said. ``If you don't play on turf and then come in, the advantage
is going to be with the turf team. That's not why we win or lose,
not because of the turf. We lost because we didn't get the job
done.''

LAPD'S ART THEFT UNIT HUNTS OUT GALLERY ROGUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY TROY ANDERSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Amid the guns, stolen stereos and bags of drugs
that fill the LAPD evidence room is what appears to be a famous
Renoir painting of a woman in a red dress.
</P>
<P>
   It is not. Rather, it is a meticulous fake seized from a Los
Angeles art dealer who tried to sell it for $350,000 to a collector
in suburban Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a city the size of Los Angeles, there are 3.5 million
suckers they can sell fraudulent art to,'' said Detective Don
Hrycyk, one of two investigators in the Los Angeles Police
Department's Art Theft Unit.
</P>
<P>
   With Los Angeles' growing affluence and love affair with art,
comes a regular rogue's gallery of crime.
</P>
<P>
   In recognition of Los Angeles' emerging art culture and the
criminals profiting from it, the Los Angeles Police Department in
the mid-1980s formed what would become the nation's only dedicated
art-theft unit.
</P>
<P>
   It has recovered more than $31 million in art in the last five
years _ more than all other burglary detectives recovered citywide
in the same time period. About 400 art theft crimes were reported
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles has not been hit with art heists like Europe, where
armed thieves take millions in art from old chateaux, but the
private homes and estates of the wealthy are frequent targets.
</P>
<P>
   And the market for fakes is enormous, police say.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Whether the unit is investigating thefts of art from
little-known artists or tracking down stolen Monet and Picasso
paintings, Hrycyk and his partner, Kara Clifford, need a mix of a
bloodhound's tracking ability, an art connoisseur's expertise and a
swindler's mind to catch art thieves.
</P>
<P>
   The work of an art detective involves knowing who can
authenticate artwork, expertise in computer enhancement technology,
plenty of patience and the instincts to piece together subtle clues
in the art theft puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   The unit was headed by now-retired Detective Bill Martin, a big,
burly man known to toss off references to obscure artists with the
greatest of ease.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Hrycyk describes himself as an ``artistic
Neanderthal'' who learned his trade from Martin when he retired in
the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have very little artwork at home,'' said Hrycyk, a
plainclothes officer who wears jogging shoes and his shirt untucked
over his 9 mm Smith &AMP; Wesson handgun. ``I think this job has made
me leery of attempting to buy good art.''
</P>
<P>
   Art theft, considered one of the top criminal enterprises in the
world behind drug trafficking and arms sales, is a $2 billion- to
$5 billion-a-year underworld business. The illicit trade in stolen
art and cultural artifacts has increased dramatically in recent
years, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
</P>
<P>
   It is also a crime that goes unsolved in most cases. While bank
robbers are caught nine times out of 10, art thieves are only
caught two times out of 10, LAPD detectives said.
</P>
<P>
   The LAPD's art theft detail has made a few arrests recently in
art cases involving San Fernando Valley residents.
</P>
<P>
   These include the ``Well Traveled Renoir'' and an Altadena man
who is accused of stealing more than 7,500 one-of-a-kind
``Peanuts'' cartoon movie animation cels worth more than $1 million
from a Sherman Oaks animation company, detectives said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Renoir case, Jesaia ``Bob'' Venger knowingly obtained the
fake oil painting titled ``La Loge'' and a repudiated certificate
of authenticity, Hrycyk said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, Venger tried to sell the fake Renoir, Hrycyk said.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 29, he pleaded no contest to a charge of grand theft and
was sentenced to 15 days in jail, three years of probation, fined
$200 and ordered to perform 200 hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Peanuts'' case, Terry James Gilfoy, 49, of nearby
Altadena was arrested on a charge of grand theft on April 20 at his
home. He is accused of stealing 7,500 animation film cels valued at
$1 million from an animation company in suburban Sherman Oaks
called Bill Melendez Productions, detectives said.
</P>
<P>
   A judge agreed there is enough evidence to take the case to
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The case began when Melendez Productions reported they were
missing some of the animation cels from a ``Peanuts'' holiday
special, Hrycyk said.
</P>
<P>
   Gilfoy had been working for the company as a handyman.
</P>
<P>
   ``They trusted him,'' Hrycyk said. ``He worked unsupervised and
we are learning he helped himself over a period of time to the high
valued animation calls and sold them all over the country. He sold
them in New York, Ohio, Arizona and Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   The detectives broke the case using the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the stolen property showed up on the Internet in New
York,'' he said. ``They were unwitting buyers who had obtained the
stuff.''

DELAHOUSSAYE RIDES FOUR WINNERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Eddie Delahoussaye, on the downside of a
Hall of Fame career, won't be part of the Triple Crown drama
Saturday at Belmont Park.
</P>
<P>
   But the 47-year-old jockey staged a triple of his own Monday at
Hollywood Park _ and then went one better, finishing with four
winners on the holiday card, including Gourmet Girl in the $208,400
Milady Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to do nowadays,'' said Delahoussaye, who had five
mounts, the loser being fifth-place Magellan in the $400,000
Charles Whittingham Handicap, won by River Bay and Alex Solis.
``I'm not riding a lot of horses and I'm not riding a lot of
quality stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Delahoussaye hasn't ridden in a Belmont since he and A.P. Indy
won it in 1992. He and First American finished 16th in the Kentucky
Derby this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four like that gets your adrenaline pumping and keeps you
going,'' said Delahoussaye, who was 7 for 66 at Hollywood Park when
the day began. ``I'm still competitive and I want to win. When I
don't, that's when I'll quit.''
</P>
<P>
   His fourth winner, Lucky Raisin in the nightcap, made it a
3-for-3 day for trainer Julio Canani.
</P>
<P>
   It was Delahoussaye's first quadruple at Hollywood Park in more
than four years and his first anywhere in at least a year.
</P>
<P>
   Delahoussaye sent Pico Perdomo-trained Gourmet Girl ($11.20) to
the lead at the rail on the far turn and won the 1 1/16-mile Milady
by two lengths over pacesetting long shot Yolo Lady. It was the
4-year-old's first Grade I victory. Favored Victory Stripes was
third.
</P>
<P>
   Delahoussaye and Magellan were in contention in the Whittingham
_ formerly the Hollywood Turf Handicap _ before the horse tired.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Frankel-trained River Bay ($13.40) rallied from seventh to
win for the first time since he and Solis captured the Sunset
Handicap on the same turf course last July.

`PHANTOM MENACE' REACHING TO BOX OFFICE STARS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Force will clearly be with moviegoers for
several more months at the nation's multiplexes, where it continues
to dominate business and break records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace'' showed impressive
staying power with an amazing $64.8 million at 3,023 theaters
during the Friday through Memorial Day holiday weekend, pushing its
13-day total to $205 million, studio sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day total, which matched last weekend's Friday to
Sunday take, made ``Phantom Menace'' the 24th highest domestic
grosser ever as it edged past ``Terminator 2: Judgment Day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are great numbers,'' declared Tom Sherak, 20th Century
Fox's distribution chief. ``There was beautiful weather everywhere,
so we think we did very well this weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherak said the audiences have been 59 percent male with many
children being accompanied by their fathers. He added it's likely
that many adults have delayed seeing ``Phantom Menace,'' the fourth
installment in George Lucas' saga, until the long lines become
shorter.
</P>
<P>
   Movie analyst Arthur Rockwell agreed that ``Phantom Menace''
should continue to perform well, noting that many theaters have
booked the movie for eight weeks. ``I think there are a lot of
moviegoers who want to see it but feel like there's still no
rush,'' he said. ``The word of mouth has been very good, and
theater owners who booked it are breathing a sigh of relief.''
</P>
<P>
   With moviegoing expected to continue at a scorching pace during
June as schools let out, ``Phantom Menace'' has a clear shot at
becoming one of the top three movies ever. ``Titanic's'' $600.8
million domestic gross is likely to remain out of reach but the
$460.9 million taken in by the original ``Star Wars'' and the
$399.8 million for ``E.T. _ The Extraterrestrial'' could be topped.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, ``Phantom Menace'' broke the 3-year-old record set by
``Independence Day'' for fewest days needed to pass $200 million by
eight days. It took in $13.3 million on Friday, $18.8 million on
Saturday, $18.2 million on Sunday and a projected $14.5 million on
Monday. It so dominated the box office that the combined total of
the next nine films fell $2 million short of matching the four-day
take even with an impressive $27.8 million opening for Universal's
``Notting Hill'' at 2,745 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects for the well-reviewed romantic comedy, starring Julia
Roberts and Hugh Grant, also appear strong with the studio
reporting that 76 percent of those surveyed would ``definitely
recommend'' the movie, far above industry averages.
</P>
<P>
   Universal also posted solid results for its fourth weekend of
``The Mummy'' in third place with $12.7 million at 3,399 theaters,
pushing it past $117 million to 125th on the all-time list over
``The Towering Inferno.'' Fox's fifth weekend of ``Entrapment''
followed with $6.3 million at 2,754 sites to go past $68 million
overall.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's major disappointment came from Sony's opening of
virtual-reality thriller ``The Thirteenth Floor'' in fifth place
with a feeble $4.3 million at 1,815 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Floor'' may have suffered by following in the wake of Warner
Bros.' ``The Matrix,'' which took in a still-strong $3.5 million at
2,521 theaters to finish sixth and push its 62-day total to around
$154 million.
</P>
<P>
   The performance by the top three films, which took in $105
million combined, signals a strong outlook for the upcoming summer
slate, according to Disney marketing executive Chuck Viane. His
studio received positive response from sneak shows on Saturday at
1,100 theaters for ``Instinct,'' an action-adventure with Anthony
Hopkins that will open next weekend at more than 2,000 locations.
Theaters showing the preview drew 70 percent capacity with 31
percent sold out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a wonderful time of year,'' Viane said. ``Success has
led to success, starting with `The Mummy,' `Phantom Menace' and
`Notting Hill.' This is going to be a great summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell said ``Instinct,'' which also stars Cuba Gooding Jr.,
could benefit from the current winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it delivers compelling entertainment, people will go, but
if it doesn't, they won't,'' he said. ``People do want to go to the
movies, especially with all the new theaters, and if there's a
glimmer of hope that it's entertaining, they'll be there.''
</P>
<P>
   The following week looks solid with New Line's comedy ``Austin
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' and Paramount's thriller ``The
General's Daughter'' opening June 11. Some forecasts have already
predicted the first weekend of ``Austin Powers'' will top the
fourth weekend of ``Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   Holdovers took the final four slots of the Memorial Day weekend
top 10, led by Fox's eighth weekend of ``Never Been Kissed'' with
$2.1 million at 2,123 theaters. Fox Searchlight's third weekend of
``A Midsummer Night's Dream'' came in eighth with $2 million at
1,093 theaters, followed by Universal's seventh weekend of ``Life''
with $1.4 million at 1,214 screens and Paramount's sixth weekend of
``Election'' with $1.38 million at 827 sites.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks' second weekend of ``The Love Letter'' finished 11th
with $1.3million at 781 theaters.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAN ANTONIO _ Sean Elliott's teammates drew a line in the dirt:
Step across it or just go home with the women and children.
</P>
<P>
   It was about heart. It was about giving this city something
historic.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott's reputation was as soft and squishy as those Taco
Cabana carne guisada specials he endorsed on local television. His
heart was questioned. His nerve was doubted. His teammates demanded
he step across the line and fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old Sean would have gone into the fourth quarter with 19
points,'' Spurs guard Mario Elie said, ``and ended with 19
points.''
</P>
<P>
   The old Sean saw those lines drawn in the dirt, or in his case
on the basketball floor, and cowered.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Elliott stood at the free-throw line in the
waning seconds of a Western Conference finals game against the
Rockets and all but tripped over it. He missed a pair of free
throws that could have iced a Spurs win. He went home looking soft
and shaken.
</P>
<P>
   But not this Sean. This Sean looked Elie in the eyes during a
final, desperate Spurs timeout in a game that looked like it
belonged to the Portland Trail Blazers and said, ``Give me the
ball. I've got one 3 left in the gun.''
</P>
<P>
   The words resonated through Elie's head, and the metaphor was
prophetic. The odds seemed impossible _ the Spurs were once down by
18 points in the second half but somehow fought their way back into
the game.
</P>
<P>
   This Sean had spent the day as the most reliable Spur, calmly
firing away and picking off Blazers as if he were wearing a
coonskin cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't going to deny him,'' said Elie, who inbounded the
ball with 12 seconds remaining and the Spurs down by a bucket. ``He
had that look.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the same look that this Sean has shown his teammates all
year, the look Elie demanded again Monday when he shouted at
teammates, ``Come on, it's all about the heart of a champion.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the same look the Spurs have craved from their talented
forward for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   During the preseason, Elie got in Elliott's face and stayed
there. His message: Show some heart when it counts.
</P>
<P>
   During the offseason, David Robinson got up early nearly every
morning when Elliott's scarred knees looked as fragile as his
last-second nerve and pushed his friend in the weight room. His
message: We're going to need you, Sean.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, after the Blazers spent 46 minutes launching full assault
on Robinson and Tim Duncan, running the Spurs virtually out of the
building, Elliott knew the final two minutes had to belong to his
deadly shooting gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to hesitate in those situations,'' Elie said. ``He
would look for a pass or maybe wait too long, until the defense was
on him. But he wanted the ball all day. That was the sign of a
great player and a confident player ready to step up.''
</P>
<P>
   It was about a player ready to step across the line drawn in the
dirt. It was about moving beyond the reputation.
</P>
<P>
   After a late timeout when the Spurs still were down by eight
points with just two minutes remaining, Robinson huddled his
teammates and shouted, ``We have to relish this situation. Sean, be
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott grabbed a pass from Duncan with 56.9 seconds remaining
and nailed a 3-pointer to draw his team within 84-81.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after a Robinson steal, a pair of Elie free throws and a
free-throw miss by Portland's Damon Stoudamire, the Spurs were
within 85-83 with 12 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott got a finger-in-the-face scream of encouragement from
coach Gregg Popovich during the final timeout and responded,
``Don't worry.''
</P>
<P>
   After Elie got Elliott the ball along the sideline, Elliott saw
Robinson come open on the post for what could have been a
game-tying shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just looked him off,'' Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott tiptoed inside the sideline, turned, set his feet behind
the 3-point line and lofted a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `My gosh,''' Popovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Robinson: ``You've got to have some serious, uh (nerve) to
take that shot.''
</P>
<P>
   This Sean does. This Sean shot down the Blazers with maybe the
biggest shot the Spurs franchise has ever seen, giving his team its
first lead of the game and carrying the Spurs to an unlikely 2-0
series lead.
</P>
<P>
   As for the old Sean? The fragile one?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have shot it,'' Elliott said. ``I might not have made
it, but I would have shot it.''
</P>
<P>
   Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy, perhaps remembering the cowering
Elliott, said he'd bet $100 to see Elliott make that shot again.
</P>
<P>
   But this Sean and these Spurs just might take that bet. Not to
mention the series.

By CARLTON THOMPSON 
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
MILWAUKEE _ Lately it seems the Astros might have as much luck
trying to bench-press an elephant or fight a lion as they've had
hitting opposing pitchers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once the biggest and baddest beasts in the National League
jungle, the Astros have been tamed. And in most cases, it hasn't
exactly been Marlon Perkins taking them into captivity.
</P>
<P>
   The current offensive stench began to filter its way through the
clubhouse almost two weeks ago. Blame it on Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' ace and personal slayer of the Astros hypnotized
the Houston bats, holding them to one run on four hits in eight
innings May 19. They have been in a trance ever since, hitting a
measly .187 in that game and the 11 forgettable offensive showings
that have followed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't start swinging the bats better we're going to be
in trouble, because the Cubs are playing some very good baseball
right now,'' said catcher Tony Eusebio, who is hitless in his last
18 at-bats and hasn't driven in a run since the day before Brown
put on the hex.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are 5-7 in their last 12 games, and their NL Central
lead has been reduced from four games to one. Considering they are
averaging six hits and three runs in those 12 games, the Astros are
fortunate to have won five of 12.
</P>
<P>
   They can thank the pitching staff for that. The Astros have a
team ERA of 3.06 during the same period the offense has struggled.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros haven't scored more than five runs in any game during
the slump and have been held to three runs or fewer in eight of the
12 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to even think about it,'' center fielder Carl
Everett said. ``All those numbers and statistics show is that we're
human. We know we're a good-hitting club. We know that on any given
day, we can make a pitcher wish he hadn't shown up.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers have been lining up to face the Astros, and the list of
starters who have trotted to the mound during the baffling 12-game
dry spell hardly classifies as a Who's Who.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is rare because most of the time our offense is going to
be anywhere from decent to good,'' manager Larry Dierker said. ``In
the last week, I don't remember us facing anyone who I would
classify as dominant.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you're not swinging the bats very well and you're not
drawing as many walks, an average starter with good control can be
effective against you.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Gardner (San Francisco), Bobby Jones (Colorado) and Todd
Ritchie (Pittsburgh) are hardly menacing presences on the mound,
but the Astros couldn't beat any of them. Russ Ortiz (Giants) and
Kris Benson (Pirates) may develop into staff aces someday. But who
wouldn't have liked the Astros' chances against the pair of
wet-behind-the-ears righthanders, who combined to hold the Astros
to seven hits and three runs in 14 innings?
</P>
<P>
   Chan Ho Park, Shawn Estes, Darryl Kile, Pedro Astacio and
Francisco Cordova also put forth quality efforts against the Astros
over the past two weeks. Brian Bohanon and Astacio are the only
starters they have tagged with losses, and Astacio pitched a
complete game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've faced some people who we should have beaten but we
didn't beat,'' said first baseman Jeff Bagwell, whose .286 average
in the last 12 games looks almost like .400 in relation to how his
teammates have fared. ``The bottom line is that teams are going to
go through stretches like this, and we have to go through it as a
team. The focus always comes back to the offense, but a shutout
might be nice right about now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to defer the blame; I'm just saying that you
win and lose as a team. Sometimes the offense has to pick up the
pitching; sometimes the pitching has to pick up the offense. We're
not going to score 10 runs every night. It's a team game. We'll get
through this.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Astros' offense goes through so many stretches where
the hitters do everything short of assaulting opposing pitchers,
Bagwell realizes the attention will be just as strong _ maybe
stronger _ when they struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We created the monster,'' he said. ``But the full monster
hasn't been out there.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to injuries that have taken Moises Alou, Ken
Caminiti and Ricky Gutierrez out of the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't discount the injuries,'' Bagwell said. ``We've had a
lot of guys hitting out of position, and that affects things. I'm
not saying those guys can't do the job, but Billy Spiers is not
comfortable hitting cleanup (his spot in the lineup Friday).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not using injuries as an excuse. The bottom line is that
we're just not swinging the bats well. All I'm saying is that you
can't discount the injuries. We're missing some big boys who we
expect a lot from.''
</P>
<P>
   The expectations are just as high for the players who are
healthy, even if their batting averages are not:
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bell has seven hits in his last 46 at-bats, only one for
extra bases.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Biggio is 11-for-51 in his last 12 games and has almost as
many strikeouts (10) as hits (11).
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett is in a 7-for-34 rut that has dropped his average
24 points.
</P>
<P>
   Spiers has four hits in his last 33 at-bats and hasn't driven in
a run since May 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to hit better,'' Biggio said. ``I don't know how to
say it more flatly than that. We have to.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
INDIANAPOLIS _ Patrick Ewing sat in the visitors' locker room at
Market Square Arena, grimacing as he slowly lowered his left leg
into a huge trash bucket filled with ice and water.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ewing had just finished playing 40 minutes, scoring 16 points
and pulling down 10 rebounds in Sunday's 93-90 victory over the
Indiana Pacers in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   And it was Ewing who made the big defensive play, jumping out to
distract Indiana's Reggie Miller just enough to make Miller misfire
on a late 3-point attempt that would have given the Pacers a
one-point lead with 16 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   While it has been mentioned by many that the Knicks are perhaps
better off without Ewing clogging things up, Sunday's game was
Exhibit A in Ewing's defense.
</P>
<P>
   Included in Ewing's Game 1 effort was an 8-for-8 night at the
free-throw line, including four straight in the final 51.3 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patrick has been great for us,'' said Latrell Sprewell.
``People have been talking about how we're better without him. I've
always said we need that guy, we need him to play well, we need
everybody to play well. Patrick was great for us (Sunday).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised. Patrick wants a ring more than anybody on
this team. He's going to come out and play regardless of how he's
feeling. That says a lot about his character.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially since he's playing hurt, which is what he will most
certainly be doing in tonight's Game 2 at Market Square Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any other body part could hurt him now,'' said
New York coach Jeff Van Gundy. ``I don't think there's any left,
unfortunately. This is as healthy as he's going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Four times a day, 25 minutes per session, Ewing has to soak his
left leg to ease the tendinitis in his left Achilles' tendon. The
tissue won't heal until he has at least six straight weeks of
complete rest, but for now, while the Knicks are still in the
playoffs, Ewing ices the leg at home, in his hotel room and in the
locker room after games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all banged up,'' he said, managing a small laugh. ``And I
hurt my (left) shoulder, and I got kneed in the quad (quadriceps
muscles, all in Game 1 against the Pacers).''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing is willing to endure the pain, however, if he can milk a
few more victories out of his creaky body.
</P>
<P>
   The injuries have been coming at an increasingly steady pace. A
broken wrist not only caused him to miss all but 26 games last
season but had many doubting he would ever be able to play again.
</P>
<P>
   Then as soon as his wrist began to get better, the tendinitis
began to eat away at Ewing's legs, causing many to doubt whether
the 36-year-old center had enough left in his body to lead the
Knicks on a playoff run.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one expected him to come back from his wrist injury,'' said
teammate Herb Williams, one of Ewing's best friends. ``Everyone
thought it was career-ending. He started to feel good, and then the
Achilles' injury came. Mentally, he went back down a little bit.
And he may still be down. I think he's just pushing his way through
it right now because he has to.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ewing ``has to'' because he's one of ``those,'' linked with
Karl Malone, John Stockton, David Robinson and Charles Barkley as
active members among the NBA's 50 Greatest Players who have not won
a championship.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing and the Knicks came close in 1994, losing to the Rockets
in Game 7 of the NBA Finals. But in this most improbable season,
the Knicks, who were in danger of missing the playoffs with fewer
than 10 games left in the regular season, are three victories away
from advancing to the Finals once again.
</P>
<P>
   It's all about his legacy, and Ewing craves a title and the
attendant acclaim that comes with a championship ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows that embrace (from the fans) won't come until he wins
the title,'' Williams said. ``Why do you think he wants it so
badly? What people don't understand is that he doesn't care what
his role is, and he doesn't care how much pain it takes to get
there. He just wants to win a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   His role has changed, as have the Knicks, because of Ewing's
injuries. Ewing is no longer the focal point of the offense,
allowing Sprewell, Allan Houston and Chris Childs the freedom to
run the floor in transition, an attack that puts added pressure on
opposing defenses.
</P>
<P>
   That was the difference in Game 1, in which the Knicks were able
to whip the Pacers with a 22-8 edge in fast-break points.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he realized that at this point, we're all going to do
it together,'' Houston said. ``Nobody is just going to carry it on
his shoulders. It's going to be everybody doing it together. I
don't know if it was hard for him. All I know is, he does trust his
teammates. I think that makes all the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's a role he consciously made or one we asked
him to make; it just sort of evolved. We're just doing what we do
best as players. With his injuries, it's just happened. Who knows
whether this would have happened if he was 100 percent healthy?
</P>
<P>

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
SAN ANTONIO _ Mario Elie jumped into Sean Elliott's face Monday for
another round of barking. The play had not been called and would
not be for several more possessions. But Elie knew.
<TEXT>
<P>
   This was Elliott's game, his moment. So Elie stuck his mug into
Elliott's and pounded on his chest, pulling out the old chestnut
from his Houston days: ``Heart of a champion. Heart of a
champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, as the San Antonio Spurs took the court for their
last chance, Elliott told Elie, ``M.E., I've got one 3 left in the
gun.'' He grabbed Elie's bullet inbounds pass, balanced himself
just inside the sideline and, with a hop and one dribble, lofted a
perfect 3-pointer just above Rasheed Wallace's considerable reach,
lifting the Spurs to an 86-85 win over the Portland Trail Blazers
in Game 2 of the Western Conference finals. With the win, San
Antonio took a 2-0 lead in the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got 100 bucks right now to see him make the same shot
again,'' said Trail Blazers coach Mike Dunleavy, incredulous that
his team had somehow lost a game in which it never trailed before
Elliott's heroics. ``It was an incredible shot.''
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio trailed by 18 points in the second half, by eight
with less than two minutes left, and by six in the last minute. But
after Elliott's second 3-pointer of the final minute swished with
nine seconds left, he and David Robinson converged on Portland's
Jim Jackson to swat away his driving jumper, Walt Williams' rushed
11-footer came up short, and the Spurs found themselves halfway to
their first Western Conference title.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a good sign,'' Robinson said. ``To be a
championship team, you've got to win games like this. Now, we want
to just go in day in and day out with that confidence, to do it
again and again.''
</P>
<P>
   Having found a way to win Monday's game, the Spurs would seem to
have the right to expect anything. They were outshot, outrebounded
and outworked from the outset. Aside from the frontcourt of
Elliott, Robinson and Tim Duncan, they made just two of 19
first-half shots as the Trail Blazers became determined to make the
Spurs' supporting cast beat them.
</P>
<P>
   They double-teamed Duncan hard, allowing him only 11 shots. He
made eight and finished with 23 points, 10 rebounds and five
blocked shots. But he and Robinson could not control the game, and
less than two minutes into the second half, the Trail Blazers led
52-34.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what our problem was,'' said Elliott, who
finished with 22 points. ``We were sleepwalking. They outhustled us
to the boards and outplayed us in the half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't match their intensity. I'm pretty sure they thought
they had the game in the bag.''
</P>
<P>
   But Elliott hit a 3 (he was 6-for-7 from the arc for the game),
and after a Damon Stoudamire jumper for the Blazers, San Antonio
suddenly took over, flying through a 14-0, five-minute run that
brought the 35,260 in the Alamodome to full roar and the Spurs to
the belief they could find a way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was huge for us,'' Robinson said. ``It got us back in the
game. It gave us a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   But even after the Spurs pulled within one in the fourth
quarter, the Trail Blazers seemed to pull safely away again.
Jackson, playing most of the second half as Isaiah Rider sat out
with a sprained right knee, hit a trey and then scored on a drive
off a spin move. And Wallace, though unable to duplicate Saturday's
breakthrough 28-point performance, hit a pair of jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   Elie and Avery Johnson scored for the Spurs, but when Stoudamire
pulled up for a 15-footer, the Trail Blazers led 84-76 with 1:59
left.
</P>
<P>
   But the Spurs came back again. Johnson hit a jumper, then set up
Elliott for another 3. Elie then hit a pair of free throws with
33.3 seconds left to pull the Spurs within 84-83, and with the
Trail Blazers holding a chance at the last possession, the Spurs
put Stoudamire on the line and took their chances.
</P>
<P>
   Stoudamire missed his first free throw, leaving Elliott a chance
to go for the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``You practice your whole life for situations just like that,
and to not come through is very frustrating,'' said Stoudamire, who
had 15 points and seven assists. ``It was very important, because
it left us with just a two-point lead playing in San Antonio.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurs coach Gregg Popovich gave Elliott the option of sending a
pass inside to gain a tie. Robinson set a screen to set Elliott
free, then cut to the low post as planned.
</P>
<P>
   And Elliott would have had ample reason to abandon the 3 he
thought still in his holster. Stacy Augmon cut in front of Elliott,
forcing Elie to throw ``a Roger Clemens fastball'' that nearly
pulled Elliott out of bounds. But as he regained his balance with
Wallace closing and Augmon and Jackson charging from behind,
Elliott waved off Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for the pass,'' Robinson said. ``I thought,
`What are you doing taking that shot?' You've got to have some
serious, uh, nerve to take that shot.''
</P>
<P>
   But Elliott, seldom known for such bravado, never doubted his
touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just felt good,'' he said. ``Sometimes you get in a
situation you feel like you can't miss.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trail Blazers would have bet anything, or at least
Dunleavy's $100, that Elliott could not have made the shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Sean took that off-balance 3 in the corner, it looked off
from where I saw it,'' Stoudamire said. ``But that's the kind of
luck this team seems to have when they're playing against us. We
just don't have an answer for a shot like that.''
</P>
<P>
   But if there was any doubting him, Elliott said he would happily
take and make that shot again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can do it again right now,'' he said. ``I'm still feeling
it.''

LITTLE THINGS MEAN A LOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ There are going to be nights when Mo Vaughn
doesn't come through in the clutch, nights when the little things
make the difference between an Anaheim Angels victory or defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Against the lowly Minnesota Twins on Monday night, an
eighth-inning nonthrow by shortstop Andy Sheets led to a run, and a
judgment call by third-base coach Larry Bowa cost the Angels one in
a 3-2 loss in front of 20,466 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   After his game-winning three-run homer in Sunday's victory over
Kansas City, Vaughn directed the Angels' attention toward building
some consistency during the series with the last-place Twins.
Instead, Vaughn, who flied to left with two outs in the seventh and
runners at first and second, stood in the on-deck circle and
watched Randy Velarde strike out to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't wait for Mo to do it every night,'' Sheets said. ``We
have to execute and do the small things that win games. We didn't
do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The momentum of back-to-back wins was over, lost to pitcher
LaTroy Hawkins, who entered the game with a 1-7 record and a team
that had dropped five straight.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Belcher pitched well in his fourth consecutive solid start,
but the Angels had to settle for taking pleasure in his 2.90 ERA
during that span. A less- pleasant stat: The Angels are in last
place in the American League West.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher was spotted a 2-0 lead after three innings. Todd Greene
and Darin Erstad, who have started to pull out of extended slumps,
provided the offense against Hawkins. Greene, whose homer Saturday
night against Kansas City was his only hit of the homestand, opened
the second by driving a 1-0 fastball into the Angels' bullpen for a
1-0 lead. It was Greene's 10th homer of the year, already a season
high just two months into the season.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad, whose first-inning homer Sunday snapped a slide at 2 for
18, began the third by rolling a triple into the right-field
corner. Erstad scored on a single by Velarde, his seventh hit in
the past three games.
</P>
<P>
   But that was it. The Twins came in with just 11 sacrifice flies,
second-worst in the league. On Monday it was their biggest weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``A team beats you with three sac flies, (that) tells you how
important the little things can be,'' manager Terry Collins said.
``There were some times in the game when we needed to do some
things we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins didn't fault Bowa for sending Greene from second on a
base hit to center by Jeff Huson with one out in the eighth. The
Twins had infielder Denny Hocking in center, but Greene was just
past third when Hocking came up with the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The throw was a little off-line, but Twins catcher Terry
Steinbach blocked home plate and held onto the ball when Greene
bowled him over.
</P>
<P>
   Collins was more upset that Greene, who is recovering from
surgery to his right shoulder, didn't slide. He also wasn't pleased
when Huson stayed at first even through the throw from center
wasn't cut off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see how Todd feels tomorrow,'' Collins said. ``That's
what I'm worried about. What will it be like after it stiffens
up?''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbach left the game and wound up at a local hospital for
X-Rays, but he certainly played a big role in this game. His
one-out single in the eighth was his third hit of the game. And he
took third when first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz singled to right.
Mientkiewicz stumbled rounding first and could have been easily
thrown out by Sheets, who took the relay from outfielder Greene.
</P>
<P>
   But Sheets held the ball and blew a chance to get the second
out. When pinch hitter Todd Walker flied to left, it should have
been the final out. Instead, Steinbach scored the eventual winning
run.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I turned to throw, (Mientkiewicz) was right between me
and the first baseman,'' Sheets said. ``If I throw it it could have
bounced off his head and gone into the dugout. Then the winning run
would have walked home.''

<P>
   &UR; !text! &LR; ANAHEIM _ Tim Belcher pitched seven innings and received
a no-decision in the Angels 3-2 loss Monday night to the Minnesota
Twins.
</P>
<P>
   Seven innings would have been considered a victory in itself a
month ago when Belcher had a 9.96 ERA and a lot of Angels' people
worried. He was signed in the offseason to a two-year, $10.2
million contract and was expected to provide innings. In three
consecutive starts, he failed to get out of the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference is getting through those early innings,'' said
Belcher, who lowered his ERA to 7.08. ``Once you start to do it,
your confidence begins to improve. So did my location. I stopped
getting undone by that one inning. I was keeping us in game and
giving us a chance to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher's work ethic was cited by manager Terry Collins as a
major reason for the turnaround. In his last four starts, Belcher
has gone seven innings three times with an ERA of 2.90.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work you do between starts can be so critical to what
happens once you take the mound,'' Collins said. ``He had some
adjustments to make in his mechanics and he made them. He knew what
he had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher wasn't flawless Monday. He walked four and twice loaded
the bases but got out of those jams with just one run.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a guy does what he has been doing for seven innings, two
runs will win you some games in this league,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>

Terry Steinbach were minor-league battery mates in the Oakland
organization from 1984-86. Steinbach went 2 for 3 against Belcher
and 3 for 4 overall. He singled and scored the eventual wining run
in the eighth against Shigetoshi Hasegawa (1-2) before leaving the
game after an eighth-inning collision with Todd Greene at the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an old friend and maybe I go soft on him,'' Belcher
joked.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbach's condition was not funny. He was taken to the
hospital for X-Rays and was diagnosed with a sprained right
shoulder. Because it is his throwing shoulder, Steinbach is
expected to be placed on the 15-day disabled list today.

STAFF O FTC IS SAID TO OPPOSE BARNES &AMP; NOBLE BID TO WHOLESALER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Editors: The following is an added starter on The New York Times
front page) (sw) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The staff of the Federal Trade Commission has
concluded that the planned merger between the nation's largest
bookseller and its largest book wholesaler violates antitrust law
and has recommended that the full commission step in to block
Barnes &AMP; Noble's $600 million acquisition of Ingram Book Group, a
person involved in the deal said on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, a significant victory for both publishers and
independent booksellers, which have waged a powerful campaign
against the proposed deal since it was announced last year, does
not bode well for the planned acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Barnes &AMP; Noble and Ingram, a unit of Ingram
Industries, will try to make their case soon to the full
commission. But the commissioners rarely overturn the
recommendations of their staff. And if the recommendations are
upheld, the two companies will have to decide whether it is worth
waging a protracted and uncertain legal fight.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ellen Keating, a spokeswoman for Barnes &AMP; Noble, said on
Monday night that the company had been working closely with the
commission and was providing information that the agency had
requested. ``These are confidential proceedings,'' Ms. Keating
said, ``and we're not going to comment on speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble proposed the merger during a period of
consolidation and turmoil in the publishing and book-selling
industries. Top executives from the company have hailed the deal as
a rare opportunity to recognize great cost-savings through
consolidation.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes &AMP; Noble, in particular, has been in the middle of a
buying binge as part of its response to growing competition on
line, particularly from Amazon.com. Amazon.com, which started by
relying almost exclusively on wholesalers to fill its orders,
remains dependent on the services of Ingram. Ingram has been its
leading supplier, filling more than 58 percent of its orders,
according to Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition would give Barnes &AMP; Noble access to 11
distribution centers, which would help it cut costs and reduce
delivery time for its growing base of on-line customers.
</P>
<P>
   But from the moment the proposed deal was announced last
November, it was denounced by groups representing writers and
smaller booksellers. One group likened it to the marriage of
Godzilla and King Kong. The independent booksellers, led by their
trade group, the American Booksellers Association, have waged a
fierce legal and letter-writing campaign, hoping to enlist not only
the federal regulators, but state antitrust officials as well.
Officials in California said they were investigating the deal.
</P>
<P>
   For the independent booksellers, the worst fears are that a new
book conglomerate mixing Ingram and Barnes &AMP; Noble could ultimately
affect issues like credit, speed of delivery and access to popular
titles that are in short supply. Although Ingram, which is based in
Nashville, is a dominant force in book distribution, it does not
disclose its market share. Barnes &AMP; Noble has about 14 percent of
the retail book market.
</P>
<P>
   The American Booksellers Association, along with Amazon.com, the
New York-based Authors Guild, and others had filed papers with the
Federal Trade Commission urging it to intervene and block the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But the legal case has hardly been open-and-shut. While federal
regulators have been more rigorously examining proposed mergers
during the Clinton administration than in earlier years, they have
taken on so-called horizontal ones, that is, those between
companies in the same line of business, and have only rarely
challenged ``vertical'' mergers involving businesses in different
aspects of an industry, like Barnes &AMP; Noble and Ingram.
</P>
<P>
   Oren Teicher, the chief operating officer of the American
Booksellers Association in Tarrytown, N.Y., said he had not heard
of the FTC staff's position on the merger but added that the
association would be ``extremely gratified'' to see it blocked. For
the nation's bookstores, Teicher said, the merger would be
``terribly anticompetitive.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the smaller bookstores rely on Ingram as the sole source
for books, though the larger stores typically place orders directly
through publishers as well as through Ingram and the second-largest
wholesaler, Baker &AMP; Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Independent booksellers had organized one of the most elaborate
opposition campaigns in the recent history of the book industry,
with so many petitions, E-mail messages and telephone appeals to
the FTC that the agency had set aside a special line just to record
calls about the Ingram deal.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC has been performing what is known as a second request
review, a fairly uncommon procedure that allows the agency to
extend its examination of the competitive impact of a proposed
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Other recent deals in the book industry faced intense reviews
from federal regulators but were still eventually approved. The
British media group Pearson PLC faced this extra round of
inspection for its purchase of Simon &AMP; Schuster's education unit,
which was ultimately approved. Bertelsmann A.G.'s successful
acquisitions of Random House and Bantam Doubleday Dell also
received additional attention.

FORMER POW LEADS L.A. PARADE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Canoga Park may not be Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez's
hometown, but San Fernando Valley residents gave the released POW a
hero's welcome during its annual Memorial Day parade.
</P>
<P>
   Looking sharp in his Army dress uniform, Ramirez led the parade
as honorary grand marshal Monday and then spent his afternoon
surrounded by well-wishers who hugged and congratulated him near
the grandstand area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just an honor _ the whole thing,'' said Ramirez, 24, of
East Los Angeles. ``It's just great that they would ask me to serve
as grand marshal.''
</P>
<P>
   The parade, sponsored by the Canoga Park-West Hills Chamber of
Commerce, drew a crowd estimated at more than 25,000 people to the
community 25 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. They were
entertained by marching high school bands, singing church groups,
roping charros and numerous veteran and military organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez was captured in late March near the Macedonia-Yugoslavia
border while on a peacekeeping mission with Spc. Steven M.
Gonzales, 21, of Huntsville, Texas; and Staff Sgt. Christopher J.
Stone, 25, of Smiths Creek, Mich. The three soldiers were released
May 1.
</P>
<P>
   During a break in the parade, Ramirez stepped down from the
grandstand and was approached by children, parents and veterans who
stopped to shake his hand, snap photographs and get his autograph.
Ramirez graciously complied.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been very happy to see me, and I'm very happy to
see them,'' he said. ``I'm glad to have their support.''
</P>
<P>
   The soldier's mother, Vivian Ramirez of Baldwin Park, was
likewise overcome by emotion by the outpouring of support.
</P>
<P>
   ``My (italics) mi hijo (end italics), he's just overwhelmed, and
I feel the same way he does,'' Ramirez said. ``I'm really proud to
be his mother. I just want to thank everyone in Canoga Park for
being so kind in welcoming my (italics) mi hijo (end italics)
home.''
</P>
<P>
   During the parade, Ramirez said she could hear people shouting,
``There goes the mother, the No. 1 mother.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It just makes me feel real happy to hear all that,'' she said.
``A lot of people come up to me and say that... they're so glad
I've got my (italics) mi hijo (end italics) home and that they're
very proud of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Moira Phillips of suburban Reseda was so overjoyed when she saw
Vivian Ramirez that tears came to her eyes, as she gave her a giant
hug.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was just so great and was a real strong example of
motherhood,'' said Phillips, a mother of three boys, ages 13, 9 and
7. ``She just symbolizes a mother losing something and having it
returned.''
</P>
<P>
   After the parade, U.S. Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Woodland Hills,
presented Andrew Ramirez with an American flag that had flown over
the U.S. Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flag is in honor of his return and for the outstanding way
he has handled himself both during his time in captivity and since
he's been released,'' Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials who attended the parade include U.S. Rep. Howard
``Buck'' McKeon, R-Santa Clarita; state Sen. Richard Alarcon, D-Van
Nuys; state Assemblywoman Sheila Kuehl, D-Encino; and Los Angeles
County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky.

WIND AT SOX' BACKS

<P>
   It's too bad for the Red Sox that the month had to end. There
hasn't been a May like this around Fenway Park since 1986. You
know, the one they still call, ``That Championship Season.''
</P>
<P>
   If you were among the 27,883 in attendance or near a television
set Monday, you probably got a lot of enjoyment out of the Olde
Towne Team's 8-7 victory over the Detroit Tigers. Can you remember
the last time the Red Sox overcame a 6-1 deficit with three home
runs, then held off the visitors with a magnificent rescue by the
oft-maligned bullpen?
</P>
<P>
   The Sox have won four in a row, went 20-8 in May, and increased
their lead in the American League East to 1 1/2 games over the
Yankees, who lost to Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   What happened Monday should be ample evidence that this is a
team we are going to enjoy the next couple of months. The three
home runs, each of which came with a man on base, were off the bats
of Brian Daubach, Jason Varitek, and Troy O'Leary, none of whom
figures to break any slugging records. O'Leary's homer in the
seventh inning broke a 6-6 tie. Is there anything that could make
the Fenway Faithful happier?
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the wind was blowing out,'' said O'Leary, ``and I was
just hoping it was to the wall. The next thing I knew, I looked up
and it was out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were happy to peck away. But the big damage was done by
Varitek. I got in there and the wind was blowing out.''
</P>
<P>
   How can you lose when your starting pitcher has his left
shoulder nearly pulled out of the socket while fielding a ground
ball in the second inning, then demands to be left in? Mark
Portugal's wisdom in the situation could be questioned but not his
courage.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of weird stuff out there today,'' said
Varitek, whose homer also came in the seventh, as a pinch hitter,
and tied the game at 6-6. ``But we kept plugging away. Tip your hat
to the bullpen: Pat Rapp, John Wasdin, Mark Guthrie, Derek Lowe,
and Tom Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough day for Portugal. You have to admire a guy who
gets his shoulder thrown out of the socket on a ball hit back to
him and he stays in the game. That shows you how much of a
competitor he is and how much we're going to need him down the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   Is this luck? After O'Leary's homer, Mike Stanley came to the
plate knowing that the Tigers have not hesitated to pinch inside
lately, but when he got hit on a 3-and-2 pitch by Matt Anderson, it
was the Tigers who lost two players and manager Larry Parrish
because of it. All were thrown out by plate umpire Chuck
Meriwether, who had seen a similar act in Cleveland last week
involving the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're probably thinking about what happened in Cleveland,''
said Meriwether. ``I'm not. Every game is different. I make a
judgment on a situation as it happens right then.''
</P>
<P>
   Said crew chief Jim Evans, ``Our response is because there was
provocation _ two home runs given up. If not, maybe a warning at
that time would have been sufficient. But in that situation, you're
going to have a further incident in the game if you don't do
something at that point. You've got to take action right there. If
he wasn't throwing at him, it's a bad time to let one get away
inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley said pitches that stray are not uncommon after home
runs. He expected one right away, but not on 3 and 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what he was thinking,'' said Stanley. ``It's
tough to say. It was just the decision by the umpire that it was
intentional. I was on my heels with the first pitch. I didn't know
what was going on. But after that, maybe that one got away from
him.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Sox began May, they were 11-11 and struggling to find
an identity. The lineup was not set. Injuries to Nomar Garciaparra
and Gordon made you wonder whether this would be a .500 club all
year. But they reeled off their most wins in May since 1986, doing
major damage at the expense of Anaheim, Texas, New York, and
Cleveland, all teams with playoff ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to come from behind and score 6-7 runs against
major league pitching,'' said Daubach, whom Varitek was pinch
hitting for and who was the first person to greet Varitek in the
dugout. ``But we kept playing hard every inning and didn't give up.
We peck away and peck away and then we got a couple of home runs
for the win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some strange things early and we fell behind,''
said Williams. ``But we fought back, tied it, and went ahead. We're
resilient. The big middle innings by Rapp picked us up and gave us
a chance to get our offense going.''

FIRST-PLACE FROLICS AT FENWAY

<P>
   The full moon was Sunday night, but the real lunacy didn't take
place until Monday afternoon at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   It will go down as a nifty, come-from-behind, 8-7 victory over
the Detroit Tigers, making the Red Sox 20-8 for the month of May
and inflating their giddy, first-place lead over the Yankees to 1
1/2 games.
</P>
<P>
   But it was so much more. This was was ``Pulp Fiction'' meets
``Bull Durham,'' one of the nuttiest and most entertaining games of
this or any season. It was Bizarro Baseball, a Holiday Festival
that included 10 pitchers, six homers, four hit batsmen, three
ejections, one subluxation (Mark Portugal's shoulder), and one
cleaned-out locker _ from a guy on the winning side.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. It might not rank up there with the
locker-emptying of Roger Clemens and Mike Greenwell in the final
week of the 1996 season, but Portugal, the Sox starter, packed his
stuff and loaded his car after giving up six runs in three innings.
Boston manager Jimy Williams said he expects Portugal back Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Old Jimywocky was the perfect guy to encapsulate the events of
the final day of
</P>
<P>
   May.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strange game,'' said the manager. ``A day game, but I was
looking for that moon. I don't know what was happening but there
were some strange things.''
</P>
<P>
   Strange indeed. Most peculiar.
</P>
<P>
   It started with Luis Polonia's big-league popup that Nomar
Garciaparra lost in the sun. The ball landed for a two-base hit
(originally scored an error, but changed after the game, adding two
more runs to Portugal's ERA). That set the tone.
</P>
<P>
   After Polonia's 120-foot double, Tigers second baseman Damion
Easley was hit for the first of three times. Actually, he was
grazed three times.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox got one back in the first (Nomar's 33d RBI of the
month), but Detroit struck quickly in the second. Gabe ``We Tease
Him A Lot, 'Cause We Got Him On The Spot'' Kapler started the
three-run rally with a Bucky Dent-type homer into the net.
</P>
<P>
   With one on and one out, Deivi Cruz hit a one-hopper back to
Portugal and the righty strained himself when he leaped and gloved
the ball. His left shoulder popped out of its socket
(``subluxation'') and it looked as though Portugal's body was being
invaded by Joe Cocker. Call Ghostbusters.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hurt me, just watching,'' said Williams. ``I guess it
went out of its socket.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal hung around for three full innings, then left trailing,
6-1. While the Sox came back with a barrage of homers, the veteran
righty did some packing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came in to get a bat and he was packing a bag,'' said Mike
Stanley. ``I guess he has some serious decisions to make in the
next 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston trailed, 6-4, in the seventh when things really got
interesting. With one on and one out, Tigers manager Larry Parrish
summoned rocket reliever Matt Anderson. The righty has been clocked
at 103 miles per hour, which is the approximate speed at which
Jason Varitek's game-tying, two-run, pinch homer left the yard.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit flamethrower wasn't done. He immediately surrendered
a single to Garciaparra, then Troy O'Leary conked a 318-foot
pop-fly homer just inside the left-field foul pole.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley was next, and on a 3-and-2 pitch, Anderson drilled the
first baseman with a 99-mile-per-hour fastball. The pitch hit
Stanley above the left elbow and prompted Anderson's immediate
ejection by plate umpire Chuck Meriwether (he and the Tigers have
some history).
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Brad Ausmus was incensed and got himself tossed before
behemoth Parrish could reach Meriwether for his own pink slip.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way Matty's throwing, he couldn't hit him if he threw at
him,'' reasoned Parrish.
</P>
<P>
   From that point, the game moved to its inevitable conclusion.
The indomitable Tom Gordon came on to record his 54th consecutive
regular-season save. Imagine making The New York Times Bestseller
List (Stephen King's ``The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon'') and winning
the Rolaids Relief Award in the same calendar year.
</P>
<P>
   Given their first-place status and the nature of this thrilling
comeback, one would have expected euphoria in the Sox clubhouse,
but the mood was somewhat muted by Portugal. He met with Williams
briefly, then brushed past a group of writers without commenting.
His locker was nearly empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a little down,'' said Williams. ``It's a personal
situation. We'll just try to keep it in our clubhouse. I appreciate
his privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Williams think Portugal will report for work today?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll be here,'' said the manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I've never seen that before,'' said Sox pitching
coach Joe Kerrigan. ``When I was with the Orioles, Jim Palmer did
it once a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal hasn't won since May 9 and his ERA is 5.00.
</P>
<P>
   If Portugal goes AWOL it would not be the first time a Sox
pitcher bolted in the middle of a season. Bill Lee took a hike
after the Sox traded his pal, Bernie Carbo, in 1978 and tall righty
Gene Conley tried to fly to Israel after a frustrating loss in
Yankee Stadium in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   God bless the Red Sox. In bad times and in good, they are always
entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   We can't wait for June.

VAN BELONGED TO BASSIST OF IRON BUTTERFLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(EDITORS: Today in 1st graf refers to Tuesday.)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News

<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ The Los Angeles County coroner might determine
as early as today if the skeletal remains found in a heavily wooded
Malibu ravine over the weekend are those of Iron Butterfly bassist
Philip ``Taylor'' Kramer, who disappeared four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are also looking into the cause of death,
including the possibility of suicide.
</P>
<P>
   On the day Kramer disappeared, he reportedly called a 911
operator from his cellular phone and threatened to kill himself.
</P>
<P>
   But Ron Bushy, the acid rock band's drummer and one of its
founders, said he did not believe Kramer killed himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was a suicide,'' he said. ``That's just not
like Taylor. I've never known him to run away from something. He
just tackles it head on. He had a zest for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart fell when I found out (Saturday) night,'' Bushy said.
``It freaked me out. But it's some sort of closure.''
</P>
<P>
   Kramer's sister Kathy refused to dismiss the possibility of foul
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's lots of possibilities, and that's one of them,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hikers found the remains in and around an aqua 1993 Ford
Aerostar van, which authorities later determined belonged to
Kramer. The 42-year-old musician disappeared Feb. 12, 1995, while
driving to Thousand Oaks from Los Angeles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many things that are consistent,'' Los Angeles
County sheriff's Deputy Bruce Thomas said, when asked if he thought
the remains were that of Kramer.
</P>
<P>
   The human skull and bones were found 300 feet below Decker
Canyon Road in west Malibu on Saturday night by hikers
photographing abandoned vehicles, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Kramer said she hopes the remains do not belong to her
missing brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still hoping that it might not be my brother, but we
feel with the van and everything it may be,'' she said. ``We're
just waiting for confirmation right now, and even though we've been
wanting to know what happened, it's still a major shock.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear whether the driver died when the
car went off the side of the road.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Thomas Schwabe, a member of the coroner's investigations
unit, said Kramer's family is searching for dental records and
possibly X-rays that might contain identifying characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must try and look at as many things as possible,'' he
said, adding that his office's caseload was too heavy to begin the
autopsy Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1952, Kramer joined Iron Butterfly when it re-formed
from 1975 to 1977, Bushy said.
</P>
<P>
   In its first incarnation, with another bassist, the band
skyrocketed to fame in 1969 with its album ``In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,''
which sold 4million copies.
</P>
<P>
   In later years, Kramer started his own computer company, which
he pulled out from bankruptcy shortly before he vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Bushy said Kramer had a desire to stay healthy, doing 1,000
sit-ups a day without fail and up to 1 and one-half hours a day on
a Stairmaster.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities received the call about the body about 7 p.m.
Saturday _ too late to begin the investigation, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday morning, investigators went to the site, which is
being treated as a crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the remains were removed that day and the rest on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The heavily wooded ravine is commonly used as a dumping ground
for stolen and junk cars, Thomas said.

<P>
   BOSTWICK, Ga. _ In 1945, returning from the Pacific after four
and half years in the Army, George Dorsey got off the bus in
Monroe, east of Atlanta, and walked down a dirt road to his home.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, as other veterans of World War II were honored, Memorial
Day services were held here to remember George Dorsey, not just for
what he did overseas, but because of what happened to him when he
returned.
</P>
<P>
   After living quietly and working at a farm in nearby Walton
County for 10 months, Dorsey, his wife and two others, all black,
were shot to death by a group of about 15 whites, in one of
Georgia's most infamous, and still unsolved, incidents of racial
brutality.
</P>
<P>
   On July 25, 1946, Dorsey and his companions were dragged out of
a car and shot more than 60 times because, people said at the time,
one of them, a farm worker named Roger Malcolm, had stabbed the son
of his white boss. Many people said the boss' son had been having
an affair with Dorothy Dorsey, Malcolm's common-law wife and
Dorsey's sister.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, many whites were outraged by the stabbing.
Eleven days later, less than an hour after Roger Malcolm had been
released on bail from the county jail, George Dorsey, 28, his wife,
Mae, 23, Roger Malcolm, 24, and Dorothy Dorsey, 20, lay lifeless on
the Georgia clay.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, dozens of people commemorated the deaths. In a plain
country church in neighboring Morgan County, about 60 people
listened to an account of the slayings and how George Dorsey, who
risked his life for his country, lost his life when he came home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every generation has the duty and responsibility to take up
the cross and advance the cause of human rights, human dignity and
good human relations,'' Christopher Culbreath, a local city
councilman, said from the pulpit Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``On July 24, 1946, George W. Dorsey answered the call for his
generation,'' Culbreath declared.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting six rows back, Jessie Robinson said she could not help
noticing how different the service was from the one given when
George Dorsey was buried. Mrs. Robinson, 86, was there that day,
when no one dared to mention the cause of George Dorsey's death. It
was too dangerous a subject, she said, so they said a prayer, put
him in the ground and walked away silently.
</P>
<P>
   After the speeches were given Monday, the crowd followed a
bagpipe player to the Mount Perry Missionary Baptist Church
cemetery, where the Dorsey and his wife are buried. An American
flag was folded by two sergeants from McPherson Army Base in
Georgia and handed to George Dorsey's nephew, Columbus Dorsey Jr.
Surrounded by graves marked by small, wooden crosses, Columbus
Dorsey shut his eyes as taps was played. His mother and brother,
sitting beside him, stared straight ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1946, the killings made national headlines and led to a
six-month FBI investigation. In the end, a federal grand jury of 21
whites and two blacks listened to 100 witnesses and came up with no
indictments.
</P>
<P>
   The case then lay dormant for almost half a century. The site of
the killings, a single-lane bridge over Moore's Ford, a section of
the muddy Apalachee River, was eventually torn down, and life went
on for the residents of this small northeast Georgia county, which
is still mostly farmland and forest.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1991, the case was reopened when a witness, Clinton
Adams, came forward. Adams was 10 when he and a friend saw the four
people being shot again and again in a barrage of bullets that, in
Adams' words, left smoke and bubbles coming out of their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, then a barefoot white boy in overalls, watched in horror
from the edge of a nearby grove of pine trees.
</P>
<P>
   He knew George Dorsey as the neighbor who came over to help chop
wood and who had run two miles to telephone an ambulance when
Adams' father died.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was over there in the war, he was a soldier
fighting,'' said Adams, 63, speaking from his home in Bonifay, Fla.
``But when he came back, he was just a nigger. Him being a veteran
didn't enter anybody's mind. I know I'm not supposed to talk like
that, but that's how it was then.''
</P>
<P>
   And even though he wanted to help, Adams said he thought that
talking would have cost him and his family their lives. Forty-five
years later, after a lifetime of moving from one town to the other
in fear of the Ku Klux Klan, which he believed was behind the
killings, he told the FBI his story. The case was reopened, but no
arrests have been made.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After the killings came back to public attention, a memorial
committee _ made up of blacks and whites and including civil rights
advocates and the athletic director at the University of Georgia _
was formed.
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception in 1998 the group, the Moore's Ford Memorial
Committee, has laid granite headstones at the victims' previously
unmarked graves and led a march over the new bridge at the site of
the killings. Monday's service singled out George Dorsey as a
veteran of war.
</P>
<P>
   Holding his uncle's flag tightly, Columbus Dorsey Jr. said he
doubted any arrests would ever be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be a book wrote about it, but justice? No, justice
will never be done,'' he said.

NOTES SHOW COVER-UP AT NATION'S COSTLIEST SCHOOL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREG GITTRICH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Lax practices by contractors and Los Angeles
school district officials allowed oil-contaminated soil to be used
in site preparation for construction of the costliest school in
U.S. history, a Daily News investigation has found.
</P>
<P>
   Construction notes and financial documents obtained by the Daily
News show contractors building the $170 million Belmont Learning
Center downtown mixed tons of contaminated and clean soil at the
construction site, skewing tests for toxicity.
</P>
<P>
   The financial documents, &UR;  &LR; along with memos written by the Los
Angeles Unified School District's on-site environmental assessor,
provide evidence that officials minimized testing of contaminated
soil to save money and knew that soil contaminated with crude oil
was left at the site and was used in grading the hilly property.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental scientists from the state Department of Toxic
Substances Control and the newly-strengthened school district's
School Safety Team said the documents, written between December
1997 and March 1999, were never turned over to them despite
repeated requests for all information pertaining to soil
contamination at Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   After reviewing the documents obtained by the Daily News, the
safety team called for an immediate and thorough investigation by
the district's director of internal audits and special
investigations, Don Mullinax.
</P>
<P>
   State toxic control officials vowed to immediately open an
investigation into excavation methods used at the site before state
inspectors ordered construction halted in February amid mounting
environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know anything about this,'' said Hamid Saebfar,
chief of southern California clean-up operations for the Department
of Toxic Substances Control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based upon the field notes we got from (the Daily News), they
diluted waste. That would be a violation of several hazardous
substance laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Groveman, the environmental lawyer heading up the district
team of experts investigating toxic problems at Belmont, said &UR;  &LR; the
documents raise ``serious questions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get to the bottom of why these documents are only
now beginning to appear and determine who covered them up and what
reasons they may have had,'' he said. ``We are requesting the
investigation focus on whether any district policies, and state or
local laws were violated.''
</P>
<P>
   Erik Nasarenko, a spokesman for the district, said the school
district will provide all documents relating to soil contamination
to Mullinax.
</P>
<P>
   ``We concur with the recommendations of the School Safety
Team,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kajima Urban Development, the lead company of Belmont's
construction team, referred questions to Fleishmann-Hilliard, the
public relations firm that represents it. &UR;  &LR; Spokesman Eric Rose at
first promised a quick response but after reviewing the documents
declined comment on behalf of Kajima.
</P>
<P>
   The excavation contractor, Calex Engineering, did not return
phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   School board President Victoria Castro, the biggest advocate of
the Belmont complex, was out of town and could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Scott Wildman, chairman of a joint legislative audit
committee investigating Belmont, said he believes the documents
show a deliberate attempt to hide environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The soil mixing results were done in an attempt to provide
misleading test results and circumvent every environmental
regulation that exists,'' Wildman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These very questionable decisions ... have definitely put the
safety of children in question.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout 60 pages of hand-written, construction field notes,
Steve Croasdale, an environmental consultant for Law/Crandall,
which was hired by the district to monitor site excavation, warned
that Calex's earth-moving equipment was jeopardizing the validity
of soil samples.
</P>
<P>
   Croasdale made his most provocative observation Oct. 13, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calex is using a Scraper 637 (a type of construction
machinery) to move impacted soil,'' Croasdale wrote. ``The use of a
637 will mix a lot of clean soil with impacted soil, which will
make the sample levels lower than they should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Croasdale notes that he attempted to talk to the Calex foreman
overseeing the work, but the supervisor would not stop to talk to
him. Later in the day, Croasdale wrote, the foreman refused to use
another type of equipment, explaining ``he has to use'' the
scraper.
</P>
<P>
   After the foreman's explanation, Croasdale scrawled: ``Their
(sic) will be a lot of clean soil mixed in.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Law Crandall stood by the content of their
documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it as we see it ... We're there for observation
purposes,'' said Ray Hadden, branch manager for the environmental
firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The district has all our reports.''
</P>
<P>
   The excavating techniques Croasdale observed that autumn day
were not unique, according to billing requests submitted to the
district March 10, 1999, by an intermediary for Kajima.
</P>
<P>
   The Belmont complex is designed to sit atop a concrete podium,
erected to transform the sloping construction site to a level
surface. Along with the podium, several portions of the site are
being cut and terraced for the school, athletic facilities, retail
stores and a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, excavation workers used the scrapers noted by
Croasdale to complete 84 hours of earth-moving between June 29 and
July 21, 1998, according to the billing request.
</P>
<P>
   Equipment specifications cited on the request show as much as
36,000 cubic yards of potentially contaminated soil was excavated
during the 22-day period using the machinery.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   That's enough soil to cover 20 football fields with a one-foot
layer of dirt.
</P>
<P>
   The soil excavated during the project was moved from a
potentially contaminated site west of the parking structure and
stockpiled temporarily on the location of the school football
field, the billing request states.
</P>
<P>
   Workers tested the soil _ after it had been moved and mixed with
clean soil by the machines _ and discovered a portion was
``suitable for reuse,'' while some that was ``environmentally
unacceptable'' needed to be hauled off the site, the billing
request explains.
</P>
<P>
   The soil ``suitable for reuse'' was dumped as compacted fill at
two sites, including the planned location for the baseball field,
according to the request for payment.
</P>
<P>
   Similar work was completed with the suspect scrapers between
Aug. 6 and Aug. 21, 1998. According to the billing documents,
workers used the equipment to move stockpiled contaminated material
at the football field to the baseball field for additional fill.
</P>
<P>
   Months later, Croasdale's notes say procedures by Calex
continued to contaminate clean soil.
</P>
<P>
   In a Jan. 29, 1999, field note, Croasdale wrote he had been
trying to keep clean and contaminated soil separated but the
earth-moving equipment used by the excavator made it difficult to
ensure cross contamination wasn't occurring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calex has been making new roads on (the) site so some of the
crude oil impacted soil is being spread all around the site.''
</P>
<P>
   After seeing copies of the field notes last week, Sen. Tom
Hayden, D-Los Angeles, a longtime critic of Belmont, said the
inspector should be commended for ``putting down what he saw and
knew was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The poor public is led to believe that inspection and
enforcement mean something,'' Hayden said. ``But if all it means is
scribbling down notes on nefarious activities that nobody reads and
filing them in a giant box, the public should be angry. This is a
sad story.''
</P>
<P>
   One year before Croasdale's last mention of potential cross
contamination, Richard Lui, the school district's environmental
health assessor for Belmont, came up with a different solution for
the soil contaminated with crude oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``This memorandum is to inform you that no additional excavation
of crude oil contaminated soil is required in the southern bleacher
area,'' Lui wrote Jan. 13, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since crude oil is not regulated as a hazardous substance
under (federal law), no additional removal of soil impacted with
crude oil is necessary in this area.''
</P>
<P>
   A week earlier, Lui told the California Regional Water Quality
Control Board that cost considerations played a role in the number
of tests the district conducted on soil at the site.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to test results for a 1,600-cubic-yard soil stockpile,
Lui wrote: ``The results of the analysis indicate that the
contaminant resembles that of crude oil, which is consistent with
the site being located near the Los Angeles City Oil Field.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Due to cost considerations, eight out of the 16 samples were
analyzed. The Los Angeles Unified School District ... feels that
the analysis of the eight samples adequately characterizes the
stockpile, thereby eliminating the need for additional analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Lui added that ``in the interest of saving tax dollars and since
it has been confirmed that the contaminant is crude oil,'' the
district is limiting future tests to only determine whether
petroleum hydrocarbons are present in the soil.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the safety team, who asked not to be identified,
said Lui's explanation ``flagrantly neglects the safety of children
to save a small amount of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Completing the entire scope of soil tests would have cost the
district only a ``few hundred, maybe a few thousand dollars,'' an
independent environmental scientist confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden called Lui's correspondence ``definite proof'' that the
district knew petroleum-contaminated soil was on the site from an
early stage and still failed to take the proper steps to remediate
it.
</P>
<P>
   As the district prepares to pay $1.5 million for a new battery
of environmental tests and millions more to remediate the site,
LAUSD officials could not immediately identify who told Lui that
partial sampling was adequate.
</P>
<P>
   Lui, who continues to help monitor on-site environmental
concerns for the district, did not return several phone calls for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The credibility of the district is shot,'' said board member
David Tokofsky, a vocal critic of the repeatedly bungling by
district bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still nobody is taking any blame and no employee has been
dismissed,'' Tokofsky said. ``And, of course, (Castro), the board
member who represents the district that Belmont is in, is missing
in action now and can't be reached.''
</P>
<P>
   When the state halted construction of the half-finished complex
in February, Superintendent Ruben Zacarias instituted a series of
environmental policies, including a requirement to remove or
remediate all petroleum-contaminated soil found on school sites.
</P>
<P>
   That policy was recently put at risk when assistant general
counsel Brad Hogin made several unauthorized amendments to a state
Senate bill governing the selection of school sites.
</P>
<P>
   Hogin inserted a loophole into the bill that would have allowed
districts to avoid reporting petroleum contamination. &UR;  &LR; He cited the
same federal law Lui referenced in his memo to avoid excavating
soil soaked with crude oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Lui's letter is substantive proof that the District has
been attempting to use a legal loophole to cover up petroleum
contamination at Belmont since at least early 1998,'' Hayden wrote
in a letter to Zacarias on Friday. ``For this cover-up which is a
hazard to children's health, Mr. Lui should be held accountable. He
should be fired.''

   KOSOVO-MACEDONIA (Skopje, Macedonia) _ If there is an
overwhelming sense that emerges from a walk through the squalid
refugee camps of Macedonia these days, it is despair. Whether it is
the newly arrived refugees who until last week bravely eluded
Yugoslav efforts to expel them from Kosovo, only finally to flee in
the face of dwindling food and unending fear, or the refugees who
have already endured weeks in the overcrowded camps here, Kosovars
are giving up on their dream of returning home soon and are
increasingly desperate to go abroad. By David Rohde.

   HAMPTONS-FOREVER (New York) _ The questions are always the same:
Have the Hamptons become declasse? Have they been ruined by IPO
arrivistes who eat Godiva somoas and chug $40 shots of Porfidio
tequila with their Southwestern Sushi? Have they been spoiled by
hordes of ``day trippers'' who come hoping per chance to rub elbows
with Steven Spielberg at the Blue Parrot, or Martha Stewart at Nick
&AMP; Toni's? Propelled by a bull market and fueled by celebrity
sightings, change is rippling as never before across the Hamptons,
and it is challenging traditional defenses that have long served to
protect the Hamptons Way of Life, many locals say. By David
Barstow.

closed to the public for remodeling. By David W. Dunlop.

   REFORM-JEWS (Undated) _ More than a century ago, leaders of
Reform Judaism declared such practices as wearing skullcaps and
prayer shawls and using Hebrew in services to be the dated relics
of the past, and emphasized instead a focus on social ethics and a
highly cerebral approach to the faith. But in a symbolically
resonant gesture, and with an eye on the approach of a new century,
Reform's rabbinic arm, the Central Conference of American Rabbis,
last week adopted a document that encourages the movement's members
to explore traditional rituals. By Gustav Niebuhr and Nadine

</P>
<P>
   YEN-MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ One of the main culprits in the
global financial crisis of 1997 is sneaking back into the financial
markets. The play, known as a ``carry trade,'' has not caught fire
yet the way it did two years ago. But if this bet does go
mainstream again, it could weaken the yen and buoy the U.S. bond

   SCI-STATUS (Undated) _ Scientists have known for decades that
poverty translates into higher rates of illness and mortality, but

   SCI-FLEAS (Undated) _ Fleas' habits would surely place them

victim, they proceed to harass, extract blood, induce allergic
reactions, introduce infectious organisms and deposit their eggs on
their unwelcoming host. As if that is not enough of a turnoff, the
tiny worm-like larvae emerging from the eggs feed principally on

   SCI-MATING-ESSAY (Undated) _ Because mating lies at the center
of so much of life, it is a particularly important area of study
for evolutionary psychologists. Sociologically, mating affects the
distribution of wealth. Psychologically, it influences nearly
everything from depression to social success. Mate preferences _
how we pick partners, attract them, conflict with them, keep them,
lose them, and then start all over again _ determine who is
selected and shunned, altering our species' evolution. By David M.
Buss.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FAMINE (Undated) _ Hordes of creatures living in the hidden

may be in crisis. By William J. Broad.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-CENTENARIAN (Undated) _ Until recently, very few people
lived to be more than 100 years old, but more and more are living
to extreme old age in very good health. A study of 169 centenarians
in Massachusetts reveals: Only three have had cancer; a
disproportionate number are women who never married; there is no
pattern of diet and exercise; the only common personality trait is
the ability to manage stress; about 80 percent are women, but the
relatively few men in the group are far healthier than the women,
and among the women who are mothers, the ones who had children
after age 40 are disproportionately represented. By Philip J.
Hilts.

<P>
   SCI-HORMONE (Undated) _ By new study suggests that low-dose

supplements may increase bone mineral density in women over 65 by
at least as much as the higher hormone doses now recommended but
without unpleasant side effects. By Nancy Beth Jackson.

NEW FRONTRIERS AWAIT BUSH IN CALIFORNIA VISIT
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ GOP presidential hopeful George W. Bush, even
as he leads the polls in California, has been the political
equivalent of a Stealth bomber here: powerful, well-funded and yet
largely invisible in recent months.
<P>
   But when the Texas legislative session ends this month, the
governor will have to begin to reveal himself as he heads out on
the campaign trail, on what has become the most anticipated tour of
the young political season.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's most populous state, one crucial to the fortunes of
all presidential hopefuls, will see him up close at the end of this
month with a three-day tour of San Diego, Orange County, Los
Angeles, Sacramento, Silicon Valley, San Francisco and Fresno. A
month in advance, tickets are hot-sellers, organizers report.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor will have plenty of company in California
this month. Democratic hopeful Bill Bradley plans an exhaustive
10-day visit, Vice President Al Gore will make his 55th stop in the
state, and GOP hopefuls Elizabeth Dole, Steve Forbes, Lamar
Alexander, Dan Quayle, Pat Buchanan and John McCain also fly in for
fund raising and campaigning. Even with nine months to go before
the crucial March 7 primary, Bush's early successes in California
have created strategic problems for his Republican and Democratic
challengers alike in California. The pack of presidential hopefuls
has been measured against his poll numbers, prodigious fund raising
and long list of endorsements. They will have to battle hard just
for a share of the spotlight he'll grab with his first official
foray into the state.
</P>
<P>
   They'll also have to counter the Bush California strategy, one
which argues that the Texas governor best understands the state and
its issues _ from education to technology _ while also connecting
best with its people, diverse as they are.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is ``suited to California,'' born in Midland, Texas, with
an outlook that's ``Western in nature,'' said his chief campaign
strategist, Karl Rove, in a recent interview with The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an entrepreneur and a risk-taker, and that's the
California spirit,'' said Rove. ``He's demonstrated enormous appeal
to Hispanics, to women, to Democrats and independents.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the next month, he will bring a message aimed directly at
California's issues _ including accountability in schools,
reforming juvenile justice, reducing the welfare rolls, and
maximizing the benefits of the new economy and high-tech industry
to all Americans, Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a particular challenge in California, where Republicans
have suffered dramatic losses among women, Hispanic and independent
voters who consider their candidates as too extreme and intolerant.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush will speak about a ``compassionate, conservative, and
hopeful'' GOP agenda, said Rove. ``The question (he will explore)
is how do we continue the current prosperity _ and make sure it is
shared by all.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the money: Bush has already raised $7.6 million
without even hitting the campaign trail, and campaign insiders say
by the end of June, the Bush camp intends to hit a $15.2 million
mark _ a generous chunk of it from California.
</P>
<P>
   Already, competitors on both sides are preparing to counter the
Texas wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not going to have an easy time of it,'' said Democratic
campaign strategist Garry South, who engineered the 1998 landslide
victory of Gov. Gray Davis. South insists the political landscapes
are so different that ``a sensible moderate in Texas can look
pretty damn right wing in California.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are also taking aim at Bush. ``We've already been to
California half a dozen times ... and the California Republican
Party adopted John McCain as their surrogate senator,'' said Howard
Opinsky, spokesman for the Arizona senator. ``We welcome Mr. Bush
to the state.''
</P>
<P>
   And  &LR; Rival campaign strategists suggest that when Californians
know more, they may not be so enamored.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's his position on offshore oil drilling? Where is he on
Proposition 187 and 209 and bilingual education?'' said one key
strategist. ``Bush has not met with a single reporter in
California, or been grilled on California issues.''
</P>
<P>
   In an illustration of just how important California is for his
candidate, Rove, the press-shy tactician for Bush, recently agreed
to talk about the road ahead for his candidate in California. here.
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  He noted that California's significance to the 2000
presidential contest has as much to do with timing and numbers:
Along with Florida and Texas, it accounts for more than 40 percent
of the electoral votes needed to win the presidency. And an early
March 7 California primary date means ``we'll be here a lot,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But challenges also abound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expectations are huge _ and there is no way they could be
sustained,'' Rove said. ``Republicans are so eager, after eight
years in the wilderness, that they're getting ahead of reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to recognize it's going to happen. ... There are going
to be bumps,'' Rove said.
</P>
<P>
   Californians deeply involved in the Texas governor's effort also
say that he faces frontiers here that are unique to the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He'll face his first presidential open primary here ``without a
Republican governor in the statehouse ... (in a state where)
changing demographics and the cybereconomy have changed the way you
can organize a state,'' said GOP strategist Leslie Goodman, a
friend of Bush's and editor of politicalaccess.com, a leading
political Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have their own agenda for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Choice, guns and anti-hate legislation,'' said Democratic
strategist Bob Mulholland. ``On those, (Bush) is too extreme for
California.''
</P>
<P>
   And a comparison between Bush and Gore, which is inevitable,
will also contrast ``some striking similarities to the governor's
race'' between Davis and his vanquished GOP challenger Dan Lungren,
said South.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bush) never served in the military in Vietnam; Gore did. ...
(Bush) has been in office less than six years, and never had any
foreign policy experience. He's never had to cast votes on war and
peace,'' South said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a first-time national candidate ... and (Republicans) are
slobbering all over him without having heard him give a speech,''
said South, who has had recent talks on strategy with the Gore
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He predicts, too, that California Latinos will not be easily
wooed by Bush. ``(Republicans) can wear all the sombreros they
want, but Latino voters are not shallow and not led astray by
little acts of symbolism that don't mean anything to their daily
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   But the state legislator who helped kick off the Bush tidal
wave, Assemblyman Bruce Thompson of Fallbrook, insists that Bush's
roll-out at the end of the month may surprise all doubters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the kind of leader we haven't seen since Ronald Reagan,''
said Thompson, who along with Assemblyman Bill Leonard began the
state endorsement campaigns which have swept Bush across the
nation. ``He has the ability to convey a message that makes sense
... and people will not be disappointed whatsoever.''

ALIOTO MASSING FUNDS FOR WAR CHEST
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ POOR WILLIE BROWN. Remember when he thought he
would run unopposed? Now his limo probably has a bumper sticker,
``Honk if you're running for mayor, damn you!''
<P>
   Clint Reilly is in. Tom Ammiano? Gavin Newsom? Tony Rivera? All
potential honkers.
</P>
<P>
   And now, maybe ... Angela Alioto?
</P>
<P>
   Realistically, Alioto is four years away, but you never know.
She says she'll run when she has $2 million of her own saved, so
she doesn't have to sell her mayoral soul to special interests.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the dough is starting to flow. Attorney Alioto's specialty
is defending the little guy, and she scored her first major win
last week, beating the stuffing out of Janet Reno's massive legal
machine.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto's client is a Sicilian immigrant from a town just down
the road from Angela's grandfather's hometown. The client is an INS
agent in Illinois who was denied promotion for 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think the INS would know better than to discriminate
against an immigrant. NOW they know.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto says the verdict is a tribute to her late dad, ex-mayor
Joe.
</P>
<P>
   Angela's fee is about $250,000, and she told buddy Jerry Brown,
``I'm getting close.''
</P>
<P>
   SON OF SWEEP: The Central Station cops continue to invent their
own rules in North Beach. I'm told they closed up the sidewalk cafe
action at midnight last Saturday for the second weekend, although
the law says only that booze must be off the outdoor tables by
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   And now a report that the restaurants are being told by someone
that their waiters must earn $11.50 per hour because they are city
employees, because they work on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   So does this mean hookers must also make $11.50 per hour?
</P>
<P>
   Someone Up There in city power circles doesn't like the sidewalk
cafe action. No telling whom. Mayor Brown's office didn't return my
phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   KETCHUP IS FREE: I recently made fun of the high price of
room-service hamburgers at the Fairmont and the Mark Hopkins
hotels. My bad.
</P>
<P>
   From the Trump International Hotel and Tower in New York comes a
note from guest Ed Moose, whose room-service burger was $25, plus
21% delivery and service charge, for a total of $30.25. No extra
charge for the over-cooking, Ed says.
</P>
<P>
   So San Francisco is Bargainville. The Mark Hopkins room-service
burger is $16, plus $2 delivery, 15% gratuity, 8.5% tax, dealer
prep and FOB. The Fairmont's burger is $11, plus $2 delivery, 17%
gratuity, 8.5% tax, yadda yadda.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I never travel without a CPA.
</P>
<P>
   BUM TRIP: A job applicant for the Examiner art department, being
taken to lunch, tripped over a traffic cone near SFMOMA, fell off
the curb, broke nose, had to be pulled from the path of a charging
MUNI bus.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about a struggling artist!
</P>
<P>
   The good news: For once, nobody complained about a MUNI bus
being late.
</P>
<P>
   MORE N.Y. NEWZ: Moose, still on loose, reports that New Year's
Eve dinner and dancing at Manhattan's Rainbow Room will set you
(with date) back $6,000. And a Four Seasons room is $75,000, but it
includes your own piano player (BYO piano?).
</P>
<P>
   At our very own fair-priced Fairmont, the most exclusive suite
has been reserved for Millennium Eve for a mere $43,000.
</P>
<P>
   TU GO, GIRL! At Miramonte High in Orinda, they've got what must
be the most popular Latin Club this side of Latin America. Latin
teacher Mrs. Bisio (been there so long she has Roman-numeral
license plates) has her legions attending bowling parties and toga
dinners.
</P>
<P>
   So revered is Ann Bisio that her students proudly wear ``Air
Bisio'' T-shirts, with a cartoon of their leader in Michael
Jordan-like silhouette, leaping over the Roman Empire.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan is retired; Bisio soars on.
</P>
<P>
   YOU GO, GIRL! Happy column 25th anniversary to Pat Steger,
without whom San Francisco high society doesn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   But all these years of Pat making people famous and nobody
writes about Pat. Did you know, for instance, that Steger is an
aviation pioneer?
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Alitalia flight from Lisbon to Milan, Pat liked the
pasta so much that she asked for more. There it is: First airline
passenger in history to request seconds on anything but salted
peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   YOU GONE, GIRL? Will the Giants move into their new ballpark
next year with a new PA voice? It's rumored they will consider
replacing seven-year mike vet Sherry Davis, the first woman PA
voice in big-time sports.
</P>
<P>
   I prefer Sherry's solid, straight-ahead style to the annoying
screamers most teams now employ. And I cheered when she broke the
sound barrier in the old-boys club.
</P>
<P>
   But if a team has guts enough to buck tradition by hiring a
woman to a high-profile job, they should be allowed to make a
change without being accused of discrimination or opportunism.
</P>
<P>
   If the Giants do make a change, here's how they can prove
they're not caving in to the wimpy bleating of a small but vocal
group of overserved chauvinists: Hire another woman.
</P>
<P>
   TIP O' THE DAY: Looking for a career in a fast-growth industry?
Check into BART escalator repair.
</P>
<P>
   A scary situation Monday, as my BART escalator broke and I was
trapped for half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Lame joke, sure, but my joke writers are all stuck in a BART
elevator.

 &HT;    FEAR OF Y2K A BOON FOR MAKERS OF WINDMILLS
 &HT;    1100&AMP;adds. Moving in (a) national and (l) lifestyle categories
for release Sunday, June 6.

<P>
   WINFIELD, Ala. _ Dusk was still several hours away as Ken
O'Brock tightened the final screws on the windmill he had
constructed on a sweltering spring day in a rolling pasture about
75 miles northwest of Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   If he hustled, O'Brock figured, he could load his equipment onto
the truck with the Ohio WINDMIL license plates and get a good start
on the long drive to his next job in central Florida. As the final
months of the millennium tick down, time is precious for a veteran
windmiller with more business than he can handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing twice as many jobs this year,'' said the owner and
installer of O'Brock Windmills of North Benton, Ohio. ``In one
week, I put up four windmills. One near Athens, Ga. One outside of
Bainbridge, Ga. And two in Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Why this surprising surge in a centuries-old technology? Credit
a more modern technological glitch _ the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
   Folks are afraid that many computers may shut down at midnight
on Dec. 31, when programs that use only two digits to record dates
won't be able to distinguish the new year 2000 from 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Livestock and crops _ not to mention people _ will get thirsty
awfully fast if the Y2K bug stings computers at power plants, and
electric pumps stop sending water to homes and farms.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, my friend, is ...
</P>
<P>
   Demand for windmills has been ``incredible,'' said Craig Donges,
owner of Ohio Windmills, near Youngstown. ``There's a big concern
for drinking water come the new millennium. My sales have probably
doubled this year. There's been a lot of interest in the Southeast.
Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas have probably been my biggest new
customer base.''
</P>
<P>
   Reuben Neely, a retired elementary school principal, hired
O'Brock to erect a 47-foot windmill on his farm outside Bainbridge,
in southwestern Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not strictly because of Y2K,'' Neely said. ``But I
believe in being prepared. If anything happens, I'm ready.''
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Windmills were already in use the last time a new millennium
blew in. ``The earliest reference to a windmill occurs in the works
of Arab writers in the 9th Century AD,'' according to the
Encyclopedia Britannica. Windmills spread through Europe between
the 12th and early 19th Centuries until wind power began to be
replaced, initially by steam power and later the
internal-combustion engine and electric power.
</P>
<P>
   Windmills were at least as important as the six-shooter in
settling the American West. Indeed, they were widely used until the
1930s, when New Deal programs began wiring rural America for
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   In 1854, Daniel Halladay introduced a wind-powered pump in the
United States that is basically the design still used today. A
number of blades are set radially on a wheel, like spokes. The wide
blades are curved and angled to catch even a slight breeze. A tail
vane keeps the wheel facing the wind. The turning wheel provides
power to move a long shaft up and down to pump water from a well.
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a five- to seven-mile-per-hour wind'' to turn the
blades enough to power the pump, said O'Brock.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, windmills _ which cost $5,000 and up _ aren't the
only low-tech solutions to a possible millennium meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a tremendous upsurge in demand for hand pumps,''
said David Suey, president of Dempster Industries of Beatrice, Neb.
``We got caught off guard. Didn't know what was happening at first.
Everyone ordering hand pumps. Then a customer mentioned Y2K and it
came to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The hand pumps are priced at about $500 apiece, and the company
usually sells hundreds a year, mostly to Third World customers.
This year, sales are already in the thousands, mostly to domestic
dealers ``in every single state,'' said Suey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come the end of December, we'd better not have more than a
nickel's worth of inventory,'' he said. ``Unless these guys
(predicting Y2K disaster) are the smart ones. Then everyone else
will be wanting a pump.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales are also booming for wood-burning stoves, kerosene
lanterns, food canners and juicers, water filters and all sorts of
other survivalist gear, said Glenda Lehman Ervin, communications
manager of Lehman's in Kidron, Ohio. From its sprawling Midwestern
store and through its globally distributed catalog, Lehman's has
been selling non-electric appliances since 1955.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of the founder, Ervin said Lehman's traditional
customers are the Amish, missionaries, homesteaders,
environmentalists and the ``chronically nostalgic'' who savor
old-fashioned items like hand-cranked ice cream churns. This year,
she said, the normal business has been ``overwhelmed'' by
``Y2Kers.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Lehman's has taken pride in providing ``same-day
service _ shipping the same day we received an order,'' she said.
``We're now four to five weeks behind (on some items). Our pipeline
is choked. We're not set up for this volume of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the boom has been a mixed blessing for a company with a
motto of ``more than a store, it's a way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want business based on fears of what may or may not
happen'' on New Year's Day, said Ervin. ``We're in this for the
long haul.''
</P>
<P>
   So is O'Brock, an amiable 59-year-old former farmer who has been
selling and erecting windmills since 1968. With his wife, Sharen,
often serving as his ground crew, O'Brock estimates he has set up
500 to 800 windmills, at least one in every state, including Alaska
and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   There are only a handful of independent windmillers like O'Brock
and Donges and Paul Crowley of Ropesville, Texas, who travel around
the country setting up windmills for individual farmers, ranchers
and homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   The windmill community is divided into two segments, explained
Randall Swisher, director of the American Wind Energy Association,
a national trade group.
</P>
<P>
   One segment is the commercial energy industry that utilizes huge
``wind farms'' with hundreds of windmills and turbines to generate
electricity for businesses or even communities. The other segment
consists of folks who have a windmill in their backyard to pump
water or to power a small generator, or have several windmills
scattered across a ranch to pump water for cattle on isolated
ranges.
</P>
<P>
   Swisher estimated that there are 30,000 or so of these
individually owned windmills in operation. But the number is
growing rapidly as 1999 breezes toward 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in business since 1888 (and will) set sales records
this year,'' said James Dockel, sales manager for the Aeromotor
Windmill Corp. in San Angelo, Texas. The company manufactures
windmills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first three months were my best year ever,'' said Ellen
Sattler of American Windmills in Diamond Springs, Calif. ``We sell
to people who put it up as a kit. A giant Erector set, I call it.
With the help of a few buddies, a few beers and pizzas, it takes a
couple of days for somebody who is a little bit mechanical.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are strictly water pumpers,'' she said. Her customers
are ``normally farmers, but not this year. Now it's Joe
Americana.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Or it's Cyndy Wright, who hired O'Brock to build a windmill in a
pasture on her spread outside Winfield in the hills northwestern
Alabama. An anesthetist at the local hospital and something of a
rural maverick, Wright raises longhorn steers and horses in a
region known more for corn and soybeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted a windmill. Now I've got one,'' she declared
as O'Brock climbed down from the 40-foot tower after spinning the
wheel, which measured eight feet across, and drawing water on a
windless afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K issue didn't figure in her decision to build the
windmill, she said, ``but it would be nice to be a little
self-sufficient in case something happened.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was echoed by Pat Halloran, who has a new O'Brock
windmill on his Stone Oak Farm in Oglethorpe County, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've wanted a windmill all my life,'' he said. Rotating atop a
53-foot tower, his windmill provides water to ``trickle irrigate''
a big garden of corn, tomatoes, herbs and other produce.
</P>
<P>
   There is often a good dose of romance and nostalgia mingled in
with the practicality of having a windmill, O'Brock believes. ``Y2K
has provided a good excuse for a lot of people who always wanted a
windmill.''
</P>
<P>
   He includes himself among these windmill lovers. ``I had an old
windmill on my farm and I thought it would be neat to fix it up,''
he said. That was in 1967. He rebuilt his own windmill and has been
building them for others ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times people want to put one up just to look at it,''
said Crowley, of Paul's Windmills in Ropesville, Texas. His shop is
not far from the windmill collection and museum in Lubbock, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
   A retired school teacher, Crowley put one up for himself and
``the next thing I knew, I was selling them.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost of a windmill depends on how deep the well must be and
how tall the tower must be. O'Brock said the tower should be 15
feet taller than any trees or structures within 400 feet. However,
there are exceptions. In Cyndy Wright's pasture, the tower was no
taller than two nearby trees, but the prevailing winds came from
other directions.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brock said he has never fallen from a windmill tower, but came
close once. He had already unfastened his safety belt when a gust
of wind swung the wheel around and knocked him off the platform. A
hook on the unfastened safety belt caught on a tower brace and
saved him.
</P>
<P>
   Every windmill presents a new challenge, he said. And since many
are erected on isolated farms, he often stays with his customers,
making friends while finishing his task.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never intend to retire,'' he hollers down from the top of
the tower. ``I like what I'm doing.''
</P>

SO MUCH MONEY, AND SO MUCH CONTROVERSY 
 
CLAY ROBISON
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ We all know the old cliche about money not
buying happiness. In the political world, however, we can almost
always depend on it to purchase controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The more dollars there are, the more elected officials and
interest groups have to fight about.
</P>
<P>
   One obvious, recent example of money buying misery is Texas'
huge settlement of its anti-tobacco lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what some people may think of him, former Attorney
General Dan Morales scored a huge victory for Texas taxpayers when
he and his team of five high-powered plaintiffs' lawyers overcame
some strong obstacles last year to win a $17.3 billion payout for
the state from cigarette companies.
</P>
<P>
   It was the crowning achievement of Morales' political career,
and he did it without any help from Gov. George W. Bush or the
Texas Legislature. But he was a hero for only a few days before
political controversy over huge lawyers' fees _ which eventually
were to total $3.3 billion _ began to dim his limelight.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks, the number of news articles about the legal fees _
egged on by civil justice reformers eager to cash in on another
opportunity to bash trial lawyers _ had surpassed coverage of the
settlement itself. It mattered little to Morales' critics that the
five outside lawyers were to be paid separately by tobacco
companies, not by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the controversy has steadily deepened. Now, Attorney
General John Cornyn, Morales' successor, has openly accused Morales
of fraudulently doctoring contracts in an unsuccessful effort to
help a sixth lawyer, mystery friend Marc Murr, score a $250 million
tobacco payday.
</P>
<P>
   According to Cornyn, federal investigators also are looking into
Morales' dealings with Murr, who has been accused by other lawyers
of contributing little, if anything, to the tobacco lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Morales has heatedly denied Cornyn's allegations, leaving the
public to only guess whether there is any real fire or only
overheated politics behind all the smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn, a Republican, launched his first attack on Morales and
the lawyers' fees last year during Cornyn's election campaign,
which was heavily backed by civil justice reformers who have worked
hard to clamp limits on monetary judgments and lawyers' fees in
lawsuits against doctors, insurance companies and other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn had recently resigned from the Texas Supreme Court, where
he had often sided with the majority in favor of the so-called
tort-reform restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Morales, despite several political controversies while in
office, was one of Texas' most popular Democrats. And when he
decided not to seek a third term as attorney general, he didn't
rule out the possibility of a future race for governor.
</P>
<P>
   As the dispute over legal fees continued to smolder, the
Legislature was spending the positive part of Morales' legacy.
Lawmakers last week put the finishing touches on a new state budget
that spends or endows $1.8 billion in tobacco payments.
</P>
<P>
   That money represents the first payments _ plus interest _ that
cigarette makers agreed to pay Texas over 25 years. It is earmarked
for health care or health-related programs, largely as Morales
proposed. Some $180 million is appropriated for an important
health-insurance program for low-income children. Because of the
tobacco settlement, thousands of Texas children will get health
care their parents never could have afforded.
</P>
<P>
   Every lawmaker in Austin and the governor _ who also has
criticized the high lawyer fees _ are grateful for the tobacco
windfall. It helped them balance a new $98.1 billion budget while
keeping campaign promises to cut taxes and raise teacher pay.
</P>
<P>
   But riches still enrich controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Two Texas Southern University faculty members in Houston are
suing because TSU was left off a list of tobacco-endowed research
and health-care programs at medical schools and health-care
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Harris County, which includes most of Houston, was prepared to
sue until legislators decided not to meddle with its share of the
settlement dollars.
</P>
<P>
   And the American Cancer Society and the Campaign for
Tobacco-Free Kids are unhappy because the distribution of tobacco
funds seems to be more heavily weighted toward research into
fighting cancer and other smoking-related illnesses than toward
preventing children from smoking in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Garnet Coleman, D-Houston, pointed out that Texas is
scheduled to continue receiving significant tobacco payments for
another two decades. More money may be spent on anti-smoking
programs in the future, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the end of the story,'' Coleman added.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it the end of debate.

TRAVELERS LODGE THEIR COMPLAINTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A recent column about hotel rooms struck a nerve with many
readers.
</P>
<P>
   After detailing some of my pet peeves _ peepholes placed too
high on doors, electrical outlets hard to access, tiny bathrooms _
I asked for your insight. And you weren't shy about expressing
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Among responses:
</P>
<P>
   ``As a woman traveling alone, safety is my first priority,''
writes Mary Lee Archer. ``I want an interior room so that in the
evening I don't have to exit my car in a parking lot and walk to
the door. I check for multiple locks and see that all windows are
locked. I also ask for a room near the desk (lobby) if such are
available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second, good lighting _ a matter of safety as well as
convenience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The room must also be nonsmoking, but it must have been so
from the beginning. Sometimes I have been given so-called
nonsmoking rooms in which someone had simply removed the ashtrays.
No smoke odor is acceptable; I am allergic to tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
NOISE POLLUTION &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the earlier column, I listed one of my priorities as being
near ice and vending machines. But not too near.
</P>
<P>
   ``My worst horror story was at a Holiday Inn,'' Archer writes.
``Everything seemed reasonably all right except that I was directly
across from the ice dispenser. The city had a balloon show the next
day, and balloonists take off about dawn. Beginning at 2 a.m., a
line of balloonists formed filling ice chests! It was simply
dreadful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should add that I wrote Holiday Inn afterward to complain
and received credit (for the night of the balloonists' parade to
the ice machine).''
</P>
<P>
   Riecke Baumann's lodging priorities begin before reaching a
room. A hotel, writes Baumann, should be ``easy to find on the
freeway,'' should provide ``easy parking'' and its lobby should be
``easy to find and near the bathroom since I always need to visit
when I first get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Simple requirements
</P>
<P>
   Baumann stresses practical preferences:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``A telephone next to the bed. Why do they think we want to
get up and go across the room to use or answer the phone?
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Light switches close to the bed, either on the wall or at
the base of the lights, not where I have to strain to reach up to
the top of a lamp.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Fresh batteries in the (television) remote control.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Fire alarms with fresh batteries. I once had one beep
forever, till I unplugged it, because the batteries were dead.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Twenty-four hour room service, though being next door to
Denny's, as La Quinta often does, is fine, maybe better.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Employees who can give simple directions. How hard is
that?''
</P>
<P>
   I share reader Lowell Heinz' frustration when he writes: ``All
the rooms I have been in (except one) during some 50 years have
only had one luggage holder. Most couples and some single people
have two suitcases. Where do you put the second one?''
</P>
<P>
   At 5 feet 7, I empathize, too, with Mrs. Allen Key who writes,
``One of my pet peeves is showers. I'm short, and they (shower
heads) are almost universally installed near the ceiling. Shower
adjustments are also exasperating; the temperature is difficult to
adjust, and the water pressure is so variable that sometimes you
feel as if your body is being pierced, and if you lower it to a
comfortable pressure it stops operating as a shower and runs in the
tub.''
</P>
<P>
   I dare say many of us have encountered reader Doug Acker's
dilemma at trying to sleep on ``a pillow that is narrower than your
head. If you have a king-size bed, why can't the hotel use
king-size pillows?''
</P>
<P>
   Acker also senses a ``total disregard for the business
traveler'' at many lodgings. ``The desk is usually too small (or
round) to work on a laptop, the chair is way too low, and the phone
is by the bed. It would be nice if there were a second phone line
into the room, one for laptop and the other for voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Reader Lorene Windham's main concern is for travelers with
disabilities. ``My husband is left-handed and paralyzed on his
right arm, and we need a room (in which) the bathroom must be
equipped with a grab bar on the left side of the commode,'' she
writes. ``Sound simple? No. At one hotel we were told that they
could not have accommodations for everybody and that most people
are right-handed anyway. Can you believe that? Also, most rooms for
travelers with disabilities only have a king-size bed. Why not two
queens or regular beds?''
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Austin asks, ``Why don't they put decent lights in
hotel rooms so we can read in bed? A heat light in the bathroom is
nice, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there a ``perfect'' hotel room? Perhaps not, given our
different needs and peccadillos. But one of the most significant
reader correspondences comes from Alan T. Stutts, dean of the
University of Houston's Conrad N. Hilton College of Hotel and
Restaurant Management, where considerable research focuses on
traveler-friendly accommodations.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest gripe,'' Stutts writes, ``is finding that the staff
of a hotel are not empowered to solve my problem.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: In seach of Rick's Cafe
 &HT;    For release June 2, 1999.
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CASABLANCA, Morocco _ So, OK, I knew there was no such place as
Rick's Cafe here, but the airport, where Rick shot Maj. Strasser
and he and the sleazy cop, Louie Renault, walked off together into
the mist, it's not there either. Well, it's 30 miles away and it's
new.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Wolfe was right. Even if you've only been there via film,
you can't go home again. The 1942 classic ``Casablanca'' is a
nostalgic, romantic fantasy that has no basis in fact. But we all
want to believe it is real. If you are one of those, today's
Casablanca could be disillusioning.
</P>
<P>
   We want to see it as an exotic place when, in fact, Casablanca _
the 1999 version _ is a teeming metropolitan city of upwards of 3
million. The popular fez and caftans of the Bogey flick are not
obvious.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to see Casablanca 1942, you've got to go to
Marrakech, about 150 miles down the road. While Casablanca does
have its medina and souks, it is overpowered by skyscrapers, by
major business offices, by men with attache cases, by automatic
teller machines.
</P>
<P>
   My search for Rick's Casablanca took me to Marrakech, a
three-hour bus ride through declining countryside and into the
heart and soul of my visions of Arabian nights as well as World War
II intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   Rick, if he were real and still alive, would be running a cafe
in Marrakech _ somewhere off the Jema l-Fna square, a throwback to
the Middle Ages. Strange characters frequent the square, where
charmers still rhapsodize lunging cobras with their flutes, where
aged hucksters recite allegories to entranced young Arabs who
eagerly toss coins onto the storyteller's frayed carpet in hope
that he will continue the story instead of going home to lunch as
he has falsely threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the souk that forms one side of the noisy, crowded, seedy
square, the merchants are at work. With Rick at my side, cigarette
dangling from his lip, Ahmed likely would not try to extract $15
from me for a T-shirt. He would see Rick and he would force the
shirt into my hands. But Rick wasn't there, never was. It was a
battle to get him down to $10 but the shirt probably wasn't worth
$8.
</P>
<P>
   The Casablanca of Rick and Ilsa was created thousands of miles
away, in Hollywood. The real Casablanca of 1942 never was like it
and the Casablanca of 1999 is even further from it. The storyline
was sheer fiction, but it was so good that it has become cult among
American filmgoers.
</P>
<P>
   And, so, you are somewhat disappointed to see the big city, the
teeming thousands in the streets, the airport so far out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the trip to Marrakech somewhat satisfied my search
for the Casablanca of Rick, it wasn't the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Is there nothing here to connect me to 1942, to Victor Laszlo,
to the storyline of romance and intrigue?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it is in my hand.
</P>
<P>
   It is a little blue card the border guard handed me as I stepped
into Morocco. I am told to hold onto the card, as it will get me
out of the country. Get me out of the country? As in ``Letters of
Transit,'' those elusive papers Rick eventually gave to Victor? I
have the 1999 version of the ``Letters of Transit?'' I do, I do!
</P>
<P>
   Then it is real. It is 1942. And I have the documents to get
Victor off to Lisbon where he can resume his resistance to the
Nazis. But I am too timid. I return the card to the border guard as
we leave.
</P>
<P>
   There is a hero in this, however, and it is my wife. She's not
handing back those ``Letters of Transit.'' She flicks her eyelashes
at the guard and asks if she can keep the blue card. Obviously a
romantic, he agrees.
</P>
<P>
   The fantasy remains alive! She gives the ``Letters of Transit''
to Rick who, in turn, drives all the way out to that airport with
Louie and turns them over to Victor and Ilsa. As the plane pulls
away, Rick shoots Maj. Strasser and I join Rick, Louie and my wife,
walking toward the misty runway.
</P>
<P>
   It's something we'll always remember _ as time goes by.

 &HT;    Despite apparent rise, pipe bombs really an old headache for ATF
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett and A. Scharnhorst
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Each case is startling: a 13-year-old
student in Brazil, Ind., is arrested for attaching seven pipe bombs
to a classmate's family cars; two high school students plant more
than 50 pipe bombs in Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo;
someone puts a pipe bomb in a white paper bag in a planter outside
the ballroom hosting the Palm Beach Lakes High School prom.
</P>
<P>
   The pipe bomb, a simple explosive device made from readily
available household items and some gunpowder, suddenly has the
nation's attention. The basic directions for making a pipe bomb are
available in public libraries and on the Internet, and it seems
their use is escalating with each frightful news report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's paying more attention,'' said John D'Angelo, a
spokesman with the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
in Washington. But, he said, ``Pipe bomb incidents happen all the
time. I think the stats show there really hasn't been a huge
increase.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1991 and 1995, only California and Illinois topped
Florida in the discovery of explosive devices, including pipe
bombs, records show. More than 1,500 bombs were found in Florida in
those years. Between 1991 and 1995 _ the last year for which the
ATF has statistics _ pipe bombings resulted in an average of $1.25
million in damage annually, federal data show.
</P>
<P>
   As with many pipe bombing cases across the country, federal and
local investigators still are searching for those responsible for
the bomb found at the Palm Beach Lakes prom at the Sheraton Hotel
in West Palm Beach on May 15, officials said. The case is a
priority for West Palm Beach and school district police and ATF
agents, but investigating a pipe bomb can sometimes seem futile,
investigators admit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike a firearms case, where oftentimes you can identify
where the gun came from from tracing a serial number . . . , there
is nothing that will make a pipe bomb singularly identifiable to
one individual,'' D'Angelo said. ``It's a piece in a large puzzle.
It's rare. . . . You don't come across the smoking gun in something
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the ATF says pipe bombs have become the most common
explosive device used by criminals in the United States _ the ideal
weapon for the do-it-yourself, entry-level terrorist. Pipe bombs
are low-tech, inexpensive, easy to build and, for these reasons,
difficult for investigators to link to the bomber.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more primitive the device, the harder it is to trace,''
said Roy Bordes, president of the Bordes Group Inc., an Orlando
securities design company. ``You can track the powder and the
wiring. With a lot of work, you can even trace the nails _ find
what batch, what press and what (hardware store) they were sold at.
But when you find the (store), can you link the nails to the buyer
or the bomber? That's a real tough one.''
</P>
<P>
   The unsophisticated construction of the pipe bomb at the Palm
Beach Lakes prom puts it at the opposite end of the spectrum from a
device such as the one that blew up Pan Am Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The bomb that brought down the jet was so technically complex _
Semtex plastic explosives with a computerized Czech-made detonator
triggered by altitude _ that only a limited number of terrorists
could be considered suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the bomb was traced to two Libyans because of a
microchip. Pipe bombs typically leave no such distinct signatures,
and the one found at the prom _ believed to consist of gun powder,
PVC pipe, nails and masking tape _ was basic.
</P>
<P>
   Olympics bomb was complex
</P>
<P>
   The deadly explosive device that went off at Centennial Park at
the Atlanta Olympics three years ago was a far more complex pipe
bomb, with 11 parts, including a 12-volt battery, alarm clock,
steel plate, foam padding and two kinds of tape.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say most of the pipe bomb cases they solve are the
result of detective work involving interviews with people, rather
than lab work involving forensic evidence. When it comes to
primitive devices, identifying disgruntled employees, or unhappy
students, or jealous lovers usually is most fruitful.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simple pipe bomb is something anyone can put together,''
said Bordes. ``Part of the problem is that the Internet has
provided everybody with a massive research field. Anyone with a
computer mouse and a screen can learn how to make bombs.''
</P>
<P>
   The bomb recipes on the Internet have been available for
decades. How-to books on homemade explosives and violent revolution
written by radical anti-war activists have moved from bookshelves
to Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anyone who wanted to make a bomb in the '40s could
have gone to their local library and found out how,'' said Susan
Ellerin, president of STAT Resources, a security consulting company
in Chestnut Hill, Mass. ``What has happened is that the media now
has exposed it to people who otherwise might not have been clever
enough to find it. This generation is most able to access
information. They are so computer literate and their search tools
are so sophisticated, they just can locate things easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the brother of convicted Unabomber Theodore
Kaczynski, a victim of one of his bombings and the mother of a
victim of the Oklahoma City bombing made a plea for Internet
companies to purge bomb-building instructions.
</P>
<P>
   David Kaczynski, Unabomber victim Gary Wright and Marsha Kight,
whose daughter died in the Oklahoma City blast, appeared at a news
conference to ask America Online, Microsoft, Walt Disney and Yahoo!
to voluntarily police the vast array of Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Industry spokesmen said companies do what they can, but
questioned whether it is possible to scan the content of every Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't tolerate any bomb-making information to be posted on
AOL Web pages, chat rooms or any other areas of service,'' said AOL
spokesman Andrew Weinstein. ``When we find it, we remove it.''
</P>
<P>
   Go Network uses automated filters to find and block sites filled
with violent language, said Amanda Higgins of Infoseek.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not 100 percent foolproof,'' she said. ``There's an awful
lot of sites out there. The Internet is still a relatively new
medium. There's still a little bit of the wild, wild Web aspect of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Era of teen unrest?
</P>
<P>
   The fear among law enforcement and security specialists is the
killings at Columbine High School in Colorado and the rash of
shooting and bomb threat incidents that followed could signal a new
era of teen unrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that school is about to end for the summer,
so we'll have a cooling off period,'' said Bordes, who in the wake
of Columbine has begun working with Orlando school officials. ``The
$64,000 question is whether we're looking at a major long-term
problem. It will be interesting to see how the next school year
flies.''

 &HT;    STUDY: Welfare reform cut benefits
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ More than 400,000 children and 250,000 adults
lost health insurance in 1997 because welfare reform laws
disqualified them for Medicaid coverage, Families USA reports in
the first national study to correlate welfare reform with health
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the children should not have lost Medicaid coverage, but
few states have taken significant advantage of federal laws and
dollars to expand Medicaid eligibility for low-wage working
families and reach those who are eligible, says the national health
consumer group's report, ``Losing Health Insurance: The Unintended
Consequences of Welfare Reform.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are seeing is the tip of the iceberg,'' Families USA
executive director Ron Pollack said, because 1997 was the first
year welfare reform was implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Many welfare recipients will start reaching the two-year time
limit requiring them to work or lose benefits on July 1, he said,
and families will begin reaching lifetime welfare limits three
years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reward many are receiving for coming off welfare, even
when they get jobs, is the loss of health care coverage,'' Pollack
said. ``And while politicians from both sides of the aisle are
celebrating the reduction in the welfare rolls, they are ignoring
this nasty side effect of welfare reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio's welfare rolls shrank by 26 percent in 1997 and by 17
percent last year when 198,683 went off public assistance in the
two years, compared with national decreases of 20 percent and 13
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Families USA used data from the federal Department of Human
Services, Health Care Financing Administration and Census Bureau.
The report is available on www.familiesusa.org.

 &HT;    'Tacky' is as 'tacky' does
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Sometimes my clothes don't match. It doesn't
bother me a whole lot, but whenever I suspect I've slipped from
sartorial splendor to ludicrous, a little voice from the past
begins to nag: ``Tacky!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tacky'' is a pejorative southern word noted for its
flexibility of meaning. ``Tacky'' can describe anything from the
paint on the front porch floor to your son's new girlfriend's
tattoo. And no matter how it's used, it's always a ladylike thing
to say.
</P>
<P>
   For example: When I was six I wanted a pair of red sandals. Mama
said red shoes were ``tacky'' and only streetwalkers wore them. I
didn't know what one of those was but I figured it was pretty bad
for Mama to get so bent out of shape about it. No red shoes.
</P>
<P>
   One sleepy Sunday afternoon while I was still in my streetwalker
phase, I was playing store in Mama's shoe closet. On a rack in a
far back corner, I discovered a pair of silver and white satin,
high-heeled shoes that I thought were the most beautiful things I
had ever seen. They looked like Cinderella's own to me, and the
temptation to slip into them and wheel myself around the
neighborhood on my old Roadmaster was overwhelming. Mama caught me
mid-spin and hauled my silly looking self inside for a talk,
insisting I'd made a spectacle
</P>
<P>
   of myself and that it was not appropriate for little girls in
navy blue romper suits and satin high heels to pedal themselves
around the neighborhood. ``Tacky,'' she said. ``Really tacky.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years I learned that ``tacky'' in Mama's dialect
covered a broad range of social infractions. Pulling up my dress
and using my petticoat for a handkerchief was seriously tacky, as
was crawling around under the pews inchurch.
</P>
<P>
   When I was nine, I played piano in our elementary school's
orchestra. I loved making music with a bunch of other kids and
found it particularly gratifying when we came out even - you know,
where no one was left playing after the others had finished.
Performing in public was not a problem, unless my mother was in the
audience - which she usually was. ``Psst!?'' I'd hear in a raucous
stage whisper from the first row. ``Sit up straight! Knees
together!? Occasionally, as an abbreviated reminder of my
backsliding ways she'd hiss
</P>
<P>
   that one little word every southern girl dreads: ``Tacky!''
</P>
<P>
   Mama's been gone a long while now, but every time I read the
paper or listen to the news, I can almost hear her comment.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Jones has stopped hanging out in Arkansas hotels, and
during a hiatus between courtrooms has lent her name to a psychic
hot line. ``Paula Jones...Celebrity Psychic Network...Accurate
answers from caring psychic advisors, for life's tough questions,
$3.99 a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Get outta' here.
</P>
<P>
   Joey Buttafuoco (the 38-year-old owner of an auto body shop who
served six months for statutory rape after his 17-year-old
girlfriend shot his wife) is alive and doing well in Los Angeles
where Mrs. Buttafuoco still loves him in spite of the bullet lodged
in her head and he is hosting his own cable talk show and pursuing
an acting career.
</P>
<P>
   Scuzzy living has its own rewards.
</P>
<P>
   Monica goes on Saturday Night Live and for $600 before taxes,
makes jokes about her slatternly romp through the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Class act, dearie.
</P>
<P>
   And let us not overlook Larry Flynt, pornographer extraordinaire
and congressional blackmailer, who recently delivered a lecture in
the hallowed halls of Washington's Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   I'm telling you what folks, if my mama were still here, I could
guarantee she'd be sitting right out there in the front row
harrumphing and muttering, ``Tacky!''

 &HT;    Both sides settle for less with pollution bill compromise
 &HT;    By Ralph K.M. Haurwitz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush, his allies in the Texas
Legislature and industry groups did not get exactly what they
wanted in a bill to reduce air pollution from older industrial
plants. The governor, who led the charge for a program that was
virtually all carrot, wound up with one that includes a stick.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental activists and their legislative allies wanted a
program that was virtually all stick. But confronted with the
political reality of a popular governor and a conservative
Legislature, they had to settle for much less.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this business, sometimes you get a bill that doesn't
completely please anyone but partially pleases everyone,'' said
Rep. Ray Allen, R-Grand Prairie, the House sponsor of the plan.
``Sometimes that's the best you can do.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan received final approval from the Senate and House on
Sunday and now goes to Bush, who said he would sign it. Under the
measure, Senate Bill 766, most of the older industrial plants would
be encouraged _ though not required _ to trim emissions.
</P>
<P>
   However, plants emitting the largest amounts would be coerced
into installing pollution controls by sharply rising fees. If they
don't ``volunteer'' to cut back by September 2001, the fee on their
emissions in excess of 4,000 tons a year would triple annually,
starting at $26 a ton.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in 2005 the owners or operators of such plants
would have to pay $2,106 a ton. But by curbing emissions under a
so-called voluntary pollution-reduction permit, they could avoid
fees entirely on emissions in excess of 4,000 tons and pay just $26
a ton for the first 4,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 800 industrial plants that were in existence or under
construction were exempted, or grandfathered, from emissions rules
by state lawmakers when they adopted clean-air legislation in 1971.
Bush's top environmental priority for the legislative session has
been to reduce those emissions using a voluntary approach. Critics
wanted the reductions mandated.
</P>
<P>
   Bush welcomed the compromise bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``My staff worked with members of the House and Senate to come
up with a bill that will encourage plants that are grandfathered to
meet standards, and there is a little incentive in the bill,'' the
governor said. ``I think it is proper. I'm glad it's in the bill to
encourage those that are still grandfathered to meet deadlines for
the State of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also supports a mandatory clean air provision in a bill
deregulating the electric-utility industry. That bill requires
owners of grandfathered power plants to reduce emissions but allows
them to charge consumers for the cost.

   Bush's chief opponent in the Legislature on the question of
grandfathered emissions, Rep. Glen Maxey, D-Austin, did not sound
nearly as pleased with the final wording of SB 766. ``Our goal was
to close the loophole for grandfathered emissions,'' Maxey said.
``That is not done. But it is more than the environmentalists
expected us to get when we started out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's totally politics on the governor's part. Governor Bush
needs a bill to look green'' for a likely presidential race, Maxey
added.
</P>
<P>
   Tom ``Smitty'' Smith, director of the consumer group Public
Citizen, described the compromise as a good first step. ``But it's
important we lay the blame for refusing to go farther on the
governor,'' Smith said. ``A majority of the grandfathered plants
are going to become great-grandfathered plants.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry groups were not completely satisfied, either. Ben
Sebree, vice president of governmental affairs for the Texas Oil
and Gas Association, a trade group representing producers, refiners
and pipeline companies, said his organization supported the concept
of voluntary reductions. Tripling the fees leaves large plants with
essentially no option, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an attempt to move it from voluntary to mandatory,''
Sebree said. ``And to a large extent that guts the spirit of the
bill. We're neutral on it now.''
</P>
<P>
   The largest source of grandfathered emissions _ lignite-fired
generators at the Aluminum Company of America's aluminum smelter
near Rockdale, about 50 miles east of Austin _ gets a bit of a
break. The bill allows Alcoa to make substantial reductions in
emissions of nitrogen oxides but to forgo reductions of sulfur
dioxide. Alcoa officials had argued that the high cost of reducing
sulfur emissions might force the plant to close. Sulfur dioxide
contributes to haze and acid rain; nitrogen oxides form
ground-level ozone.

 &HT;    EDITORIAL: Milosevic indictment amounts to little
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The problem with justice is that it takes confidence in the
system to produce results.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment last week of Yugoslavian President Slobodan
Milosevic by the International War Crimes Tribunal is an
interesting turn in the ongoing Balkan saga. However, the
tribunal's efforts in capturing indicted war criminals and bringing
them to trial has been nothing short of futile. In fact, its
failure has undermined confidence in the tribunal itself _ thus
making it little more than a sham body with few means of enforcing
its legal activities.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of a war crimes tribunal is an unfortunate necessity in
a world of ever-increasing technological warfare. Previous wars in
the Balkans have proven medium-sized armies have the potential to
devastate entire races of people with lightening-quick attacks. The
massacre of Muslims during the Bosnia War and now of the Kosovars
in the current conflict demonstrate the need for just such a
tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   But, like legal bodies in this nation, any court has the power
to act only with enforcement. It takes a police force to serve
warrants and arrest suspects once a court approves them.
</P>
<P>
   The War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague, Netherlands, does not have
a police force. It has no way of forcing extradition or arrests. It
can only raise its voice to perceived injustice and hope the
criminals are somehow brought to them.
</P>
<P>
   Flash back to the Bosnia War, where Yugoslav forces decimated
United Nations-established ``safe havens'' for Bosnia Muslims.
Bosnian Serb leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic have been
under indictment for instigating those actions by this same War
Crimes Tribunal. The tribunal knows where each is, what they do and
where they live. But the tribunal does not have a force that can
extricate them from Bosnia and deliver them for prosecution, and
thus far nations with military forces are reluctant to do likewise.
</P>
<P>
   In the current situation, the indictment of Milosevic and his
deputies looks to have two possible consequences. First, it serves
to justify the continued NATO air campaign against Serbia, making
the campaign an attack on war criminals leading a ``rogue'' state.
Second, it makes any attempt at negotiations even more difficult to
commence. Any cease-fire agreement with a convicted war criminal
will probably not have to be honored once the conviction is
secured, leaving Serbia, if it capitulates, to the will of
international bodies to determine its future.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to see a generally-respected international body
taking action against a leader who is a threat to his own citizens
and the stability of an entire region. Unfortunately, without the
means to enforce that action, and without the international
confidence necessary to pressure for Milosevic's arrest, the
indictment is only an official recognition of the terror Milosevic
has wrought.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Proposed Ohio bill lets dying patient expire peacefully
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ No one liked it when emergency doctors and medics
were compelled to unleash electric shock paddles, long breathing
tubes and hypodermic needles in their desperate revival effort so a
dying patient might live to vegetate another day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember times when families were blocking the paramedic's
way of getting to the patient or cussing at them or threatening to
sue,'' says Dr. David Keseg, one of about 200 emergency specialists
in the south-suburban practice of Premier Health Care.
</P>
<P>
   But if a nursing home or family member dialed 911, it didn't
matter if a dying patient had made it clear in both a living will
and whispered pleas that he or she wanted to die without frenzy.
Living wills don't apply to ambulance staffs. They were legally
required until May 20 to do everything they could to restore the
heartbeat of that barely recognizable loved one in the fetal
position.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency doctors and paramedics have lost lawsuits in Ohio both
for reviving someone who didn't want to be revived and for not
reviving someone whose family wanted a heroic effort, says Dr.
David Romano, who served with Keseg on the committee that drafted
the new law's rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have literally been in situations where I've had two family
members tell me, 'You do everything or we'll sue you,' and two
other family members say, 'If you do anything, we'll sue you,'''
says Romano, director of the emergency departments at the Mercy
hospitals in Springfield and Urbana and a Beavercreek ambulance
staff member for 10 years before he became a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   The solution is House Bill 354, called ``DNR Comfort Care'' for
``do not resuscitate.'' It means people who are terminally ill or
have end-stage organ disease can, with their physician's
authorization, receive assurance of dying as peacefully as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Enrollment in basic Comfort Care is a choice to forgo all
elements of CPR from emergency personnel. Or the patient can choose
Comfort Care Arrest, which authorizes medical treatment up to the
point when the breathing or heartbeat stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``These situations happen many, many times a day in every
community in the state of Ohio,'' Romano says.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the dominant end-of-life topic in public discussion has been
the debate on whether assisted suicide is mercy or murder, a far
rarer contingency. By focusing on whether it's fair to end
someone's life, we have ignored the far more pertinent question of
when it's fair to save someone's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing written that says the only way you can meet
your maker is with somebody thumping on your chest and somebody
putting a plastic tube down your throat,'' Romano says. ``But for
some reason, people in this country in the last 30 years have
developed the sense that that has to happen to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, he says, people whose hearts stop beating have less
than a 5 percent rate of surviving and regaining their faculties.
For people who already are very sick, that rate is virtually zero.
</P>
<P>
   But Romano remembers a recent survey in which ``John Q. Public
thinks that rate is 60 percent or more. So there's a huge
discrepancy between reality and expectation.''
</P>
<P>
   Living wills still enable people to declare that they don't want
to be heroically saved in other cases when they are barely alive.
They should be backed up by a durable power of attorney for health
care, which authorizes someone else to speak for them, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency personnel now can turn their attention to keeping a
hopeless Comfort Care patient relatively comfortable with
medication, a clear breathing passage, other first aid and
emotional support.
</P>
<P>
   No law is perfect. The state does not provide Comfort Care
enrollees with the bracelets or necklaces they need to identify
themselves. But if they can't afford jewelry, they can still go to
a hospital for a plastic identification bracelet.
</P>
<P>
   It won't save a life, but might save a death from being more
gruesome than it has to be.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Mustang keeps building on its history of success
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps no vehicle, other than the original Volkswagen Beetle,
represents the baby boomer generation more than the Ford Mustang.
</P>
<P>
   The Mustang came to the automotive scene with a fever that has

Mustang not only endures but thrives.
</P>
<P>
   To put the phenomenon of Mustang mania into perspective, more
than 6.9 million Mustangs have been sold in the 35 years since the
distinctive little rear-wheel-drive's introduction. The 1 millionth
Mustang was sold in March 1966. By comparison, the other
most-recognized American car, the Chevrolet Corvette, passed the 1
million mark in 1993, some 40 years after its launch.
</P>
<P>
   Like most success stories, the Mustang is built on a solid
history. If you think you are automobile-literate, here is a

 &HT;    SCIENCE/MEDICINE: Education crucial in managing joint pain
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Even as new medications are relieving arthritis
symptoms without upsetting stomachs, an Arthritis Foundation survey
shows that misconceptions by both doctors and patients are holding
people back from treatment that might help.
</P>
<P>
   The American Physical Therapy Association hopes to educate at
least the patients this weekend when it operates a toll-free hot
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are tips that physical therapists can offer to help
people with arthritis to avoid fatigue and flare-ups and to make
their homes more arthritis-friendly,'' said APTA president Jan K.
Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Many primary-care physicians are unaware of aggressive treatment
strategies that go beyond medications, the Arthritis Foundation
found, despite research showing the value of support groups,
exercise classes and other complementary therapies. The
foundation's own Arthritis Self-Help Course has been shown to
reduce pain by 20 percent and doctor visits by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Arthritis is the No. 1 cause of disability in this country, the
foundation claims, costing the economy $65 billion a year and
striking 40 million Americans, including 300,000 children.
</P>
<P>
   But the foundation's report card still found considerable belief
in the myths that arthritis only affects the elderly and that
little can be done to relieve it.
</P>
<P>
   Two out of five Americans with chronic joint symptoms haven't
sought a doctor's diagnosis, according to research by the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention. And even among those diagnosed
with arthritis, nearly three out of five are not undergoing
treatment for it.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is many people's stomachs can't handle the longtime
drug of choice for arthritis, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) such as aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen.
</P>
<P>
   But two recently approved drugs called cox-2 inhibitors have
shown success in relieving arthritis pain without upsetting the
stomach. Celecoxib, marketed as Celebrex, was the first on the
market, with MK-0966 (Vioxx) receiving approval May 21. Two new
injectable drugs, hyaluronan (Hyalgan) and hylan G-F20 (Synvisk),
also are effective for osteoarthritis of the knee.
</P>
<P>
   By inhibiting only cox-2 enzymes, the new drugs relieve pain in
the joints without leaving the stomach lining vulnerable to ulcers
and bleeding, explains the Mayo Clinic's Mayo Health Oasis Web site
(www.mayohealth.org).
</P>
<P>
   The nutritional supplement glocusamine sulfate has been
associated with reduced pain and increased mobility for arthritis
patients, Mayo says, but it also warns that it hasn't been
subjected to long-term safety studies and that dietary supplements
aren't federally regulated to contain what they say they do. Little
controlled research has been done on chondroitin sulfate, another
popular arthritis treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Fraudulent arthritis products are at the top of the list of top
health frauds published by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Copper bracelets, Chinese herbal remedies, large doses of
vitamins, snake or bee venom just don't work,'' the FDA explains.
``Because the symptoms of arthritis go into remission periodically,
individuals who try these unproven remedies may associate the
remedy with the remission.''
</P>
<P>

APTA is www.apta.org.

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ TEEPEN-COLUMN _ At last, an explanation for the
low-level emotional miasma that I've dragged along all these years
like swamp fog _ uncomplaining, even saint-like if I do say so
myself, in my silent martyrdom, bearing my own angst with debonair
grit. It's all GI Joe's fault. (Tom Teepen is national
correspondent for Cox Newspapers.) MOVED FRIDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ CASABLANCA, Morocco -- The 1942 classic
``Casablanca'' is a nostalgic, romantic fantasy that has no basis
in fact. But we all want to believe it is real. If you are one of
those, today's Casablanca could be disillusioning. (Kleinberg, Cox
News Service) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN02 _ ``Tacky'' is a pejorative southern word noted
for its flexibility of meaning. ``Tacky'' can describe anything
from the paint on the front porch floor to your son's new
girlfriend's tattoo. And no matter how it's used, it's always a
ladylike thing to say. (Schuett, Cox News Service). MOVED SUNDAY.
</P>
<P>
   EDITORIAL-MILOSEVIC _ The indictment last week of Yugoslavian
President Slobodan Milosevic by the International War Crimes
Tribunal is an interesting turn in the ongoing Balkan saga.
However, the tribunal's efforts in capturing indicted war criminals
and bringing them to trial has been nothing short of futile. In
fact, its failure has undermined confidence in the tribunal itself
_ thus making it little more than a sham body with few means of
enforcing its legal activities. (Cox News Service) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   OHIO-LAMB-COLUMN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Emergency doctors and
paramedics have lost lawsuits in Ohio both for reviving someone who
didn't want to be revived and for not reviving someone whose family
wanted a heroic effort, says Dr. David Romano, who served with
Keseg on the committee that drafted the new law's rules. The
solution is House Bill 354, called ``DNR Comfort Care'' for ``do
not resuscitate.'' It means people who are terminally ill or have
end-stage organ disease can, with their physician's authorization,
receive assurance of dying as peacefully as possible. (Lamb, Dayton
Daily News) MOVED.

   ARTHRITIS-TREATMENT _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Two out of five Americans
with chronic joint symptoms haven't sought a doctor's diagnosis,
according to research by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention. And even among those diagnosed with arthritis, nearly
three out of five are not undergoing treatment for it. One reason
is many people's stomachs can't handle the longtime drug of choice
for arthritis, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such
as aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen. But two recently approved drugs
called cox-2 inhibitors have shown success in relieving arthritis
pain without upsetting the stomach. (Lamb, Dayton Daily News)

FROM CATCH TO FINISH, CATFISH IS GREAT EATING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RALPH WININGHAM  
 c.1999 San Express Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN MARCOS, Texas _ In about twice the time it takes to read
this paragraph, old Uncle Willis could skin, clip off the fins,
behead and remove the insides of a three-pound channel catfish.
</P>
<P>
   Working at a fish cleaning shop and processing a couple tons of
fish a week finely honed his skill to a point he was like a machine
_ a very smelly machine.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, many people who fish have lost the knack or
desire to clean their own catch, and others were never taught the
proper technique.
</P>
<P>
   Doing their best to change that situation, at least with the
younger fishing generation, is the Texas Agriculture Extension
Service with it's recently created Texas 4-H Sportfishing Program.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Hysmith and Brian Triplett, both county extension agents,
were demonstrated part of the program recently at the 4th annual
Texas Fly Fishing and Outdoor Show at Southwest Texas University's
Aquarena Springs in San Marcos.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing wrong with harvesting fish as a food
source,'' Triplett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting a lot of kids involved, some of whom don't have
a chance to learn from their father or grandfather,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that the program is a long-term, community-based
sportfishing and aquatic resources education effort that teaches
such skills as freshwater and saltwater angling, tackle crafting,
aquatic ecology, resource management and ethics _ and the basics of
how to clean a fish.
</P>
<P>
   Hysmith, who is based in College Station, carefully explains
that the whiskered cats are popular for both catching and eating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Channel cats are the most popular and are readily identifiable
because of their forked tail,'' he said, explaining that other
species in Texas include bullheads, flatheads and blues.
</P>
<P>
   The cleaning process starts the same for any catfish, with the
cleaner grabbing the freshly killed fish by the head, avoiding the
spines on the dorsal and pectoral fins.
</P>
<P>
   ``These spines will jab you and they hurt a lot. Each spine has
little barbs, just like a sting ray barb,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hysmith added that any fish whose gills have turned white should
be avoided as having been dead too long and may not be safe to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Holding the head with your fingers and thumbs wrapped around the
back of the pectoral fins, carefully avoiding the dorsal spine, the
cleaner uses a sharp fillet knife to cut through the skin behind
the fish's head, around the pectoral fins and down across its
belly.
</P>
<P>
   The dorsal fin is then removed by cutting at an angle on both
sides of the fin and pulling it out with a pair of skinning pliers.
The same pliers are then used to grab the cut skin, which is pulled
away from the flesh toward the tail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the skin comes off in one piece and other times you
have to pull it off a little at a time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The anal and pelvic fins are removed the same way as the dorsal
fin, and most people leave on the tail fin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be sure to save the stomach area. That is where they get the
catfish nuggets you buy at the store,'' Hysmith said.
</P>
<P>
   Firmly gripping the body of the skinned fish with one hand and
pulling up on the head of the fish with the other, the head and
most of the intestines are removed as the head breaks free from the
body.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skinning a fish is quite a process, but it just takes
practice,'' Hysmith said.
</P>
<P>
   Eating a mess of catfish is the ultimate goal of going through
the trouble of cleaning them, with a multitude of recipes available
for a fine fish meal.
</P>
<P>
   One of the easiest, although it can make you believe the kitchen
is on fire, is the following recipe for blackened catfish.
</P>
<P>
   If you try to cook this in your kitchen, make sure the exhaust
fan is going full blast.
</P>
<P>
   I prefer to use a propane cooker on the deck or at the camp
site, but do whatever makes you happy and gets the job done. (Be
advised: this is a hot and spicy dish.)

   BLACKENED CATFISH
</P>
<P>
   6 catfish fillets
</P>
<P>
   2 tbsp paprika
</P>
<P>
   2 tsp salt
</P>
<P>
   2 tsp lemon pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 tsp garlic powder
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 tsp cayenne pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 tsp black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 tsp basil
</P>
<P>
   1 tsp onion powder
</P>
<P>
   1 tsp thyme
</P>
<P>
   1 cup butter
</P>
<P>
   Mix all spices in a large bowl and set aside. Melt butter and
pour into another large bowl. Dip fillets into melted butter, then
coat both sides with spice mix. Place coated fillets on a sheet of
waxed paper. Heat a cast iron skillet over high heat about 10
minutes or until skillet is very hot. Place three fillets at a time
in the skillet and drizzle with about 1 tablespoon of butter for
each fillet. Cook on high heat for about two minutes per side. The
cooking fillets will smoke, a lot, so preparing this dish outside
is highly recommended.

TIME FOR SILENCE FROM THE NRA 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ His name is Chet. He lives in an outer Albany
suburb. He called me to complain about gun control.
</P>
<P>
   There should be no restrictions whatever on gun ownership, Chet
was saying. Guns aren't the problem. People are the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Are you in the National Rifle Association, I asked him? Sure.
Well, I let him know that it looks like he and his pals are on the
verge of some real unpleasantness. And that has less to do with the
justice of their position than with their tactics. According to all
the polls, people are losing patience with the NRA's intransigence.
Keep it up, and it won't be long before NRA stands for ``Not
Relevant Anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution gives
citizens a presumptive right to own guns. Some of the gun-control
people will argue that, because of the amendment's wording, that
right applies not to individuals but to state militias. They're
wrong. The Supreme Court of the United States ruled years ago that
the right of gun ownership applies to people, not to institutions.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean, however, that the right to own a gun can't be
reasonably regulated, or shouldn't be. Regulation becomes
unconstitutional only when it's so oppressive that it infringes
upon the basic right itself.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same deal with abortion, by the way. That's why the
current abortion debate focuses on the edges of the issue _ on
parental notification, late-term abortions and public funding for
them. The basic right to an abortion _ whether you like it or not,
and most people wince at it _ is settled law.
</P>
<P>
   The abortion rights crowd fights all that fiercely, the same way
the NRA fights any attempt at regulating gun ownership. In their
tactics and their stark, mindless terror that their rights somehow
will be taken away, these two groups resemble one another more than
they differ.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the problem. Three in five Americans call themselves
moderates. But the terms of political debate in this society seem
increasingly set by the extremists on both sides. It's when the
extremists become too shrill that people in the middle begin to
press for concrete action from their politicians. That's when
things get nasty.
</P>
<P>
   Generally politicians are content to sit back, collect campaign
dollars from pressure groups and maintain the status quo so the
money keeps rolling in. It's only when public pressure on them
mounts that they'll actually take action on controversial issues.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened with tobacco. The tobacco industry, like
the NRA, was giving heavily to Republicans. So the Democrats began
a drumbeat against tobacco use. They were so successful in fanning
the flames of people in the middle that, eventually, the
Republicans turned their backs on their contributors and hopped on
board.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with schoolchildren with guns popping into class, the same
thing is happening with guns. The Senate, controlled by
Republicans, recently passed gun-control legislation it had
rejected just a week earlier. And gun-control forces are rubbing
their hands together in glee as this debate intensifies.
</P>
<P>
   At the root of all this is the fear of many honest, law-abiding
gun owners that federal agents in black helicopters will land in
their front yards one morning and confiscate their firearms.
That'll never happen, even though some gun-control fans unabashedly
would love to see it.
</P>
<P>
   But gun nuts running around proclaiming their love for weaponry
and their opposition to any regulation, no matter how modest or
reasonable, hurt their cause rather than help it.
</P>
<P>
   I've been around politics a long time. I've seen this stuff
before. You don't convince people by infuriating them. If Chet and
his buddies want to avoid some bruising defeats, it's time to adopt
a new tactic:
</P>
<P>
   Just shut up.
</P>
<P>

SCONCES ADD FLAIR TO ANY ROOM, INDOORS OR OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Wall sconces add ambience to any room, including
the patio.
</P>
<P>
   The term sconce is used to describe a variety of lighting
devices. It is most commonly associated with a wall light that
generally features sockets for candles that are fixed to a shelf or
tray that projects from a back plate.
</P>
<P>
   Sconces can also have one or more branches of light with candle
sockets and a broad lip or circular collar to catch the dripping
wax.
</P>
<P>
   These wall lighting fixtures evolved from the candle and back
plate brackets used in medieval times, where they illuminated walls
from castles to more humble dwellings.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the centuries, various materials have been used for
wall sconces, including wrought iron, pewter, silver, copper,
brass, carved wood, gilded wood and glazed earthenware.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until the second half of the 17th century that carvers
and gilders began enhancing the basic elements of the sconce
(candleholder and back plate) with more decorative elements.
Backing the sconce with mirrored glass doubled the candle power.
</P>
<P>
   Sconces were also decoratively painted, gilded and japanned
(varnished with a special type of lacquer). Some even featured a
needlework back plate surrounded by a shaped or molded wood frame.
</P>
<P>
   From the late 17th century through the middle of the 18th
century, sconces were sometimes referred to as girandole (a
branched candleholder often attached to a wall mirror). Girandoles
were originally symbols of luxury and opulence.
</P>
<P>
   Girandoles feature very elaborate brackets with lights and often
with branched candlesticks.
</P>
<P>
   The revival of the rococo style in the mid-19th century restored
the elaboration of the girandole. The sconce evolved into a gas
bracket during the Victorian era and was wired for electricity for
the revival of period furnishings in the Edwardian era.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the electric sconce is often outfitted with a
candle-flame bulb (and perhaps decorator shades) and faux cardboard
candles replete with make-believe melting wax.
</P>
<P>
   Sconces also come in a variety of contemporary designs, from
frosted glass to durable resins, that bear no resemblance to their
ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   Expect to pay $30 or more for a candle sconce, and from $60 up
to $400 or more for an electric version.

INLAYS TURN FLOORS INTO SHOWPIECES 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Photo available on Wieck database)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Inlaid floors have become a popular decorating
trend for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Custom wood floors add so much beauty to a home,'' said Ed
Korczak, executive director of the National Wood Flooring
Association in Ellisville, Mo. ``Customizing wood floors is a great
way to show off your sense of style.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Korczak, adding inlay to wooden floors may make a
room appear larger or complement a certain look, from country to
contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   Inlay is the art of arranging wood pieces and other materials
such as tile, marble, stone and metal into geometric or free-form
patterns and designs.
</P>
<P>
   Historic Floors of Oshkosh in Winneconne, Wis., founded in 1991,
features a catalog of inlaid medallions and borders to customize
hardwood floors. The company also specializes in custom-order
designs.
</P>
<P>
   Customers send floor samples for the company's designers to
duplicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than 90 percent of the inlay work that we do goes into
new homes,'' said Dick Norton, marketing manager for Oshkosh.
``About seven years ago, we were only doing border replacements for
worn-out floors from the turn of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   All designs are factory assembled and ready for glue-down
installation and finishing at the job site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of modern technology, the saws that are used to cut
wood are very high-tech,'' Norton said. Laser technology, which is
computer-directed, cuts finer curves than most straight saws, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, it's a piece of cake to cut something like a delicate
rose pattern or any other intricate design,'' Norton said.
</P>
<P>
   Historic Floors by Oshkosh has designed some high-profile
floors, including the sound stage for ``Saturday Night Live'' and
floors for the films ``Meet Joe Black'' and ``The Perfect Murder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done work all over the world,'' Norton said. ``We
reproduced an exact replica of a blackened and distressed castle
floor and a $3,000 inlay medallion for a ceiling in a house in
Canada to conceal a pull-down stair.''
</P>
<P>
   Designs are based on anything from photos and fabric to
staircases or favorite flowers and plants. Ivy is very popular for
outlining eating areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't feel that you have to use inlay designs through the
whole house,'' Norton said. ``Medallions are perfect if you have
the space or wish to mirror the shape of the ceiling.''
</P>
<P>
   Borders can be just as decorative, especially when they are used
to define an area, Norton explained. ``Homeowners like to use them
to separate one room from another or just to define an area in a
large room.''
</P>
<P>
   They also work well in front of fireplaces and stair landings or
to patch in where a wall has been removed during renovation.
</P>
<P>
   Color is achieved by combining woods: maple for white tones,
poplar for pale green, red oak for a pinkish cast, mahogany for
browns, walnut for dark brown, yellowheart for yellow and
purpleheart for grape tones.
</P>
<P>
   ``For colors such as blue and red, the wood must be impregnated
with the color,'' Norton said. ``This way if you refinish the floor
by sanding it down, you'll never lose the color.''
</P>
<P>
   Wooden floors in general are considered a good investment to
help a house hold its value and sell faster and for more money,
according to a recent nationwide survey of residential real estate
agents by the National Wood Flooring Association.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Nichols, owner of the Wood Floor Store in Latham, N.Y.,
said that hardwood floors are practical for allergy suffers,
because wood doesn't harbor dust and microorganisms as other floor
coverings do.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can also refinish and repair a wood floor,'' Nichols said.
</P>
<P>
   They also are timeless and resilient, which can reduce body
fatigue, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one place you don't want to install a hardwood floor is
over concrete in the basement,'' advised David Hartson, co-owner
with Tony Poutre of P&AMP;H Premiere Hardwood Floors in Albany.
``There, you should look to a machine-made wooden floor, where the
layers of wood are laminated and stabilized so it's not affected by
humidity and warp.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping hardwood floors clean is a must because sand and grit
act like sandpaper. High-gloss finishes tend to show scuff marks,
scratches, traffic areas and dirt more readily than satin finishes,
according to the National Wood Flooring Association. A softer
finish reveals the natural character, color and grain of the wood
more readily than a gloss finish.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on wear and tear, a wooden floor shouldn't have to be
buffed out and recoated for at least five to seven years, Hartson
said.

AUTHOR SEEKS WRITING HAVEN WITH A VIEW OF MISERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM O'BRIEN  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN, N.Y. _ In the foothills of Misery Mountain, on land
where he spent boyhood summers, author Caleb Carr is planning to
restore an 18th-century farmhouse as a writing haven.
</P>
<P>
   Carr, author of the historical thrillers ``The Alienist'' and
``Angel of Darkness,'' bought the 1,560-acre property in April for
$975,000.
</P>
<P>
   To Carr, who spent summers in Cherry Plain, it is more like
home. The land was owned by his great-aunt, Emily Henrotin, but
left the family when she died in the mid-1960s. His mother, whose
family bought the neighboring farm in the 1950s, still lives down
the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all sort of comes full circle,'' said Carr, 43. ``It had
always been a dream of everyone in the family to buy the place and
get it back in the family.'' Carr purchased the property from the
estate of Hazard E. Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   As he graciously showed off the property one recent day, Carr
made clear his love for its location in the Taconic foothills of
eartern New York. The farmhouse nestles in a remote corner, more
than a mile down a dirt road, with the sounds of a nearby creek
rushing by. The property ends at the Massachusetts border, and it
includes Misery Mountain _ named for its three ragged peaks that
have challenged many a climber _ and another, closer mountain
nearby that is unnamed.
</P>
<P>
   The farmhouse has been largely empty since the 1960s, and it is
in need of considerable work. Its dining room is a marvel, a step
back in time to the mid-18th century, and three other rooms are
original.
</P>
<P>
   A three-bay garage out back is dilapidated, and two barns
elsewhere on the property are in need of serious repair.
</P>
<P>
   ``The task of putting it back on its feet is really daunting,''
Carr said. He has an engineer coming to evaluate the property and
tell him how much it will cost to restore it to working order.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everything can be salvaged. It'll take quite a bit of
time,'' he said. ``I would like to spend as much time as I can up
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr fought off an attempt by New York state to acquire the
land: The Taconic Trail runs across the top of the property.
</P>
<P>
   ``With that, they'd want access from down here,'' he said.
``It's always been a farm, not a recreational site, so I've been
trying to re-establish it as a farm.''
</P>
<P>
   Leo Goodermote is a farmer who works some of the land. The
author won't work the rest himself, but he wants to see it thrive
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``There really aren't many places like this left anywhere unless
you want to go out to Montana,'' he said. ``For me, it being a
fairly easy drive down to New York, that mattered a lot. The family
history did matter because I have very fond memories of our
great-aunt. When the farm was up and running, they would let us
come here and work on it. It was really the center of activity in
this town. It's very reminiscent of another time. That's what I
like about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Carr has an apartment in New York City, and between books he
often works rewriting scripts in Los Angeles. He says he is ready
to write a third novel, though he is uncertain he wants to write
another sequel to his two best-sellers.
</P>
<P>
   The novels focus on Dr. Laszlo Kreizler, a specialist in mental
disorders _ or alienist as they were called at the time _ who
investigates serial killings in the late 19th century. Carr knows
the public and publisher would like a third novel in the series,
but he also wants to avoid the fate of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who
grew so tired of Sherlock Holmes he tried to kill off his own hero.
</P>
<P>
   While Carr is still uncertain what his next book will be about,
he is sure where it will be written.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the main purpose of it, to get it mainly up on its feet
so I can spend much of my time up here writing,'' he said. ``It's
really the only spot in the world I've been to that was really
removed. The whole valley is self-contained and secure.''

 &HT;    FEAR OF Y2K A BOON FOR MAKERS OF WINDMILLS
 &HT;    1100&AMP;adds. Moving in (a) national and (l) lifestyle categories
for release Sunday, June 6.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINFIELD, Ala. _ Dusk was still several hours away as Ken
O'Brock tightened the final screws on the windmill he had
constructed on a sweltering spring day in a rolling pasture about
75 miles northwest of Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   If he hustled, O'Brock figured, he could load his equipment onto
the truck with the Ohio WINDMIL license plates and get a good start
on the long drive to his next job in central Florida. As the final
months of the millennium tick down, time is precious for a veteran
windmiller with more business than he can handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing twice as many jobs this year,'' said the owner and
installer of O'Brock Windmills of North Benton, Ohio. ``In one
week, I put up four windmills. One near Athens, Ga. One outside of
Bainbridge, Ga. And two in Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Why this surprising surge in a centuries-old technology? Credit
a more modern technological glitch _ the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
   Folks are afraid that many computers may shut down at midnight
on Dec. 31, when programs that use only two digits to record dates
won't be able to distinguish the new year 2000 from 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Livestock and crops _ not to mention people _ will get thirsty
awfully fast if the Y2K bug stings computers at power plants, and
electric pumps stop sending water to homes and farms.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, my friend, is ...
</P>
<P>
   Demand for windmills has been ``incredible,'' said Craig Donges,
owner of Ohio Windmills, near Youngstown. ``There's a big concern
for drinking water come the new millennium. My sales have probably
doubled this year. There's been a lot of interest in the Southeast.
Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas have probably been my biggest new
customer base.''
</P>
<P>
   Reuben Neely, a retired elementary school principal, hired
O'Brock to erect a 47-foot windmill on his farm outside Bainbridge,
in southwestern Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not strictly because of Y2K,'' Neely said. ``But I
believe in being prepared. If anything happens, I'm ready.''
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Windmills were already in use the last time a new millennium
blew in. ``The earliest reference to a windmill occurs in the works
of Arab writers in the 9th Century AD,'' according to the
Encyclopedia Britannica. Windmills spread through Europe between
the 12th and early 19th Centuries until wind power began to be
replaced, initially by steam power and later the
internal-combustion engine and electric power.
</P>
<P>
   Windmills were at least as important as the six-shooter in
settling the American West. Indeed, they were widely used until the
1930s, when New Deal programs began wiring rural America for
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   In 1854, Daniel Halladay introduced a wind-powered pump in the
United States that is basically the design still used today. A
number of blades are set radially on a wheel, like spokes. The wide
blades are curved and angled to catch even a slight breeze. A tail
vane keeps the wheel facing the wind. The turning wheel provides
power to move a long shaft up and down to pump water from a well.
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a five- to seven-mile-per-hour wind'' to turn the
blades enough to power the pump, said O'Brock.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, windmills _ which cost $5,000 and up _ aren't the
only low-tech solutions to a possible millennium meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a tremendous upsurge in demand for hand pumps,''
said David Suey, president of Dempster Industries of Beatrice, Neb.
``We got caught off guard. Didn't know what was happening at first.
Everyone ordering hand pumps. Then a customer mentioned Y2K and it
came to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The hand pumps are priced at about $500 apiece, and the company
usually sells hundreds a year, mostly to Third World customers.
This year, sales are already in the thousands, mostly to domestic
dealers ``in every single state,'' said Suey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come the end of December, we'd better not have more than a
nickel's worth of inventory,'' he said. ``Unless these guys
(predicting Y2K disaster) are the smart ones. Then everyone else
will be wanting a pump.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales are also booming for wood-burning stoves, kerosene
lanterns, food canners and juicers, water filters and all sorts of
other survivalist gear, said Glenda Lehman Ervin, communications
manager of Lehman's in Kidron, Ohio. From its sprawling Midwestern
store and through its globally distributed catalog, Lehman's has
been selling non-electric appliances since 1955.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of the founder, Ervin said Lehman's traditional
customers are the Amish, missionaries, homesteaders,
environmentalists and the ``chronically nostalgic'' who savor
old-fashioned items like hand-cranked ice cream churns. This year,
she said, the normal business has been ``overwhelmed'' by
``Y2Kers.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Lehman's has taken pride in providing ``same-day
service _ shipping the same day we received an order,'' she said.
``We're now four to five weeks behind (on some items). Our pipeline
is choked. We're not set up for this volume of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the boom has been a mixed blessing for a company with a
motto of ``more than a store, it's a way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want business based on fears of what may or may not
happen'' on New Year's Day, said Ervin. ``We're in this for the
long haul.''
</P>
<P>
   So is O'Brock, an amiable 59-year-old former farmer who has been
selling and erecting windmills since 1968. With his wife, Sharen,
often serving as his ground crew, O'Brock estimates he has set up
500 to 800 windmills, at least one in every state, including Alaska
and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   There are only a handful of independent windmillers like O'Brock
and Donges and Paul Crowley of Ropesville, Texas, who travel around
the country setting up windmills for individual farmers, ranchers
and homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   The windmill community is divided into two segments, explained
Randall Swisher, director of the American Wind Energy Association,
a national trade group.
</P>
<P>
   One segment is the commercial energy industry that utilizes huge
``wind farms'' with hundreds of windmills and turbines to generate
electricity for businesses or even communities. The other segment
consists of folks who have a windmill in their backyard to pump
water or to power a small generator, or have several windmills
scattered across a ranch to pump water for cattle on isolated
ranges.
</P>
<P>
   Swisher estimated that there are 30,000 or so of these
individually owned windmills in operation. But the number is
growing rapidly as 1999 breezes toward 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in business since 1888 (and will) set sales records
this year,'' said James Dockel, sales manager for the Aeromotor
Windmill Corp. in San Angelo, Texas. The company manufactures
windmills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first three months were my best year ever,'' said Ellen
Sattler of American Windmills in Diamond Springs, Calif. ``We sell
to people who put it up as a kit. A giant Erector set, I call it.
With the help of a few buddies, a few beers and pizzas, it takes a
couple of days for somebody who is a little bit mechanical.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are strictly water pumpers,'' she said. Her customers
are ``normally farmers, but not this year. Now it's Joe
Americana.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Or it's Cyndy Wright, who hired O'Brock to build a windmill in a
pasture on her spread outside Winfield in the hills northwestern
Alabama. An anesthetist at the local hospital and something of a
rural maverick, Wright raises longhorn steers and horses in a
region known more for corn and soybeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted a windmill. Now I've got one,'' she declared
as O'Brock climbed down from the 40-foot tower after spinning the
wheel, which measured eight feet across, and drawing water on a
windless afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K issue didn't figure in her decision to build the
windmill, she said, ``but it would be nice to be a little
self-sufficient in case something happened.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was echoed by Pat Halloran, who has a new O'Brock
windmill on his Stone Oak Farm in Oglethorpe County, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've wanted a windmill all my life,'' he said. Rotating atop a
53-foot tower, his windmill provides water to ``trickle irrigate''
a big garden of corn, tomatoes, herbs and other produce.
</P>
<P>
   There is often a good dose of romance and nostalgia mingled in
with the practicality of having a windmill, O'Brock believes. ``Y2K
has provided a good excuse for a lot of people who always wanted a
windmill.''
</P>
<P>
   He includes himself among these windmill lovers. ``I had an old
windmill on my farm and I thought it would be neat to fix it up,''
he said. That was in 1967. He rebuilt his own windmill and has been
building them for others ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times people want to put one up just to look at it,''
said Crowley, of Paul's Windmills in Ropesville, Texas. His shop is
not far from the windmill collection and museum in Lubbock, he
noted.
</P>
<P>
   A retired school teacher, Crowley put one up for himself and
``the next thing I knew, I was selling them.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost of a windmill depends on how deep the well must be and
how tall the tower must be. O'Brock said the tower should be 15
feet taller than any trees or structures within 400 feet. However,
there are exceptions. In Cyndy Wright's pasture, the tower was no
taller than two nearby trees, but the prevailing winds came from
other directions.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brock said he has never fallen from a windmill tower, but came
close once. He had already unfastened his safety belt when a gust
of wind swung the wheel around and knocked him off the platform. A
hook on the unfastened safety belt caught on a tower brace and
saved him.
</P>
<P>
   Every windmill presents a new challenge, he said. And since many
are erected on isolated farms, he often stays with his customers,
making friends while finishing his task.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never intend to retire,'' he hollers down from the top of
the tower. ``I like what I'm doing.''

<P>
   WINFIELD, Ala. _ Dusk was still several hours away as Ken
O'Brock tightened the final screws on the windmill he had
constructed on a sweltering spring day in a rolling pasture about
75 miles northwest of Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   If he hustled, O'Brock figured, he could load his equipment onto
the truck with the Ohio WINDMIL license plates and get a good start
on the long drive to his next job in central Florida. As the final
months of the millennium tick down, time is precious for a veteran
windmiller with more business than he can handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing twice as many jobs this year,'' said the owner and
installer of O'Brock Windmills of North Benton, Ohio. ``In one
week, I put up four windmills. One near Athens, Ga. One outside of
Bainbridge, Ga. And two in Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Why this surprising surge in a centuries-old technology? Credit
a more modern technological glitch _ the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
   Folks are afraid that many computers may shut down at midnight
on Dec. 31, when programs that use only two digits to record dates
won't be able to distinguish the new year 2000 from 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Livestock and crops _ not to mention people _ will get thirsty
awfully fast if the Y2K bug stings computers at power plants, and
electric pumps stop sending water to homes and farms.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, my friend, is ...
</P>
<P>
   Demand for windmills has been ``incredible,'' said Craig Donges,
owner of Ohio Windmills, near Youngstown. ``There's a big concern
for drinking water come the new millennium. My sales have probably
doubled this year. There's been a lot of interest in the Southeast.
Florida, Georgia, the Carolinas have probably been my biggest new
customer base.''
</P>
<P>
   Reuben Neely, a retired elementary school principal, hired
O'Brock to erect a 47-foot windmill on his farm outside Bainbridge,
in southwestern Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not strictly because of Y2K,'' Neely said. ``But I
believe in being prepared. If anything happens, I'm ready.''
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Windmills were already in use the last time a new millennium
blew in. ``The earliest reference to a windmill occurs in the works
of Arab writers in the 9th Century AD,'' according to the
Encyclopedia Britannica. Windmills spread through Europe between
the 12th and early 19th Centuries until wind power began to be
replaced, initially by steam power and later the
internal-combustion engine and electric power.
</P>
<P>
   Windmills were at least as important as the six-shooter in
settling the American West. Indeed, they were widely used until the
1930s, when New Deal programs began wiring rural America for
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   In 1854, Daniel Halladay introduced a wind-powered pump in the
United States that is basically the design still used today. A
number of blades are set radially on a wheel, like spokes. The wide
blades are curved and angled to catch even a slight breeze. A tail
vane keeps the wheel facing the wind. The turning wheel provides
power to move a long shaft up and down to pump water from a well.
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a five- to seven-mile-per-hour wind'' to turn the
blades enough to power the pump, said O'Brock.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, windmills _ which cost $5,000 and up _ aren't the
only low-tech solutions to a possible millennium meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a tremendous upsurge in demand for hand pumps,''
said David Suey, president of Dempster Industries of Beatrice, Neb.
``We got caught off guard. Didn't know what was happening at first.
Everyone ordering hand pumps. Then a customer mentioned Y2K and it

   The hand pumps are priced at about $500 apiece, and the company
usually sells hundreds a year, mostly to Third World customers.
This year, sales are already in the thousands, mostly to domestic
dealers ``in every single state,'' said Suey.

`ALIENS' FILMS EVOLVED OVER LIFE OF SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: ``Tuesday'' in 5th graf refers to June 1) 
By ROB LOWMAN 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Most actors wouldn't consider playing a synthetic
being in a sci-fi picture as a turning point in their careers. But
that's exactly what it was for Lance Henriksen when he took on the
role of Bishop, an android, in the 1986 James Cameron film
``Aliens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided I'm going to work in a certain way, and if I don't
see it on the screen myself, then I'm going to get out of acting,''
says Henriksen, who recently finished up three years of starring in
``Millennium,'' the dark, brooding series from Chris (``X-Files'')
Carter on Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bishop was an innocent,'' he says of the android who was
programmed not to harm people. ``I really loved playing him for
that reason,'' Hendriksen says, adding that he used his emotional
life of when he was 12 to get into character.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop was a change of pace for Henriksen, who often has been
cast in tough guy roles such as gunfighters and cops, including one
in an earlier Cameron film, ``Terminator.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, Henriksen saw what he was looking for up on the screen,
and you can, too, with the release Tuesday of ``The Alien Legacy''
from 20th Century Fox Home Video on both VHS and DVD. All four of
the ``Alien'' films, which star Sigourney Weaver as the
unbelievably resilent Ripley, have been digitally remastered.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron's ``Aliens'' is, of course, the sequel to Ridley Scott's
terrifying 1979 ``Alien,'' which introduced the world to one of
cinema's most nightmarish creatures. ``Alien'' has been called a
``haunted-house movie in space,'' but that doesn't do it justice.
Scott created, with the help of artist H.R. Giger's fantastic
visions, a futuristic gothic tale. The creature begins as a sort of
incubus or succubus, attaching itself to the face of an
unsuspecting body. It eventually grows _ like a cancer _ inside the
individual, tearing forth at an unexpected time. (Those who have
seen it will never forget John Hurt's chest-bursting moment.) The
alien equals our most primal fear _ the unknown.
</P>
<P>
   When Cameron came around to do the sequel, he took a different
tack, opting for an unrelenting action movie more akin to a war
flick. But the films have one thing in common _ great special
effects that still hold up. Considering that they were made before
computer-generated images, it's doubly amazing. There were four
men, Henriksen says, inside the giant animatronic queen that Ripley
faces off against in ``Aliens.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor says that his favorite memory of the shoot, which took
place in London, was when they were going to spend a couple of
hundred thousand dollars on an animatronic model of Bishop so that
it could be bounced around during a climactic scene. Henriksen,
instead, suggested that he learn to move like the model. ``So, we
put wires on the wrist of the (Bishop) doll and bounced it across
the floor. Then I started matching the movements of the doll, and
it worked perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   He says that the scene where he is ripped in half by the
creature took two weeks to film, but now would take a lot less
because of CGI. (By the way, Bishop lives _ he is a synthetic.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing about Jim Cameron is that he puts every dollar
on the screen,'' says Henriksen about the man behind the most
expensive movie ever made.
</P>
<P>
   While the first two ``Alien'' movies were quite influential,
being both commercial and artistic successes, the latter two went
in different directions. ``Aliens 3,'' in which Ripley crash lands
on a penal colony planet after her escape from her last battle with
the creatures _ only to find one growing in her _ takes a middle
ground between the gothic and the action genres. The 1992 film
never fully gels but has some interesting moments, and picked up an
Oscar nomination for special effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alien Resurrection'' is more a tongue-in-cheek action picture.
The 1997 film was written by Joss Whedon, the man behind TV's
``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and has a hip, fun, over-the-top
quality.
</P>
<P>
   Henriksen, who was also in ``Alien 3'' as Bishop's creature,
says that while working on ``Aliens,'' cast members hoped that
``Scott would do the third and Jim do the fourth, so there would be
this competitive slant on it.''
</P>
<P>
   While that didn't happen, the four ``Aliens'' movies are the
most consistently exciting of any movie series, which is why fans
of the films should be thrilled with this new release.
</P>
<P>
   This five-tape gift pack includes a 66-minute documentary that
contains interviews with Scott and Cameron, the film's special
effects creators and crew, and ``Aliens,'' which has been re-edited
to include 17 minutes deleted from the original.

CABLE AIMS TO TURN ON VIEWERS WITH GUY SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ All hail the Alpha Male.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's the new trend on television these days. Although
the female viewer is still coveted, she is also more plentiful. But
the male _ in TV Land he's the elusive prize, all channel surfing,
short-attention-span testosterone and a tendency to buy a lot of
things advertised. He's the Holy Grail of Nielsen ratings.
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, meaning last season, the way to hook males was
with comedies. Or cop shows. But the wily, or just dumbfoundedly
bored, males gave up and moved on. Where? To wrestling, mostly. And
pay-cable channels on which they can glimpse the occasional nipple.
</P>
<P>
   That shift of the male phalanx set off alarms in Hollywood,
where television executives got out the charts and graphs and came
up with a brilliant new idea: Programming for the YesterMale,
pre-women's lib, pre-cuddling after sex, pre-toilet seat down. You
know, the man's man, the proud remote-toting Neanderthal.
</P>
<P>
   So while wrestling remains central to the mix, the ante has been
raised, first by USA Networks, which recently launched a series
called ``Happy Hour.'' Hosted by Frank Zappa's sons, Ahmet and
Dweezil, ``Happy Hour'' (Saturday nights) is a rollicking variety
show with music, dancing, celebrity guest stars (actors, musicians,
athletes), stupid games and a good dose of scantily clad
navel-shaking by 10 women known as the ``Bombshell'' dancers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Happy Hour'' cashes in on its goal of being fun, brainless,
dumb and sexy all at once. USA loves the show. Why? Because it's
where the boys are.
</P>
<P>
   Next out of the gate is ``The X Show'' on the FX cable channel.
The daily, one-hour ``talk/magazine series'' appears Wednesday
nights.
</P>
<P>
   This show is essentially Barbara Walters' ``The View'' with four
males who make TV out of hot-property guy magazines such as Maxim,
Details and Men's Health.
</P>
<P>
   Tips are given on women (called ``Gettin' It''), finance,
sports, entertainment, technology, sex, clothes, self-improvement,
office survival and gadgets.
</P>
<P>
   One of the four hosts is Mark DeCarlo, best known as host of the
syndicated ``Studs,'' a show that took ``The Dating Game'' out on
the town and gave it a cheap lap dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The X Show'' has a pedigree that leads back to the Y
chromosome. Producers Gary Auerbach and Mark Cronin are responsible
for ``Singled Out'' on MTV _ a show that took ``Studs'' to a frat
party, stopping for Trojans along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Cronin has been a producer, writer and contributor for
``numerous Howard Stern projects,'' so at least you know where this
show is going.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, ``The X Show'' understands the male mind. It has
a bulldog for a mascot. It has aggro-male sports commentator Jim
Rome as a special correspondent. It will use Perfect 10 magazine
(for those who don't need fake breasts) model of the year Ashley
Degenford in a variety of ways. For instance, the show's unofficial
motto is ``total honesty and no male models.''
</P>
<P>
   So during the fashion segments, Degenford _ and other Perfect 10
talent _ will model suits, ties, underwear, whatever.
</P>
<P>
   Degenford, in fact, has been dubbed the show's
``lingerie-wearing movie premiere and red-carpet- event
correspondent.'' Basically, she'll be an ``Entertainment
Tonight''-style reporter, only with less clothing.
</P>
<P>
   On ``The X Show'' there will be weekly ``Pretty Girl;; pageants,
culling nonpro models from the ranks of everyday female workers _
such as ``masseuses, latte makers and more.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, promises the network, is only the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   But the series that really helped define this genre is Comedy
Central's ``The Man Show,'' which debuts June 16 following ``South
Park.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Man Show'' is described as ``an unapologetic look at
things men like, do and think.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, ``The Man Show'' was developed at ABC, which passed.
It then moved to Fox, which also passed. Finally, Comedy Central
revamped the concept and turned ``The Man Show'' into a weekly,
30-minute tribute to testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   Co-hosted by Jimmy Kimmel (who co-hosts ``Win Ben Stein's
Money,'' the channel's entertaining game show) and Adam Carolla
(who co-hosts MTV's extremely popular ``Loveline''), ``The Man
Show'' is the most blatantly ironic take on the Alpha Male trend.
</P>
<P>
   It says, with a wink, leer and a flex of the bicep, that, hey,
we get it, this is just us goofing on Oprah and Her Lot. Each
episode starts with a ``Manologue.'' There is sketch comedy. There
are celebrity guests. There are _ of course _ man-on-the-street
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   And there is the Juggy Dance Squad.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case that concept needs explaining, a word often used in
association with the Juggy Dance Squad is ``bodacious.'' They are
fueled by the sounds of a man called The Fox, who guzzles beer,
sings and plays the piano. The audience is fueled by loads of beer
_ dispensed by the lovely Juggy Dance Squad.
</P>
<P>
   Recurring segments include ``Man-O-Vations'' (all the great
things made for men, such as WWF books on tape, the alcho-derm
patch, etc.); ``Household Hints From Adult Film Stars'' (no,
really); ``Movies Men Don't Want to See,'' and ``Father and Son
with Jimmy and Kevin Kimmel,'' with dad telling little 5-year-old
Kevin ``the importance of ESPN'' and when to double down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Man Show'' was created by Stone Stanley Productions, which
does ``Loveline'' and another man-attracting offering for FX called
``Bobcat's Big Ass Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Cable is the home of these shows because it can target niches
almost without risk. Any audience is good audience, but all the
better if you can get stupid or ironic enough to latch on to males.
In the broadcast network universe a gender-equal approach is almost
mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there's one network daring to seek, almost exclusively,
males. And that's UPN, not exactly known for brilliant strategies
in its short existence. Still, as the country's sixth network and
with carte blanche to create an identity, UPN has probably wisely
gone for males. It has lower overhead, and if it can get the
desired demographic to advertisers, it doesn't have to beat CBS for
total viewers.

<P>
   A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; THE NIGHT INSPECTOR &QL; 
 &UR; Frederick Busch (Harmony, $23)
</P>
<P>
   The narrator of this novel, set in New York City in 1867, is
William Bartholomew, a former Union sniper who was maimed when his
rifle exploded in his face during the Civil War. He covers his
disfigurement with a pasteboard mask, but there's little else
hidden in this grim, atmospheric story that weaves postwar history
with the author's imaginings about the people with whom Bartholomew
associates. One of them is Herman Melville, whose books ``The
Whale'' and ``The Ambiguities'' Bartholomew has read. Now,
Melville's writing career is lagging and he works as a customs
inspector. Bartholomew first approaches him in an eatery, and as
they talk, Melville becomes fascinated with the mask, as
Bartholomew knows he must _ after all, he says, Melville wrote
about ``men who struck through the mask or curtain or surface of
things not to do harm by the striking per se, but to learn what lay
on the other side.'' With Bartholomew, Melville and other
characters, Busch (``Girl''s) builds a story around violent
memories of the war and an attempt to rescue ``the last crop of
slavery,'' a group of children held in Florida. The novel closes
with Bartholomew attending a reading by Charles Dickens, whose
world Busch imagined in his 1978 novel, ``The Mutual Friend.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; A MAN'S TURF: THE PERFECT LAWN &QL; 
 &UR; Warren Schultz (Potter, $35)
</P>
<P>
   ``And God said, Let the Earth bring forth grass ''.`` .''``
.''`` and the Earth brought forth grass ''.`` .''`` .''``''
(Genesis 1:11-12). This book, an obvious Father's Day ploy, is full
of pictures of grass so green you have to squint when you look at
it. There are other photos that aren't so easy to explain, like the
one of a shirtless Humphrey Bogart raking what looks to be a pile
of dead weeds across a patch of dirt. We thought this might
symbolize (begin itals) failed (end itals) grass, but as we read
along we realized that it was the manliness of the raker Schultz
was trying to point out. And point it out he does, again and again,
without a notion of how silly he sounds. ``Is a man ever more of a
man than when he's standing, hose in hand, on his own front lawn as
the air cools on a summer evening?'' he asks. We are not making
this up. He includes tips on growing different grasses, the rules
of mowing, close-up views of sprinklers and weeds, and a picture of
helmet-clad lawn-mower racers who ``put their manhood on the line
and raise the fun of mowing to a new level.'' Happy Father's Day. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; SHIP OF GOLD IN THE DEEP BLUE SEA &QL; 
 &UR; Gary Kinder (Vintage, $14)
</P>
<P>
   New in paperback is Kinder's marvelous account of treasure
hunter Tommy Thompson's efforts to find and recover the cargo of
the paddle steamer Central America, which sank in the Atlantic
Ocean in 1857, taking with it hundreds of passengers and a fortune
from the California gold fields. The book begins with a narrative
account of the sinking of the Central America, the tense and
poignant story of a brave captain, his terrified passengers and
crew, and their efforts to survive a raging storm at sea. From
there, Kinder leaps ahead more than 100 years to the odd group of
men, lead by the eccentric Thompson, who went searching for the
wreck under 8,000 feet of water off South Carolina. Kinder drew
from survivors' accounts for chapters on the sinking of the ship,
and from Thompson's sonar and at-sea logs for passages on the
search and on confrontations at sea with other treasure hunters who
wanted the gold for themselves. Kinder also describes the
cutting-edge technology Thompson used to recover the gold, and the
legal maneuvers through which he claimed the right to salvage it.
This is a suspense-filled adventure story, and Kinder does a superb
job of telling it. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; 100 BOOTS &QL; 
 &UR; Eleanor Antin (Running, $14.95)
</P>
<P>
   They are a collective presence to Antin, these boots _ she
refers to them as ``he.'' In 1970, she was a frustrated artist
trying to figure out how to show her work to people without
depending on the white walls of the New York galleries. Then she
hit upon an idea that could be had for the price of a postcard and
a 6-cent stamp. She would find a hero _ she envisioned an outsider
like Don Quixote _ who could carry a long, narrative work of art
that she would send out through the mail. The boots themselves came
to her in a dream, and the next day, she went to an Army-Navy store
and bought them: 100 black, rubber boots. The first postcard, which
went out to about 1,000 artists, writers, critics, museums,
galleries, universities, libraries and other unsuspecting
recipients, was mailed on March 15, 1971, and was called ``100
Boots Facing the Sea'' _ it's on the cover of this book. The next
was ``100 Boots on the Way to Church,'' then ``100 Boots at the
Bank,'' and so on. Antin's address was on the cards, and some
people wrote back (a few asked her to leave them alone). All
together, there were 51 postcards mailed over more than two years _
the last was ``100 Boots Go on Vacation'' on July 9, 1973. The
mailings were so successful that the boots appeared at the Museum
of Modern Art for two months before the series ended. This book
contains all 51 postcards. If you like it, go to a used-book store
and look for an even more delightful book called ``The Red Couch,''
by photographers Kevin Clarke and Horst Wackerbarth (with brief
text by William Least Heat-Moon). &QL;

GROUND WARS MAKE STRANGE BEDFELLOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(jt) 
 By PATRICIA COHEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is Kosovo a liberal cause? A conservative one?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's hard to tell. As the question of sending in
ground troops becomes more and more pressing, many seasoned
anti-war liberal intellectuals like Susan Sontag and Democratic
lawmakers like Sen. Tom Harkin have pushed to send in the soldiers.
And right by their side are conservative stalwarts like William
Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard; Republican Sen. John
McCain, and Jeane Kirkpatrick, the former U.N. delegate during the
Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, other conservatives like Pat Buchanan and
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott say the United States should stay
out. ``Give peace a chance,'' said Lott _ sounding remarkably like
former President Jimmy Carter and Tom Hayden, the former leader of
the Students for a Democratic Society who is now a California state
senator.
</P>
<P>
   Politics, of course, has produced more strange bedfellows than
``The Dating Game.'' Yet something else seems to be going on here.
These odd alliances may signal a stumbling, but significant,
intellectual and political shift that could have far-reaching
effects for American foreign policy. The unlikely agreements
between bitter ideological enemies are evidence of how much the
definition of America's role in the world is changing.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, opposing the military was a reflex for leftists.
Whether a skirmish in Grenada or a full-scale war in Vietnam, such
battles only helped to strengthen the military and fuel the nuclear
conflict with the Soviet Union. To them, the idea that the United
States had a special responsibility was simply a euphemism for
American imperialism.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, those are precisely the kinds of arguments that liberals
who oppose the war in Kosovo continue to make. ``Bombs couldn't
bring peace in Vietnam,'' Hayden wrote in a letter to President
Clinton last month. Hayden also warned against a ``new
imperialism,'' and getting stuck in a ``quagmire.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent editorial in The Nation anguished over the dilemma
faced by the ``principled anti-militarist.'' Still, the editorial
demanded that the administration ``Stop the war now,'' citing
violations of law, the disquieting notion of America as the world's
policeman and the bombing's contribution to the Kosovars'
suffering. Even the human rights president, Carter, opposes using
military force to prevent ethnic cleansing in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But many liberals reject such arguments. The first cracks in the
antiwar tradition appeared at the end of the Cold War. Suddenly the
definition of the national interest was up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   The Bosnian war in the early 1990s, with its haunting images of
skeletal figures behind barbed wire, forced deportations and mass
killings, helped push more liberals out of the anti-war camp. Never
again, declared a growing number of intellectuals, particularly
Jewish ones.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this period, prominent liberals like David Rieff, Ms.
Sontag's son, published wrenching accounts from Bosnia. Other
liberals, like Leon Wieseltier, who wrote a string of editorials in
The New Republic, urged a reluctant Bush administration, and then
the Clinton administration, to act.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the chilling effect caused by the death of 18 Army
Rangers in Somalia in 1993, humanitarian military missions gained
respect among liberals. By 1995, when the Serbs massacred thousands
of civilians in the Bosnian town of Srebenica while a U.N.
peacekeeping force stood by, many liberal peaceniks had hatched
into hawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The automatic `no''' has evaporated, said Todd Gitlin, who led
anti-war sit-ins in the 1960s and now teaches at New York
University. ``I think it is a sea change. Just wars are not only
possible, but legion.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, what enabled some doves to embrace war _ splitting
off narrow national interests from universal principles of human
rights _ is precisely what made it unappealing to many
conservatives. Buchanan has said: ``Americans sense that, despite
our disgust at the latest massacre and Milosevic's thuggery, no
vital U.S. interest exists there. The Serbs do not threaten NATO;
they have not attacked Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Those very reasons are the ones approvingly cited by Vaclav
Havel, the former dissident and current president of the Czech
Republic, in a recent speech supporting NATO's involvement in the
``first humanitarian war.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If the end of the Cold War freed the left from the automatic no,
it also freed the right from the automatic yes. No longer were
conservatives compelled to see every battle as a test of America's
anti-communist resolve. And while many on the right had previously
invoked human rights to criticize regimes in China and the Soviet
Union, the issue was less powerful when containing Communism was no
longer the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger has argued in Newsweek's international edition that
now that the United States and NATO are in Kosovo, they must win _
even if it means ground troops _ because maintaining credibility
trumps every other consideration. But he noted that in the past he
had ``passionately rejected'' sending soldiers to Kosovo, and added
that it was ``absurd'' to think global equilibrium or prosperity
depends on the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   For conservatives who want to send ground troops to Kosovo,
intervening to protect human rights has grown into a legitimate
foreign policy goal.
</P>
<P>
   Kristol said in an interview that American troops should have
been sent to Rwanda in 1994 to stop the Hutu massacre of an
estimated 500,000 Tutsis in a 100-day period _ even though the
United States had no vital interests there. As for Kosovo, Kristol
sees his support of ground troops as an extension of what he
characterizes as former President Ronald Reagan's vision of
America's unique moral mission in world affairs: The United States
should stand up to Serbia's president, Slobodan Milosevic, just as
it stood up to the ``Evil Empire.''
</P>
<P>
   Like other conservatives as well as liberals, Kristol is joining
human rights and Realpolitik interests in a search for common
ground. In Kosovo, Kristol said, ``the moral and strategic
interests of the United States really coincided.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Hoffmann, a liberal professor of European studies at
Harvard University, made a similar case in a recent issue of The
New York Review of Books. ``To tolerate this ferocious combination
of ethnic cleansing and quasi-genocide'' is to `` invite world
disorder on a grand scale,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   True, skeptics could ask whether establishing order is just an
excuse for waging a humanitarian war or whether the appeal to human
rights is simply a way to sell the abstract goal of stability to a
doubtful public. Yet either way, the Kosovo campaign is sharpening
the debate over when force is justified.
</P>
<P>
   McCain would like to see ``a 21st-century policy interpretation
of the Reagan Doctrine,'' which he calls a ``rogue state
rollback.'' In his view, the military should only be called in when
``our strategic interests and our political values'' are both
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Wieseltier, who also says both strategic interests and moral
imperatives require action in Kosovo, put it a different way: ``If
the United States is unwilling to put any one of its soldiers in
harm's way, then the United States is not a superpower.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously this debate won't be settled soon. Still, Kristol
noted how few could have predicted that ``this obscure little part
of the world turns out to crystallize what America's role in the
world should be.''

</P>
<P>
   Obviously this debate won't be settled soon. Still, Kristol
noted how few could have predicted that ``this obscure little part
of the world turns out to crystallize what America's role in the
world should be.''

   NEW YORK _ Now that the fanfare around National Poetry Month in
April has died down _ the readings, the slams, the tractor pulls _
there is time for a little serious contemplation about the future
of the form.
</P>
<P>
   Questions abound: Is there a hot genre? What will the new
millennium bring? Are the poetry wars over? Have the Nuyoricans,
those anti-establishment aesthetes , sold out? And, finally, will
it ever be OK to rhyme again?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The answer is
</P>
<P>
   you surely knew
</P>
<P>
   Dependent on
</P>
<P>
   your point of view.  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with poets, academics, editors and others
lyrically minded, the only point of agreement seems to be that
poetry is enjoying a remarkable renaissance, from cowboy poetry
festivals in the West to daily bits of verse published on the
Internet. Robert Pinsky, the United States' poet laureate, does
regular poetry readings on PBS.
</P>
<P>
   Bookstores carry the work of this year's Pulitzer Prize winner,
Mark Strand,
 &UR; I think of the innocent lives
</P>
<P>
   Of people in novels who know they'll die
</P>
<P>
   But not that the novel will end. &LR; alongside the work of the
socialist street poet named Sparrow:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; There is a sickness eating away at the
</P>
<P>
   American people _ an illness, a pox
</P>
<P>
   upon this nation-state. And that illness is...Classic Rock.  &LR;  It
is that abundant variety of contemporary poetry, the professionals
say, that makes it so difficult to predict the direction of poetry
in the coming years. Not that there aren't a few ideas. For Pinsky,
the most important current trend has less to do with a particular
style of poetry than its presentation: oral, not printed.
</P>
<P>
   The poet Dana Gioia, the author of ``Can Poetry Matter?''
(Greywolf Press, 1992), said the hottest thing happening in poetry
is rap music. The idea that rap music is poetry is not new; its
increasing popularity and sophistication has Gioia thinking it is
the style to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rap is spoken poetry,'' Gioia said. ``Rap music is essentially
written in the same base meter as `Beowulf,' the difference being
that rap is rhymed and Beowulf isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars say that the resurgence of interest in spoken
poetry means that poetry has come full circle, from its ancient
roots in chants and songs through its emergence as a powerful
written form and, finally, in recent years, back to a more oral
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Between the primitive and the postmodern, of course, were dozens
of styles. In the first 600 years of this millennium, poetry moved
from the epic medieval lyrics and tales of Chaucer to the airy,
metaphysical, lovelorn sonnets (holy and otherwise) of Shakespeare
and Donne. Movements and their adjectives each had their time: the
lush Romantics, like Byron, owned the early 1800s.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; She walks in beauty, like the night
</P>
<P>
   Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
</P>
<P>
   And all that's best of dark and bright
</P>
<P>
   Meet in her aspect and her eyes.  &LR;  More restrained, the
Victorians dominated the late 1800s and the knotty _ and naughty _
Moderns ruled after that. But the Moderns (Stevens, Eliot, Auden)
became the Establishment, and eventually some people (those
rascally Beats) started complaining.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the current writing style, some say it's the classics
that are in vogue. Alice Quinn, the poetry editor of The New
Yorker, said that for years while teaching her graduate course at
Columbia University she spent ample time on 19th- and 20th-century
masters like Robert Frost and Emily Dickinson.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Fame is a bee.  &LR;   &UR; It has a song _
</P>
<P>
   It has a sting _
</P>
<P>
   Ah, too, it has a wing.  &LR;  ``I suddenly realized,'' Ms. Quinn
said, ``that what they really wanted, the people becoming writers,
was a survey class from Chaucer to Yeats.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Quinn believes the real money may lie even farther in
the past. ``What are the books that have done well in recent
years?'' she asked. ``Dante, Ovid, Horace.'' Each of which, Ms.
Quinn noted, have been translated and re-imagined by modern poets.
Recent popular translations include Pinsky's version of Dante,
``Gilgamesh'' by David Ferry and Ovid by the late Ted Hughes.
Coming soon are Ferry's translation on Virgil and Seamus Heaney's
take on Beowulf.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the poetry establishment has had some problems lately. In
March, the Academy of American Poets, the home of poetry's elite,
announced it would make significant changes in the structure of its
board of directors in response to critics who had called it far too
homogeneous. More women and minority members will be invited to
participate.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the board, Jonathan Galassi, the editor in
chief at Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux and a poet himself, said the
changes reflected variety of thought in contemporary poetry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take the academy as a bellwether, we expanded the Board
of Chancellors to represent a lot of different parts of the
spectrum,'' Galassi said. ``In a way, I think that's a sign that
there's more stuff out there. That's the picture now.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, however, most poetry professionals agreed the passions
of the poetry wars of the mid-1990s (roughly the establishment vs.
everybody else) have subsided.
</P>
<P>
   The poet Bob Holman presided over the growth of poetry slams a
decade ago while serving as the ``slam master'' at the Nuyorican
Poets Cafe in the East Village. Loud and declamatory, slams are
competitions where poets shout out their work, often with a
microphone in hand and their bodies in motion. The winners are
chosen by the audience. Alliteration and assonance are key
elements, as in the work of Saul Williams, a Nuyorican alumnus.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Blowing tunes through lunar wombs
</P>
<P>
   impregnating stars giving birth to suns
</P>
<P>
   that darken the skins that skin our drums.  &LR;  In the mid-1990s a
group of Nuyorican types known as the Unbearables protested outside
The New Yorker, demanding that their work be considered.
</P>
<P>
   Holman, who called himself a ``bemused bystander'' to the
Unbearable events, said each side has since come to see the value
of the other. ``Various traditions now exist side by side,'' he
said, ``and all are finding their audiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Some are finding large audiences. This summer's National Poetry
Slam in Chicago will have a record 48 teams of four poets each.
That comes on the heels of last year's well-received independent
film, ``Slam.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the next generation, there are only hints.
</P>
<P>
   Don Lee, an editor at the literary magazine Ploughshares, said
the Internet is the ideal means of dissemination and
experimentation. ``A short story or a novel is impossible to read
on the screen,'' Lee said. ``Poetry is very easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy, perhaps, but by no means simple _ or harmonious.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always going to be people saying what the other side
is doing is stodgy or stupid,'' Lee said. ``That's been going on
since poetry began.''  &QL;

THE ART OF FINISHING UNFINISHED ART  
 (EDITORS: NOTE SLUG CHANGE; ORIGINALLY SKEDDED AS
SYMPHONIES-REVIEW)

   Imagine being Franz Xaver Suessmayr. Your teacher, Wolfgang
Amadeus Mozart, is dying, just as he's writing one of his greatest
works. On his deathbed he explains how he envisions completing it.
The rest is up to you.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Suessmayr. No one can say which parts of the ``Requiem'' he
had to make up, but he never wrote anything particularly good after
that. Others would later clean up his orchestrations and create new
versions based on newly unearthed sketches. Listening to the
``Requiem'' with all this in mind gives a whole new meaning to the
concert series title ``Mostly Mozart.''
</P>
<P>
   Finishing the unfinished artworks of the dead has always been a
tricky business, but it can be a marketable enterprise, as recent
events confirm.
</P>
<P>
   When Ralph Ellison died five years ago, he left no instructions
concerning his 2,000-page draft for a sprawling epic. But it was
trimmed by the scholar John F. Callahan into a 384-page novel,
``Juneteenth,'' and published amid great publicity last week. And
Ernest Hemingway's unfinished ``True at First Light'' was cut from
850 pages to 320 by his son Patrick for publication this July in
time for the writer's 100th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Dead artists tend to have more clout than living ones these
days. After all, thanks to the peculiarities of restoration and
rediscovery, the big art premiere last week was for Leonardo da
Vinci (his newly restored ``Last Supper,'' in Milan, Italy), and at
the Tony awards next Sunday, the late Tennessee Williams could win
in the ``Best New Play'' category (for his newly produced ``Not
About Nightingales'').
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? In an age of cultural recycling, the fine art of
finishing could become a cottage industry.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone shares the same definition of
``finished.'' When Stanley Kubrick died in March, having just made
the final cut of ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' rumors flew that Warner Bros.
might do a little more editing to ensure the movie an ``R'' rating.
Tom Cruise came forward and vowed to fight any alterations.
</P>
<P>
   One wonders what would have happened if Cruise had been friends
with Edith Wharton. Could he have have used his influence to see to
it that her unfinished novel ``The Buccaneers'' would stay
untouched by contemporary completers?
</P>
<P>
   In defense of those who can't leave well enough alone, finishing
a work can bring it to a wider audience. If Marion Mainwaring had
not finished ``The Buccaneers,'' fewer readers would have
encountered this work of Wharton's _ and even fewer would have
tuned in to watch it on TV.
</P>
<P>
   And utterly no one would have seen the unproduced final drama of
Frances Sheridan, an 18th-century novelist, if a contemporary
writer hadn't added an ending 233 years after her death. The
resulting play, ``The Whisperers,'' with three acts by Sheridan and
two more in Restoration language by Elizabeth Kuti, premiered in
Ireland this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Collaborating with the dead creates special challenges. It means
seeing every note on a napkin as a little ``how-to'' manual,
ignoring unhelpful instructions like, ``Burn this if you find it,''
and wildly guessing what the artist would have wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Designers in Barcelona have been guessing since 1926 how to
finish the Sagrada Familia church in the spirit that the architect
Gaudi intended _ though no one can agree whether that spirit means
building it as originally specified, updating it or leaving it
magnificently half-built.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Dickens left a half-written murder mystery without a
killer. In the ingenious musical adaptation of ``The Mystery of
Edwin Drood'' in the 1980s, the audience chose the murderer by
voting. Different endings were performed each night.
</P>
<P>
   While Dickens might be as startled to discover the Broadway
version of his detective novel as Victor Hugo would be to see a
touring company of ``Les Miz,'' the show's creators did demonstrate
a certain respect for Dickens by leaving the story unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   And audiences don't mind a little open-endedness. They will
happily vote on an ending. They will turn out to see performances
of Bach's unfinished ``The Art of the Fugue'' that stop where Bach
did. They will read ``The Last Tycoon'' though F. Scott Fitzgerald
didn't finish it.
</P>
<P>
   But in cases where the artist is the art, audiences may need a
little closure. When Jean Harlow died in 1937 during the filming of
``Saratoga,'' her fans wanted the movie released, so her remaining
scenes were shot with Mary Dees, who stood as far from the camera
as possible in a wide-brimmed hat.
</P>
<P>
   When Bela Lugosi died during shooting for the 1959 cult classic
``Plan 9 from Outer Space,'' his dentist filled in for him, cloaked
in a cape. When the actor Brandon Lee died in 1993 during the
filming of ``The Crow,'' the filmmakers digitized his image and
inserted him into new scenes, proving that the latest technology is
just as good as a wide-brimmed hat.
</P>
<P>
   Artists planning to die anytime soon should leave instructions.
They should leave heirs, who can shop around for the right person
to finish the opus. They should focus on one masterwork at a time.
Schubert worked on too many at once, leaving so many fragments that
scholars don't know which piece goes with which.
</P>
<P>
   And they should leave a decent beginning. That way, the
prospective finisher, when in doubt, can always reprise. Franco
Alfano, the poor guy who had to write the end of Puccini's
``Turandot,'' figured he might not be able to think up a better
melody than the one in the aria ``Nessun Dorma,'' so he repeated
the theme.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with a beginning can provide inspiration. The act of
finishing another's work may illuminate one's own creative
struggles. Or it may promise, in the grand tradition of the
cathedral and the sitcom, a revival of the artist who selflessly
collaborates with others, throwing in jokes or gargoyles for the
sake of the enduring whole and not for the sole credit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, credit may be taken. After finishing Titian's ``Pieta,''
Palma Giovine painted a Latin inscription that read, ``What Titian
began and left behind, Palma reverently completed and dedicated to
God'' _ thus putting all the creators in their proper places.

might do a little more editing to ensure the movie an ``R'' rating.
Tom Cruise came forward and vowed to fight any alterations.
</P>
<P>
   One wonders what would have happened if Cruise had been friends
with Edith Wharton. Could he have have used his influence to see to
it that her unfinished novel ``The Buccaneers'' would stay
untouched by contemporary completers?
</P>
<P>
   In defense of those who can't leave well enough alone, finishing
a work can bring it to a wider audience. If Marion Mainwaring had
not finished ``The Buccaneers,'' fewer readers would have
encountered this work of Wharton's _ and even fewer would have
tuned in to watch it on TV.
</P>
<P>
   And utterly no one would have seen the unproduced final drama of
Frances Sheridan, an 18th-century novelist, if a contemporary
writer hadn't added an ending 233 years after her death. The
resulting play, ``The Whisperers,'' with three acts by Sheridan and
two more in Restoration language by Elizabeth Kuti, premiered in
Ireland this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Collaborating with the dead creates special challenges. It means
seeing every note on a napkin as a little ``how-to'' manual,
ignoring unhelpful instructions like, ``Burn this if you find it,''
and wildly guessing what the artist would have wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Designers in Barcelona have been guessing since 1926 how to
finish the Sagrada Familia church in the spirit that the architect
Gaudi intended _ though no one can agree whether that spirit means
building it as originally specified, updating it or leaving it
magnificently half-built.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Dickens left a half-written murder mystery without a
killer. In the ingenious musical adaptation of ``The Mystery of
Edwin Drood'' in the 1980s, the audience chose the murderer by
voting. Different endings were performed each night.
</P>
<P>
   While Dickens might be as startled to discover the Broadway
version of his detective novel as Victor Hugo would be to see a
touring company of ``Les Miz,'' the show's creators did demonstrate
a certain respect for Dickens by leaving the story unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   And audiences don't mind a little open-endedness. They will
happily vote on an ending. They will turn out to see performances
of Bach's unfinished ``The Art of the Fugue'' that stop where Bach
did. They will read ``The Last Tycoon'' though F. Scott Fitzgerald
didn't finish it.
</P>
<P>
   But in cases where the artist is the art, audiences may need a
little closure. When Jean Harlow died in 1937 during the filming of
``Saratoga,'' her fans wanted the movie released, so her remaining
scenes were shot with Mary Dees, who stood as far from the camera
as possible in a wide-brimmed hat.
</P>
<P>
   When Bela Lugosi died during shooting for the 1959 cult classic
``Plan 9 from Outer Space,'' his dentist filled in for him, cloaked
in a cape. When the actor Brandon Lee died in 1993 during the
filming of ``The Crow,'' the filmmakers digitized his image and
inserted him into new scenes, proving that the latest technology is
just as good as a wide-brimmed hat.
</P>
<P>
   Artists planning to die anytime soon should leave instructions.
They should leave heirs, who can shop around for the right person
to finish the opus. They should focus on one masterwork at a time.
Schubert worked on too many at once, leaving so many fragments that
scholars don't know which piece goes with which.
</P>
<P>
   And they should leave a decent beginning. That way, the
prospective finisher, when in doubt, can always reprise. Franco
Alfano, the poor guy who had to write the end of Puccini's
``Turandot,'' figured he might not be able to think up a better
melody than the one in the aria ``Nessun Dorma,'' so he repeated
the theme.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with a beginning can provide inspiration. The act of
finishing another's work may illuminate one's own creative
struggles. Or it may promise, in the grand tradition of the
cathedral and the sitcom, a revival of the artist who selflessly
collaborates with others, throwing in jokes or gargoyles for the
sake of the enduring whole and not for the sole credit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, credit may be taken. After finishing Titian's ``Pieta,''
Palma Giovine painted a Latin inscription that read, ``What Titian
began and left behind, Palma reverently completed and dedicated to
God'' _ thus putting all the creators in their proper places.

STOP WHINING CITY-SLICKERS, OR, HOW THE WEST ISN'T ALWAYS FUN 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(jt) 
 By TOM KUNTZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're anything like the pampered, reluctant farmer's wife
played by Eva Gabor in ``Green Acres'' _ ``Dahling, I love you, but
give me Park Avenue'' _ then you definitely want to think twice
about moving to rural Washington state. Officials in Spokane
County, in the eastern part of the state, have had it with
city-bred newcomers complaining about the less amenable aspects of
the boondocks. And so the Spokane County Commission this month
published a pamphlet called the ``Code of the West'' to forewarn
new and prospective residents about the pitfalls of supposedly
idyllic country life.
</P>
<P>
   You might also call it ``How the West Is Not Fun.'' Here are
excerpts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The pamphlet starts with some historical context:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The Code of the West was first chronicled by famous western
writer Zane Grey. The men and women who came to this part of the
country during the United States' westward expansion were bound by
an unwritten code of conduct. The values of integrity and
self-reliance guided their decisions, actions and interactions. In
keeping with that same spirit, we offer this information to help
citizens of Spokane County who wish to follow in the footsteps of
those rugged individualists and live outside the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; For starters, the pamphlet says, forget about essential public
services on a par with cities and towns. The county can't afford
them:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _Emergency response times for sheriff, fire suppression, medical
care, etc., cannot be guaranteed. Under some extreme conditions,
you may find that emergency response is extremely slow and
expensive. ...
</P>
<P>
   _School buses travel only on maintained county roads designated
as school bus routes by the school district. If you live on a
private road, you may need to drive your children to the nearest
county road or bus stop.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The county's many private access roads are often in bad shape, the
pamphlet says. And guess what? They're your problem:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _Natural disasters, especially floods, can destroy roads. ...
Residents served by private roads and/or bridges have had large
bills for repairs and/or reconstruction after floods.
</P>
<P>
   _Unpaved roads generate dust. Spokane County does not treat
roads to suppress dust. If you reside near an unpaved road, you may
want to have the road treated for dust suppression by one of the
contractors authorized to do road oiling by the County.
</P>
<P>
   _If your road is unpaved, it is highly unlikely that Spokane
County will pave it without financing by the adjoining property
owners through a Road Improvement District.
 &UR; You want reliable, regular contact with the outside world? Dream
on:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _Mail delivery may not be available to all areas of the county.
...
</P>
<P>
   _Newspaper delivery is not always available to rural areas. ...
</P>
<P>
   _Standard parcel and overnight package delivery can be a problem
for those who live in the country. ...
</P>
<P>
   _Telephone communications can be a problem, especially in the
mountainous areas of Spokane County. If you have a private line, it
may be difficult to obtain another line for fax or computer modem
uses. Even cellular phones may not work in all areas.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Our public utilities are second to some:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _If you do not have access to a supply of treated domestic
water, you will have to locate an alternative supply. ...The cost
for drilling and pumping can be considerable. ...
</P>
<P>
   _Electric service may not be readily available in every area of
Spokane County. It is important to determine the proximity of
electrical power, as it can be very expensive to extend power lines
to remote areas. ...
</P>
<P>
   _Power outages can occur in outlying areas with more frequency
than in more developed areas, particularly if power lines are
difficult to access. A loss of electric power can interrupt your
supply of water from a well. Interruptions in power may cause you
to lose the food in your freezer or refrigerator. ... If you live
in the country it is important to be able to survive a week or
longer in severe cold with no utilities.
</P>
<P>
   _Trash removal is available everywhere in Spokane County, but
some removal can be more expensive in rural areas than in
metropolitan areas. In some cases, your trash dumpster may be
several miles from your home. Your only option may be to haul your
trash to the disposal site yourself.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Property rights? Yeah, right:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _Many property owners do not own the mineral rights under their
property. Owners of mineral rights have the ability to change the
surface characteristics in order to extract their minerals. It is
very important to know what minerals may be located under the land
and who owns them.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Good fences make good neighbors. But you might not have good
fences:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _Fences that separate properties can be misaligned with the
property lines. A survey of the land is the only way to confirm the
location of your property lines.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ah, wilderness!: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _The physical characteristics of your property can be positive
and negative. Trees are a wonderful environmental amenity, but can
also involve your home in a forest fire. Homes built in forested
areas face the very real potential of being damaged or destroyed by
wildland fires. ...
</P>
<P>
   _Steep slopes can slide in unusually wet weather. Large rocks
can also roll down steep slopes and present a great danger to
people and property. ...
</P>
<P>
   _Nature can provide you with some wonderful neighbors. Most,
such as deer and eagles, are positive additions to the environment.
However, even ``harmless'' animals like deer can cross the road
unexpectedly and cause traffic accidents.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Still, your remote location doesn't mean you won't have any
company:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _Many areas in the County are open for hunting. ... Don't
automatically assume that your property is in a shooting or a
no-shooting zone. ...
</P>
<P>
   _Low-flying crop-duster planes may fly overhead during irregular
hours. It is possible that adjoining agricultural uses may disturb
your peace and quiet.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; And don't forget our barnyard friends on big farms within
whiffing distance:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   _Animals and their manure can cause objectionable odors. What
else can we say?

   Two Indian jets were lost in airstrikes against a large force of

New Delhi has used jet fighters and helicopters gunships in its

   The genetic material in Dolly, the sheep that was the first
animal to be successfully cloned from an adult, may be showing a
sign of aging, in effect appearing older than the sheep itself,
said the scientists in Scotland who created the animal. If
confirmed, the finding would be the first sign of possible genetic
abnormalities in cloned animals.

   Leading investigators said they were not yet convinced by the
preliminary data, which were published in a letter to the journal

   Nearly three years after John Huang emerged as a central figure
in the furor over how Democrats financed President Clinton's
re-election, the Justice Department announced that Huang would
plead guilty to a single felony charge of conspiring to make
illegal contributions. Republicans dismissed the plea agreement as
a sweetheart deal: Huang will receive no jail time in exchange for
his continuing cooperation with authorities. Federal prosecutors
will also clear him of charges contained in congressional reports
on the fund-raising issue that he may have had an espionage
relationship with China.

   A School's Responsibility
</P>
<P>
   As the Supreme Court interpreted federal laws over the years to
provide protection against sexual harassment, uncertainty remained
over whether any law even applied to harassment of one student by
another. Now, as a result of a bitterly fought 5-4 ruling, school
districts are on notice that they can be sued for failing to stop
severe and pervasive harassment in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   The court's dissenters said the ruling opened the door to
massive federal intrusion. But school board lawyers said that it
was clear the ruling applied only to egregious behavior and that
they could live with it.

   New Hampshire's New Holiday
</P>
<P>
   As one civil rights advocate put it, New Hampshire won the race
to be last. It effectively agreed to become the 50th state to adopt
a holiday honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The state
House of Representatives, which had resisted in the past, voted
solidly to attach King's name to the existing Civil Rights Day, and
no further hindrances remained to the new holiday. Most other
states approved a Martin Luther King Day in the 1980s. So what took
New Hampshire so long? Some holiday advocates said it was not
racism that resisted the change but the tradition-bound,
independent-minded nature of residents.

   Should scientists be allowed to experiment on abandoned human
embryos, the tiny spheres of cells often generated in excess by
fertility clinics? The National Bioethics Advisory Commission
signaled it would approve a specific use: the removal from embryos
of the all-purpose stem cells, which generate all the tissues and
organs of the body. Biologists hope these cells may directly
replace damaged tissues, including brain cells lost in Parkinson's
disease.

Arkansas real estate ventures, Ms. Steele about sexual

   SWEET CHARITY

   Last year was good for charity: Americans donated a record $175
billion, 11 percent more than in 1997, according to Giving USA
1999, put out by the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel's
nonprofit arm. The only area that declined was the arts, culture
and humanities (down about 1 percent). But donations jumped by 20
percent or more in environment and wildlife, health, human services
and public benefit organizations (which includes civil rights
groups, public affairs, consumer protection and scientific
development).

the Nasdaq stock market is planning an evening trading session,

   Diplomacy and Betrayal
</P>
<P>
   The balance of power between the United States and the United
Nations is always tricky. And now former Secretary General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali, in his book ``Unvanquished: A U.S.-U.N. Saga,''
writes of his 1996 ouster, blaming it on caving in to Bob Dole's
``claim that American troops served under my `command.''' He feels
especially betrayed by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, he
says, accusing her of lecturing instead of doing ``the difficult
diplomatic work of persuading.'' Albright's spokesman, James Rubin,
said Boutros-Ghali had neglected his core duty: ``Smooth
cooperation with the United States.''

   A Respite (Sort of) for Springer
</P>
<P>
   Many fans of ``The Jerry Springer Show'' were angered when the
episodes ``Guess What? I'm Bisexual'' and ``My Daughter Wants to Be
an Adult Film Star'' were yanked, replaced by tamer, 6-year-old
reruns. Some station owners were peeved, too, because the show
mesmerizes viewers at a Nielsen-rating level second only to
``Oprah'' and ``Judge Judy,'' earning scads of money.
</P>
<P>
   But Studios USA, the show's owner, was getting political heat
again about the daily format of sexual confrontations leading to
fights. And a Chicago alderman, Edward M. Burke, wantedto know why
off-duty Chicago policemen working as security guards don't arrest
guests for assault and battery.
</P>
<P>
   So executives at Studios USA got righteous _ again. First, they
announced they would ``control'' the violence (April 1998). Then
they said they'd ``eliminate'' it (June). They were also going to
``edit it responsibly'' (July). But the ratings fell. So breast
baring and hair pulling resumed. Now they say ``violence, physical
confrontation or profanity'' will again be edited out.

   Today, long after that quintessential nugget of Cold War
bluster, who has come closest to winning the bet? It would be a

   If you're anything like the pampered, reluctant farmer's wife
played by Eva Gabor in ``Green Acres'' _ ``Dahling, I love you, but

   The genetic material in Dolly, the sheep that was the first

   Nearly three years after John Huang emerged as a central figure

plead guilty to a single felony charge of conspiring to make
illegal contributions. Republicans dismissed the plea agreement as
a sweetheart deal: Huang will receive no jail time in exchange for
his continuing cooperation with authorities. Federal prosecutors
will also clear him of charges contained in congressional reports
on the fund-raising issue that he may have had an espionage
relationship with China.

   A School's Responsibility
</P>
<P>
   As the Supreme Court interpreted federal laws over the years to
provide protection against sexual harassment, uncertainty remained
over whether any law even applied to harassment of one student by
another. Now, as a result of a bitterly fought 5-4 ruling, school
districts are on notice that they can be sued for failing to stop
severe and pervasive harassment in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   The court's dissenters said the ruling opened the door to
massive federal intrusion. But school board lawyers said that it
was clear the ruling applied only to egregious behavior and that
they could live with it.

   New Hampshire's New Holiday
</P>
<P>
   As one civil rights advocate put it, New Hampshire won the race
to be last. It effectively agreed to become the 50th state to adopt
a holiday honoring the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The state
House of Representatives, which had resisted in the past, voted
solidly to attach King's name to the existing Civil Rights Day, and
no further hindrances remained to the new holiday. Most other
states approved a Martin Luther King Day in the 1980s. So what took
New Hampshire so long? Some holiday advocates said it was not
racism that resisted the change but the tradition-bound,
independent-minded nature of residents.

and humanities (down about 1 percent). But donations jumped by 20
percent or more in environment and wildlife, health, human services
and public benefit organizations (which includes civil rights

   The balance of power between the United States and the United
Nations is always tricky. And now former Secretary General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali, in his book ``Unvanquished: A U.S.-U.N. Saga,''
writes of his 1996 ouster, blaming it on caving in to Bob Dole's
``claim that American troops served under my `command.''' He feels
especially betrayed by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, he
says, accusing her of lecturing instead of doing ``the difficult
diplomatic work of persuading.'' Albright's spokesman, James Rubin,
said Boutros-Ghali had neglected his core duty: ``Smooth
cooperation with the United States.''

   A Respite (Sort of) for Springer
</P>
<P>
   Many fans of ``The Jerry Springer Show'' were angered when the
episodes ``Guess What? I'm Bisexual'' and ``My Daughter Wants to Be
an Adult Film Star'' were yanked, replaced by tamer, 6-year-old
reruns. Some station owners were peeved, too, because the show
mesmerizes viewers at a Nielsen-rating level second only to
``Oprah'' and ``Judge Judy,'' earning scads of money.
</P>
<P>
   But Studios USA, the show's owner, was getting political heat
again about the daily format of sexual confrontations leading to
fights. And a Chicago alderman, Edward M. Burke, wanted to know why
off-duty Chicago policemen working as security guards don't arrest
guests for assault and battery.
</P>
<P>
   So executives at Studios USA got righteous _ again. First, they
announced they would ``control'' the violence (April 1998). Then
they said they'd ``eliminate'' it (June). They were also going to
``edit it responsibly'' (July). But the ratings fell. So breast
baring and hair pulling resumed. Now they say ``violence, physical
confrontation or profanity'' will again be edited out.

been a member of the Soviet Communist Party, but Nixon, who spent a

<P>
   HONOLULU _ Frank Hartwell was in a cheerful mood as he finished
his rounds as a tour guide on the USS Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? He could personally share in the collective pride
over Mighty Mo, one of America's most celebrated warships.
Hartwell, who joined the Navy while his family was living in Santa
Monica, had been assigned to the destroyer Satterlee during World
War II, and had guarded the Missouri's flank during the furious
battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had picket duty. We formed the protection ring around
her,'' Hartwell said. He laughed. ``In other words, we were
expendable. Our job was to keep the kamikazes (Japanese suicide
bombers) off the big ships.''
</P>
<P>
   And now he stood just a few feet from a plaque on the Missouri's
deck that commemorates the exact spot where Japan signed a
surrender document in September 1945.
</P>
<P>
   The sun was shining here in Hawaii. Douglas MacArthur's voice,
recorded at the surrender ceremony, boomed from a loudspeaker
overhead: ``May God preserve it ... These proceedings are closed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hartwell's enjoyment of the moment was short-lived, as is
the case with most visitors to the Missouri, which has tied up in
Pearl Harbor since the end of January. Even on these decks, the eye
is naturally drawn forward, to a point just off the bow, where the
gleaming white USS Arizona Memorial lies silently in the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've visited it nine times,'' Hartwell said. ``I can't help
choking up every time, seeing those 1,177 names. It just grabs
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the two memorials, in unique juxtaposition, seize
visitors in radically different ways.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona is a symbol of the start of America's war in the
Pacific. In Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, it was
torn apart when a bomb from overhead crashed into an ammunition
magazine, sending the battleship to the harbor floor in less than
nine minutes. Its loss of 1,177 crewmen _ 77 percent of the 1,535
men assigned to the ship at the time _ constitutes the single
greatest naval disaster in American history.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri, with its famous Surrender Deck, represents the
other bookend of World War II _ its conclusion. And its history is
as storied as the Arizona's is tragic. The Missouri, whose hull was
laid in 1941, was in action as recently as 1991, when its tomahawk
missiles pounded Iraqi positions in Kuwait and Baghdad during
Operation Desert Storm.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri was decommissioned the next year (the second time
in its history it had been mothballed) and ultimately came to rest
here as a kind of museum at anchor. As if in a symbolically
protective gesture, the Missouri's famed 16-inch guns point
directly over the top of the Arizona, which lies submerged a few
hundred feet away.
</P>
<P>
   The Mighty Mo has already proven to be an irresistible lure for
tourists stopping in to see the Arizona. In its first two months
here, it drew 88,852 visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Its contrasts with the Arizona extend well beyond the histories
of the two ships. The USS Arizona Memorial is administered by the
National Park Service, and its documentary film, boat ride into the
harbor and visit to the memorial are all provided at no cost. The
Battleship Missouri Memorial is maintained by the private USS
Missouri Memorial Association, and it charges adults anywhere from
$10 for general admission to $29 for a deluxe tour.
</P>
<P>
   As a tourist attraction, the Missouri is very much in a state of
evolution. ``Since opening (it), we've found that visitors are
fascinated about seeing its interior and how sailors lived and
worked,'' said Don Hess, the memorial's vice president of
operations.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate the curiosity, the memorial association is
gradually making over various rooms in the ship as exhibits in an
attempt to show how they were used.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, visitors can peek in on an officer's stateroom and
the ward room, and wander through the bridge. As an inducement to
pop for the higher-priced tour, the ship recently opened its combat
engagement center _ the ship's nerve center during an attack _ to
its Signature Tour patrons only.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, there are further plans to open the
mess deck and crew berthing area. ``If you come back a year from
now, there will be so much more open,'' said spokesman Patrick
Dugan. ``We just need time to get it all ready. It came into Hawaii
on Father's Day last year, and it needed some work. It was rusty.
It needed a paint job. A lot of work was done before its grand
opening in January.''
</P>
<P>
   Even for the standard admission _ $10 for adults, $6 for
children ages 4 to 12 _ the Missouri is well worth the visit.
</P>
<P>
   It's intriguing to walk through the area of the Surrender Deck,
where black-and-white photos of the event are displayed and
MacArthur's voice transports you back into history.
</P>
<P>
   Another visitors' favorite: the 16-inch guns, which stretch out
ominously along the forward deck. They were capable of firing
2,000-pound shells for distances of 20 miles or more. Imagine a Geo
Metro being tossed from Catalina Island and taking out the Ports o'
Call restaurant in San Pedro.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the Missouri are collected at a ticket booth next to
the USS Arizona Memorial parking lot, then ferried over the bridge
to Ford Island on open-air trolleys.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, however, the ship already shows signs of being
cluttered up with tourist trappings. The pier alongside it, for
example, has become home to all manner of military vehicles (many
draped with camouflage netting) that have absolutely nothing to do
with naval warfare.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona, by contrast, is maintaining a longstanding
tradition of quiet dignity. At this hallowed site, anything more
would be crass.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors are first given a priority number. It is essential:
Some 1.5 million people visit this park every year, with the summer
months experiencing the greatest crush.
</P>
<P>
   When your number is called, you file into a theater to watch a
brief documentary film. Mercifully, the lights are dimmed for this
presentation; many visitors, particularly those who are old enough
to have lived through Pearl Harbor and the horrors of the war, dab
at their eyes as details of the Arizona's demise are presented.
</P>
<P>
   It was an unbelievably lucky shot, really. A Japanese plane
dropped a 1,760-pound armor-piercing bomb that landed alongside the
second turret, crashed through four decks and detonated in the
ship's forward ammunition magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The concussion, according to Walter Lord's 1957 best seller
``Day of Infamy,'' was more like a ``whoom'' than a ``bang,'' but
it was so great that it stalled the engine of a pickup truck being
driven along Ford Island by an aviation ordnance man.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion literally blew off the Arizona's bow and ignited
fires that burned for 2 1/2 days. In less than nine minutes, the
ship was at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   The attack was well-timed, because seven U.S. battleships were
lined up like cars at a toll booth along the east side of Ford
Island: the Nevada, Arizona, Tennessee, West Virginia, Maryland,
Oklahoma and California. (Today, the Missouri is tied up roughly
where the Maryland and Oklahoma sat side by side.)
</P>
<P>
   The element of surprise in the attack was also extreme. U.S.
practice for an attack had been so extensive that in the early
stages the presumption was widespread _ from lowest rank to highest
_ that this was just another drill. According to Lord's book, one
commander even assumed that a diving plane was some hot-dogging
U.S. aviator, and tried to get the number on the plane to report
him.
</P>
<P>
   Early warning systems were fairly primitive in that day, too,
but one was working fine. The story of its operation is one of the
most wrenching of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   At a radar placement near Kahuku on Oahu's north shore, the
screen suddenly filled with blips just after 7 a.m. _ nearly an
hour before the attack would begin. The operators had picked up the
first wave of Japanese attack planes, launched from aircraft
carriers 230 miles to the north of the island. But when the
operators, both privates, breathlessly relayed their news to an
Army lieutenant at Fort Shafter on the western outskirts of
Honolulu, the lieutenant surmised that the they'd merely picked up
a cluster of inbound U.S. planes and told them, ``Look, don't worry
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese arrived at Pearl Harbor about a half hour later,
and carried out their two-hour attack nearly without challenge.
</P>
<P>
   As devastating as the attack was, it could have been much worse.
The American fleet of aircraft carriers was out to sea at the time,
and it would prove to be a key component of the war in the Pacific.
Also, while the attack pilots concentrated on the ships in the
harbor, they ignored the repair and construction facilities, the
fuel storage tanks and the submarine base.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the U.S. was able to recover rather quickly. In fact,
although Battleship Row endured the brunt of the attack, five of
the seven ships were salvaged and were back in action during the
war. Only two were utter losses: the Oklahoma, which capsized, and
the Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Today, visitors assemble on a sun-washed dock to climb into the
launch that will carry them to the USS Arizona Memorial. The boat
is manned by young sailors in crisp white uniforms. It's impossible
to look at them and not think of their Navy forebears, slowly
stirring on a Sunday morning 58 years ago, oblivious to the sudden
tragedy that was about to be visited on them from high overhead.
</P>
<P>
   At the memorial itself, conversation tends to be hushed. The
184-foot slab of concrete spans the midsection of the ship, and the
hulk lies just inches below the surface of the water, an aft turret
and other rusted remnants protruding here and there. Many of the
crewmen remain entombed below.
</P>
<P>
   In the shrine room, at the end closest to Ford Island, a marble
wall contains the names of the ship's 1,177 dead _ which represent
more than half of the 2,340 military deaths suffered in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   It's a moving experience to survey the names, all the more so if
you've heard a personal remembrance.
</P>
<P>
   My dad used to play baseball in Princeville, Ill., with one of
these guys. Jack Sniff. Said to be a pretty good pitcher as a
teen-ager before duty called. And there he is, listed among the
U.S. Marines who were assigned to the Arizona: J.B. Sniff, CPL.
</P>
<P>
   Later, out on the center section of the memorial, park ranger
Mary Kalishevich indicated a slick of oil near the protruding
turret. No, she says, that did not come from the launch that
brought us out here. It still gurgles forth from this sunken ship,
all these years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no idea how much oil was on the ship when she was
sunk,'' Kalishevich said, ``and we have no idea how much oil is
left.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a myth out here _ that when the last survivor dies,
she will stop crying tears of oil for her crewmen to come back.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU _ Frank Hartwell was in a cheerful mood as he finished
his rounds as a tour guide on the USS Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? He could personally share in the collective pride
over Mighty Mo, one of America's most celebrated warships.
Hartwell, who joined the Navy while his family was living in Santa
Monica, had been assigned to the destroyer Satterlee during World
War II, and had guarded the Missouri's flank during the furious
battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had picket duty. We formed the protection ring around
her,'' Hartwell said. He laughed. ``In other words, we were
expendable. Our job was to keep the kamikazes (Japanese suicide
bombers) off the big ships.''
</P>
<P>
   And now he stood just a few feet from a plaque on the Missouri's
deck that commemorates the exact spot where Japan signed a
surrender document in September 1945.
</P>
<P>
   The sun was shining here in Hawaii. Douglas MacArthur's voice,
recorded at the surrender ceremony, boomed from a loudspeaker
overhead: ``May God preserve it ... These proceedings are closed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hartwell's enjoyment of the moment was short-lived, as is
the case with most visitors to the Missouri, which has tied up in
Pearl Harbor since the end of January. Even on these decks, the eye
is naturally drawn forward, to a point just off the bow, where the
gleaming white USS Arizona Memorial lies silently in the water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've visited it nine times,'' Hartwell said. ``I can't help
choking up every time, seeing those 1,177 names. It just grabs
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the two memorials, in unique juxtaposition, seize
visitors in radically different ways.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona is a symbol of the start of America's war in the
Pacific. In Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, it was
torn apart when a bomb from overhead crashed into an ammunition
magazine, sending the battleship to the harbor floor in less than
nine minutes. Its loss of 1,177 crewmen _ 77 percent of the 1,535
men assigned to the ship at the time _ constitutes the single
greatest naval disaster in American history.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri, with its famous Surrender Deck, represents the
other bookend of World War II _ its conclusion. And its history is
as storied as the Arizona's is tragic. The Missouri, whose hull was
laid in 1941, was in action as recently as 1991, when its tomahawk
missiles pounded Iraqi positions in Kuwait and Baghdad during
Operation Desert Storm.
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri was decommissioned the next year (the second time
in its history it had been mothballed) and ultimately came to rest
here as a kind of museum at anchor. As if in a symbolically
protective gesture, the Missouri's famed 16-inch guns point
directly over the top of the Arizona, which lies submerged a few
hundred feet away.
</P>
<P>
   The Mighty Mo has already proven to be an irresistible lure for
tourists stopping in to see the Arizona. In its first two months
here, it drew 88,852 visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Its contrasts with the Arizona extend well beyond the histories
of the two ships. The USS Arizona Memorial is administered by the
National Park Service, and its documentary film, boat ride into the
harbor and visit to the memorial are all provided at no cost. The
Battleship Missouri Memorial is maintained by the private USS
Missouri Memorial Association, and it charges adults anywhere from
$10 for general admission to $29 for a deluxe tour.
</P>
<P>
   As a tourist attraction, the Missouri is very much in a state of
evolution. ``Since opening (it), we've found that visitors are
fascinated about seeing its interior and how sailors lived and
worked,'' said Don Hess, the memorial's vice president of
operations.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate the curiosity, the memorial association is
gradually making over various rooms in the ship as exhibits in an
attempt to show how they were used.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, visitors can peek in on an officer's stateroom and
the ward room, and wander through the bridge. As an inducement to
pop for the higher-priced tour, the ship recently opened its combat
engagement center _ the ship's nerve center during an attack _ to
its Signature Tour patrons only.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, there are further plans to open the
mess deck and crew berthing area. ``If you come back a year from
now, there will be so much more open,'' said spokesman Patrick
Dugan. ``We just need time to get it all ready. It came into Hawaii
on Father's Day last year, and it needed some work. It was rusty.
It needed a paint job. A lot of work was done before its grand
opening in January.''
</P>
<P>
   Even for the standard admission _ $10 for adults, $6 for
children ages 4 to 12 _ the Missouri is well worth the visit.
</P>
<P>
   It's intriguing to walk through the area of the Surrender Deck,
where black-and-white photos of the event are displayed and
MacArthur's voice transports you back into history.
</P>
<P>
   Another visitors' favorite: the 16-inch guns, which stretch out
ominously along the forward deck. They were capable of firing
2,000-pound shells for distances of 20 miles or more. Imagine a Geo
Metro being tossed from Catalina Island and taking out the Ports o'
Call restaurant in San Pedro.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the Missouri are collected at a ticket booth next to
the USS Arizona Memorial parking lot, then ferried over the bridge
to Ford Island on open-air trolleys.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, however, the ship already shows signs of being
cluttered up with tourist trappings. The pier alongside it, for
example, has become home to all manner of military vehicles (many
draped with camouflage netting) that have absolutely nothing to do
with naval warfare.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona, by contrast, is maintaining a longstanding
tradition of quiet dignity. At this hallowed site, anything more
would be crass.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors are first given a priority number. It is essential:
Some 1.5 million people visit this park every year, with the summer
months experiencing the greatest crush.
</P>
<P>
   When your number is called, you file into a theater to watch a
brief documentary film. Mercifully, the lights are dimmed for this
presentation; many visitors, particularly those who are old enough
to have lived through Pearl Harbor and the horrors of the war, dab
at their eyes as details of the Arizona's demise are presented.
</P>
<P>
   It was an unbelievably lucky shot, really. A Japanese plane
dropped a 1,760-pound armor-piercing bomb that landed alongside the
second turret, crashed through four decks and detonated in the
ship's forward ammunition magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The concussion, according to Walter Lord's 1957 best seller
``Day of Infamy,'' was more like a ``whoom'' than a ``bang,'' but
it was so great that it stalled the engine of a pickup truck being
driven along Ford Island by an aviation ordnance man.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion literally blew off the Arizona's bow and ignited
fires that burned for 2 1/2 days. In less than nine minutes, the
ship was at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   The attack was well-timed, because seven U.S. battleships were
lined up like cars at a toll booth along the east side of Ford
Island: the Nevada, Arizona, Tennessee, West Virginia, Maryland,
Oklahoma and California. (Today, the Missouri is tied up roughly
where the Maryland and Oklahoma sat side by side.)
</P>
<P>
   The element of surprise in the attack was also extreme. U.S.
practice for an attack had been so extensive that in the early
stages the presumption was widespread _ from lowest rank to highest
_ that this was just another drill. According to Lord's book, one
commander even assumed that a diving plane was some hot-dogging
U.S. aviator, and tried to get the number on the plane to report
him.
</P>
<P>
   Early warning systems were fairly primitive in that day, too,
but one was working fine. The story of its operation is one of the
most wrenching of the attack.
</P>
<P>
   At a radar placement near Kahuku on Oahu's north shore, the
screen suddenly filled with blips just after 7 a.m. _ nearly an
hour before the attack would begin. The operators had picked up the
first wave of Japanese attack planes, launched from aircraft
carriers 230 miles to the north of the island. But when the
operators, both privates, breathlessly relayed their news to an
Army lieutenant at Fort Shafter on the western outskirts of
Honolulu, the lieutenant surmised that the they'd merely picked up
a cluster of inbound U.S. planes and told them, ``Look, don't worry
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese arrived at Pearl Harbor about a half hour later,
and carried out their two-hour attack nearly without challenge.
</P>
<P>
   As devastating as the attack was, it could have been much worse.
The American fleet of aircraft carriers was out to sea at the time,
and it would prove to be a key component of the war in the Pacific.
Also, while the attack pilots concentrated on the ships in the
harbor, they ignored the repair and construction facilities, the
fuel storage tanks and the submarine base.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the U.S. was able to recover rather quickly. In fact,
although Battleship Row endured the brunt of the attack, five of
the seven ships were salvaged and were back in action during the
war. Only two were utter losses: the Oklahoma, which capsized, and
the Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Today, visitors assemble on a sun-washed dock to climb into the
launch that will carry them to the USS Arizona Memorial. The boat
is manned by young sailors in crisp white uniforms. It's impossible
to look at them and not think of their Navy forebears, slowly
stirring on a Sunday morning 58 years ago, oblivious to the sudden
tragedy that was about to be visited on them from high overhead.
</P>
<P>
   At the memorial itself, conversation tends to be hushed. The
184-foot slab of concrete spans the midsection of the ship, and the
hulk lies just inches below the surface of the water, an aft turret
and other rusted remnants protruding here and there. Many of the
crewmen remain entombed below.
</P>
<P>
   In the shrine room, at the end closest to Ford Island, a marble
wall contains the names of the ship's 1,177 dead _ which represent
more than half of the 2,340 military deaths suffered in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   It's a moving experience to survey the names, all the more so if
you've heard a personal remembrance.
</P>
<P>
   My dad used to play baseball in Princeville, Ill., with one of
these guys. Jack Sniff. Said to be a pretty good pitcher as a
teen-ager before duty called. And there he is, listed among the
U.S. Marines who were assigned to the Arizona: J.B. Sniff, CPL.
</P>
<P>
   Later, out on the center section of the memorial, park ranger
Mary Kalishevich indicated a slick of oil near the protruding
turret. No, she says, that did not come from the launch that
brought us out here. It still gurgles forth from this sunken ship,
all these years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no idea how much oil was on the ship when she was
sunk,'' Kalishevich said, ``and we have no idea how much oil is

Tony Blair edged out further on a shaky limb to press NATO's war
against Yugoslavia. But the only thing that gripped the public was
a photo in the Sun of Prince Edward's fiancee, Sophie Rhys-Jones,
with a breast bared and the giant press dust-up it produced. By

STUDENTS PROTEST THE `SCHOOL OF ASSASSINS' 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Using money they made from their high school
Christmas dance, seven St. Ignatius seniors entered the world of
social activism last month when they flew to Washington, D.C., and
joined 5,000 others in a protest against a U.S. military training
facility nicknamed ``The School of the Assassins.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were marching to the Pentagon, I looked back down the
hill and saw this incredible line of people snaking around,''
Chrystine Lawson said. ``That's when I realized I was part of
something much bigger than just us.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawson, the student body president at St. Ignatius, had learned
about the dark and bloody history of the School of the Americas in
teacher Jim McGarry's morality class. The reality of the military
school came home last summer when Lawson and a classmate, Sara
Suman, lived for several weeks in Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in Panama in 1946 by the U.S. Army to train Latin
American soldiers to fight encroaching communism, the School of the
Americas moved in 1984 to Fort Benning, Ga. Among its 60,000
graduates is former Panamanian Gen. Manuel Noriega _ now serving a
40-year prison sentence in Florida for drug dealing _ and the head
of the death squads in El Salvador, Roberto D'Aubuisson, who died
in 1992 and is widely believed to have authorized the 1980
assassination of Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Romero.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me so ashamed, coming from this country, and taking
pride in this country,'' Lawson said.
</P>
<P>
   Her classmates, Susannah Farber and Christina Pavloff, who were
in El Salvador, experienced the same emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody there knows somebody who's been killed'' by
SOA-trained soldiers, Farber said. ``A lot of them resent
Americans. We had to tell them that we were against the school,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   The mass protest in Washington gave the four girls and three of
their classmates _ Alena Reyes, Sierra Fish and Tonilyn Sideco _
the chance to make their feelings public.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by three of their teachers and a Jesuit priest from
St. Ignatius, the seven seniors boarded a red-eye flight one
Thursday and hurled themselves into a four-day exercise of the
First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we were all back for first period on Tuesday,'' said
religion teacher Mary Ahlbach.
</P>
<P>
   One particularly profound moment for all the protesters was
during a long demonstration at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   ``One by one, they read off the names of all the people in Latin
America who were killed because of the SOA,'' Farber said. ``After
each name, we answered, `Presente.' It's like we were creating a
voice for all those people who were silenced.''
</P>
<P>
   The seven St. Ignatius girls _ each the picture of the bright,
hip, ebullient, hair-tossing U.S. teen-ager _ said it was a little
weird to know that many in Washington probably perceived them as
``religious fanatics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tourists were staring at us and, at the Capitol, the workers
inside kept looking out the windows at us,'' Lawson said. ``But the
people who organized the demonstration made a point of having us
pray for them. They told us this was not about hatred for anybody,
but about wanting peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, in their own hearts, the students believe that the
issue of U.S. policies in Latin America is a sweeping one of social
justice _ no matter which god, if any, a person worships.
</P>
<P>
   Said Fish: ``Before the march on the Pentagon, I was so
apprehensive. We had to go through a training session (on civil
disobedience) just to be able to attend. People right next to us
were getting arrested for lying down and painting the sidewalk
(with blood- red paint).
</P>
<P>
   ``But then this woman was there with pictures of her two kids
who'd been killed. She was, like, fearless. You see that and you
realize that we were just utilizing our rights as U.S. citizens to
use our voice for people our country has hurt. We owe them that.''

   KOSOVO-WOMEN _ KUKES, Albania _ Vjollca Lushnaj witnessed
profound joy and horror in a single night. Her daughter was born in
a Kosovo hospital amid Serb attacks and NATO bombs. Three days
later, she was trudging across the border of Albania, a new refugee
and new mother, husband-less after he decided to remain behind to
fight with the Kosovo Liberation Army. Most of the Kosovo refugees
are women and children, as most families are without the men. A
look at how the mothers of Kosovo are coping, and the help they
need. (Holmes, Cox News Service)

   ATF-PIPEBOMBS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The pipe bomb, a simple
explosive device made from readily available household items and
some gunpowder, suddenly has the nation's attention. The basic
directions for making a pipe bomb are available in public libraries
and on the Internet, and it seems their use is escalating with each
frightful news report. ``Everyone's paying more attention,'' said
John D'Angelo, a spokesman with the Federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms in Washington. But, he said, ``Pipe bomb
incidents happen all the time. I think the stats show there really

laws disqualified them for Medicaid coverage, Families USA reports
in the first national study to correlate welfare reform with health
coverage. Most of the children should not have lost Medicaid
coverage, but few states have taken significant advantage of
federal laws and dollars to expand Medicaid eligibility for

program that was virtually all carrot, wound up with one that
includes a stick. Environmental activists and their legislative
allies wanted a program that was virtually all stick. But
confronted with the political reality of a popular governor and a
conservative Legislature, they had to settle for much less.

   &UR; SPECIAL REPORT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ANTHRAX-ISLAND (Vozrozhdeniye Island, Uzbekistan) _ In the
spring of 1988, Soviet germ scientists secretly transferred
hundreds of tons of anthrax bacteria _ enough to destroy the world
many times over _ almost a thousand miles to this remote island in
the heart of the inland Aral Sea, according to American and Central
Asian officials. Here Russian soldiers dug huge pits and poured the
sludge into the ground, burying the germs and, Moscow hoped, a
grave political threat. Today, Vozrozhdeniye Island _ or
Renaissance Island, as it translates from the Russian _ is the
world's largest anthrax burial ground. American military scientists
and intelligence experts who have secretly been traveling here for
the past four years to survey the island and take samples of the
buried bacteria have discovered that some of the anthrax spores are
still alive _ and potentially deadly. By Judy Miller.

   KOSOVO-NATO (Brussels, Belgium) _ NATO military planners heard
Tuesday how many troops and tanks the allies and other countries
would provide for the beefed-up, 45,000-strong peacekeeping force
planned for Kosovo if diplomacy brings a settlement there. But
allied officials said Russia, a key diplomatic player, was keeping
its distance. By Craig R. Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-DIPLOMACY (Berlin) _ Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin
and Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, the European Union's envoy,
met Tuesday with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and
German Chancellor Gerhardt Schroeder on Kosovo. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-RUSSIA (Moscow) _ Three weeks after Russia and the

for peace in Yugoslavia, both Russia and its Western partners are

Botha for refusing to appear before the Truth and Reconciliation

By Donald G. McNeil Jr.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-MEXICO (Washington) _ The U.S. government's dissatisfaction
with how Mexico investigated accusations of drug corruption
involving President Ernesto Zedillo's closest aide reflects the
mistrust that continues to shape the two governments' dealings on
matters of criminal justice. Officials say it also reflects the
difficulty that Washington continues to have in handling reports of
corruption that involve high-level Mexican officials. By Tim

also tantalizing. By Stephen Kinzer.

   EVERGLADES-SPARROW (Everglades National Park, Fla.) _ Scientists
say the plight of the threatened Cape Sable Seaside sparrow
reflects the failing health of the Everglades ecosystem, a vast
wetland wilderness splintered by canals and dikes and threatened by
urban development. As Congress, in July, takes up a $7.8 billion
engineering plan to restore the swamplands to ecological health,
some environmentalists and wildlife officials say the sparrow is
the test of whether the plan can succeed. The controversy reflects
how politically complicated and interconnected the problems in the
Everglades are, and how difficult any solution will be. By James C.

FOUNDATION EAGER TO TELL FORT CHADBOURNE'S STORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRONTE, Texas _ Just off U.S. 277, about 11 miles northeast of
this West Texas town, a part of Texas history is crumbling away
amid prickly pear cactus, spreading mesquites and a thumping oil
well pump.
</P>
<P>
   It is Fort Chadbourne, one of a line of U.S. forts built in the
mid-1800s to protect the settlers from angry Comanches and to halt
the Comanches' traditional trek through the West Texas plains into
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   It is part of the state's history, but it doesn't belong to the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Built in 1852, Chadbourne was used primarily to defend a stop on
the Butterfield Overland Mail route from 1858 to 1861. The fort was
surrendered to Confederate Col. Henry E. McCulloch in February
1861. The Texas Militia occupied the fort for a while, and then
U.S. troops moved back in after the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   But they didn't linger.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of water and wood made it an almost impossible place to
maintain, and the army moved out. Some historians say the fort was
abandoned in 1868; others say they stayed until 1873. In either
case, they left the native sandstone buildings to the scorching
West Texas heat and winds.
</P>
<P>
   Now, sitting on a small hillside, only a few remnants of the old
fort remain. A long barracks is still discernible. The roof is long
gone and cactus and cedars have sprouted up in what were once
living quarters for A and K companies of the 8th U.S. Infantry.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby are an officers quarters, a small hospital and a house
that was built for Robert E. Lee. He was to serve as an officer at
the small fort, but by the time the house was prepared, he received
orders to go elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The fort is on private property now and has been since 1876,
when Garland G. Odom established the Odom Luckett Land and
Livestock Co. on more than 100,000 acres of West Texas. The fort
was his first headquarters and has remained in the same family all
these years.
</P>
<P>
   Garland Richards, who grew up playing on the crumbling fort, is
the current owner, and he is trying to save what is left. He and
his family have established the Fort Chadbourne Foundation and have
a number of fund-raisers planned. They hope to preserve the
decaying buildings, as well as construct a museum and visitor's
center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We offered this fort to Texas Parks and Wildlife Department
about 20 years ago,'' Richards said. ``We thought they were going
to take it, but one afternoon they called and said they couldn't do
it. They didn't have the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Richards' family has given tours of the fort since 1969. Every
school bus in the surrounding counties has made the trip up the
winding asphalt drive that runs through the fort.
</P>
<P>
   Richards has collected an array of artifacts from the fort area
and is more than willing to share them with interested visitors.
Still, there is no formal museum, no place for visitors to read
about the fort, nothing in the way of available facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Community leaders from nearby Abilene, Winters, Bronte and other
West Texas towns serve as board members on the foundation. They
believe they can raise the money needed to save the fort and turn
it into an educational tourist stop.
</P>
<P>
   The first public effort will be June 26, when the Bronte Chamber
of Commerce sponsors Fort Chadbourne Day, a day of tours, free
beans and cornbread and a free dance. Donations will be accepted.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, contact the foundation at (915) 743-2555.

<P>
   HALAL-BUTCHERS (New York) _ In almost any neighborhood in
America where Muslims make their home, halal meat shops are the new
butchers in an old-fashioned way. To non-Muslims the shops can be
mysterious, even intimidating. But to others they are a happy
addition to the checkerboard of tiny, specialty food shops _ places
with impeccable meat and intensely personal service. Even as the
production of meat nationwide becomes increasingly industrialized,
analysts say that Halal meat is nevertheless the fastest growing
style of specialty butchering in the country. By Molly O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   PARTY-CAKES (New York) _ When a woman walked into Magnificent
Confections a few weeks ago, she wanted a simple cake for her son's
30th birthday. But by the end of her visit, she had ordered a white
sculpted elephant, with it's trunk turned up, dressed with jewelry.
``She got obsessed,'' said Lege Sulit, a co-owner of Magnificent
Confections, a tiny bakery on the Upper East Side. But in New York
today, she isn't alone in her obsession. The party cake has become
an over-the-top symbol of creativity and, some would say,
competitive excess. By Monique Yazigi.

SERB ACTIVIST DEFIES BOMBING TO RECORD ATROCITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN

   BELGRADE _ For the last two months, just about everyone who
could get out of Kosovo did.
</P>
<P>
   But Natasha Kandic keeps going back.
</P>
<P>
   As director of the Belgrade-based Humanitarian Law Center, she
has returned repeatedly to Kosovo, defying NATO's bombs and
Slobodan Milosevic's police, to check on friends and gather
firsthand accounts of human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   With most major roads destroyed, she negotiates the twisting,
narrow back roads of Kosovo, her files stuffed into a black canvas
bag with ``Codman Square Health Center'' stamped on it, a gift
received during a visit to Boston last year.
</P>
<P>
   Her stories of atrocities, in dry, straightforward prose that is
chilling in its spareness, may later be included in submissions to
the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia at
The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few human rights activists to get inside Kosovo,
Kandic is even more unusual in that she is a Serb. Sitting at an
outdoor cafe in the Yugoslav capital, the 50-year-old shrugs off
her unusual background.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many Serbs interested in human rights,'' she said.
``You just don't hear about them.''
</P>
<P>
   She acknowledged that Serb forces have been accused of the
lion's share of human rights abuses in Kosovo that have accompanied
the forced explusion of nearly 1 million ethnic Albanians from the
province. But she expressed frustration that Serb authorities have
refused to give her access to areas where NATO has bombed
civilians. She wants to document atrocities by NATO, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian government has said that the ethnic Albanians who
fled Kosovo did so to escape NATO's bombing. She is one of the few
here publicly willing to call that story ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of Albanians were expelled, by orders,'' she
said. ``Some left on their own. The official statements that
Albanian refugees are fleeing NATO bombardment are stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Kandic provides a perspective lacking in most contemporary
accounts of what is happening in Kosovo. For example, she said that
some Serbs have risked their lives to protect Albanian friends and
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   She said that witness accounts are consistent in blaming Serb
paramilitary units and police for most acts of terror. She said
that soldiers from the Yugoslav Army, most of them conscripts from
towns and villages in southern Serbia, have by and large behaved
better than the paramilitary units.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even Albanians have told me that the Yugoslav Army were
sometimes kind to them, that the soldiers sometimes gave them food,
that some of the soldiers were crying, seeing the condition of the
children,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kandic considered it crucial not to lump all Serbs together. She
is dedicated to the principle that all human life is sacred, and
that to dehumanize any segment of the population, be it Albanian or
Serb, inevitably leads to conflict.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after NATO began bombing Yugoslavia, and Serb forces
began the wholesale explusion of ethnic Albanians from their homes,
Kandic drove into Pristina, the capital of Kosovo. She saw Serbs
and Albanians standing side by side, guarding the entrance to their
apartment building next door to her office.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had agreed that Serbs would defend Albanians from the
police, the Albanians would defend the Serbs from the KLA and all
would defend themselves from paramilitaries,'' she said. Such
solidarity is rare in the countryside, but not in Pristina, she
said. (The KLA is the acronym for the Kosovo Liberation Army.)
</P>
<P>
   Kandic is well-known for her fearlessness. After her friend and
colleague, the human rights lawyer Bajram Keljmendi, was murdered
near Pristina the day after NATO began bombing, Kandic went looking
for Fehmi Agani, a 66-year-old sociology professor and human rights
activist. As a member of the Albanian delegation at the failed
peace talks in France, Agani was at risk for assassination, she
believed. He was later found murdered.
</P>
<P>
   On the way to Agani's house, Kandic's car was stopped by police.
When the commanding officer found out two of Kandic's companions
were Albanian, he ordered them out of the car. When Kandic
protested, the police officer ordered her back into the car, then
walked over and slammed the car door on her legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said Serbia is being ruined by Serbs like me,'' she
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   It is a charge she has heard before, that she is a traitor, that
she is a collaborator with the Americans and Western Europeans who
want to impose their will on Serbia. Kandic, however, said the
adoption and application of human rights laws will bring about a
more stable, prosperous Yugoslavia, one that would be welcomed back
into the international community, improving the quality of life for
all its 10 million citizens, Serbs and minorities alike.
</P>
<P>
   But in a society where even the most tepid criticism of the
status quo is treated as treason by the government, Kandic is
regularly marginalized. Anatella Riha, who worked as a researcher
for Kandic for three years, said she often hears people dismiss
Kandic as a self-loathing Serb.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say she hates Serbs. I don't think she does,'' said
Riha. ``I think she believes that freedom of the press, freedom of
movement and speech, all these human rights help Serbs as much as
anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kandic's name is brought up in conversation here in cafes
or government buildings, the word ``crazy'' is often used, as a
term of both endearment and derision.
</P>
<P>
   Riha, who interviewed rape victims in Bosnia as part of her work
for Kandic, suggested that ``you have to be a little crazy to do
this job in this place. I think Natasha is crazy in a good way. I
think she is very brave.''
</P>
<P>
   Surviving on the generosity of private donors, and laboring
under a government that has empowered itself to shut down any
organization it deems subversive, Kandic's office has compiled
evidence of war crimes in Bosnia and Croatia, where Serbs were both
victims and perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
   Some of her stories capture the venal brutality of Kosovo. A
woman she interviewed in a refugee camp in Montenegro told how some
local men and her son, Nezvat, were killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men in uniforms and caps on their heads came into their
yard,'' Kandic recounted in one of her memos. ``They seemed to be
drunk and shouted and cursed. They told her she would not be
killed, that they would let her live so she would pine for her dead
son. They killed the men with knives. Nezvat bled to death in his
mother's arms.''
</P>
<P>
   She then reads from an account given to her by an Albanian man
who fled Pec after the bombing started. Serb forces burst into the
man's home and shouted, ``You have one minute to leave!''
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter-in-law put her baby in the cradle, and then one of
the uniformed men kicked it so hard that the baby fell out of the
cradle and started to scream,'' the man told Kandic.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of them ordered my son Blerim to stay behind. My son
remained silent, but my wife and I started to cry and plead with
them to let us stay, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a rifle pointed at Blerim's temple. I tried to go back
and help him, but then I heard a shot and saw Blerim taken up in
the air before he crumpled down in a heap at my father's feet. They
got hold of me, too, but then my wife rushed and took me out of the
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we left the room we heard three more shots. I heard them
shouting that we should go to Clinton. Blerim's body was left
behind.''

ANOTHER BOOST FOR NATO 
</HEADLINE>
   (w and k coding.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Thank you, Joschka Fischer.
</P>
<P>
   The German foreign minister has performed an extremely useful
service by showing that his government's allegedly flat-out
opposition to using ground troops in Kosovo is not what it seems.
And Fischer has provided fresh evidence of the one development
since the air campaign began two months ago that has surprised both
the Serbs and most Western analysts: the relentless unity of NATO
to see this horror end on its terms.
</P>
<P>
   As a critical month begins, Fischer made it clear what use of
ground troops Chancellor Walter Schroeder called ``unthinkable''
and what use of them might be anything but that.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings here with US officials, Fischer stressed that his
boss was referring to a British trial balloon about ground troops
going in before a peace agreement but after Serb forces had been
weakened even more than they already have been by the bombing. That
scenario would put Germany's coalition government in an impossible
bind and create major constitutional problems, Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the wrong scenario. What's really going on is an
effort to negotiate an agreement with Russia that would incorporate
NATO's principles in a UN Security Council resolution. That would
be a clear signal to Slobodan Milosevic that he is ``completely
isolated'' _ and, worse, because of the military consequences of a
refusal to comply.
</P>
<P>
   That would seem to raise a question of whether Germany would
have a different view about combat troops in such an event. But
nobody asked it until Margaret Warner of ``The NewsHour with Jim
Lehrer'' had the sense to put it to him directly in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a legal standpoint, this would be a quite different
position for us and this would then have political discussion. We
must very carefully go ahead step by step.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, what Schroeder called ``unthinkable'' was more
like a straw man. The much more likely event is a Persian Gulf-like
situation precipitated by a Serb refusal to comply with a UN
resolution. That still leaves the difficult negotiations to produce
such a resolution that have been going on among US Deputy Secretary
of State Strobe Talbot, Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin, and
Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari on behalf of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some substantial progress,'' he told Warner. ``We
have now reached a door for a peaceful solution. And in the next
days I think it would be very, very important whether we can manage
to get the door open or not.''
</P>
<P>
   If the talks succeed, Fischer sees China's role in the Security
Council as a problem but not an obstacle. His view is that a
solution would not cause ``real problems'' for the
sovereignty-fixated Chinese that would produce a veto. But even as
the diplomacy has intensified, so has the inexorable demonstration
of NATO's united will. In the space of a week, ground forces on
Kosovo's borders have been virtually doubled to a level of 50,000
and the bombing has escalated to include the entire economic
infrastructure of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every day, the will behind this campaign is reinforced by
a conference call linking Fischer with his counterparts here, as
well as in London, Paris, and Rome. The obvious bump ahead is what
to do should the talks with Russia break down, but the key NATO
leaders have not retreated an inch from the insistence that this
mess can only end with the withdrawal of all Serb forces of all
kinds from Kosovo, their replacement with a military force built
around NATO to keep peace, the return of all refugees, and the
re-establishment of an autonomous Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In the current muddle, and with the horror caused by the tiny
number of bombs that miss their targets and kill civilians, it's
understandable that US public opinion is more divided than at the
bombing's commencement. But the polls will respond to developments,
and this is the month when big ones will come almost on top of each
other.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer was the perfect voice to contribute to the debate. He
comes to his job from a lifetime of peace activism, including
opposition to the Cold War's conflicts in Third World proxy states.
But he also has a special empathy with the plight of refugees,
coming from an ethnic German family in Hungary for 200 years that
was kicked out after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The enemy this time, he says, is the ``aggressive nationalism''
that wreaked such havoc and horror in the 1930s and 1940s and
cannot be allowed to take root again _ in the Balkans of all
tinder-box places under the sick banner of some dictator's dream of
a Greater Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the real problem,'' he told Margaret Warner. ``You
have the Greater Albania, you have the Greater Bulgaria _ the
Balkans are full of ``Greaters'' _ and this means bloodshed,
nothing else.'' Stopping it in Kosovo is a challenge that cannot be
avoided or fumbled. And Fischer's important message is that Germany
will be there.

EX-POW MCCAIN LOSING THE SUPPORT OF VETERANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ No current candidate for president has been
more celebrated for his record of military service and heroism than
Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican and former Vietnam
prisoner of war whose campaign has thus far been shaped by his
command of national security issues.
</P>
<P>
   But as he seeks the Republican nomination for president in 2000,
McCain finds he can't count on a voting bloc he might have expected
to own: veterans.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for McCain lies in his willingness to make peace
with the Vietnamese government that imprisoned and tortured him and
to view Vietnam less as a former foe than as a future trading
partner.
</P>
<P>
   That conciliatory stance, which may win him admiration in other
quarters, has antagonized the many veterans who believe it was
wrong to extend diplomatic and trade ties to Vietnam before all
troops missing from the war could be accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community is desperately divided between those who say he
is a wonderful, honorable man and those who say he is a traitor to
his country and a traitor to those he left behind,'' said Mary
Schantag of the POW Network, a Missouri-based group that seeks to
provide resources and support for families of those still missing
in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, that division of opinion is alive in the American
Legion, the nation's largest veterans' organization, where McCain
has been viewed as an uncertain ally ever since he led the fight to
normalize ties with Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been nice if the senator had agreed with us and
worked with us,'' said Phil Budahn, spokesman for the American
Legion, which has 2.8 million members.
</P>
<P>
   The Legion and many other veterans' groups say that by opening
diplomatic ties with Vietnam the United States lost what leverage
it had to press for return of missing service members and of
soldiers' remains.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he respects the views of the veterans who disagree
with him and sympathizes with families of the missing soldiers. But
his position remains unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long ago I learned that you have to do the right thing,'' he
said in an interview. ``I was convinced that reconciliation and
healing from the Vietnam War was my number one priority, and part
of that is solving as much as possible the POW-MIA issue.''
</P>
<P>
   For presidential candidates, veterans can be a potent political
force. They are often well-organized in big cities and small towns
throughout the country, providing a large pool of volunteers. Their
presence at campaign events, with medals on display, can give
credibility to a political candidate seeking the title of
commander-in-chief. Of the 13 presidential candidates in the 2000
race, only McCain, Vice President Al Gore, and Senator Bob Smith of
New Hampshire are Vietnam veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for McCain's campaign, many among the hundreds of
veterans organizations are still intently focused on finding those
missing in action or bringing home their remains. From the Vietnam
War, there are still 2,061 Americans unaccounted for, according to
the Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't been overly supportive,'' said John S. Edwards,
chairman of American Ex-Prisoners of War, referring to McCain, who
believes the search for the missing is essentially over.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards's characterization is milder than many. Even among those
who admire McCain for enduring 5 1/2 years in a North Vietnamese
prison camp under inhumane conditions, some go so far as to
question his patriotism for pushing to normalize relations with
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Schantag said many families of POWs believe McCain should have
insisted that Vietnam provide something in exchange. ``He's willing
to give them all the concessions in the world for nothing,'' she
said. ``That's a tough pill to swallow for some family members who
are desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   Other major veterans' groups are not nearly so harsh, even if
their characterizations of McCain tend toward the tactful or tepid.
The Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, with nearly 2
million members, has no quarrel with McCain on any veterans' issue.
In fact, the VFW worked with McCain last year to get hardship duty
pay for troops currently searching for American remains in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that some veterans groups do have a problem with
Senator McCain,'' said Bruce R. Harder, director of national
security and foreign affairs for the VFW. ``We do not. . . . We
don't agree with those who say he's a traitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the eight senators who are Vietnam veterans, six, including
McCain, voted to normalize relations with Vietnam. He and Senator
John F. Kerry took the lead in pushing the issue through Congress
in 1994, working with President Clinton. They argued that
normalizing relations would help, not hinder, the search for
missing Americans.
</P>
<P>
   That argument did not sway opponents. In 1996, some veterans and
their organizations let Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole know that
they would be unable to support him against President Clinton if he
chose McCain as his running mate, sources close to the Dole
campaign said.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry, a Democrat, still gets upset when he recalls the vitriol
that McCain has endured from some veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the criticism of Senator McCain was so far off
target and so far off the wall that it was insulting and
insensitive to where he comes from and what he stands for,'' said
Kerry, who is also a decorated naval officer and Vietnam veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Provoking controversy in unexpected quarters is hardly out of
character for McCain; indeed, it is his trademark.
</P>
<P>
   The senator, a former naval aviator and a graduate of the US
Naval Academy, has always been willing to embrace unpopular
positions during his years in Congress. For example, he is a
champion of campaign-finance legislation, despite the opposition of
his party and of key interest groups, such as the National Right to
Life Committee and the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent day of campaigning here that included Memorial
Day services at Manchester's Central High School and Memorial Day
parades in Amherst and Sunapee, McCain said he believes that
Vietnam is cooperating fully when it comes to finding and returning
American remains. And he said he is skeptical that there are any
Americans being held in Vietnam against their will.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence that there are Americans alive that is in
any way compelling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the last American forces left Vietnam in 1975, only one
American, Marine Private First Class Robert Garwood, has returned
from Vietnam alive, and he was court-martialed for desertion and
collaborating with the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also believes that some people are making money from the
suffering of families still hoping to find a relative after so many
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time someone has alleged there is an American alive
somewhere and we pursued it, we found out it was a fabricated piece
of evidence that is cruel in the extreme to the families and loved
ones of those missing in action,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he remembers being called off the Senate floor one
afternoon to meet with a man whose father had been missing for
years. The family had been given what was purported to be a photo
of the father taken recently in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``The son said to me, `Senator McCain, why are you keeping my
father from coming home,' and starts crying,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found out, guess what, this picture was of three Russian
farmers in a Russian magazine,'' McCain said. ``There's somebody
intentionally manufacturing this, for what reason?''
</P>
<P>
   At Central High School last week, McCain was the honored guest
at the annual Memorial Day ceremony, complete with a Marine Corps
honor guard and a wreath to commemorate those who died in past
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   The young Marines jockeyed to have their pictures taken with
McCain. A teacher asked him about America's role in the Kosovo
situation. Students clustered around, hoping to shake his hand.
</P>
<P>
   To the side, Lionel LeBlanc, a retired member of the US Air
Force and a 1943 graduate of Central High, took in the commotion.
Asked his view of the senator, LeBlanc at first said only that
McCain is doing a good job as senator. Then he added that he
doesn't believe the United States should have normalized relations
with Vietnam and that he doesn't believe the United States should
send ground troops to Kosovo, two positions strongly held by
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't understand why he was so nice to the North
Vietnamese,'' LeBlanc said. ``They almost disemboweled him.''

   MONTREAL _ The eyes of Canada are fixed on the stars this week
as a new national hero, Julie Payette, a 35-year-old Montrealer
with an infectious smile, engaging style, and a string of
accomplishments that has given her a reputation as a Renaissance
woman, rides space shuttle Discovery to glory.
</P>
<P>
   Well, actually the red-haired astronaut is riding Discovery on a
rather humdrum supply mission to the nascent International Space
Station. Her main job will be replacing a malfunctioning set of
power cells, not the sexiest of space chores.
</P>
<P>
   But don't try telling Canadians there's nothing special about
this jaunt above the atmosphere. This country is in the grip of
``Julie fever,'' burning most intensely in Payette's native Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   She's become a cultural icon, compared not so much to John Glenn
or other space worthies as to pop diva Celine Dion and hockey
legend Wayne Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's our most glamorous astronaut. . . . She flies jets,
speaks six languages, and holds two engineering degrees,'' gushed
columnist Margaret Wente in the Globe and Mail newspaper. ``And she
looks terrific in a jumpsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   Liftoff from Cape Canaveral was Thursday, and Canada went gaga.
</P>
<P>
   ``Magnifique!'' crowed a Quebec televison newswoman reporting
live from Florida as the space shuttle carrying Payette and her six
fellow astronauts rose atop a flower of flame from the launch pad
at the Kennedy Space Center.
</P>
<P>
   Payette's leap into the celebrity stratosphere is a bit tough to
understand. Seven other Canadians have preceded her into orbit, and
Canadian astronauts have completed more space missions than those
from any other country except the United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Payette is not even the first Canadian woman astronaut, an honor
that went to Roberta Bondar in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But Payette has captured the popular imagination in a nation
that is seldom given to hero-worship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canadians, suddenly, are genuinely excited about space, and
perhaps that's partly driven by Julie Payette's own huge enthusiasm
and engaging style,'' said John Manley, Canada's minister of
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Astronaut Marc Garneau, the first Canadian in space, said: ``She
has a personality that attracts people, she looks great, and she
speaks well. Plus, she has all those accomplishments.''
</P>
<P>
   Payette's achievements include an engineering degree from McGill
University and a master's degree in applied science from the
University of Toronto. She plays piano at the concert level, can
pipe a sweet tune on the flute, and is described as an exceedingly
gifted soprano, who has sung with the famed Tafelmusik Baroque
Orchestra Choir.
</P>
<P>
   She is fluent in French, English, and Russian and can hold a
conversation in Spanish, Italian, and German.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother always said there's room for improvement,'' Payette
recently told reporters. ``You just have to apply yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   She's an expert scuba diver, earned her wings as a jet pilot
with the Canadian Armed Forces, has designed computer systems for
IBM-Canada, is a former speech researcher for Bell-Northern
Research, and has done work in ``natural language processing,
automatic speech recognition, and the application of interactive
technology to space,'' according to the official biography from the
Canadian Space Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been afraid of missing the boat, of not being good
enough, afraid of not being able to accomplish what's asked of
me,'' Payette said.
</P>
<P>
   Also: She plays racquetball and squash with a savagery that
frightens her male spacemates. ``You don't want to challenge Julie
to any physical sport,'' said Chris Hadfield, another Canadian
astronaut. ``She'll demolish you.''
</P>
<P>
   As a girl, Payette briefly pondered a career as a flight
attendant. However, inspired by the Apollo missions _ along with a
prepubescent crush on astronaut Neil Armstrong, whose photo was
taped to her bedroom door _ she finally set her sights a few
hundred miles higher.
</P>
<P>
   She was seriously bitten by the space bug at around age 8,
immersing herself in science magazines and announcing to her family
that someday she was going to tumble about in zero gravity. But she
didn't seriously seek to try on a spacesuit until 1992, when she
heard that the Canadian Space Agency was recruiting its second
class of astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   She's been a publicity deliverance for Canada's space program
and the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration. ``I don't
think there's anyone quite like Julie either in Canada or the US,''
said NASA head Dan Goldin.
</P>
<P>
   She's happy to share her professional life, but can be extremely
reticent to discuss anything personal. At the news conference in
August announcing the flight, she refused to disclose her marital
status.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a person sans histoire,'' she told reporters, showing a
rather Gallic flair for drama. The Canadian Space Agency later
confirmed she is wed to Montreal engineer Francois Brisette.
</P>
<P>
   In Quebec, she's become so famous that French-language media
seldom bother using her surname: ``Julie En Orbite!'' proclaimed
Journal de Montreal on Friday in the monster headline imposed on
photographs covering the front page. Quebec aired more-or-less
nonstop coverage the day of the event.
</P>
<P>
   Quebec's Parti Quebecois, committed to separatism and officially
disdainful of all things Canadian, ignored the fact that Payette
proudly wears the Maple Leaf emblem on her arm, issuing an official
resolution in the provincial legislature wishing her godspeed and
safe return.
</P>
<P>
   But she's not simply a Quebecois phenomenon. From Newfoundland
to British Columbia, Juliemania has gripped Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The country's media, which hitherto have shown little interest
in celestial exploration, have lately been deluging Canadians with
weighty articles and television looks at whither the space program
and at what cost. Canada pumps $245 million a year into its space
agency and has pledged $1 billion over the next two decades toward
construction of the International Space Station. Such figures
usually appall Canadian commentators, if they bother to comment at
all. But since Payette hopped aboard, the money has mostly been
portrayed as well spent.
</P>
<P>
   There have also been breathless features about Julie's menu in
space (macaroni and cheese, bean-and-mushroom ratatouille, lots of
vitamins) and what CDs will accompany her journey (Celine Dion,
Sarah McLachlan, and choir music). Other articles have been
dedicated to the intricacies of Julie's high-tech space toilet and
analyses of how Julie will snuggle into her space sleeping bag.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, the attention of Canada was riveted when Payette
issued her official au revoir on videotape shortly before blasting
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you feel some of the specialness that's in the air, the
magic of the moment, as I do,'' she said. ``My friends, I'm nothing
without you.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A backhoe operator digs delicate tidal pools in the mud
next to a former roadhouse in Newburyport, Mass., trying to create
an oasis for egrets and other shorebirds just beyond the parking
lot.
</P>
<P>
   Workers plant green clumps of marsh grass along the Neponset
River near Boston, turning part of an old drive-in site into a
landscape that 17th-century Puritans would have recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Cape Cod National Seashore officials flood a dried-out marsh
next to Provincetown's airport, drowning the reeds that moved in
after the marsh was drained in a misguided attempt to kill
mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   After centuries of watching much of nature's most valuable real
estate disappear beneath cities, farms and other human
constructions, Massachusetts is taking a national lead in fighting
back. Across the state, government agencies and private groups are
restoring swamps and marshes, investing millions to recreate
terrain that our forebears regarded as wasteland.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be able to ... undo past damage is just terribly
exciting,'' said Christy Foote-Smith, chief of the state's Wetlands
Restoration and Banking Program, which is helping with about 100
restoration projects in various stages of development. ``We're on a
very steep learning curve, but we're making excellent progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans have learned only recently how valuable wetlands
really are, sometimes by the bad things that happened when they
disappeared. Wetlands prevent floods by absorbing water in their
soils, trap pollutants that otherwise would contaminate drinking
water, provide a nursery for many species of fish and host
communities of plants and animals not found anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts Audubon Society estimates that the services of
a single acre of wetlands is worth about $170,000 to humans.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, undoing the past is a tall order. Since colonial
times, 30 percent of American wetlands have been destroyed,
including 230,000 acres of marsh in Massachusetts buried beneath
places such as Boston's Back Bay and Logan Airport. The current
development boom nibbles away at still more.
</P>
<P>
   But even the 3,000 acres Governor Paul Cellucci hopes will be
restored by 2010 would bring Massachusetts to the brink of a
milestone achieved by few, if any, other states: creating more
wetlands than it destroys. Tighter laws since the 1970s have cut
wetland loss to less than 50 acres a year, so that even a few new
acres a year would be enough to offset the losses _ likely for the
first time since the American Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   That would make Massachusetts a model for the federal
government's longstanding effort to stop the decline of wetlands, a
policy called ``no net loss'' by former President George Bush.
Despite the policy, the country loses 100,000 acres annually,
though some huge projects, such as restoration of the Florida
Everglades, eventually will tilt the balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thousands of acres (of restored wetlands) in Massachusetts
will be very helpful in moving us toward the annual goal,'' said
Michael Davis, deputy assistant secretary of the Army for civil
works. Though no official records are kept, he said, ``It's a
fairly small club of `no net loss' states.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is risk in trying to recreate something as complex
as a wetland, which as the name implies, requires a careful mixing
of water and land to thrive. Tiny mistakes in the land contours or
water flows can be magnified over time, sometimes creating a field
instead of a marsh.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's certainly a lot of science behind this, but there's a
bit of art, too. It's definitely experimental,'' said Gary Clayton,
vice president for operations at Massachusetts Audubon Society,
which is creating a two-acre salt marsh in Newburyport's Joppa
Flats.
</P>
<P>
   The wetland restoration movement is especially remarkable
considering how callously wetlands were treated until recently.
Dorchester's Neponset Marsh, hundreds of gorgeous acres that
stretch out from the home site of a former British colonial
governor, was used as a dumping ground in the 1960s for muck
dredged from the river bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the layer of spongy peat that underlies the marsh is
buried beneath up to eight feet of dredge material and a towering
reed called phragmites has overrun most of the land, giving it the
look of a Kansas wheat field.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more or less an upland meadow. The water is almost
gone,'' said Rich Kleiman, wetlands specialist for the state office
of environmental affairs, standing in one section so dry that
knee-high meadow grass has grown in. ``We've only become more
enlightened to the value of these areas in recent times.''
</P>
<P>
   As governments learned to appreciate swamps and marshes, state
and federal laws made wholesale destruction of them more difficult,
reducing the national loss rate from 290,000 acres a year in the
1980s to 100,000 acres. In Massachusetts, legally permitted losses
dropped from 1,500 acres a year to 15 acres a year in the 1990s,
although additional acres are probably filled illegally or are too
small to come under regulatory scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   President Bush's ``no net loss'' declaration in 1988 committed
the nation, at least rhetorically, to building new wetlands to
offset the continued losses.
</P>
<P>
   The early experiments were discouraging. Massachusetts began
requiring developers to create wetlands to offset years of damage,
but a recent University of Massachusetts at Amherst study showed
that almost half of these efforts fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``You typically end up with a lot of wet meadows'' instead of
land where water is an intimate part of its character, said Peter
Veneman, a soil scientist at the university who co-authored the
study. The trouble, he said, is that developers created something
that looked like a wetland and then did little follow-up to see how
the water actually flowed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, most wetland restoration efforts springing up across the
country aren't trying to put wetlands in places they never were.
Instead, activists and government officials find wetlands that have
either been damaged or destroyed, and try to bring water back to
them, a policy Veneman said has a much better chance of succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   In the Neponset Marsh, the Metropolitan District Commission
plans to begin restoring wetlands as early as next winter, using a
$425,000 federal grant to remove the dredge materials, knock holes
in an earthen dike and increase the size of a culvert to give a
stream more room to spread out.
</P>
<P>
   ``You break through the dike, you create the right elevation and
the water does the rest. . . . It's not super complicated,'' said
Kleiman. He said the increased saltwater will kill off the
phragmites, and allow the native spartina grass to flourish.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 100 restoration projects that the state is tracking
are simpler than the Neponset restoration, so-called ``pipes
projects'' where the wetland is damaged, but not destroyed, and
water flow can be restored with plumbing changes.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the National Park Service last week formally
unveiled a new, larger culvert in Provincetown that, by itself,
will restore 90 acres of wetland, the most in state history. The
$377,000 project allows more saltwater into the marsh, driving out
the phragmites and bringing back shellfish and possibly juvenile
striped bass.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the restoration may improve mosquito control on the
land, which was drained in the 1930s to get rid of mosquitoes.
Project manager Norm Farris said the culvert will allow fish called
mummichogs into the marsh to eat mosquito larvae.
</P>
<P>
   However, not all of the projects are so simple.
</P>
<P>
   At long-awaited Pope John Paul II Park in Dorchester, a section
of Boston, the Metropolitan District Commission is creating a whole
new landscape, including a narrow band along the Neponset River
where contractors have excavated to the water level and begun
planting spartina grasses that would have grown there before the
property became a landfill and drive-in movie theater.
</P>
<P>
   And, on the North Shore, the Massachusetts Audubon Society is
turning the area below the old Sportsman's Lodge in Newburyport
into a wetland that includes three tide pools, called salt pannes,
that could serve as feeding areas for shorebirds.
</P>
<P>
   The $180,000 project requires contractors to excavate down to a
clay layer that will hold water in the pannes, and cut new channels
into the mud to allow water to flow in. Adding to the complexity,
each panne is at a different elevation in hopes of creating
slightly different plant and animal mixes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully expect we'll be going back in subsequent years and
making some adjustment'' to the marsh, said Audubon's Clayton.
</P>
<P>
   State officials say they're surprised how quickly wetland
restoration has caught on with the public, government and
businesses alike. Foote-Smith of the Wetlands Restoration program
said 171 possible wetland projects have been identified in the
Neponset River watershed alone, the first of 28 major river systems
the state is scouring for candidate sites.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, corporations such as Gillette Co. have formed a
partnership with the state to restore 300 acres of wetlands over
the next six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is climbing on the wetlands restoration bandwagon,''
said Foote-Smith, who figures she needs all the help she can get
since it will cost perhaps $30 million to $60 million to meet the
state goal of 3,000 acres restored.
</P>
<P>
   When, and if, Massachusetts achieves ``no net loss'' of wetlands
as a result of all that, will depend in part on how many of these
restored acres are on land that had stopped being wetland
altogether, and whether regulators can push developers to create
quality replacement wetlands for those they destroy.
</P>
<P>
   But it will also depend on whether regulators continue to limit
development to only a few acres a year. A single big project, such
as the proposed New Bedford Airport, could mean the difference
between gain and loss for the year.
</P>
<P>
   And state officials know the political winds can shift on
protecting wetlands, sometimes viewed as an obstacle to economic
development. ``Wetlands are still the most maligned environmental
resource and conservation commissions are among the most maligned
environmental practitioners,'' said DEP assistant commissioner
Arleen O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   But Davis, the deputy assistant secretary of the Army, said
Massachusetts' restoration program makes him optimistic that the
United States can go from losing to gaining wetlands in the next
few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not satisfied with that 100,000-acre loss,'' Davis
said. ``We're seeing states like Massachusetts step up and
respond.''

 By JOSEPH P. KAHN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ ``In the old days, I was very arrogant,'' Peter
Matthiessen over lunch recently. ``I used to say, `I'll write it
and you sell it.' But maybe those days have passed.'' The author,
craggy-faced and dressed in a blue blazer, blue sweater, and blue
polo shirt, clears his palate with a swig of lager. ``I remember a
good friend of mine going out on tour two months before he died,
knowing he was going to die. He felt he owed it to his publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, you're not only talking about your book . . .
you're talking about yourself, and I have always hated that.'' At
age 72, and possessing a body of work the equal of any of his
American contemporaries, novelist or nonfiction specialist,
Matthiessen seemingly has little left to prove _ whether he chooses
to play the publicity game or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bone By Bone,'' his latest book, completes an ambitious
trilogy launched in 1990 with the haunting novel ``Killing Mr.
Watson.'' Set in southwestern Florida a century ago, the trilogy
chronicles the fortunes, and misfortunes, of Edgar J. ``Bloody''
Watson, a local sugar-cane baron gunned down by neighbors in 1910
in cold-blooded revenge for Watson's own murderous deeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lost Man's River,'' the second volume, fleshes out the Watson
legend through the eyes of one of his sons, Lucius Watson; it
appeared to largely enthusiastic reviews in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;
</P>
<P>
   With ``Bone By Bone'' Matthiessen returns the focus of his
storytelling to Watson himself, recasting the saga as autobiography
and thus completing a literary trifecta that deserves comparison to
Cormac McCarthy's superb Border Trilogy.
</P>
<P>
   In Matthiessen's case, dividing the yarn into three parts was
somewhat arbitrary from the outset. He wrote the story in one
sweeping take, totalling some 2,000 pages, and then spent nearly a
decade chopping up the narrative and adding connective tissue.
``Lost Man's River'' remains his favorite of the three, an
admission few novelists would make unless pressed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still like it the best, although `Bone By Bone' has the
strongest voice,'' he says. ``Even if it's not a voice everyone is
going to love.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly didn't write Watson as a lovable character. But if
the reader doesn't have sympathy for Watson . . . then I've failed
somehow. Watson is part of our turn-of-the-century entrepreneurial
tradition. He's way out in the swamps running a 40-acre cane
plantation, and he's got competition coming in with full government
backing, taking advantage of immigrant and black labor. We've seen
this everywhere. If you're making money, somehow you're above moral
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watson is quite aware of men like Ford and Rockefeller and
Gould, who were not nice guys, either. People died for the fortunes
these guys made. Watson sees that, but he also has flaws that do
him in.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Matthiessen's dark joke these days is that someday he will knit
the original manuscript back together again, minus the scaffolding.
``I don't particularly care if it's published or not,'' he
declares. ``I just want it somewhere in its proper form. It would
be kind of a hobby, maybe leading to it being rediscovered 40 years
later. Like `Moby-Dick' was.''
</P>
<P>
   His publisher, Matthiessen adds, ``goes white as this tablecloth
whenever I mention it. My wife does, too. It would be hard work. As
Don DeLillo once told me, the real joy of writing is not cutting
bad stuff but cutting good stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthiessen has certainly produced more than his share of good
stuff: more than 20 books in all, a prodigious output that had
solidified his reputation as the peerless chronicler of lost tribes
and endangered species, fearsome predators and political martyrs.
The titles alone _ ``At Play in the Fields of the Lord,'' ``Far
Tortuga,'' ``The Tree Where Man Was Born,'' ``Sand Rivers,'' ``In
The Spirit of Crazy Horse,'' ``The Snow Leopard'' (winner of the
1978 National Book Award) _ suggest the widest possible world by
which one authorial imagination can be engaged.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``The Snow Leopard,'' serialized in The New Yorker, remains a
particular favorite of many Matthiessen fans. The book grew out of
several influences in his life, including the death of
Matthiessen's second wife (he is remarried now and has two grown
children), his friendship with wildlife expert George Schaller, and
his interest in Zen Buddhism, another subject he is uncomfortable
discussing (he teaches a meditation class at his home on Long
Island when he is in residence). The result is a mystical account
of a 250-mile trip through Tibet undertaken by Matthiessen and
Schaller in search of the rare snow leopard. It also nearly _
underscore nearly _ brought Matthiessen the commercial success that
has otherwise eluded him, an injustice that helps explain his
current commitment to modest self-promotion. A commitment at odds
with Matthiessen's embrace of Zen Buddhism and its ideology of
egolessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've wandered onto the best-seller list for a couple of
weeks,'' he relates with a wry smile, ``but I'm strictly a bottom
feeder. My one chance was `The Snow Leopard,' which got a . . .
rave on the front page of the Sunday New York Times Book Review.
The publisher was beside himself with joy. Unfortunately no one
ever saw the review. That week, the Times went on strike.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there was ``In The Spirit of Crazy Horse,'' published
in 1983. Depicting the militant activities of the American Indian
Movement and one of its leaders, Leonard Peltier, who was convicted
of killing two FBI agents in South Dakota, the book was pulled from
circulation by Viking Press after Matthiessen was slapped with a
$49 million libel suit by FBI officials and William Janklow, then
governor of South Dakota. The book is back in print  &UR; today &LR; ,
although Peltier remains in prison while the suit against author
and publisher drags on.
</P>
<P>
   Matthiessen regards the lawsuit as more dispiriting than
harrowing. For sheer terror, there was the time back in 1961 when
he and some fellow travelers were taken prisoner during a civil
uprising in the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we were going to be shot,'' he recalls. ``We heard
later that more than 200 white people were killed in that same area
that night. I'm still not sure why we were spared.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently there was a field trip to study grizzy bears in
Montana. Matthiessen's guide was Doug Peacock, renowned in
eco-warrior circles as a kind of latter-day Paul Bunyan of the
wilderness. In one day on foot, the pair spotted 18 bears, or
``about 17 more than I cared to see,'' says Matthiessen.
</P>
<P>
   Was he scared? ``Oh yeah. The Park Service was keeping people
out, we had to brush out the trails ourselves. We could hear snorts
and snuffles as we waded along. I kept saying, `Doug, let's sing
something so the bears will know we're here. Like ``The
Marseillaise,'' or Cyndi Lauper.' '' Matthiessen laughs. ``But Doug
wouldn't allow it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His interest in the Watson legend dates back 55 years, when
Matthiessen took a boat ride through the Everglades with his
father, who had heard of Watson's dark reputation _ and his murder.
Matthiessen returned to southwestern Florida in the 1980s,
intending to write a sprawling regional novel.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the things I wanted to write about were there,'' he
explains. ``Traditional Indian people. The environment and nature.
Social justice and violence. The Watson story was supposed to be
one strand, but it was so strong it took over.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthiessen got hold of a few Watson letters and one surviving
picture of him, but for years the family would have nothing to do
with the author. One Watson daughter had married a local bank
president and was uncomfortable with inquiries into her father's
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had an agreement not to speak about Watson, partly
because everything written about him was so lurid,'' says
Matthiessen. ``I think I interviewed everybody over 90 in southwest
Florida, including two of his daughters. Now they all want to talk
to me, because they know that whatever I write about him it can't
be as bad as the myth.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthiessen pushes back his plate and swallows the last of his
beer. Into the dining room strolls poet Derek Walcott, the Nobel
laureate, who walks immediately over to Matthiessen's table and
greets him warmly. While the two writers make small talk, another
party enters the room. Actor Anthony Quinn sits down with his wife
and two young children. Wolcott leaves, and when Quinn is pointed
out to Matthiessen, he leans back and nods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a Quinn story,'' he offers. ``It involves Cesar Chavez,
the California labor leader, who was the most impressive man I've
ever known. Chavez and I were exactly the same age, we'd been in
the Navy at the same time, we liked the same music, the same boxers
and ball clubs. He was very sweet and gentle and a funny man, but
also very tough. And very angry about the humiliation his people _
the farm workers _ had suffered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyway,'' Matthiessen continues, ``this dumb novel came out in
which a Chavez-like character gets assassinated. Now, Cesar himself
did not go around armed and would not let his bodyguards carry
guns, either, although he was constantly under death threats. He
didn't want someone else to die protecting him.''
</P>
<P>
   He gestures toward the actor. ``I understand Quinn was signed to
make the movie. I called the publisher myself, not to block
publication of the book but to explain how a movie version could
put Cesar's life at risk. Quinn later backed out of the movie deal.
I've always admired him for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthiessen rises to leave. ``Do you think it inappropriate if I
go over and introduce myself?'' he asks. A moment later, author and
actor are deep in conversation.

ANOTHER BOOST FOR NATO 
</HEADLINE>
   (w and k coding.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- Thank you, Joschka Fischer.
</P>
<P>
   The German foreign minister has performed an extremely useful
service by showing that his government's allegedly flat-out
opposition to using ground troops in Kosovo is not what it seems.
And Fischer has provided fresh evidence of the one development
since the air campaign began two months ago that has surprised both
the Serbs and most Western analysts: the relentless unity of NATO
to see this horror end on its terms.
</P>
<P>
   As a critical month begins, Fischer made it clear what use of
ground troops Chancellor Walter Schroeder called ``unthinkable''
and what use of them might be anything but that.
</P>
<P>
   In meetings here with US officials, Fischer stressed that his
boss was referring to a British trial balloon about ground troops
going in before a peace agreement but after Serb forces had been
weakened even more than they already have been by the bombing. That
scenario would put Germany's coalition government in an impossible
bind and create major constitutional problems, Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the wrong scenario. What's really going on is an
effort to negotiate an agreement with Russia that would incorporate
NATO's principles in a UN Security Council resolution. That would
be a clear signal to Slobodan Milosevic that he is ``completely
isolated'' _ and, worse, because of the military consequences of a
refusal to comply.
</P>
<P>
   That would seem to raise a question of whether Germany would
have a different view about combat troops in such an event. But
nobody asked it until Margaret Warner of ``The NewsHour with Jim
Lehrer'' had the sense to put it to him directly in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a legal standpoint, this would be a quite different
position for us and this would then have political discussion. We
must very carefully go ahead step by step.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, what Schroeder called ``unthinkable'' was more
like a straw man. The much more likely event is a Persian Gulf-like
situation precipitated by a Serb refusal to comply with a UN
resolution. That still leaves the difficult negotiations to produce
such a resolution that have been going on among US Deputy Secretary
of State Strobe Talbot, Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin, and
Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari on behalf of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some substantial progress,'' he told Warner. ``We
have now reached a door for a peaceful solution. And in the next
days I think it would be very, very important whether we can manage
to get the door open or not.''
</P>
<P>
   If the talks succeed, Fischer sees China's role in the Security
Council as a problem but not an obstacle. His view is that a
solution would not cause ``real problems'' for the
sovereignty-fixated Chinese that would produce a veto. But even as
the diplomacy has intensified, so has the inexorable demonstration
of NATO's united will. In the space of a week, ground forces on
Kosovo's borders have been virtually doubled to a level of 50,000
and the bombing has escalated to include the entire economic
infrastructure of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every day, the will behind this campaign is reinforced by
a conference call linking Fischer with his counterparts here, as
well as in London, Paris, and Rome. The obvious bump ahead is what
to do should the talks with Russia break down, but the key NATO
leaders have not retreated an inch from the insistence that this
mess can only end with the withdrawal of all Serb forces of all
kinds from Kosovo, their replacement with a military force built
around NATO to keep peace, the return of all refugees, and the
re-establishment of an autonomous Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In the current muddle, and with the horror caused by the tiny
number of bombs that miss their targets and kill civilians, it's
understandable that US public opinion is more divided than at the
bombing's commencement. But the polls will respond to developments,
and this is the month when big ones will come almost on top of each
other.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer was the perfect voice to contribute to the debate. He
comes to his job from a lifetime of peace activism, including
opposition to the Cold War's conflicts in Third World proxy states.
But he also has a special empathy with the plight of refugees,
coming from an ethnic German family in Hungary for 200 years that
was kicked out after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The enemy this time, he says, is the ``aggressive nationalism''
that wreaked such havoc and horror in the 1930s and 1940s and
cannot be allowed to take root again _ in the Balkans of all
tinder-box places under the sick banner of some dictator's dream of
a Greater Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the real problem,'' he told Margaret Warner. ``You
have the Greater Albania, you have the Greater Bulgaria _ the
Balkans are full of ``Greaters'' _ and this means bloodshed,
nothing else.'' Stopping it in Kosovo is a challenge that cannot be
avoided or fumbled. And Fischer's important message is that Germany
will be there.

HARLEY-DAVIDSON'S HISTORY OF SELLING MENACE TO THE UNMENACING 
</HEADLINE>

   OUTLAW MACHINE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harley-Davidson and the Search for the American Soul &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Brock Yates &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Little, Brown, 249 pp., illustrated, $24 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like Coca-Cola, Mickey Mouse, and Stetson hats, the
Harley-Davidson motorcycle is an American icon. Cherished by its
owners despite _ no, because of _ its low-tech image, it's a brash
and noisy symbol of personal freedom, individual control, and not a
little bit of menace.
</P>
<P>
   But something has happened to Harley's bad-guy persona, and
that's the central theme of ``Outlaw Machine.'' Brock Yates, an
accomplished automotive writer, attributes the 1990s resurrection
of the financially troubled Harley-Davidson Motor Co. to a gaggle
of well-heeled graybeard riders who carry cell phones in their
black leather jackets. They are America's yuppie outlaws, men
(mostly) who climb aboard their growling Harleys on weekends and
slip quietly back behind their neat desks on Monday mornings.
There's even an acronym for them: RUBs, as in Rich Urban Bikers.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Yates points out, the family-founded Harley-Davidson
company (one Harley and three Davidsons) spent the first half of
the 20th century courting wholesome Americans. But in its issue
dated July 21, 1947, Life magazine published a photo of a boozy
biker on a Harley helping to terrorize the tiny town of Hollister,
Calif. Never mind that the picture was apparently staged. From that
day on, Harley became the transportation of choice for bikers
intending to rape and pillage. That image _ as well as the Invasion
of the Japanese Bikes, which began in 1959 _ nearly drove the
company over a cliff.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble was, Harley never really acknowledged its dark side. The
company, based in Milwaukee, was steeped in Midwestern values. It
wasn't until the hero of ``Outlaw Machine,'' Willie G. Davidson,
began peddling the trappings of the bad biker lifestyle to
orthodontists and investment bankers that the company righted
itself and prospered again. Today, Harley gear _ heavy on denim and
leather _ is a $100-million-a-year business within the company's
$2-billion-a-year business, available in boutiques down at your
local mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outlaw Machine'' is a book that even a nonbiker can like, but
not love. Yates traces Harley's history from 1903, and readers who
don't know a V-twin from an identical twin may occasionally find
themselves suffering from glazed-eye syndrome. The writer is a
pretty good social observer, however, and gets it right with
descriptions of, say, many of Harley's newer customers as ``tort
lawyers who hadn't ridden anything since a ten-speed in Harvard
Square.''
</P>
<P>
   But that reveals the problem with ``Outlaw Machine.'' Just who
are these tort lawyers? And just who are the sinister bikers whose
lifestyle has created such wannabes? Brock describes them well, but
we never really meet them. What are they thinking? What are they
saying? There are only occasional hints, such as the small scene
when the flinty-eyed, leather-clad biker at Daytona's annual bike
week pulls out his cell phone and hollers, ``Jennifer, you know
your bedtime. Do what the babysitter says!''
</P>
<P>
   We need more of that in ``Outlaw Machine.'' And we could use
more of Willie G. Davidson, the superbiker who, Yates tells us, is
the brilliant marketer able to work both sides of the street. It is
this particular Davidson who is chiefly responsible for selling
Harley-Davidson's image of menace to unmenacing folks and thereby
enabling the company to survive and prosper. It is this Davidson
who understands that a Harley answers the call for a return to the
cowboy way of life. And it is this Davidson who appears hither and
yon in the book, but we learn more about him from his
black-and-white photograph than from Yates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outlaw Machine'' is worthwhile for both motorcycle mavens and
Americana aficionados, but it doesn't let us hear the voices of the
people _ especially the riders _ who are responsible for this
particular slice of American pie. In other words, it lacks what has
ultimately made the icon that Brock Yates calls ``God's own
American-made Harley-Davidson'' so popular despite its flaws: soul.

DEBT-LADEN PHILIPPINE CARRIER FACES DEMISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCSISCO _ Philippine Airlines has until Friday to come up
with $200 million to pay part of its debt or Manila will consider
alternatives to the regime of PAL's major shareholder,
multimillionaire Lucio Tan, a government official said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the airline laid off 5,000 workers, suffered a
pilots' strike and a shutdown, and two of its aircraft were seized
by U.S. marshals acting on behalf of creditors. A San Francisco
federal bankruptcy court overturned the seizure, but problems
continue for PAL and Tan, its chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Tan, a political supporter of Philippine President Joseph
Estrada, has asked for a one-month extension of the June 4
deadline. But Secretary of Trade and Industry Jose T. Pardo said
that Estrada's government wouldn't give Tan the extension he
wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president stands firmly on June 4,'' Pardo said in during
a stop in San Francisco. ``By June 5, that's the end of it. It's a
new ball game.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Pardo, the Philippines will consider using aircraft
from the country's three domestic airlines if PAL is grounded.
This, he said, coupled with expected compensatory increases in
flights to the Philippines by international airlines, should ensure
the country is served by long-haul carriers.
</P>
<P>
   PAL has debts of $2.3 billion. Among its creditors are the
Export-Import Bank of the United States, which is owed $350 million
for the Boeing 747-400 aircraft it financed for PAL. The airline
suspended payments on its debt almost a year ago, and lost a
reported $250 million in the last nine months of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   According to Pardo, Tan requested asked the Philippine
government to help the beleaguered airline.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the president has made clear government resources should
not be drawn for stressed businesses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tan, who holds 70 percent of PAL, has pledged to put up $100
million and recruit investors to pony up the other half. One of the
richest men in the Philippines, Tan said prospective investors have
demanded a guarantee that workers will not strike for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Pardo said Manila was taking a dim view of the no-strike demand.
``The government has committed to protect the interests of labor,''
he said of Estrada's populist administration.
</P>
<P>
   Should Tan not come up with a restructuring plan that satisfies
creditors and the government, Pardo said, ``there will be a basis
for the government to start a different track, and maybe open it up
to investors we have waiting on the side.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't name the investors.

OH, THOSE LOOPY LAWS! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's illegal for mourners at a wake in Massachusetts to eat more
than three sandwiches. In Maine, it's against the law to step out
of a plane in flight. And in Vermont, whistling underwater is
definitely illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Those are three silly laws that at last look were still on the
books. And there are plenty more. Here are some of them:
</P>
<P>
   --In New York, the penalty for jumping off a building is death.
</P>
<P>
   --In Connecticut, you can be stopped by the police for biking
over 65 m.p.h.
</P>
<P>
   --In Cleveland, you can't catch mice without a hunting license.
</P>
<P>
   --In California, it is illegal to set a mousetrap without a
hunting license.
</P>
<P>
   --In Rhode Island, it is an offense to throw pickle juice on a
trolley.
</P>
<P>
   --In Ohio, you're breaking the law if you get a fish drunk.
</P>
<P>
   --In New Hampshire, citizens may not relieve themselves while
looking up. But that's only on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   --And in Arizona, it is illegal to hunt camels within the state
borders.

Yummy! One of the wonderful things about visiting Vermont is the
fresh and tasty specialty food produced there. Here's just a sample
of the variety: Stonewood Farm's turkey, Dakin Farm's ham, Green
Mountain Coffee Roasters' java, the Westminster Cracker Co.'s
old-fashioned square cracker, Cabot Creamery's cheese to go with
it, Catamount Brewing Co.'s beer, and the Snow Farm Vineyard and

HAVE LLAMAS, WILL TREK

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT GREYLOCK, Mass. _ The llama trek through the hills was
about to start, and hike leader Laurie Moon was giving the group a
quick introduction to llamas.
</P>
<P>
   They are ``very sweet,'' she told the 17 adults and children
assembled at the Berkshires trailhead. They are not aggressive
toward people. They are good at spotting wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   Then she introduced the hikers to one of the four llamas on the
trek, an 8-month-old white one on a lead. ``This here is Benny,''
said Moon. ``Hmmmm,'' Benny uttered cordially, making the humming
sound that is to llamas what barks are to dogs. One well-timed hum
was all it took for this group to fall in love with llamas.
</P>
<P>
   Moon was not surprised. ``Sometimes it's love at first sight,
and sometimes it takes place over the course of the hike,'' said
Moon, 47, a Great Barrington writer, editor, yoga teacher, and
self-described ``llama ambassador.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But toward the end of it, what you start seeing is people who
want to take the animal home with them. There is a real connection
that goes on between llamas and humans.''
</P>
<P>
   Moon owns five llamas that function as pack animals and tour
guides in her 1 1/2-year-old llama trekking company, Moon Mountain
Llamas. ``They've added a lot to my life,'' she told the group.
</P>
<P>
   And she to theirs. How many llamas can boast of the rich
opportunities her small herd enjoys? During the summer months, her
llamas will trek with hikers at least three or four times a week,
happily carrying their packs and picnics, sloshing through streams,
and mingling with wildlife. ``Llamas get a kick out of hiking,''
said Moon. ``Without it, they would just be stuck in a pasture.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, more and more New Englanders are ``enriching'' llamas'
lives this way. According to Nelson Leonard of the Oregon-based
Llama Association of North America, there are about 120,000 llamas
in the US, and while they've been hot in the Western states for
about a decade, ``the population is growing fastest on the East
Coast.'' Partly, they are popular for their soft alpaca-like fleece
and as guard animals. But their value as ``pleasure animals'' is
steadily increasing in the East.
</P>
<P>
   One of these pleasures is llama treks. Two llama trek companies
have formed in Massachusetts in the last two years _ Laurie Moon's
and Berkshire Mountain Llama Treks in Lee. Moon said her business
is increasing, and she has ``as much business as I want to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Which begs the question: Why would you need a llama for a hike
anyway, especially a moderate loop like this one from Northrup
Trail on the Lanesborough side of Mount Greylock to Rounds Rock, a
mile and a half away.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: You don't exactly need a llama. You can't ride one.
Well, children can, but not adults: The average 300-400-pound male
llama _ bred for lugging potatoes in Peru _ can haul heavy loads
behind him, but not carry them on his back.
</P>
<P>
   They are, in effect, fleecy animal sherpas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They carry everything, be it lunch or overnight tents or yoga
mats,'' said Moon, whose Berkshires-born llamas are second-and
third generation descendants of Chilean animals.
</P>
<P>
   But llamas have another, more subtle function, according to
Moon. They enhance the hiking experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Llamas are very Zen animals,'' said Moon, who has been known
to merge the two facets of her career _ teaching yoga and raising
llamas _ by leading yoga hikes. (She combines hiking with breathing
and stretching exercises, plus meditation with the llamas.)
</P>
<P>
   ``They are so quiet and meditative and alert,'' Moon said. ``On
a hike, llamas tend to go slow. And because they are so alert and
their hearing is so good, they will see wildlife that otherwise we
would miss. They add a whole new element to being in nature.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do I like them?'' she asked rhetorically. ``I think the
same reason you would like a dog. They remind me to slow down. They
teach what is important in life. Eating, sleeping, listening to
your body.''
</P>
<P>
   The hikers might not have been acutely tuned into their bodies
that day, but clearly everyone was enjoying the company of these
exotic, long-necked members of the camelid family, with their
intriguing names like Wisteria Rose, Brian Boru, and Cuchulain, and
an appearance that several hikers agreed was strikingly Dr.
Suess-like.
</P>
<P>
   Saddled up with the day's snack, which included fresh fruit and
M&AMP;Ms, the animals were remarkably good-natured and tolerant of the
junior hikers, most of whom were so anxious to try out every llama
that some animals were not only led but pushed.
</P>
<P>
   At times Moon had to intervene on behalf of the adults.
``Remember parents,'' she called out. ``If you want to lead a
llama, you get a chance, too.''
</P>
<P>
   At times, the hike seemed less like a trek than llama traffic
control. The animals were not always inclined to stay on the trail
and protect the natural habitat, as Appalachian Mountain Club
naturalist Correen Seacord was urging the humans to do. Brian
Boru's basket of food supplies kept bumping into trees and getting
stuck on twigs, and at one point Wisteria Rose plopped on the
ground with no warning and decided she was ready for a break.
</P>
<P>
   But no one was complaining. One cheerful hiker was Janice
Salveson , 70, who had brought along her two 5-year-old
grandchildren, Alexandra Salveson and Liam Quinn. A seasoned
walker, Salveson has hiked the Grand Canyon three times in the last
five years, albeit without llamas. ``But this is fun too,'' she
hastened to add.
</P>
<P>
   Erica Bronstein had come with her 7-year-old daughter, Julia,
because ``I love hiking and Julia doesn't.'' She thought the
novelty of llamas would increase the hike appeal for her daughter,
and she was right. ``Usually she starts to complain pretty quickly,
but she did great. Leading a llama kept her interest up,'' said
Bronstein. ``Even if it is a little weird to go on a hike for a
couple of miles with a llama to carry out snacks.''

GOODING FACES HIS MOST CHALLENGING ROLE IN `INSTINCT'

 By VANESSA E. JONES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Director Jon Turteltaub is explaining why he hired Cuba Gooding
Jr. to star in his new film, ``Instinct.''
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, which opens Friday, Gooding plays an ambitious
young psychiatrist bent on bringing back to the speaking world a
primatologist (Anthony Hopkins) who has been rendered silent after
living with African gorillas for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Why did Turteltaub think Gooding, who earned his 1997 Oscar
yelling ``Show me the money!'' in ``Jerry Maguire,'' could play the
cerebral role? The answer lay in Gooding's 1991 debut in ``Boyz N
the Hood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a gentleness in (the film) that said he doesn't have
to jump on a table and dance to get your attention,'' the director
said.
</P>
<P>
   Turteltaub's comment made Gooding, sitting nearby in a chic
ensemble of black V-neck top and pin-striped black pants, begin
chuckling ruefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish Pepsi knew that,'' he said, referring to the company
that featured him in three high-energy Pepsi One commercials.
``They don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the only brazen comment erupting from Gooding's lips
during the interview. After all, publicity tours can get tedious.
Poised between the tail end of morning and afternoon interviews and
a flight to Detroit for more interviews, Gooding and Turteltaub
fielded questions with giddy, vaudevillian-style humor.
</P>
<P>
   And there was eating, lots of eating, courtesy of the fruit bowl
in the Four Seasons room that served as Gooding's Boston home for a
night. Oh, yeah, and they also discussed the film, which gives
Gooding his first leading role in a serious drama since winning the
Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   Gooding, 30, began his entertainment career early. The son of
the Main Ingredient lead singer Cuba Gooding Sr., he made his
professional debut break dancing in the 1984 Olympics closing
ceremonies in Los Angeles, where he lived with his family.
</P>
<P>
   The gig helped him get an agent. Then he started appearing in
commercials and had guest roles in television series like ``Hill
Street Blues'' before ``Boyz N the Hood'' kicked off his
feature-film career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instinct'' was inspired by Daniel Quinn's contemporary novel
``Ishmael,'' in which a man and an ape sit in a room talking about
the environment and human nature. In it, Quinn suggests that there
are two types of humans: takers, who use the environment for their
own benefit, and leavers, who live in peaceful balance with the
world. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Animal instruction &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In ``Instinct,'' screenwriter Gerald DiPego leaves in the
gorillas, providing lush flashbacks to Africa, where Hopkins's
character, Ethan Powell, has lived peacefully with and been
instructed by a gorilla family. When Powell returns to the United
States mute after killing two men in Africa, his recovery involves
teaching Gooding's career-focused character what he learned from
the gorillas about the leavers and the takers.
</P>
<P>
   Gooding enjoyed working with Hopkins and Donald Sutherland, who
has a brief role as Gooding's mentor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it was very intense, sometimes it was very relaxed,
and sometimes it was straight out boring,'' said Gooding. ``But for
the most part it was something I'll never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to taking the project for its starring role
opportunity, Gooding also grabbed ``Instinct'' because he sensed it
could answer the question ``Can Cuba act?'' What better way to
prove it than to go head to head with some of the world's greatest
actors?
</P>
<P>
   Gooding hadn't had many opportunities to show his talent in
recent roles. He followed up ``Jerry Maguire'' with small parts in
``As Good as It Gets'' and ``What Dreams May Come.'' He wanted to
break out of that rut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lately a lot of the characters I've done have been very
energetic and flamboyant,'' said Gooding. ``Here's one that as a
psychiatrist I sit and I listen and let people speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Gooding will have another chance to show his leading-man prowess
this summer. He and costar Skeet Ulrich will try to save the West
Coast from nuclear disaster by keeping toxic materials below 50
degrees in ``Chill Factor,'' an action film directed by Hugh
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   But first there's ``Instinct.'' The film's producer and director
began pursuing Gooding right after ``Jerry Maguire'' was released,
even before the Oscar, said Turteltaub.
</P>
<P>
   He has heard Hollywood executives say black actors don't appeal
to European audiences, who can give American films blockbuster
box-office numbers. And a Screen Actors Guild report issued in May
shows that black representation in film and television dropped
almost 1 percent, to 13.4 percent, in 1998. However, casting an
African-American actor in the lead didn't give the makers of
``Instinct'' pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing in the role that says it has to be a black
actor or a white actor,'' said Turteltaub, who suddenly turned
serious amid the volley of jokes. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Hollywood and race &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His casual attitude about casting an African-American actor
masks the fact that Hollywood is still hung up on race, said
Gooding. Putting a black actor in the lead role took a lot of
``guts,'' he said. ``And I say `guts' because there's so many
issues that are raised when you have . . . a (Hollywood) community
that is so caught up in what is a black film and what isn't a black
film.''
</P>
<P>
   And all of that becomes even more complicated when the actor in
question is perceived as selling out. Which brings us back to those
pesky Pepsi One commercials, which showcased Gooding's high energy
and neon-bright smile.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics faulted Gooding for doing them, although an
increasing number of stars, from Jennifer Lopez to David Duchovny,
appear in or voice commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Gooding said he did the ads because Pepsi had never featured a
black actor. And hey, he's a Pepsi man; he likes the product.
</P>
<P>
   Bubbling beneath those explanations, however, was another
motivation: a Hollywood rejection story that Gooding told
reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
   He had been talking to Andrew Davis, director of ``The
Fugitive'' and ``Chain Reaction,'' about starring in a movie
Gooding wouldn't name. Davis wanted to hire Gooding. The film
studio preferred an actor with more ``clout,'' said Gooding.
</P>
<P>
   The project went ahead without Gooding and Davis. However, the
name-brand actor remained. Gooding grabbed the high-profile Pepsi
One opportunity to ensure that wouldn't happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, when it comes to Hollywood, you want to get name
recognition,'' said Gooding, the joke-cracking funny man suddenly
transformed into a calculating professional. ``So I'm trying to
keep my exposure up there and deal with it because it is show
business.''

DEGAS AND NEW ORLEANS

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To celebrate the 300th anniversary of French influence in
Louisiana, the New Orleans Museum of Art has assembled virtually
all of the works that Edgar Degas created during his sojourn in New
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Degas and New Orleans: A French Impressionist in America''
runs through Aug. 29 before traveling to Copenhagen for its only
other showing.
</P>
<P>
   Admired today as the quintessential Parisian painter, Degas was,
as he himself put it, almost a son of Louisiana _ his mother was
born in New Orleans. When he came to New Orleans for a family visit
in 1872, both of his brothers were in business and living with
French-Creole relatives in the city. During the few short months of
Degas's stay, he created a body of unforgettable works that are at
the heart of the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   The Sheraton New Orleans Hotel is the official hotel of the
exhibition and offers special packages to the show. For
information, call 877-66-DEGAS. Packages are also offered by
Destination Management; for information, call 800-366-8882. For
individual tickets, call TicketMaster at 800-409-9959.

   Avis Rent A Car has agreed to make each of its 36 shuttle
systems accessible to those who use wheelchairs. The out-of-court
settlement resolves a complaint filed by a traveler who uses a
wheelchair and claimed that Avis violated the Americans with
Disabilities Act. The Justice Department reported Thursday that
Avis has agreed to have at least one wheelchair-accessible vehicle
in all its locations by December 2000 (Boston already has at least
one). ``As the summer travel season begins this weekend, airline
travelers who use wheelchairs will be able to go from the airport
terminal to their rental cars as easily as other customers,'' said
Bill Lann Lee, acting assistant attorney general for civil rights.
``This is a model agreement and Avis should be highly commended for
its cooperation and, more significantly, its desire to provide the
best possible service to its customers with disabilities.'' For

THE MANAGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It is a dangerous thing to describe a single man as
having decisively shaped present-day Boston. How can any one
individual be said to have had a pervasive impact on so various and
complicated a place?
</P>
<P>
   But if there is such a person, his name is Howard Johnson,
former president and chairman of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. And though the results of myriad little decisions as a
leader of corporate boards, foundations, museums, and government
agencies add up to influence of remarkable force _ more of which in
a moment _ he is best remembered for One Big Thing.
</P>
<P>
   At a critical time in the late 1960s, Johnson stood up to the
forces of campus rebellion at MIT. Many university presidents were
destroyed by the troubles. Only Edward Levi, University of Chicago
president, had comparable success guiding his institution to a
position of greater strength and unity after the turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Levi went on to serve as US attorney general in the aftermath of
Watergate. Johnson exerted his influence in more subtle ways. Both
men came to symbolize the power of the center to build consensus:
for increased participation by women and minorities, and
heighthened environmental awareness. And as improbable as it is for
a man who moved so effectively behind the scenes for 40 years, now
Johnson has written a book, ``Holding the Center: Memoirs of a Life
in Higher Education.''
</P>
<P>
   It has a foreward by John Reed, the MIT alum who runs Citicorp.
A leitmotif concerns Johnson's extraordinarily successful
collaborations with General Motors's Alfred Sloan, Dupont's
Crawford Greenewalt, and the Lazarus family of Federated Department
Stores.
</P>
<P>
   And though the story of the tumult of the 1960s are the hinge
upon which the book turns, its highlights are the parts of the
narrative before and after. Its most valuable contents may be a
pair of short lists of maxims _ themselves worth the asking price
for many managers.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of his generation (he was born to a Scandinavian
family on Chicago's South Side in 1922), Johnson was heavily
influenced by his experiences during World War II _ in his case,
service in the First European Civil Affairs Regiment, an
Anglo-American unit sent in to southern France in the summer of
1944 to govern Vichy France.
</P>
<P>
   After the 23-year-old ``Maire de Montpellier'' mustered out, it
was only a few short steps to the University of Chicago Business
School; then, in 1954, to the School of Industrial Management at
MIT. By 1959 he was dean. When in 1965 he accepted a six-figure
offer to become executive vice president of Federated, MIT made him
president instead.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure, Johnson offered no bluster, only reason. He
stood up with equal perpendicularity to long-haired rads and the
hectoring columnist Joseph Alsop. When presidents elsewhere were
being forced into early retirement, he stayed on to pick Jerome
Wisener, Paul Gray, and Charles Vest as his inheritors. Even
Harvard sought his counsel (though he doesn't mention it); but his
friend Robert Solow declined the offer.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Johnson was exercising power in other venues. It
was in 1968, for instance, that, as a director of the Federal
Reserve Bank of Boston, he preferred Frank Morris to Paul Volcker
as president; and led the fight to circumvent the Board of Fed
Governors' wish that a new bank be located on the outskirts of
town, preferably on I-495.
</P>
<P>
   Morris served the region for 20 highly successful years. And the
presence of a new Fed building across from South Station created a
new axis for the city, which promptly began to grow eastward to the
water.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also was the driving force behind MIT's decision to
create the Whitehead Institute _ the development which, more than
any other in the last 30 years, has assured Boston's place in the
front ranks of biotech research.
</P>
<P>
   In the years when he ran MIT, Johnson was frequently asked
whether he was related to the real Howard Johnson _ that is, the
ice cream magnate, who franchised his orange roofs and ``28
flavors'' for considerable fame and wealth. A friend introduced the
two men, and they began dining out with their wives occasionally at
the Ritz.

<P>
   BOSTON _ My irrepressible friend, Joe King, has recently
returned from an adventure into the future. Yes, Joe, among his
other talents, is a time traveler. He is back from a place known as
ProsperUtopia, where the public sector has withered away and the
free market has blossomed into unchallenged domination. Joe told me
many wild tales _ all in a breathless voice. For the first time in
his life, Joe said, he experienced bliss.
</P>
<P>
   It all began one day when Joe received an offer in the mail for
a time-travel debit card from the Bank of the Next Dimension. As
instructed, he hugged the card against his bare chest in the
requisite show of adulation for the free economy, and before he
could say spend, spend, spend, he had landed in ProsperUtopia, and
his bank account was being debited for the adventure at a pace that
could only be described as cosmic.
</P>
<P>
   Joe found himself standing in a beautiful glade. Here the trees
were a greener green than any trees he had ever seen. The sky was a
bluer blue. The clouds were a puffier puffy, the birds' chirps a
chirpier chirp.
</P>
<P>
   Joe was admiring nature's bounty when he began to experience
trouble breathing. He told himself he was being silly, and he drew
a deep breath just to prove it. But something was certainly a
little funny. The trees and sky and clouds and birds all bespoke of
fresh, clean air. Yet Joe's breaths came harder and harder.
</P>
<P>
   Just then a young man appeared from behind a tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi,'' he said. ``I'm Boom.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe could not speak, so he nodded.
</P>
<P>
   Boom saw right away what ailed Joe. ``Come with me. I'll help
you,'' he said. ``I know perfectly well I shouldn't help you. I've
been trained only to perform my market tasks. If an action has no
material market value, it is useless. I know this. Pursue only that
which is in your self-interest _ it is best for everyone. But,'' he
said, breaking off his recitation, ``I can't help myself from
helping you. It will be my undoing. I know this, too. But so be it.
Come on.''
</P>
<P>
   Boom produced an emergency oxygen kit that kept Joe alive until
he could be properly outfitted in town with a PBD, or Permanent
Breathing Device.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have them,'' Boom explained, pointing to the tiny
flesh-colored pads that practically vanished from sight just below
his nostrils. ``We have no oxygen left on earth. But,'' he added
merrily, ``who needs oxygen when you have a perfect market for its
sale and distribution.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never breathed better,'' said Joe, once the color
returned to his face with his nostril pads securely in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's competition for you,'' Boom replied. ``We in
ProsperUtopia are blessed with the purest oxygen _ and at an
excellent price. The market fixes everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bravo!'' Joe exclaimed. ``But what if you can't afford to pay
for your oxygen?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone here is rich,'' Boom said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have known,'' Joe replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or dead,'' Boom added.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the birds and the trees _ how do they survive?'' Joe
wanted to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're fake,'' Boom answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so beautiful,'' Joe offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so fake,'' Boom said. ``You'll like it here in
ProsperUtopia. We're not just rich. Every single one of us is
happy, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And the sky is very beautiful,'' said Joe.

ENVIRONMENTALIST PONDERS POLITICS

   Commentary

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Adam Werbach, the 26-year-old former president
of the Sierra Club, environmental film producer and three-year
resident of San Francisco, is considering throwing his hat _ well,
bicycle helmet _ into the ring as a candidate for mayor of San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Werbach, who is still on the board of the Sierra Club, as well
as Common Cause and Stern Grove, is serious about running against
Mayor Willie Brown. Werbach says he has acquired nondeveloper
backers, a campaign consultant who once worked in the Clinton ``war
room'' and North Woods Productions to do the media.
</P>
<P>
   North Woods made the famous ads for Gov. Jesse Ventura of
Minnesota, showing a Jesse action figure fighting with ``Evil
Special Interest Man.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will make a decision in two weeks,'' Werbach said over a
burrito Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco is a great place to visit, but it's getting hard
to live here,'' Werbach said. ``The only buses that work in San
Francisco are tourist buses.''
</P>
<P>
   Call Werbach a bike-riding tree hugger, but he managed the
Sierra Club's $50 million budget and fought off an ugly
anti-immigration resolution backed by dissident members. But he's
still so young that when he said he had to talk to his family about
running, he meant his parents.
</P>
<P>
   According to Werbach, when he was young _ well, younger _ his
parents would take him to San Francisco from Los Angles and say,
``You see, this is what life can be like. These are called
neighborhoods. Neighborhoods!''
</P>
<P>
   Werbach told me, ``This is the city of Joe DiMaggio, that's why
I moved here. Joe DiMaggio wouldn't be born here today. Fishermen
can't live here anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   As this fan of the late newspaper columnist Herb Caen and
escapee from L.A. put it: ``I cannot accept that Baghdad-by-the-Bay
becomes Beverly Hills-by-the-Bay.''
</P>
<P>
   Why shouldn't an environmentalist run for mayor? San Franciscans
are an endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Brown's recent efforts to make San Francisco streets safe
seem to be working _ in Cape Cod, anyway. Consider this passage
from an editorial headlined ``California Courtesy'' in my folks'
hometown paper, the Falmouth (Mass.) Enterprise:
</P>
<P>
   ``In San Francisco, drivers actually stop to let people cross
the street. That drivers face a hefty fine for not giving way to
pedestrians doesn't explain all of it. If that were the case, cars
would push their luck; but instead, they automatically wait to turn
until pedestrians are out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   And the date of this Falmouth Enterprise was not 1953.
</P>

STUDY FAULTS MUSCLED MALE ACTION MODELS

   Blame it on Barbie.
</P>
<P>
   For years, researchers have pointed at Barbie for being a bad
role model for the ideal woman: an incredibly busty blonde with a
super-tiny waist.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a Harvard psychiatrist says Star Wars' Luke Skywalker's big
biceps are bad for boys.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison Pope, a researcher at McLean Hospital in Belmont,
Mass., has studied how the plastic body shapes of Star Wars and GI
Joe toy figures have bulked up since they were introduced in the
1960s and '70s. He believes the action figures promote an
unrealistic body image for young men, encouraging them to use
steroids and lift weights compulsively.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, when Luke Skywalker figures first appeared on toy store
shelves, he had a boyish figure and wore a white robe that covered
his chest.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two decades later when a Skywalker figure was
re-released, his partially open robe hung over chiseled pectoral
muscles, large thighs, and a smaller waist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite clear that Luke in the 1990s has been spending a
lot of time in the gym,'' Pope said.
</P>
<P>
   Pope and other researchers are worried that the toys _ and other
images bombarding boys _ are promoting a super-muscular he-man
body.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, researchers measured the circumference of GI Joe's
waist, chest and biceps at different stages in his development over
the years. Such specific comparisons could not be done with the
Star Wars figures because of the clothing they wore.
</P>
<P>
   Then the researchers scaled these measurements to the height of
an actual man.
</P>
<P>
   Pope said the original GI Joe from the 1960s, scaled to human
dimensions, would have a bicep circumference of about 11 1/2
inches, similar to an ordinary man.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, a GI Joe Extreme purchased in 1997 for the study
would have a bicep circumference of 26 inches, larger than any
bodybuilder in history. A dedicated weight-lifter would have about
16-inch biceps, Pope said.
</P>
<P>
   His study of the evolution of action figures is in the current
issue of the International Journal of Eating Disorders. The study's
findings should be cautiously interpreted, Pope said, because he
doesn't know if the bulky toy images are the cause or the result of
boys favoring the bar-bouncer look.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Charness, a spokesman for Hasbro Inc., which makes GI Joe
and the Star Wars figures, said their sizes have gone up and down
over the years and some of the more buffed-up ones have actually
sold poorly. Charness said the GI Joe Extreme released in 1995 was
``a one-year wonder that has come and gone,'' because it didn't
sell well. In 1995, Luke Skywalker was also a he-man. ``But kids
didn't like them. And some of the collectors didn't think they were
realistic-looking. And since Star Wars is such a fan-based product
line, we reacted accordingly and changed Luke back to regular
proportions in 1996,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Area gym owners said the trend is actually going away from the
bulky look. ``They are shying away from the competitive
body-building look. Now they want some muscle tone, but not to be
huge,'' said Marco Costentino, co-owner of four Gold's Gyms in the
Boston area.

 &HT;    HILLARY CLINTON URGES WOMEN TO SUPPORT GORE'S CANDIDACY
 &HT;    310&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton urged women to
support Vice President Al Gore's presidential bid Tuesday, giving
his campaign a jump start with a key Democratic constituency.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an exceptional father and husband, a tireless advocate
for children and families, and he is my choice, and I hope your
choice, for the next president of the United States,'' Clinton said
at a Gore campaign rally.
</P>
<P>
   The rally included the release of 4,500 pledges of support from
prominent Democratic women around the country, including Sens.
Barbara Boxer of California and Patty Murray of Washington, 12
House members, Gov. Joan Finney of Kansas and former Gov. Ann
Richards of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in his remarks, pledged to put women's health issues at
the top of his agenda and to fight for equal pay for equal work. He
also vowed to kill any Republican attempts to limit abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Gore called Mrs. Clinton ``a powerful role model'' and ``a
cherished friend.'' He made no mention of the fact that she is
considering running for the the U.S. Senate seat being vacated in
New York next year by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's wife, Tipper, alluded to Clinton's political
ambitions in her remarks to the crowd at the Mayflower Hotel. ``I
wish I had a chance this morning to endorse someone for some other
race,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, during a two-day visit to Texas last week, said he was
``excited'' about the prospect of Clinton running of the Senate in
New York while he is running for president. He said her candidacy
would motivate Democratic activists up and down the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary would only complement Gore and energize voters who
have not been very energized recently,'' said Stephanie Cohen of
Emily's List, a political action committee that raises money for
women Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Gore needs help with women, whose vote was crucial to Bill
Clinton's election in 1992 and re-election in 1996. A Pew Research
Center poll in April found that the ``gender gap'' that helped the
Clinton-Gore ticket in those elections is evaporating following the
past year's impeachment proceedings and the military conflict in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In Pew's hypothetical horse race, Gore lagged behind Texas Gov.
George W. Bush among women, 52-42 percent. By comparison, in 1996,
women preferred Bill Clinton over Bob Dole, 55-37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Hawkesworth, director of the Center for the American Woman
and Politics at Rutgers University, said the defection of women
from the Democratic Party was apparent in the 1998 congressional
election, with older women leading the way. ``There has been a
great deal of speculation that ethical concerns underlie this
defection,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Lichtman, a presidential historian at American University,
said a Senate campaign by Mrs. Clinton could ``keep all the Clinton
administration controversies alive'' and ``make the emergence of
Gore as his own man more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, as a consequence, Gore has sought to distance himself
from the sexual scandals of the Clinton presidency by frequently
citing his 29 years of faithful marriage, his four children and the
expected birth of his first grandchild at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   At Monday's rally, as he does in most campaign appearances, he
referred to Tipper as ``my very best friend and lifelong love.'' He
said she has ``taught me the meaning of a strong, loving
partnership that lasts for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Gore's lone opponent for
the 2000 Democratic nomination, has a breakfast fund-raiser
scheduled Wednesday with women supporters. The speaker is author
and former journalist Anna Quindlen, who will endorse Bradley.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Cesspool secrets

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A fellow I know, who has made a success of himself
in his job as a journalist, and I were on our way to lunch, which
is a way of life in this world center of journalism, when we
stopped by the men's room on the floor of the building where he
offices.
</P>
<P>
   I was in the process of washing my hands when he interrupted our
conversation _ appropriately enough, we were discussing national
politics _ to point out a particularly large cap screw on a portion
of plumbing that sprouted from above the facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know what would happen,'' he asked, his eyes glinting,
``if we should take a screwdriver and pry away that cap?''
</P>
<P>
   Before I could say that I didn't, he went ahead and told me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would result in such a force of water that it could not be
stemmed until a team of factory-trained, craftsmen plumbers were
called forth to undo the damage we had created.''
</P>
<P>
   And then he giggled.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't want to, but I had to. I had to ask how he happened to
have acquired such knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned it in college,'' he said, smirking a self-satisfied
smirk. ``That's what we would do in the men's room of the
administration building, and then run like the dickens.''
</P>
<P>
   I knew he had been a 1960s-style rebel. Little did I know.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you don't do that sort of thing anymore, do you?'' I
asked, edging toward the door, readying myself to run like the
dickens.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't,'' he said, sighing wistfully. ``Now I'm a mature
adult with a responsible position and I conduct myself
accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   And then he told me what it is that he does now.
</P>
<P>
   From one time to another, as he stops by the men's room to and
from his office, he makes it a point to drop a bit of change into
the basin of the wall-mounted, male-engineered device of his
choice, as if it were a wishing well.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the purpose of this is to clog up the pipes?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' he explained, shaking his head. ``The coins are
too heavy to flush. They simply remain there from day to day.''
</P>
<P>
   And from day to day, he keeps adding nickels, dimes, quarters,
even pennies.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose being ... ?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a scientific experiment,'' he explained. ``How much money
will it take for someone to reach their hand into the basin and
fish out the change?''
</P>
<P>
   In case you're interested, the top price so far has been 73
cents.
</P>
<P>
   But it should be noted, from a scientific aspect, the results of
the experiment may be slightly skewed, in that the only other
office on the floor with access to the men's room is a law firm.

STUDY FAULTS MUSCLED MALE ACTION MODELS

   Blame it on Barbie.
</P>
<P>
   For years, researchers have pointed at Barbie for being a bad
role model for the ideal woman: an incredibly busty blonde with a
super-tiny waist.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a Harvard psychiatrist says Star Wars' Luke Skywalker's big
biceps are bad for boys.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison Pope, a researcher at McLean Hospital in Belmont,
Mass., has studied how the plastic body shapes of Star Wars and GI
Joe toy figures have bulked up since they were introduced in the
1960s and '70s. He believes the action figures promote an
unrealistic body image for young men, encouraging them to use
steroids and lift weights compulsively.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, when Luke Skywalker figures first appeared on toy store
shelves, he had a boyish figure and wore a white robe that covered
his chest.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two decades later when a Skywalker figure was
re-released, his partially open robe hung over chiseled pectoral
muscles, large thighs, and a smaller waist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite clear that Luke in the 1990s has been spending a
lot of time in the gym,'' Pope said.
</P>
<P>
   Pope and other researchers are worried that the toys _ and other
images bombarding boys _ are promoting a super-muscular he-man
body.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, researchers measured the circumference of GI Joe's
waist, chest and biceps at different stages in his development over
the years. Such specific comparisons could not be done with the
Star Wars figures because of the clothing they wore.
</P>
<P>
   Then the researchers scaled these measurements to the height of
an actual man.
</P>
<P>
   Pope said the original GI Joe from the 1960s, scaled to human
dimensions, would have a bicep circumference of about 11 1/2
inches, similar to an ordinary man.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, a GI Joe Extreme purchased in 1997 for the study
would have a bicep circumference of 26 inches, larger than any
bodybuilder in history. A dedicated weight-lifter would have about
16-inch biceps, Pope said.
</P>
<P>
   His study of the evolution of action figures is in the current
issue of the International Journal of Eating Disorders. The study's
findings should be cautiously interpreted, Pope said, because he
doesn't know if the bulky toy images are the cause or the result of
boys favoring the bar-bouncer look.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Charness, a spokesman for Hasbro Inc., which makes GI Joe
and the Star Wars figures, said their sizes have gone up and down
over the years and some of the more buffed-up ones have actually
sold poorly. Charness said the GI Joe Extreme released in 1995 was
``a one-year wonder that has come and gone,'' because it didn't
sell well. In 1995, Luke Skywalker was also a he-man. ``But kids
didn't like them. And some of the collectors didn't think they were
realistic-looking. And since Star Wars is such a fan-based product
line, we reacted accordingly and changed Luke back to regular
proportions in 1996,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Area gym owners said the trend is actually going away from the
bulky look. ``They are shying away from the competitive
body-building look. Now they want some muscle tone, but not to be
huge,'' said Marco Costentino, co-owner of four Gold's Gyms in the
Boston area.

 &HT;    MANY WOMEN REFUGEES FACE HARDSHIPS IN UNFAMILIAR ROLE AS SINGLE
MOMS
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   KUKES, Albania _ She is only 22, but with her wane face and
sunken eyes, she looks years older. It has been an arduous two
months for Vjollca Lushnaj, alone and struggling as a new mother
and a new refugee in a gritty tent city in northern Albania.
</P>
<P>
   The soft-spoken woman from a small village in southern Kosovo
experienced profound joy and intense horror in a single night. In
early April, her first child, a daughter named Arianita was born in
a hospital in the southern Kosovo city of Prizren amid Serb attacks
and NATO bombs. Ten minutes after she gave birth, the electricity
was cut and explosions rattled the windows of the delivery room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt so happy when I saw the baby. She looked so healthy and
now I was a mother. But the ugly part of the world was not far
away,'' Lushnaj recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the more than 800,000 ethnic Albanian refugees pushed
out of Kosovo by Yugoslav and Serb military forces and paramilitary
gangs are women and children. Most are families without husbands
and fathers, as many young men were either forcefully separated
from their families, or chose to break away and join the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA).
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the trauma of their expulsion from Kosovo and
difficult new life as refugees, the women have been thrust into
new, unfamiliar roles as single parents and the sole providers of
emotional stability and sustenance for their children.
</P>
<P>
   After Lushnaj gave birth to her daughter, the next day with her
consent, her husband, Avdi, kissed his wife and baby good-bye and
escaped to the mountains cast his lot with a KLA guerilla group
that is barely holding its own against Serb forces inside Kosovo,
the embattled southern province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant
republic.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, she and her newborn were fleeing across the
border of Albania and into a chaotic new world of food-handouts,
water rations and daily apprehension over what the future will be.
</P>
<P>
   For some, especially those from the smaller towns and rural
villages, most daily tasks outside the home, even fetching bread
from the local bakery or fuel for the stove, were tasks handled by
the men. Now, they struggle to learn how to acquire disposable
diapers and milk for their babies, and whether there will be a
school for their older children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The women are now the decision-makers and the ripple effect on
the children of a disorganized, distraught or confused
decision-maker is extensive,'' said Christina Moore, a clinical
psychologist working in Kukes for the nonprofit aid group Medecins
Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders).
</P>
<P>
   The women struggle to adjust to life in the camps and answer the
incessant questions of their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``They understand everything. Everyday they ask about their
father. Is he safe? Does
</P>
<P>
   he have enough to eat? I tell them we will go home soon. Your
father is alive and he has plenty,'' said Hyrie Trolli, 27, who
fled with her two sons, Agron 9, and Arben, 7, while her husband,
Muq, stayed behind.
</P>
<P>
   Tears well in her eyes and her voice drops to a whisper, out of
range of her sons: ``But I don't believe it. I've lost the hope. I
don't think I'll meet him again.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists say the ethnic Albanian refugees are fortunate
that their Kosovo society was close-knit and extended families --
uncles, aunts, cousins and grandparents -- often lived in the same
house. That support system has been transplanted to the refugee
camps, with older uncles or grandfathers stepping in to the
father's role.
</P>
<P>
   As for the women, Moore has found that many are coping by doing,
in a fashion she equates with the Rosie-the-riveter phenomenon of
World War II, when American women quickly and effectively filled
the jobs of men who had gone off to war.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp distinction of the Kosovar refugees is the extreme
trauma many of the women themselves have experienced in being
uprooted from their lives and forced into a life as castaways in a
foreign country.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, they find comfort in the fact that they are not
alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps enormously that they are surrounded by women who've
had the same terrible experiences,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of other women in the camps are enduring the same
hardships. In the Kukes I camp, an entire row of tents are filled
with women and children from the same village, Dragacina, which
also was the home of the young mother, Lushnaj.
</P>
<P>
   The new mother, Lushnaj, arrived in the refugee camp anemic,
dehydrated and unable to breastfeed. Italian doctors treated her,
gave her fluids and made her healthy again.
</P>
<P>
   But the pain of separation from her husband, and concern for her
new baby are not so easily soothed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said good-bye and kept repeating: 'Take good care of the
baby. Take good care of the baby.' He repeated these words and 'I
hope I see you again.' He repeated them over and over until he
finally walked away,'' she said.

<P>
   Q: My sister came across a letter from President Grover
Cleveland that was written personally to her grandfather. It is
still in the original envelope and dated. What is it worth?
</P>
<P>
   _ M.S., Haltom City, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: The value of the item depends on two things: what he wrote
and whether he was president at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Panagopulus, president of Alexander Autographs in
Greenwich, Conn., said Cleveland autographs and letters are
generally worth about $150 to $400. Prices for presidential letters
increase greatly if they have historical value.
</P>
<P>
   He lists Cleveland with Benjamin Harrison and Herbert Hoover as
presidents who don't ``stir any fire in the soul'' with most
collectors. ``It's really how sexy the president is,'' he said. The
least-collected chief executive, according to Panagopulus, is
Millard Fillmore.

and worked there as a disc jockey while studing music. Capitol
Records signed Ford to his first recording contract in 1948, and he
was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'd like to write my first fan letter at age 70. Where can I
write to Neil Diamond?
</P>
<P>

BACKSTREET BOYS ARE BACK _ ON TOP OF THE CHARTS
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Poor Garth Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   The country giant's record for one-week CD sales in the United
States has just been broken by pop disposables the Backstreet Boys.
</P>
<P>
   The Orlando, Fla.-based quintet sold 1.13 million copies of its
new CD, Millennium, the first week it hit the bins. That shattered
Brooks' record of 1.08 million, set less than six months ago with
Double Live.
</P>
<P>
   The pop music industry is, obviously, playing a very cruel joke
on Garth. Consider:
</P>
<P>
   Brooks writes a healthy chunk of his lyrics. The Backstreet Boys
write, well, some of theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks can play an instrument. The Backstreet Boys do not or
cannot.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks can sing. The Backstreet Boys? Take away the slick
production and the coats of honey-glazed, factory-made harmonies
poured on their records _ and you've got a definite maybe.
</P>
<P>
   The Backstreet Boys, in other words, are being nicely rewarded
for being mediocre. They're the Titanic and Felicity of pop music _
middle-of-the-road, squeaky-clean, annoyingly cute pin-ups who,
like the casts of Titanic and Felicity, have discovered the secret
of success: teen-age girls.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-age girls _ or their moms _ are the ones who've scooped up
the Boys' two efforts, Millennium and its 7-million-selling
predecessor, 1997's Backstreet Boys, the group's debut.
</P>
<P>
   They're the ones who, for the past several weeks, were glued to
MTV, watching the Boys count down to Millennium's May 18 arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, MTV _ the driving force behind Backstreet Boys'
teeny-bop-pop winning ticket. Over the past several weeks, the Boys
have been a constant staple on MTV _ hosting shows, doing
interviews, plugging their new single and video, I Want It That
Way.
</P>
<P>
   The Backstreet Boys aren't any better or worse than 'N Sync or
C-Note; they're simply masters of mass marketing. After seeing the
group on MTV 24-7, of course you're gonna go out and buy the
record. And when 'N Sync puts out a new disc, the same thing will
probably happen. And, again, it will work.
</P>
<P>
   But pop music survives _ and thrives _ on such vicious cycles:
Today's mega-hot 'N Sync or 98 Degrees is tomorrow's Jordan Knight,
an embarrassment, a joke, a slice of a memory for some girl who,
years ago, used to plaster her bedroom with New Kids on the Block
posters but now won't even admit to owning one of their tapes.
</P>
<P>
   The Backstreet Boys _ don't worry, they'll get theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, though, what they offer isn't that bad. Their music
is a place where a 14-year-old girl can live out her junior-high
fantasies: the relationship that will never crumble, the boyfriend
who will never cheat, promises that'll never be broken. ``Don't
care what you do/As long as you love me,'' the Boys guarantee.
</P>
<P>
   Their music does not reflect the cold realities of growing up in
1999: school shootings, drug overdoses, abusive parents, teen
pregnancy, AIDS. The closest the Backstreet Boys come to touching
on reality: One of 'em has a coupla tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   You want them that way, though. You want them to keep singing
their sweet, pretty songs about falling in love. You want them to
remain clean and cute.
</P>
<P>
   Anything's better, you figure, than your kid liking Marilyn
Manson.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Backstreet Boys are as harmless and temporary as
the group waiting to take their place _ 98 Degrees, Five, C-Note,
whoever. But for the next few minutes, girls will continue to buy
their records, get Mom and Dad to foot the bill for posters,
T-shirts, concert tickets. And more records set by artists with
more talent will probably be broken.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as quickly as it all came along, it will all go away _
until the next new clone on the block moves in.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks could not be reached for comment.

FRENCH SOLE IN A CALIFORNIA POT 
</HEADLINE>
  (This is the second of eight columns by Thomas Keller, the chef and
owner of the French Laundry in Yountville, Calif. He is also the
author, with Michael Ruhlman and Susie Heller, of ``The French
Laundry Cookbook'' (October 1999, Artisan). His collaborator on
these columns is Ruhlman.)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Classic French cuisine has long had a reputation in this country
for being stuffy and rigid, but the opposite, in fact, is true:
classic French cuisine is dynamic and infinitely renewable, a
source I return to again and again for ideas and inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   During my five years at the restaurant, I have served hundreds
of original dishes. They didn't just materialize out of air. Almost
every one of them has a reference to something that came before it,
and this dish is a good example of how a classic preparation can be
transformed into something that feels both modern and regional.
</P>
<P>
   I learned sole Veronique when I was a young cook, and it was
straight out of Escoffier's 1903 text, Le Guide Culinaire. A piece
of sole is folded into a package and poached in a little fish
stock, lemon juice and wine; this liquid, called a cuisson, is
reduced and mounted with butter to make the sauce, and the plate is
garnished with very cold skinned grapes.
</P>
<P>
   I fixed on this preparation because it uses grapes, and I am
cooking in the heart of the California wine country. Right now, I'm
using the perlette grape, a round green variety that keeps its
crunch after you peel it and has a slightly acidic quality that
enhances the fish and offsets the rich sauce.
</P>
<P>
   I liked the fact that a flat piece of fish was folded to give it
more dimension. I decided to add another layer of complexity by
stuffing this package. I couldn't stuff it with fresh grapes
because of their size and water content, but dried grapes, I
thought, would work perfectly. I use California raisins, bound with
rich brioche, herbs and butter. This simple notion of stuffing adds
contrasting colors, flavors and textures (most notably the chewy
raisins) to what had been a plain piece of fish.
</P>
<P>
   Then I wrap the fish in plastic and poach it in water _ a great
technique that's easy, efficient and especially good for this dish.
It lets the delicate stuffed fish hold its shape, and it makes it
possible to cook many portions at the same time. (I use this
technique, which I call ``boil in a bag,'' for various poultry
dishes as well.)
</P>
<P>
   For the sauce, I enrich a reduced fumet with hollandaise and
cream. Then I glaze the dish beneath a broiler and garnish it with
peeled seedless green grapes.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe looks long, but it's really not so daunting if you do
it in stages. In fact, it's perfect for a dinner party, because
everything other than making the hollandaise and poaching the fish
can be done a day head. And there's little guesswork: the packages
cook perfectly every time because the temperature of the water is
consistent.
</P>
<P>
   Reduced to its essence, sole Veronique is fish and grapes. My
sole Veronique has additional flavors and textures, but because
I've stayed within the perimeters of a classic French preparation,
the dish doesn't feel confusing or overwrought. And now it is a
quintessential Napa Valley dish, too.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILLET OF SOLE VERONIQUE  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour 30 minutes, plus 1 to 2 hours for soaking fish
bones
</P>
<P>
   2 1}- to 2-pound whole gray sole, each cut into 4 fillets, bones
reserved for fish fumet For the fish fumet:
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon canola oil
</P>
<P>
   3 ounces (1\ cup) sliced button mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   \ cup sliced onion
</P>
<P>
   \ cup sliced leeks
</P>
<P>
   3 sprigs Italian parsley
</P>
<P>
   } cup sauvignon blanc or other dry white wine For the stuffing:
</P>
<P>
   [ cup sultanas (golden raisins)
</P>
<P>
   [ cup black raisins
</P>
<P>
   2{ cups diced brioche (\ inch by \ inch) or Pepperidge Farms
thin-sliced white bread
</P>
<P>
   1\ tablespoons chopped Italian parsley
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced shallots
</P>
<P>
   [ cup melted butter
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground white pepper to taste For the
hollandaise sauce:
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg yolk
</P>
<P>
   \ cup melted clarified butter
</P>
<P>
   [ teaspoon lemon juice For the glacage:
</P>
<P>
   } cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   \ cup unsweetened whipped cream
</P>
<P>
   16 white seedless grapes for garnish (peeled and cut in half if
you wish).
</P>
<P>
   1. Prepare a fish fumet: cut the fish bones into 2-inch pieces,
and soak in cold water until all traces of blood are gone, 1 to 2
hours. In a 4-quart saucepan over medium heat, heat the canola oil
and add the drained bones. Cover, and allow to steam 2 minutes. Add
the mushrooms, onions, leeks, parsley, wine and 3 cups of water.
Bring to a boil; then reduce heat to low. Simmer, partly covered,
30 minutes. (During this time, prepare the stuffing.) Remove from
heat, and let the fumet settle for 10 minutes. Place a clean
kitchen towel over a bowl, and pour the fumet through the towel;
avoid straining the sediment that has settled to the bottom of the
pan. Pour 2 cups of the fumet into a medium saucepan and set aside;
refrigerate or freeze the remainder for another purpose.
</P>
<P>
   2. Prepare the stuffing: in a small saucepan over low heat,
combine the sultanas and the black raisins with \ cup water. Simmer
until all the water is absorbed and the raisins have plumped, about
8 minutes. In a large mixing bowl, combine the diced brioche,
chopped parsley, shallots and melted butter. Drain the raisins on
paper towels, and add to the mixture. Season with salt and white
pepper to taste, and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   3. Prepare the hollandaise sauce: in a 1-quart stainless steel
mixing bowl or the top of a double boiler, combine the egg yolk
with 1 tablespoon water. Place the bowl over simmering water, and
whisk the yolk until it thickens and resembles mayonnaise. Remove
from the heat, and slowly whisk in the clarified butter and lemon
juice. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   4. Prepare the glacage: place the saucepan of fish fumet over
medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the fumet to about \
cup. Add the heavy cream to the fumet, and reduce the mixture to a
total of } cup. While the mixture is still hot, whisk in the
hollandaise sauce, followed by the whipped cream. Keep in a warm
place; do not reboil.
</P>
<P>
   5. Fill a large casserole half full of water, place over
medium-high heat and bring to a simmer. Place the sole fillets
between pieces of plastic wrap, and pound lightly with a kitchen
mallet to flatten to an even thickness. Place the fillets on a flat
surface with the skinned side up. Season with salt and pepper to
taste. Put equal amounts of stuffing on each fillet, and roll the
fillets around the stuffing. Place each rolled fillet on a piece of
plastic wrap, and roll tightly, securing each end with a knot.
Transfer the sole packets to the simmering water, and cook 5
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   6. To serve, cut one end of each sole packet. Lightly press the
uncut end, and the rolled sole will slide out. Divide the glacage
evenly among 8 or 4 plates, place the stuffed sole in the center,
and garnish with the grapes. Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 8 as a first course, or 4 as an entree.  &QL;

WHO KNEW? THERE'S A WORLD OF BARBECUE SAUCES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEVEN RAICHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to the condiments served at backyard barbecues,
America can seem downright provincial. Ketchup, mustard and bottled
barbecue sauce are at every cook's fingertips, yet they are the vin
ordinaire.
</P>
<P>
   Travel the world's barbecue trail, however, and you will find
condiments of bolder constitution. Fiery sambals that blast your
gullet and soothing chutneys to cool you. Exotic purees of chilies
and fruit and pugnacious pastes of garlic and vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   So why grab for a commonplace condiment, when it is easy to go
global?
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, I set out on the world barbecue trail, visiting
25 countries on five continents. My mission was to learn how
barbecuing varied from country to country and region to region,
from Jamaican jerk to Javanese sate to Japanese yakitori. I came
away with a newfound respect for the ingenuity of the world's
cooks.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start in the French West Indies, home to a fiery
vinaigrette called sauce chien, literally ``dog sauce.'' There are
several theories about how this sauce acquired its name. One chef
maintained that chien refers to the bite of Scotch bonnet chilies.
</P>
<P>
   Others suggested that the preparation is a mongrel among French
sauces because it lacks such honorable ingredients as butter,
cream, or egg yolks. Whatever its origins, sauce chien never fails
to electrify grilled chicken, seafood or lamb.
</P>
<P>
   Romesco is a traditional condiment for barbecue in Barcelona.
Few sauces can rival its earthy complexity, the result of charring
the vegetables and nuts under the broiler before combining them in
the blender. Romesco isn't pretty to look at _ like most Catalan
dishes, it's brown _ but few sauces pack more punch with grilled
seafood, meat or vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Romesco is traditionally served with grilled calcots (large
Spanish green onions); try it with grilled green onions (green
Vidalias, if you can get them) or scallions. In Spain, romesco
would be seasoned with a Spanish dried chili called anorra. Our
recipe uses similar tasting ancho chilies, more readily available
here.
</P>
<P>
   In the Caucasus Mountains, the mythical birthplace of fire,
barbecue sauce means tkemali, a piquant puree of sour plums or
rhubarb, garlic, dill and cilantro. This is not as strange as it
sounds: After all, many Americans add apple or pineapple to their
barbecue sauces.
</P>
<P>
   You don't need to journey as far as the Republic of Georgia, for
tkemali turns up at Georgian restaurants in Brighton Beach,
Brooklyn, like the colorful Primorski. As for the appropriate meat,
well, you haven't fully savored grilled lamb, pork, sausage or
salmon until you have tasted it with a dab of tkemali.
</P>
<P>
   Our last condiment takes us to Vietnam, where cooks are no
strangers to fruit-based barbecue sauces. What may seem strange to
a North American is a barbecue sauce flavored with pineapple,
shrimp, and fish or anchovy sauce.
</P>
<P>
   But the combination isn't as odd as it sounds, especially when
you stop to think that American steak sauces like A-1, contain
fruit (tamarind) and anchovies. In any case, you would be hard
pressed to find a more interesting accompaniment to grilled
chicken, seafood or pork.
</P>
<P>
   FRENCH WEST INDIAN `DOG SAUCE' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 10 minutes
</P>
<P>
   3 cloves garlic, peeled
</P>
<P>
   2 medium shallots, peeled and quartered
</P>
<P>
   1 Scotch bonnet or habanero chili, seeded and quartered
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons chopped fresh ginger
</P>
<P>
   { cup flatleaf parsley leaves
</P>
<P>
   \ cup chopped fresh chives or scallion greens
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon fresh or dried thyme
</P>
<P>
   1 scant teaspoon salt, plus more to taste
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of ground allspice
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup fresh lime juice, plus more to taste
</P>
<P>
   { cup extra virgin olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   1. Finely chop the garlic, shallots, chili, ginger, parsley and
chives in a food processor. Add remaining ingredients and process
just to mix. Add \-cup boiling water and process to mix. Run the
machine in short bursts until you have a coarse puree. Add more
salt or lime juice to taste, if desired. The sauce can be served
immediately but it becomes more flavorful if you let it sit for an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: About 2 cups.

`BOBBY FLAY'S BOY MEETS GRILL': COOKING UP CELEBRITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Bobby Flay's latest book, ``Bobby Flay's Boy Meets Grill''
(Hyperion, 1999), there is a lot of Bobby. He appears on no less
than 20 pages. And on most pages lacking the freckle-faced Flay,
there is his name in large block letters.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity cookbooks are nothing new; Sophia Loren, Patti LaBelle
and, of course, Martha Stewart have all sold plenty of them. But it
is a little different when a serious chef fits himself into this
mold.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of Flay's television shows may be satisfied with a volume
of flattering photographs. But cooks are another story.
</P>
<P>
   Flay, the chef at Bolo and Mesa Grill in Manhattan, didn't
always take this approach. His first two books, ``Bobby Flay's Bold
American Food'' (Warner Books, 1994) and ``Bobby Flay's From My
Kitchen To Your Table'' (Clarkson N. Potter, 1998), were flashy and
exciting, and contained real information and recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just a year since his last book, Flay has cranked out this
volume. He offers few lessons, and the recipes, though they work,
feel stretched and strained.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the steamed clams with chili coconut broth. The dish is
delicious, but the route from beginning to finish feels a bit like
going south to get north. You begin with a large pot on the stove,
in which you assemble a fragrant broth of garlic, ginger, coconut
milk, clam juice and spinach. The clams are then added to this hot
broth. At this point, all you need to do to is put a lid on the pot
and turn the heat to high.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a grill cookbook, and Flay has found a way to
include one. He has you haul the heavy, hot pot out to the grill to
steam. Not only is this dangerous and illogical, but who has a
grill with a cover that can accommodate a pot holding 80 clams?
Flay also offers recipes for risotto on the grill and meats sauteed
in a pan on the grill.
</P>
<P>
   In his introduction, Flay writes, ``Simplicity is the whole
thing in grilling start to finish.'' He extols the importance of
quality meats and fish.
</P>
<P>
   And then he smothers perfectly good cuts of meat and pieces of
fish in loads of heavily spiced sauces. Do people really want lamb
chops with a tarragon marinade and pineapple pecan relish? Even a
basic hamburger is loaded up with double Cheddar cheese, grilled
Vidalia onions and horseradish mustard _ a big, bright, scary
construction that looks as if it could take your jaw out of joint.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Flay is recycling already. Grilled onion marmalade is
almost identical to a recipe in his first book. The technique
differs slightly _ the onions are, of course, grilled in the new
book _ but the essential ingredients remain the same: red onions,
red wine vinegar, creme de cassis, grenadine and red wine. He does
the same sort of repetition with two tuna and mango dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Flay is a talented chef with two highly successful restaurants.
And he is young, just 34. His cooking should be evolving, and his
legions of fans _ of his cooking shows, ``Hot Off the Grill'' and
``Grillin' and Chillin,''' both on the Food Network, and his
restaurants _ should benefit from observing it happen through his
books. But nothing about this new book signals growth in his
cooking, just growth in his celebrity. &QL;

A WONDERFUL ROOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MELISSA CLARK    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On most farms and suburban lawns, burdock is the
enemy, a tenacious, burr-covered weed. But that's only what burdock
reveals of itself above ground. Below, as good cooks are coming to
realize, is a wonderful root.
</P>
<P>
   It has a crunchy, firm texture, which can stand up to being
lightly sauteed, steamed or pickled. When slowly braised, simmered
or boiled, the root shows its mellow side and becomes meltingly
tender. Cooked in broth or water, burdock tastes delicately of
artichokes, mushrooms and potatoes, reminiscent of salsify. The
high heat of roasting or grilling concentrates its flavor and
brings out a nutty sweetness like a parsnip. (Chefs debate whether
it's better to cook burdock peeled or unpeeled, but since the peel
contains much of the flavor, most burdock lovers just give the root
a good, long scrub.)
</P>
<P>
   Alex Paffenroth, the owner of Paffenroth Gardens, a farm in
Warwick, N.Y., says that for years he ignored the burdock growing
wild on his onion farm, until he started selling onions at farmers'
markets. Then he began to look for more interesting crops to offer,
and a friend suggested burdock, which he noticed on sale in
Chinatown. Paffenroth planted a garden variety developed in Japan,
because it has a straight, carrotlike taproot, which is easier to
harvest than the wild variety. Now, he sells organic burdock for $4
a pound at the Greenmarket in Union Square. And he keeps a sign
next to the bin explaining what it is and how to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Berley, the chef of Angelica's Kitchen, needs no lesson.
``I'm crazy about burdock,'' he said. ``It's got this amazing,
loamy smell and really tastes like you're eating something from the
soil.'' Angelica's goes through 50 pounds of burdock a week.
</P>
<P>
   Even if chefs don't always mention it on their menus, some use
it as a crunchy garnish or to sweeten and enhance a sauce. Michel
Nishan, the chef at Heartbeat, takes advantage of the root's
sticklike shape and stacks it like Lincoln logs into a little
house, which he fills with a root vegetable slaw. At Tropica,
Franck Deletrain gives humble burdock lavish treatment, serving it
with fluke sashimi and an osetra vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people don't know what it is, it can spark a conversation,
and they'll learn something new,'' said Rocco DiSpirito, the chef
of Union Pacific. ``I like when an ingredient can do that.''
DiSpirito uses pickled burdock in an appetizer of head cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Gesualdi, the chef at the Tonic, solves the unfamiliarity
problem by dicing the root and frying it into luscious little
fritters. Most diners eat it without question as a tempting party
hors d'oeuvres.
</P>
<P>
   But some chefs revel in burdock's strangeness. Normand Laprise
of Cena discovered burdock when he was traveling in Japan, where it
is called ``gobo.'' It makes an appearance at most Japanese meals,
either dyed bright orange and pickled or slivered and simmered in
stews and soups. At Cena, Laprise uses it all season long, from
January to July. After that, local burdock becomes slightly bitter.
</P>
<P>
   He's currently serving burdock pureed into a sweet soup and
roasted, with sauteed morels, a poached egg and caviar. ``I think
maybe it's because winter is so long in Quebec, but I love to use
different local root vegetables, and burdock grows all over
Canada,'' said Laprise, who is from Montreal. ``It must like the
cold.''
</P>
<P>
   As a plant that originated in Siberia, burdock should. Now, it
flourishes in cool climates all over the world. It probably made
its way to the Americas stubbornly stuck to the fur of livestock.
But even those sticky, prickly burrs have something to redeem them.
Apparently, they were the inspiration for Velcro. And everyone
knows what that is.

STRAWBERRY FOOL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MARK BITTMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's fun to re-introduce a classic, once commonplace dish that
has all but vanished from the repertory of most home cooks. It's
even better when you can make it a little bit better.
</P>
<P>
   The dish is the fool, a sublimely easy spring and summer fruit
dessert that is little more than fruit and stiffly whipped cream,
sweetened with sugar. The fool can be made with almost any fruit _
even stone fruits like mangoes or peaches _ but is best with
berries, especially strawberries.
</P>
<P>
   Fools can be stiffened with gelatin or enriched with eggs, but
my recent experiments show both additions to be wasted effort. The
eggs add an unnecessary degree of luxury, and the gelatin makes the
fool too much like the Jell-O salads I remember from the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Yet playing around with the recipe led me to what I consider an
improvement. I used to cut up the berries, sugar them, then crush
them with a potato masher before folding in the cream. This time, I
pureed half the berries and left the other half in quarter-inch
thick chunks. I was pleased with the results, in which pink whipped
cream enrobed slightly chewy berries.
</P>
<P>
   If you have perfectly ripe, sweet berries, you may reduce the
sugar called for by half. On the other hand, some berries are so
tart that you will need more. I add a bit of vanilla extract to the
cream for flavor, but you can consider this optional, or substitute
any flavored liqueur. Most people will advise you to whip cream
with perfectly cold implements, and this is worthwhile if you are
working by hand. But an electric mixer makes such fast work of the
job that the danger is in overwhipping. Stop beating as soon as the
cream holds peaks that do not droop.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, a fool should be eaten right away, before the juice
from the berries thins the cream. But the method here allows you to
prepare the fool an hour or two in advance without a loss in
quality; just cover it in the refrigerator until you're ready to
eat it.
</P>
<P>
   One more thing: The same ingredients can be combined nearly as
swiftly to produce the simplest possible fruit gratin, a gently
warmed, lightly caramelized version of a fool that is no more
delicious but slightly more impressive.
</P>
<P>
   STRAWBERRY FOOL  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 pint strawberries
</P>
<P>
   { cup sugar, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon vanilla extract, optional.
</P>
<P>
   1. Hull strawberries, then wash them and chop into \-inch thick
pieces. Toss with half the sugar and wait 10 minutes, stirring
occasionally, until they give up their juices.
</P>
<P>
   2. Place half the strawberries and all the juice in a blender
and puree. Pour puree back in bowl with chopped strawberries.
</P>
<P>
   3. Whip the cream with remaining sugar and vanilla until cream
is stiff and holds peaks easily. Fold berries and cream together
and serve immediately, or refrigerate for up to two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Variation: To make a gratin, preheat broiler, setting rack close
to heat source. Hull and slice berries, and toss them in a gratin
dish with half the sugar. Beat cream with half the remaining sugar
and the vanilla, just until it holds soft peaks. Top berries with
cream and sprinkle with remaining sugar. Broil carefully, rotating
dish so that cream browns all over. Remove and serve.

   ANTHRAX-ISLAND (Vozrozhdeniye Island, Uzbekistan) _ In the
spring of 1988, Soviet germ scientists secretly transferred
hundreds of tons of anthrax bacteria _ enough to destroy the world
many times over _ almost a thousand miles to this remote island in
the heart of the inland Aral Sea, according to American and Central
Asian officials. Here Russian soldiers dug huge pits and poured the
sludge into the ground, burying the germs and, Moscow hoped, a
grave political threat. Today, Vozrozhdeniye Island _ or
Renaissance Island, as it translates from the Russian _ is the
world's largest anthrax burial ground. American military scientists
and intelligence experts who have secretly been traveling here for
the past four years to survey the island and take samples of the
buried bacteria have discovered that some of the anthrax spores are
still alive _ and potentially deadly. By Judy Miller.

MAMET, KNOWN FOR RAW, POWERFUL PLAYS, DIRECTS A GENTEEL MOVIE ABOUT
HEROISM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Winslow Boy'' is a first for writer-director David Mamet,
best known for his writing for the theater, including the plays
``Glengarry Glen Ross,'' ``Oleanna,'' ``American Buffalo'' and
``Sexual Perversity in Chicago'' (which became the movie ``About
Last Night''). It's one of several firsts, actually.
</P>
<P>
   For one, it's the first piece Mamet has directed that he didn't
write, having come from the 1946 Terence Rattigan play about a
British family involved in a legal battle to prove their young
son's innocence after he's thrown out of military school.
</P>
<P>
   This is also the first Mamet film that qualifies for a G rating.
Unlike such characters as the foul-mouthed real estate salesmen in
``Glengarry Glen Ross'' _ which brought Mamet the Pulitzer Prize in
1984, as well as his generally accepted title as America's leading
playwright _ the genteel characters in ``Winslow'' lack the profane
punch common to his plays and other movies.
</P>
<P>
   Just as importantly, though, ``The Winslow Boy'' is Mamet's
first unabashed look at heroism.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of `Winslow Boy,' their struggle has cost them, it
would seem, everything,'' he says. ``They gave up their health,
their wealth, their prospects, their emotional stability. And at
the end this question is, `Is it worth it?' And that, to me, is the
question of the movie, because it's an open question.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as Mamet's own writing does, ``Winslow Boy'' delves into
the differences between what's right and what's just. It also has
the kind of dramatic surprise you'd expect in a Mamet work, even
though the kind of Old Testament evil that hovers over Mamet
material such as ``The Verdict'' and ``The Untouchables'' isn't to
be found here.
</P>
<P>
   Mamet's interest in ``Winslow Boy'' is in line with his own
Chicago background. His works portray a working-class interest in
digging straight to the heart of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about Chicago,'' he says, ``is people say
writing is not an ethereal, ivory tower profession. It's just the
profession of somebody who can write. It's that strong tradition of
playwrights and newspaper writers becoming novelists. Chicago is
the spiritual home of Theodore Dreiser and Richard Wright and
Sherwood Anderson. People who looked around and said, `What's going
on in the world?' The tradition of the working man and the working
woman as individual thinkers is very much a Midwest tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just look at Chicago theater,'' he offers. ``There was Second
City, which I kinda came out of, because I used to work (there) as
a busboy when I was 13, 14 years old. I saw Robert Klein there, and
Peter Boyle, David Steinberg, and the great Fred Willard. And
before them, there was the Compass Players, with Mike Nichols and
Elaine May. Those guys were cultural heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago theater that Mamet helped create in the 1970s was
like the punk movement, where anger and a hunger to shake things up
were motivating factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``For my generation,'' Mamet muses, ``there was a spontaneous
groundswell of people who just came out of the streets _ people in
their 20s _ who just started putting on plays. We didn't know any
better, and we were too young to be careerist. That was the Chicago
theater of the time. By accident, I got a job teaching theater at
this college in Vermont. And a couple of guys I'd been working with
_ they were 21 and I was 22 _ came back to Chicago with me and we
started a theater. One of them was William H. Macy.''
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate the depth of talent in Chicago in those days,
Mamet cites the first reading of his play ``American Buffalo.'' It
was performed by, among others, Joey Mantegna and Dennis Franz,
then members of the Organic Theater, along with Mesach Taylor, John
Heard and the late J.T. Walsh.
</P>
<P>
   It was during that period that Mamet turned to directing his own
work, out of the simplest motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to New York,'' he remembers, ``and was hawking my plays
around and other people were directing my plays and I would nod and
say, maybe they know better than I do. Then after a while, I
thought, even if they do know better than I do, I'd rather do it
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   That he has done. Fluidly moving between stage and screen, he
broke into the movie business with the reworking of the script for
``The Postman Always Rings Twice'' in 1981 and then directed his
own script for the film ``House of Games'' in 1987. Since then, he
has directed his own scripts for the movies ``Things Change,
Homicide'' and ``Oleanna.'' And last year, he had an art-house hit
with the film ``The Spanish Prisoner.''

FOOD QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

<P>
   &UR; Chinese Flatbread &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Many years ago at a Mongolian barbecue restaurant in New
Jersey, I was served little pan-fried breads, relatively flat and
no bigger than an index card. They were plain but for the sesame
seeds on top. The restaurant has since closed, and I have searched
high and low for a recipe. Can you help? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Those flaky breads are called shao bing, a term that loosely
translates as ``roasted cakes.'' They are an ancient staple:
traditionally, they were slapped against the searing sides of a
clay oven, where they adhered and baked. Now, they are pan-fried or
baked in a conventional oven.
</P>
<P>
   Shao bing can be split open, like small pita breads, and stuffed
with all manner of stir-fries to make sandwiches. The Chinese also
eat them for breakfast with bowls of warm soy milk. They are always
best eaten hot.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cream of Tartar &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is cream of tartar, and how do you use it in baking? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Cream of tartar, or potassium acid tartrate, is a powder
either extracted from fresh grapes or derived from deposits that
accumulate on the insides of wine barrels.
</P>
<P>
   Most commonly, it is the acid component in baking powder that
makes cakes and cookies and quick breads rise. About \ teaspoon
baking soda plus { teaspoon cream of tartar yields the equivalent
of 1 teaspoon baking powder.
</P>
<P>
   Cream of tartar may also be added to fondant, pulled sugar and
frosting in order to produce a creamier consistency.
</P>
<P>
   Adding about [ teaspoon cream of tartar for each egg white
before beating will decrease alkalinity and make the final beaten
whites much more stable.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A Burned Pot: Safe to Use? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I've burned a nice stainless-steel pot. It might have been
coated with something because it had a slightly chemical smell when
it burned. Is it still safe to cook with, or should I get rid of
it?
</P>
<P>
   A. If the pot is simply stainless steel, it should be perfectly
fine. Stainless steel does tend to discolor and may develop a
splotchy rainbow effect when exposed to high heat.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the pot had a nonstick coating, you would have to
maintain a temperature of 550 degrees or higher for at least three
hours in order for the coating to melt and burn. (After all that,
the pot could not be used again.)
</P>
<P>
   The odor you smelled could simply have been the smell of
burning. Or if the pot has plastic handles, it's possible that the
odor might have been the smell of the plastic as it softened in the
heat.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Substituting Potato Starch &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. When I make a flourless chocolate cake at Passover, could I
substitute potato starch for cornstarch and still get the same
results?
</P>
<P>
   A. You can, but you should use one and a half times as much
potato starch as cornstarch.

MERCHANT WHO WASN'T AFRAID OF THE UNKNOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ One Saturday evening in 1947, a battered jalopy fueled
with black market gasoline jounced out of Paris in the direction of
the Loire Valley. At the wheel was Lucien Legrand, 31, and he was
off to buy some wine, which was not easy to find in Paris just
after the war.
</P>
<P>
   He needed a source of supply for his family's celebrated
epicerie, or luxury grocery store, at 1 rue de la Banque on the
Right Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew nothing about wine,'' he recalled many years later,
adding that he had been armed only with the name of a winemaker in
the town of Amboise. By Sunday night he was back in the city with a
barrel of dry white sauvignon d'Amboise, which he would bottle
himself. He had found his wine and his life's passion.
</P>
<P>
   Legrand Filles &AMP; Fils, Legrand's grocery with a large stock of
wine, is in the financial district, near the Bibliotheque National
and Comedie Francaise. As such, it has counted bankers,
stockbrokers and actors among its clientele.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Legrand died, on Feb. 15 at 83, he had become one of
France's most admired wine merchants.
</P>
<P>
   I first met Legrand some 20 years ago through a friend who had
invited me to visit the labyrinthine cellars under the Legrand
shop. They were said to have once been the catacombs of a church a
few blocks away. It was not a story Legrand was about to deny.
</P>
<P>
   What distinguished those cellars, and their proprietor, was an
absence of wines with famous names. Indeed, throughout his life,
Legrand was scornful of the hype that attended many well-known
wines. He was a fierce advocate of the simple, unembellished wines
from little-known vineyards all over France _ and of the artisans
who made them.
</P>
<P>
   He was never much of a fan of Bordeaux. ``I recognize the
quality of the great Bordeaux wines,'' he said, ``but for my taste,
they are too intellectual, too severe. They are not joyous, sensual
wines; they don't make you feel like celebrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Legrand was the enemy of all pretension. Fiona Beeston, a writer
who sold wine for him for five years, recalled her early days with
him. While she had been trained in the ``spit it all out'' school
of wine tasting, Legrand believed that ``you learned by drinking,
not tasting.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days when French businesses shut down for lunch, members
of the Legrand staff gathered at midday for a serious meal. In her
book ``Mes Hommes du Vin'' (Plon, 1989), Ms. Beeston described her
first Legrand lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he asked me what I thought of the wine, an unknown little
Marcillac, I ran down to the sales floor to get my special tasting
glass, hoping my palate was still clean,'' she wrote. ``When I
returned to the table, everyone was tucking into an enormous bowl
of tripe, the smell of which filled the room.
</P>
<P>
   When I said I couldn't taste like that, he broke out laughing
and said, `My God, it's not going to be easy to teach this
Englishwoman.' He gave me my wine in an old mustard jar and told me
to drink it with the food.''
</P>
<P>
   A slight man with a natty mustache, Legrand enjoyed talking
about wine as much as he did selling it. On my first visit, he
handed me a glass and asked my opinion. As I searched for words, he
delivered his own brief but impressive opinion, free of technical
jargon and the flowery inanities beloved of wine writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My passion is the little wines,'' he once said. ``Anyone can
buy a first growth; all you have to have is enough money. But to
discover a good everyday wine, ah, that's something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the early 1950s, he was an ardent supporter of
Beaujolais, then rarely drunk outside its region. He frowned on
chaptalization, the practice of adding sugar to Beaujolais to boost
its alcoholic content, and he didn't like sugar added to Champagne
to make it sweeter. He found and supported producers who would make
these wines for him in the unadorned styles he preferred.
</P>
<P>
   Legrand was proud to be a caviste, or wine merchant, but he
thought of himself principally as an epicier, a grocer. ``Before
the war, the epiciers were a strong, respected group in Paris,'' he
said, proud of the symbol of their trade, an impeccably white
apron.
</P>
<P>
   Legrand Filles &AMP; Fils, with its 1900s facade and elegant
interior, is still at 1 rue de la Banque, run by one of Lucien's
daughters, Francine. A son, Yves, runs a wine shop in
Issy-les-Moulineaux, outside Paris. Much of the Legrand store is
still occupied by a line of ancient coffee roasters that attracted
a loyal clientele before Legrand was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my parents' time, coffee was far more important than
wine,'' he once said. On a recent visit, his belief in little-known
producers could still be felt. Among the wines featured were a
Champagne from J.M. Tarlent and a fleurie from Domaine du Vissoux,
both difficult to find in France much less in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The windows of the back of the store face the Galerie Vivienne,
one of the hidden passageways filled with small shops that are a
feature of midtown Paris. In those windows are a vast selection of
corkscrews, glassware and other wine artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when Lucien liked to pause in the afternoon
for tea,'' Ms. Beeston recalled. ``There were some well-known
actresses who would slip in through the Galerie Vivienne to join
him. He loved it, even if his wife did not.''
</P>
<P>
   A true connoisseur, Legrand knew that wine is one of the good
things in life. But not the only thing.

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Wireless phones seem to be everywhere these days.
Too bad they don't come with instructions on when to use them.
</P>
<P>
   Who better to lay some of the ground rules for mobile-phone
etiquette than Peggy Post, great-granddaughter-in-law to Emily
Post, author of ``Emily Post's Etiquette.''
</P>
<P>
   Post wrote the 75th anniversary edition (it's the 16th) of the
etiquette guide, and is a contributing editor at Good Housekeeping
and Parents magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wireless phones have become an accepted part of the way we
live today,'' Post said through a traditional telephone line.
Because the wireless phones can be used from virtually anywhere,
their users need to remember common-sense courtesy, she cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   The number of wireless-phone users in the United States has
grown from 1.6 million in 1988 to more than 69 million today,
according to Cellular One, an equipment and service provider, and
more than half of all Americans are expected to have wireless
phones by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent survey commissioned by Cellular One, New Yorkers
said wireless phones are most appropriate for safety, emergencies
and scheduling situations. (In fact, 98,000 people place 911 calls
each day from mobile phones.) However, a majority of those surveyed
didn't approve of using wireless phones during social gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   Only 2 percent of New Yorkers polled said they approved of
holding a phone conversation at the table, although 95 percent said
taking a call from a baby sitter is acceptable, and 75 percent had
no problem with work-related calls.
</P>
<P>
   Post stressed that the cell phone should never be placed on the
table during a meal.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Trimble, who with her husband, Geoff, owns La Serre
restaurant in Albany, sees that rule broken regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of weeks ago, there was a party of four _ two couples
_ and one of the women was on the phone four times to her child,''
Trimble said. ``Her phone rang four times in less than an hour and
a half, and each call lasted five to six minutes. The wait staff
didn't know when to serve their food. If I had been the other
couple, I would have walked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Post recently joined forces with Cellular One to raise
wireless-etiquette awareness.
</P>
<P>
   Results from a nationwide survey indicated that many wireless
users need to improve their phone etiquette and put people ahead of
phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted in eight states and four metropolitan
areas by Fleishman-Hillard Research in St. Louis. For the New York
state portion, 2,628 people responded from 33 upstate counties, in
Cellular One service areas. Of the New Yorkers surveyed, 56 percent
said they would rather visit the dentist than sit next to someone
talking on a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting next to someone on a train in the New York City
area who was discussing very intimate details,'' Post said. ``I
found that to be very inappropriate. One should never discuss
confidential material that's social or work-related on a wireless
phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Cell phones are technologically advanced so callers no longer
need to shout to be heard, Post said. But she still recommended
calling from a quiet or private place.
</P>
<P>
   Not inconveniencing others is the key, Post said. Whether you're
driving or standing in a checkout line, you should be paying
attention and not holding up anyone else.

<P>
   Anyone who has visited Les Crayeres, the Michelin three-star
restaurant and hotel in Reims, France, has seen the ornate
buildings of the house of Pommery, just across the street. Louise
Pommery, one of the famous Champagne widows, put the company on the
map in the mid-19th century. Her daughter built Les Crayeres as her
home. Some years ago, the house went through a rough period, and
the wine was not up to the mark. No longer: this is a top-quality
Champagne, full flavored with a long, dry finish. The price is more
than reasonable.  &QL;

TRANSSEXUAL FILES SUIT OVER DENIAL OF POLICE JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY DELGADO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A male-to-female transsexual who was
disqualified from entering the San Francisco police academy after
failing a psychological test is suing the city, alleging gender
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Cristiana Rivas, 39, filed a lawsuit in San Francisco Superior
Court last month and is seeking damages for lost wages, humiliation
and embarrassment. Rivas said that one of the city's psychologists
referred to her as a cross-dresser while another questioned why she
didn't pursue a career in cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no doubt in my mind that I passed all the exams,''
said Rivas, a former employee with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms. ``I don't have any psychological problems.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Christopher Rivas underwent a sex change operation and
also passed the San Francisco Police Department's written, oral,
lie-detector and physical tests, along with a thorough background
check.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, she quit her job with the federal agency to
prepare for enrollment in the police academy at the end of the
month. But then she was told she had failed the psychological
portion of her application and was, therefore, disqualified from
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't told why she had failed.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, Rivas filed a $3 million claim with Department of
Human Resources' Equal Employment Opportunity Division. It was
turned down in January. Rivas has appealed that decision to the
Civil Service Commission.
</P>
<P>
   City officials deny any kind of gender discrimination claims and
say Rivas was screened out for other psychological reasons that
they cannot disclose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her gender was not the basis on which she was not accepted,''
said Lori Giorgi, the chief attorney for public protection in the
City Attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   Giorgi said the psychological test found that Rivas was not
suitable.
</P>
<P>
   Rivas believes the department, or at least its psychiatrists,
are not comfortable dealing with transgender applicants because
they don't understand the issues. For example, Rivas said, she was
referred to as a cross-dresser during her first evaluation with the
city-affiliated psychiatrist, who then asked her to explain the
difference between cross-dressing and transsexualism.
</P>
<P>
   When Rivas was evaluated by an independent psychologist
following her appeal of her disqualification, she said, the
psychologist asked her whether she had patronized a bar known for
transsexual prostitution and whether she had considered working in
the cosmetics field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat there and just told him, `I'm a professional woman with
a professional degree, and I want a professional career,''' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Giorgi said investigators who handled Rivas' claim with the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had looked into that
allegation and found it to be untrue.
</P>
<P>
   The psychologists ``emphatically deny that those statements were
made,'' Giorgi said. ``We don't ask about someone's gender
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Giorgi said the city would fight the lawsuit. She said Rivas and
any applicant had the right to take the exam again if they didn't
pass.

I KNOW HOW I SCREAMED THIS SUMMER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ I try to remember how to bend my knees and lift
my feet off the ground. It's either a hot flash or a demon theme
park thrill ride.
</P>
<P>
   I am on the grounds of Universal Studio's new Islands of
Adventure, next to a 30-acre dining and entertainment complex
called City Walk, next to three planned plush hotels.
</P>
<P>
   There must have been moments spent laughing and having a good
time, but my memory is flooded with dark flashes of me screaming,
screaming until my throat hurts, holding on so tight I bruised my
right leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not just theme park rides,'' says Steven Spielberg,
Universal's creative consultant. ``These are entertainment
achievements beyond anything I've ever seen anywhere else in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   At Islands of Adventure, which opened Friday just 15 miles down
the road from Disney World, the assault on your senses is at once
exhilarating and frightening.
</P>
<P>
   Spread across approximately 110 acres, the park features five
themed islands: Seuss Landing, Marvel Super Hero Island, Toon
Lagoon, the Lost Continent and Jurassic Park. Next door, visitors
can partake of CityWalk, an entertainment complex featuring themed
restaurants _ including one from celebrity chef Emeril Lagasse _ as
well as nightclubs, shops and a 20-screen, 5,000-seat movie
megaplex.
</P>
<P>
   When added to the existing 9-year-old theme park _ Universal
Studios Florida _ they make up Universal Studios Escape, a three-
or four-day vacation destination where families can eat, sleep and
play without ever leaving the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Watch out, Mickey Mouse.
</P>
<P>
   THE PORT OF ENTRY AND BEYOND: ``When I was a kid, I couldn't
wait to get to the Magic Kingdom,'' the bus driver is telling me
after a long day at the park. ``I used to live to make the 30-hour
drive from New York here. But after seeing this, I don't even think
about Mickey.''
</P>
<P>
   If it didn't measure up before, Islands of Adventure easily
positions Universal Studios to do battle with the folks who brought
us Mickey Mouse and the Magic Kingdom more than 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the compactness of Universal's newest theme park
allows visitors to easily walk from one attraction to the next. At
Disney World, guests must take a monorail, bus or car to get from
one event to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Although I didn't sample every attraction _ mostly for lack of
guts _ the islands were close enough that I was able to walk the
entire distance in just a few hours. To take in more than the
sights, to indulge every taste bud, would require at least a couple
of days, especially with kids in tow.
</P>
<P>
   For another, guests are less likely to just stand in line at
Universal. Visitors learn the detailed ``back stories'' of the
major attractions through video and audio.
</P>
<P>
   I began at the beginning, the Port of Entry, and headed to Seuss
Landing, a whimsical and colorful place where the characters of
Theodor ``Dr. Seuss'' Geisel spring to life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't wait to build this,'' said Lisa Girolami, Seuss
Landing's executive producer. ``When you're reading the books, the
characters literally jump off the page.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual to see the Cat in the Hat and Thing One and
Thing Two skipping around the park. If that isn't enough, go into
the house and take a seat on the couch for the Cat in the Hat ride.
</P>
<P>
   The Cat in the Hat invites Thing One and Thing Two inside and,
well, you know the story.
</P>
<P>
   If you liked the story at all, you'll love this up-close view
from the couch. The constant spinning put a pinch in my stomach,
but I'd endure anything to be near these characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing this world to life, we needed to tell the story,
including how bad greed and prejudice are, and the importance of
reading,'' said Girolami. ``We had to roll all of those things into
this land.''
</P>
<P>
   From there, I headed to the Lost Continent, home of the Dueling
Dragons double coaster, Poseidon's Fury and The Eighth Voyage of
Sinbad, a live-action show.
</P>
<P>
   I hated The Eighth Voyage of Sinbad. The acting is atrocious,
the lines worse, and they had the nerve to typecast an
African-American woman as the evil one. Did I mention I hated it?
</P>
<P>
   For Poseidon's Fury, visitors pass through a 42-foot-long water
vortex containing 17,500 gallons of swirling water into a kind of
theater-in-the-round for a battle between Poseidon (water) and his
archenemy Zeus (fire).
</P>
<P>
   As for the roller coaster _ I didn't have the nerve to do battle
with a dragon.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings me to the Incredible Hulk roller coaster on Marvel
Super Hero Island. Evil. Evil. Evil. There was no way I was going
to get in this steel contraption.
</P>
<P>
   According to park officials, Hulk's propulsion G-force is the
same as that experienced by an F-16 pilot on takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   I did, however, partake of the amazing adventures of Spider-Man,
but only because my tour guide said it was a piece of cake.
</P>
<P>
   She lied. I screamed so long and loud my throat hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Billed as the first to combine rapidly moving vehicles with
vivid sets, filmed action and pyrotechnic special effects, the ride
sweeps you into a raging battle between Spider-Man and a cast of
super-villains. The conflicts rage around, above and under you and
burst through movie screens straight at you.
</P>
<P>
   Doctor Octopus ultimately takes aim at riders with his Doomsday
Anti-gravity gun, which zaps you 400 feet into the air before
plunging you down the same 400 feet toward the dark street.
</P>
<P>
   You know it's not really happening, but it feels like it is. You
pray for your life.

   EDIBLE WONDERS: For the stomach, Islands of Adventure offers
everything from gourmet to green _ as in green eggs and ham ($5.29
with fries) at the Green Eggs and Ham Cafe in Seuss Landing. (The
eggs are colored with herbs, by the way.) Jurassic Park serves
half-pound dino burgers, and Toon Lagoon has such fare as Dagwood
sandwiches.
</P>
<P>
   For finer dining, Islands of Adventure offers Mythos on the Lost
Continent and the Confisco Grille at the Port of Entry. Mythos was
my favorite. Nestled in a massive volcanic rock formation, it is
perfect for a romantic evening.
</P>
<P>
   Guests sit on chairs that weigh 75 pounds each and cost more
than $500, but the prices were a little more reasonable. I had a
bowl of Maine lobster corn bisque ($4), pan-roasted fish provencale
with roasted garlic mashed potatoes ($13.50), and warm chocolate
banana gooey cake with peanut butter ice cream ($5.25) _ which I
would have delivered to me once a week if I could afford it.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's CityWalk, with its half-dozen shops, clubs and
restaurants, ranging from Emeril's _ operated by celebrity chef
Emeril Lagasse _ to Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville, and from the
Hard Rock Cafe to the Motown Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   I loved Pat O'Brien's Orlando and the Latin Quarter _ with one
exception: half-naked women never did anything for me.
</P>
<P>
   LAY MY WEARY BODY DOWN: Once the day is over and your legs feel
like tons of steel, there's no better place to be than the
Portofino Bay Hotel. If you can afford it.
</P>
<P>
   The 750-room Portofino Bay, Universal's version of Portofino,
Italy, is scheduled to open Sept. 1. Guests will get complimentary
white robes, complimentary breakfast in the morning and
complimentary hors d'oeuvres in the evening. They will sleep on
big, high beds covered in white Egyptian cotton linens, so fluffy
they look like pillows of clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Portofino Bay is the first of five hotels planned at the theme
park. The Hard Rock Hotel will open in 2000, and the Royal Pacific
Resort in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   All the hotels will be connected to each other and to the theme
parks by a chain of scenic waterways. In addition to more
traditional forms of transportation, guests will be able to take
water taxis from their hotels to Universal destinations and back.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've visited the Islands of Adventure, you may think you
don't want to come back. But you will. Bone-tired,
sensory-overloaded, you'll have to come back.
</P>
<P>
   Those Marvel Super Heroes did me in. Oh, did I tell you about
the Jurassic Park River Ride? Dropped me 85 feet. I escaped
Tyrannosaurus Rex, but I think I hurt my leg.
</P>
<P>
   I need some sleep.
</P>

   A KID RATES THE PARK
</P>
<P>
   Cary Glines, 16, a junior at Palmetto High School in Miami,
rated Islands of Adventure for The Miami Herald:
</P>
<P>
   In an overall rating of this park from 1-10, I'd give it a 10.
</P>
<P>
   Incredible Hulk roller coaster: 10. It shoots up really fast,
and stays fast. And it's long.
</P>
<P>
   Dueling Dragons double roller coaster: 10. It's cool how you
come close together. It's fast the whole time.
</P>
<P>
   Doctor Doom's Freefall: Lame. You don't fall fast enough. (The
ride was running at half-speed during our preview visit.)
</P>
<P>
   Spider-Man ride: 9.5 ``It's not just a sit-down 3-D thing.''
(Said Annette Whitman, 18, of Tampa: ``It's the neatest thing I've
ever done.'')
</P>
<P>
   Jurassic Park River Adventure: 8. Cool, but not long enough.
(Pete McDaniel, 7, of Richmond, Va., loved it so much he wanted to
go again; brother David, 4, was less enthusiastic.)
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   A MOM RATES THE PARK
</P>
<P>
   Intrepid Star-Telegram reporter Gracie Bonds Staples, mother of
two, filed this report:
</P>
<P>
   I also give the park a 10, but I was bothered by much of the
violence and didn't have the guts to get on many of the rides.
</P>
<P>
   Incredible Hulk roller coaster: Evil.
</P>
<P>
   Dueling Dragons double roller coaster: Ditto.
</P>
<P>
   Doctor Doom's Freefall: Et cetera.
</P>
<P>
   Spider-Man ride: Even if it is make-believe 3-D action, who
wants to fall 400 feet? Believe me, this doesn't feel like play.
</P>
<P>
   Jurassic Park River Ride: Same here. If you ask me, there's not
much difference between dropping 85 feet and 400 feet.

 &HT;    GROUPS WANT CANDIDATES TO OPPOSE PRESIDENTIAL PAY HIKE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An alliance of conservatives and liberals asked
presidential contenders Tuesday to oppose a move doubling the
salary of the job they are seeking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president suffers no real privations,'' said a letter that
asked the candidates how they stand on a congressional effort to
increase the pay to $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you know,'' it continued, ``the President currently enjoys
a salary of $200,000 per year, with perquisites, a $50,000 expense
allowance, living expense benefits that befit a king, plus a near
certain prospect, if desired, of becoming a multimillionaire upon
leaving office.''
</P>
<P>
   Signers of the letter included liberals such as consumer
activist Ralph Nader and the environmentalist Green Party, as well
as conservative leader Paul Weyrich of the Free Congress
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   A House subcommittee last month, with little public notice,
added a provision to a spending bill to increase the salary of the
next president when he or she takes office in 2001. Some public
interest groups and former presidential aides have advocated the
pay hike, which would be the first in 30 years for the chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   However, opponents charge that the salary boost for the
president is a disguised effort to increase pay for many senior
officials. As long as the president's salary is held to its current
level, it ``acts as a cap on the salaries of Members of Congress
and federal judges,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-pay raise coalition sent their letter to 11 of the top
presidential contenders, with the exception of former Red Cross
chief Elizabeth Dole, who has already denounced the pay increase.
</P>
<P>
   Dole, a Republican hopeful, sent a letter last week to House
Speaker Dennis Hastert calling the proposal ``ill-advised.'' The
``perks'' of the presidency such as a Camp David weekend retreat, a
bowling alley, a putting green, and movie theaters add up to
millions of dollars in value, Dole wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone calls to the other candidates brought no immediate
responses on the pay hike issue.

 &HT;    Four perfect days in Cajun country
 &HT;    EDs: Resending for those who need it.
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since Louisiana is celebrating its French heritage with
Francofete, this is a great year to join the party with a trip to
Cajun country.
</P>
<P>
   Cajun country is called Acadiana on maps because the Cajuns
originally came from Acadia, now Nova Scotia. It is a large, mostly
rural region _ some of it flat prairie, some of it coastal, and
some of it marsh and swamp. Getting around takes some time and
choosing itineraries can be difficult given how much there is to
see and, more importantly, eat.
</P>
<P>
   What follows are four agendas that could be experienced together
during a long weekend or separately. They are by no means a
complete guide, and they are highly subjective: The greatest
emphasis is put on where to eat, with music a close second. Someone
else might tell you where all the galleries, shops and museums are.
But for me, the essence of Cajun country is in the fresh crawfish
and oysters, the gumbo and the etouffee, the boudin and fresh game.
</P>
<P>
   These four itineraries fan out from Lafayette, but by all means
buy a map and tailor the trip to your plans . And keep in mind that
part of the fun is getting there: I never tire of driving back
roads in Cajun country, through sugar cane fields and past crawfish
ponds, by shotgun shacks and plantation homes, along bayous and
over swamps. Turn on the radio and find a station with a French
deejay and Cajun music playing. You might find out about a nearby
festival or a dance hall while you're listening.
</P>
<P>
   DAY ONE
</P>
<P>
   Fred's Lounge, Mamou
</P>
<P>
   Open for dancing and a live radio broadcast every Saturday
morning _ and only Saturday morning _ Fred's Lounge is the essence
of the Cajun joie de vivre. You wouldn't necessarily know that,
pulling into this flat scruffy prairie town surrounded by crawfish
ponds. But in this small bar off La. 13 (318-468-5411), farmers in
overalls have gathered for decades to drink beer, waltz and speak
in French to one another about their crops or their kids. A band
sets up in the middle of the room; the accordion player and singer
keeps himself going with Miller Lites, cigarettes and throat spray.
He sings French lyrics in a high voice as the accordion wheezes.
The bar's owner, Tante Sue Vasseur, keeps herself going with a pint
of Hot Damn _ cinnamon schnapps _ tucked into her jeans.
</P>
<P>
   Dancers on small swatches of floor waltz and two-step at their
own risk: A handwritten sign on the back wall reads, ''This is not
a dance hall. If you get hurt dancing we are not responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Jada Gentile drives 2 1/2 hours from Texas every Saturday to
dance at Fred's.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just love the Cajun people,'' she says between dances.
''They're so warm, and if you have any stress or anything, it just
goes. The Cajun people pull you in like family.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred's attracts a lot of camera-toting tourists, which worried
me, but what I quickly learned was that no amount of outside
traffic changes the place. The locals still come, and they display
an unerring curiosity and unjaded friendliness toward newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   J.D. Dupuis, one of Gentile's dance partners, speaks French with
me. He invites me to dinner the following week at his home in
Opelousas _ he and his wife are hosting some French tourists and he
thinks I might enjoy it. He even invites me to stay with his
family.
</P>
<P>
   I ask him why his wife is not with him at Fred's.
</P>
<P>
   ''She has a problem handling this,'' he says. ''It's a little on
the rough side for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Eunice
</P>
<P>
   After Fred's, drive south on La. 13 to Eunice, a larger town
whose street signs are in French and English, and head to Johnson's
Grocery at 700 E. Maple St. (318-457-9314) for an authentic Cajun
breakfast. Line up between aisles of motor oil and Moon Pies under
the ''Rue Boudin'' sign. At the back of the store, a man behind the
meat counter doles out links of boudin _ steamed Cajun sausage made
from rice and pork and ooh-wee hot spices. It costs about $1 a
link, and it tastes better with a cold beer, which you have to buy
at the gas station down the street. I know it's barely noon, but
trust me. Around here, this is highly traditional.
</P>
<P>
   After ''breakfast,'' visit the Acadian Cultural Center (250 W.
Park Ave.; 318-457-8490). One of several such centers in the state,
it tells the story of the Acadians who settled on the prairies of
southern Louisiana. The center offers more than a dozen educational
films, any of which the staff will play pretty much on request. We
watched one on the forced migration of Acadians to Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   The Acadians migrated to Louisiana from what is now Nova Scotia
in 1755. They were originally from France, and when they refused to
become British subjects, they were exiled, and many wound up in
Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   The center also has music, dancing and cooking demonstrations
and a historical exhibit with artifacts and information on
everything from accordions to crawfish nets.
</P>
<P>
   Palace Cafe, Opelousas
</P>
<P>
   From Eunice, take U.S. 190 East to Opelousas, where, if you are
hungry again, you can grab a bite at the Palace Cafe (318-942-2142)
right on the main street. The oldest restaurant in town, it has
classic diner food such as milkshakes, onion rings, and rural
goodies like liver and onions and fried chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Washington
</P>
<P>
   Next, head north on I-49 to Washington, a quaint, one-stoplight
town on a sleepy bayou, full of historic homes _ many of which are
open for tours. Call ahead from the tourist center (318-826-3627)
on Main Street to arrange one.
</P>
<P>
   The main attraction here, however, is the shopping at the Old
Washington Antique School Mall Flea Market (318-826-3580) not far
from Main. It has acres of antique furniture, jewelry, toys and
knickknacks, and the prices are quite fair. It is open every
Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Don't say I didn't warn you about the Country House Bed &AMP;
Breakfast. It feels more like Grandma's than a historic home. The
bed in our room had a plastic mattress cover that woke me every
time I rolled over, and the bathroom left a few things to be
desired.
</P>
<P>
   But what the place lacks in antiques and luxury it makes up for
in its hostess. An elegant woman with long, delicate fingers and a
low, husky voice, June Lowrey is immediately warm and inviting. And
over breakfast _ a delicious egg souffle _ she wove tales of being
a farmer's wife, and then, after her husband died, of living the
artist's life in the French Quarter in New Orleans. Her pencil
sketches are for sale and are good. Ask for a tour of her studio,
behind the main house in a 19th century cottage she had moved to
the property.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the two rooms inside the house, there is a private
cottage with twin beds that can be pushed together.
</P>
<P>
   The Steamboat Warehouse Restaurant is about the only place in
Washington to eat. It's a relic from the era when the town was the
largest steamboat port between New Orleans and St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Decked out in cypress beams and steamboat paraphernalia, the
restaurant has a few knockout specialities that make up for
otherwise so-so fare. The fried seafood dishes are among the best
offerings, and I had a perfectly sauteed soft-shell crab. And then
there were those Sidesaddle Angels _ an appetizer of humongous
shrimp, each stuffed with an oyster, wrapped in smoky, peppery
bacon and deep-fried. Served with a remoulade sauce, it was the
evening's undisputed champion.
</P>
<P>
   DAY TWO
</P>
<P>
   Bois des Chenes, Lafayette
</P>
<P>
   I really like this B&AMP;B, despite its location in Lafayette, a
city I don't feel like hanging around in when there are small towns
to explore. This 1820 Acadian plantation home (318-233-7816) is
simple and elegant, with period antiques, traditional and very
comfortable bedding and fluffy towels in the bathroom. There are
three suites in the carriage house, where we stayed, but our room
was so private we thought we had the place to ourselves. Two more
suites are in the main house, each with a sitting room.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast began with toast with sugared orange rinds and
continued with french toast with three kinds of syrup and crisp
bacon. The owners, Coerte and Marjorie Voorhies, speak French, and
Coerte is a geologist with a wealth of knowledge on the swamps of
south Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Swamp tour,
</P>
<P>
   Lake Martin-Cypress Island Swamp
</P>
<P>
   One of the best things about Bois des Chenes is that Coerte
Voorhies and his son, Kim, offer swamp tours, which are two hours
and cost $40 per person. They take outboard motorboats to either
the Atchafalaya Swamp and Lake Martin-Cypress Island Swamp. My
husband and I and an Ohio family went with Kim to Lake
Martin-Cypress Island Swamp, a 22,000-acre preserve about 20
minutes from Lafayette.
</P>
<P>
   I have seen a lot of swamps in several different vessels, but
this tour beat them all. Voorhies took the five of us to a swamp so
crammed with alligators, birds and other wildlife I wondered if
there was Viagra in the water.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of the eternally chatty Kim Voorhies: ''We've got
wildlife out the yin-yang here.''
</P>
<P>
   The birds fly here to nest each spring, so if you really want to

CARTOONIST BILL MAULDIN'S BOOK REMAINS A CLASSIC, 50 YEARS LATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ To a generation raised on Panama, the Persian
Gulf War and Kosovo as examples of the United States going to
battle, it may not mean much to hear comparisons of Bill Mauldin
with Ernie Pyle from the days of World War II. But for those who
were in the infantry, it means a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Mauldin is the cartoonist whose Willie and Joe drawings from the
Second World War captured the weariness and weirdness of the
American foot soldier better than anyone has, before or since. He
produced 228 pages of outstanding drawings and prose as he followed
the 45th Division through Italy and France, and his book, ``Up
Front: Fiftieth Anniversary Edition,'' (W.W. Norton, 228 pages,
$19.95) remains a classic, half a century later.
</P>
<P>
   In a contemporary review of ``Up Front,'' which was published by
Henry Holt in 1945, John P. Marquand said, ``There are very few
good books written about any war, and World War II is no exception.
In spite of the enormous number of titles, it would not require
more than the fingers of one hand to enumerate distinguished World
War II works on fighting men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most writers who have tackled this war would have succeeded
better had they left their ideologies and preconceived notions
behind them. ... War is simply war, and when you use wishful
thinking on it the result is an obvious distortion.''
</P>
<P>
   Marquand praised Ernie Pyle, saying the war correspondent ``has
achieved unique and perhaps lasting distinction simply by setting
down what he has seen, without permitting himself the luxury of
undue interpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   It is high praise, indeed, to say that Bill Mauldin's short
volume, ``Up Front,'' compares favorably with Ernie Pyle's `Brave
Men,' but any reader will see that they are the same piece of
goods, produced with the same understanding, clarity and sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Mauldin's cartoons are smile-to-yourself rather than
laugh-out-loud funny. There's one of a squad walking underneath a
balcony with a woman looking down. ``She must be very purty,'' says
Willie. ``Th' whole column is wheezin' at her.'' Another has a kid
lieutenant ranting against Joe about his sloppy combat outfit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Straighten those shoulders,'' the youngster says. ``How long
you been in the Army?''
</P>
<P>
   There's one of Willie and Joe on a hill captured from the
Germans, looking down at their old positions in Anzio and saying,
``My God! Here they wuz an' there we wuz.'' And there's the one of
an MP telling three combat vets looking at his ribbons, ``The
yellow one is fer national defense, th' red one wit' white stripes
is fer very good conduct, and th' real purty one wit' all th'
colors is fer bein' in this theater of operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauldin's understanding of infantryman was just as good in prose
as it was in cartoons. He writes, ``While a guy at home is sweating
over his income tax and Victory garden, a dogface somewhere is
getting great joy out of wiggling his little finger.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does it just to see it move and to prove that he is still
alive and able to move it. Life is stripped down to bare essentials
for him when he is living from minute to minute, wondering if each
is his last. Because he is fundamentally no different from his
countryman at home, he would probably be sweating just as hard over
his income tax and Victory garden if he were home.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauldin hits the mark again and again while talking about such
things as mud, rear-echelon goldbricks, sleeping in rain-swollen
foxholes and the overblown difference between Germans and Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   There's a cartoon of one officer saying to another, ``Beautiful
view. Is there one for the enlisted men?'' And one of a soldier
saying as he sits hip-deep in a foxhole during a bombardment in the
rain, ``Wisht I could stand up an' git some sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all part and parcel, says Mauldin, of the ``sometimes
downright funny things that always go along with misery.''
</P>
<P>
   Every part of ``Up Front'' translates well to 1999. The fear,
black humor and front-line craziness are the same as when Mauldin
first drew his cartoons. Any soldier marking time until Kosovo
turns into a ground war should snap up a copy and get ready for the
worst, as seen through Mauldin's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   They also should find ``Back Home,'' Mauldin's book on returning
veterans, published in 1947 by William Sloane. It includes cartoons
such as one of a vet coming out of a pawn shop flipping a coin,
saying, ``Who said my medals wouldn't buy me a cuppa coffee?'' And
one vet in a hospital bed asking others, ``How's things outside,
boys? Am I still a war hero or a drain on th' taxpayers?''
</P>
<P>
   As Marquand wrote at the end of the Second World War, Mauldin's
books ``should be required reading for everyone who has a husband,
sweetheart, brother, or son in the infantry, and it might not be
such a bad idea for the war college to study it. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone who reads it does not understand what Bill Mauldin
says and implies, it is time he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the war college, staff officers and the public have
had half a century to consider what Mauldin ``says and implies,''
and there doesn't seem to have been much change in the way this
country looks at war. The 50th anniversary edition of ``Up Front''
gives them one more chance.

<P>
   Adam Stettner racked his brains trying to figure out when it
happened. Could it have been while he was out jogging in the park?
Or when he wandered into the woods near the golf course to hunt
down a stray ball?
</P>
<P>
   Stettner never felt a bite or saw a rash. But sometime during
the summer of 1994, he was bitten by a tick infected with Borrelia
burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, the bacterium went to work, stealthily
winding its way through his bloodstream and ultimately wreaking
havoc with his nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I knew anything was wrong was in February
1995,'' Stettner says. ``I was walking down the hall at work and
suddenly the whole office started moving. It was like somebody took
my brain and put it in a blender.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next three years, Stettner submitted to test after test
_ blood chemistries, CT scans, MRIs, spinal taps, anything doctors
could think of to find the cause of his dizziness, nausea, memory
lapses and debilitating fatigue. Finally, down to 130 pounds from
160, he tested positive for Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't wish what happened to me on anybody,'' Stettner
says, a 26-year-old Wall Street trader. ``I lost a part of my life
I can never get back.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent FDA approval of a new Lyme disease vaccine has raised
hopes that stories like Stettner's may someday be relegated to
medical history books.
</P>
<P>
   This year people who live or vacation in tick-infested areas can
take a series of three Lyme immunization shots.
</P>
<P>
   But the good news is tempered by some disquieting facts. The
vaccine is approved only for adults, and it is not fully
protective. One out of five who receive the vaccine and are bitten
by infected ticks will still contract Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, vaccinated people might be tempted to let their guard
down. And this, of all years, is not a time to take chances.
</P>
<P>
   Ecologist Richard Ostfeld, who has spent the better part of the
decade figuring out the boom-and-bust cycles of the Lyme bacterium
as it circulates among ticks, mice and deer, is convinced that the
conditions for spreading the disease will he more dangerous this
summer than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things go as predicted, eastern oak forests and surrounding
areas will be teeming with infected ticks,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Chalk it up to the robust acorn count of 1997. Many other
factors contributing to the risk of exposure to Lyme disease are
familiar: human encroachment into forests, growing deer populations
and recent warm winters that have allowed more ticks to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The new variable comes from untangling the web of relationships
that link the tick life cycle, the feeding habits of mice and deer
and the species survival instincts of oak trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it the acorn connection,'' says Ostfeld, of the
Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins deep in oak forests where every few years oak
trees undergo a process called masting, when they produce a bumper
crop of acorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an evolved reproductive strategy,'' Ostfeld says. ``If
they dribble out a few acorns every year, there is a risk that all
the nuts will be eaten by squirrels and deer and all the other
things that eat acorns. But if the oak trees produce an enormous
bumper crop every three or four years, then some acorns will
survive and become seedlings.
</P>
<P>
   Ostfeld's analysis of this boom-and-bust cycle has led him to
conclude that two years after oak trees have their mast years, the
risk of getting Lyme disease in an oak forest goes up dramatically.
Conversely, two years after a low acorn production year, the risk
in oak forests is much lower.
</P>
<P>
   The timetable revolves around the reproductive cycles of ticks
and white-footed mice, the prime reservoirs of the Lyme bacterium.
</P>
<P>
   In a mast year, the bumper crop of acorns lures deer into the
oak forest. The deer are generally carrying a full cargo of adult
ticks. So the ticks, when done feeding, fall to the ground and lay
the eggs that will hatch into tick larvae the following summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever the deer are in the fall,'' Ostfeld says, ``that's
where the larval ticks will hatch the next summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, white-footed mice are also enjoying the acorn boom.
The mice, almost 100 percent of which are infected with Lyme from
previous tick encounters, spend the autumn munching acorns and
storing reserves to get them through the winter.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the tick larvae hatch that next August, the forest
is crawling with mice, Ostfeld says. ``Ticks get it from mice, mice
get it from ticks _ they pass it back and forth. Which came first,
nobody knows,'' Ostfeld says.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear, though, is that by the next June or July, two
years after the mast year, there are a lot of 1-year-old ticks, or
nymphs, in oak forests, and they stand an excellent chance of being
infected.
</P>
<P>
   That's worrisome because nymphs pose the greatest danger to
people. Nymphs feed during June and July, months when people tend
to spend time outdoors; adult ticks feed in the fall. And unlike
the adult tick, which is generally easy to spot and remove before
it transmits bacteria into the blood, the nymph tick is so tiny
(the size of a poppy seed) that it often escapes detection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1994 was a really good acorn year,'' Ostfeld says, ``we
predicted there would be lots of larvae and mice in 1995, and lots
of infected nymphs in 1996. It came true: 1996 saw a substantially
higher number of Lyme case in humans. In Connecticut, reported
cases more than doubled, rising from 1,548 in 1995 to 3,104 in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ostfeld hopes to use the acorn count each year to predict when
and where nymph ticks are likely to feed two years later, offering
people another weapon in their Lyme prevention arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main means of protecting ourselves is still going to be
not putting ourselves at risk, and the way to do that is to figure
out when the ticks are out and where they are. I envision what I
call Smokey the Tick warning people about what parks are liable to
be particularly risky for Lyme,'' Ostfeld says.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their successes, researchers admit that Lyme is far
from beaten. To maintain immunity people will probably need annual
booster shots. That may prove too demanding for those unaccustomed
to regular doctor visits.
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible, in theory, that some people with a specific
genetic makeup could develop an adverse reaction, similar to
arthritis, to the antibodies the vaccine arouses.
</P>
<P>
   Even with these concerns, researchers generally agree that the
vaccine is a major advance for people living in places where there
are lots of infected ticks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THWARTING TICKS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because the new Lyme vaccine is not 100 percent effective, the
best defense against the disease remains a good offense. Avoid
woody, overgrown or grassy areas. And if you're hiking, stay on the
trail, tuck your pants into your socks and wear light-colored
clothing to make ticks visible.
</P>
<P>
   Spraying your pants and shoes with an insect repellent
containing DEET helps, too. Avoid spraying face and hands, because
DEET is toxic.
</P>
<P>
   Daily tick checks are a must. Nymphal ticks are tiny, and they
like moist areas, so look in spots like the groin, navel, and
behind the knees.

   Trolling 50 miles off Cape Cod, charterboat captain Cookie
Murray glances aft, eyeing the nylon lines trailing in the wake.
Then he turns to the depth meter to see if anything is swimming
underneath the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at 2:45 p.m., a line on one of the baited poles at the
stern pops. Fisherman Everett Petronio leaps into the fighting
chair. This is the last day of the bluefin tuna season, and the
right bluefin could bring in tens of thousands of dollars in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The bluefin takes off and Petronio responds, cranking countless
circles with his right hand, bracing the pole with his left. The
struggle seems impossible, endless. Yet it is repeated thousands of
times a year on deep-sea fishing boats all along the United States
coasts.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing unusual is that a biologist, Molly Lutcavage, an
athletic woman in her early 40s, is on board. While Petronio fights
with his catch, Lutcavage is methodically attaching a massive dart
to the end of a hammer.
</P>
<P>
   The bluefin begins to tire, floating toward the surface. The
fish is beautiful, with opalescent skin. It is also gargantuan: 7.5
feet long and 400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   First mate Anthony Mendillo pulls the exhausted but thrashing
fish over to the side of the hull. Second mate Delmer Bacelis
swings the hammer and _ bang! _ implants the dart behind the rear
dorsal fin of the bluefin.
</P>
<P>
   Bacelis works the hook out of the fish and everyone leaps back.
The bluefin rights and swims away. The dart it carries is a
transmitter designed to record the tuna's journey for the next six
or seven months.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the great value of bluefin, biologists know little about
them. Except that the bluefin is a remarkable swimming machine and
can hold on to its body heat even in icy North Atlantic waters.
</P>
<P>
   A bluefin can go 20 miles an hour; rushing through the sea it
can build massive amounts of muscle in a short time. With a life
expectancy of more than 30 years, the fish can grow to well over 10
feet long and reach a weight of more than 1,400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, size and speed have proved to be little
protection. As Japan grew more affluent in the 1980s, the price for
bluefin tuna skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators tried to control the fishing frenzy that followed
with quotas, basing policies on the belief that there are two
distinct stocks of tuna: a western stock spawned in the Gulf of
Mexico, migrating along the U.S. coast and into Canadian waters,
and an eastern stock spawned in the Mediterranean Sea, migrating
along the European coast to northern waters.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 fishing for bluefin was so intense in Europe and the
Mediterranean that the quota was broken, with the catch reaching an
estimated 46,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
   If the stocks are distinct, the fortunes of one shouldn't mean
much to the other. But if that assumption is wrong, overfishing in
part of the Atlantic could threaten bluefin throughout the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   To know more, scientists developed an advanced tag to put on
bluefins. They are equipped with microprocessors and transmitters
in waterproof containers that float free from the fish. At a
programmed time, they bob to the surface and begin broadcasting
data.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage was one of the first biologists to put an advanced tag
on a bluefin. In 1993 she was hired by the New England Aquarium to
conduct an aerial survey of bluefin in the Gulf of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, there were calls to cut fishing quotas in half.
Environmentalists warned that the bluefin would soon be endangered,
while fishermen in New England claimed they saw increasing numbers
of bluefin.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage organized pilots to fly a survey off the coast of Cape
Cod. In their first year they photographed 4,984 fish in one day _
equal to about a quarter of the estimated western Atlantic stock.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, a pilot photographed a single school of
about 4,500 fish. Lutcavage's survey helped to forestall a quota
cut and to bring about a review by the National Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The academy concluded that the bluefin tuna population in the
western Atlantic had been stable since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage continued her aerial surveys until 1997. She also
tracked the fish with underwater microphones and learned that
bluefin make deep dives to the bottom at sunrise and sunset and
that after they are tagged they recover from the trauma quickly and
rejoin their schools.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997 she began tagging tuna with light tags
weighing less than an ounce. Light tags don't slow tuna down, and
they can be built to resist the high water pressures of a deep
dive.
</P>
<P>
   But the data they transmit are limited. Once on a bluefin, the
tag starts logging the temperature once an hour. At the end of eachday the tag's computer averages the temperatures and stores the
figure. After 60 days of taking temperatures, the computer shuts
down and the tag floats free.
</P>
<P>
   The data _ when the tag surfaced, its location and the average
daily temperatures _ are transmitted to a weather satellite that
passes overhead every 102 minutes. Eventually, the data move as
e-mail to a scientist.
</P>
<P>
   The process of fully transmitting all the data collected by a
single tag takes two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage programmed her tags to pop up between March and July
last year, the spawning season for tuna. The data suggest that
bluefin tagged off Cape Cod move out of New England waters after a
couple of weeks, probably crossing the warm Gulf Stream into the
cooler mid-Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   By the time spawning season came, the fish were all in a region
of the mid-Atlantic bounded by Bermuda on the west and the Azores
on the east. None of the tagged fish were in primary spawning
grounds during spawning time.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Block of Stanford, working off Cape Hatteras, N.C., has
started to work with an archival tag. Lodged in a fish's abdomen,
the tag measures not just water temperature, but also light, depth
and internal temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Two years into the archival program, the evidence shows that
bluefin tend to feed in the morning and bask in the sun in the
afternoon, that they spend most of their time in the upper water
layers but also make deep dives of more than 800 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the tags show the fish going to the mid-Atlantic
and not crossing. Block believes that bluefin have the capacity to
migrate distances that could take western bluefin into eastern
waters, but it's not clear if many actually make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   But the fishing season is over and with it the tagging season.
Now comes the wait. A tag must surface, a satellite must pass by, a
signal must be sent. Out there the true story of one of the ocean's
giants remains to be told.

<P>
   Adam Stettner racked his brains trying to figure out when it
happened. Could it have been while he was out jogging in the park?
Or when he wandered into the woods near the golf course to hunt
down a stray ball?
</P>
<P>
   Stettner never felt a bite or saw a rash. But sometime during
the summer of 1994, he was bitten by a tick infected with Borrelia
burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, the bacterium went to work, stealthily
winding its way through his bloodstream and ultimately wreaking
havoc with his nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I knew anything was wrong was in February
1995,'' Stettner says. ``I was walking down the hall at work and
suddenly the whole office started moving. It was like somebody took
my brain and put it in a blender.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next three years, Stettner submitted to test after test
_ blood chemistries, CT scans, MRIs, spinal taps, anything doctors
could think of to find the cause of his dizziness, nausea, memory
lapses and debilitating fatigue. Finally, down to 130 pounds from
160, he tested positive for Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't wish what happened to me on anybody,'' Stettner
says, a 26-year-old Wall Street trader. ``I lost a part of my life
I can never get back.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent FDA approval of a new Lyme disease vaccine has raised
hopes that stories like Stettner's may someday be relegated to
medical history books.
</P>
<P>
   This year people who live or vacation in tick-infested areas can
take a series of three Lyme immunization shots.
</P>
<P>
   But the good news is tempered by some disquieting facts. The
vaccine is approved only for adults, and it is not fully
protective. One out of five who receive the vaccine and are bitten
by infected ticks will still contract Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, vaccinated people might be tempted to let their guard
down. And this, of all years, is not a time to take chances.
</P>
<P>
   Ecologist Richard Ostfeld, who has spent the better part of the
decade figuring out the boom-and-bust cycles of the Lyme bacterium
as it circulates among ticks, mice and deer, is convinced that the
conditions for spreading the disease will he more dangerous this
summer than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things go as predicted, eastern oak forests and surrounding
areas will be teeming with infected ticks,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Chalk it up to the robust acorn count of 1997. Many other
factors contributing to the risk of exposure to Lyme disease are
familiar: human encroachment into forests, growing deer populations
and recent warm winters that have allowed more ticks to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The new variable comes from untangling the web of relationships
that link the tick life cycle, the feeding habits of mice and deer
and the species survival instincts of oak trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it the acorn connection,'' says Ostfeld, of the
Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins deep in oak forests where every few years oak
trees undergo a process called masting, when they produce a bumper
crop of acorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an evolved reproductive strategy,'' Ostfeld says. ``If
they dribble out a few acorns every year, there is a risk that all
the nuts will be eaten by squirrels and deer and all the other
things that eat acorns. But if the oak trees produce an enormous
bumper crop every three or four years, then some acorns will
survive and become seedlings.
</P>
<P>
   Ostfeld's analysis of this boom-and-bust cycle has led him to
conclude that two years after oak trees have their mast years, the
risk of getting Lyme disease in an oak forest goes up dramatically.
Conversely, two years after a low acorn production year, the risk
in oak forests is much lower.
</P>
<P>
   The timetable revolves around the reproductive cycles of ticks
and white-footed mice, the prime reservoirs of the Lyme bacterium.
</P>
<P>
   In a mast year, the bumper crop of acorns lures deer into the
oak forest. The deer are generally carrying a full cargo of adult
ticks. So the ticks, when done feeding, fall to the ground and lay
the eggs that will hatch into tick larvae the following summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever the deer are in the fall,'' Ostfeld says, ``that's
where the larval ticks will hatch the next summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, white-footed mice are also enjoying the acorn boom.
The mice, almost 100 percent of which are infected with Lyme from
previous tick encounters, spend the autumn munching acorns and
storing reserves to get them through the winter.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the tick larvae hatch that next August, the forest
is crawling with mice, Ostfeld says. ``Ticks get it from mice, mice
get it from ticks _ they pass it back and forth. Which came first,
nobody knows,'' Ostfeld says.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear, though, is that by the next June or July, two
years after the mast year, there are a lot of 1-year-old ticks, or
nymphs, in oak forests, and they stand an excellent chance of being
infected.
</P>
<P>
   That's worrisome because nymphs pose the greatest danger to
people. Nymphs feed during June and July, months when people tend
to spend time outdoors; adult ticks feed in the fall. And unlike
the adult tick, which is generally easy to spot and remove before
it transmits bacteria into the blood, the nymph tick is so tiny
(the size of a poppy seed) that it often escapes detection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1994 was a really good acorn year,'' Ostfeld says, ``we
predicted there would be lots of larvae and mice in 1995, and lots
of infected nymphs in 1996. It came true: 1996 saw a substantially
higher number of Lyme case in humans. In Connecticut, reported
cases more than doubled, rising from 1,548 in 1995 to 3,104 in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ostfeld hopes to use the acorn count each year to predict when
and where nymph ticks are likely to feed two years later, offering
people another weapon in their Lyme prevention arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main means of protecting ourselves is still going to be
not putting ourselves at risk, and the way to do that is to figure
out when the ticks are out and where they are. I envision what I
call Smokey the Tick warning people about what parks are liable to
be particularly risky for Lyme,'' Ostfeld says.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their successes, researchers admit that Lyme is far
from beaten. To maintain immunity people will probably need annual
booster shots. That may prove too demanding for those unaccustomed
to regular doctor visits.
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible, in theory, that some people with a specific
genetic makeup could develop an adverse reaction, similar to
arthritis, to the antibodies the vaccine arouses.
</P>
<P>
   Even with these concerns, researchers generally agree that the
vaccine is a major advance for people living in places where there
are lots of infected ticks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THWARTING TICKS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because the new Lyme vaccine is not 100 percent effective, the
best defense against the disease remains a good offense. Avoid
woody, overgrown or grassy areas. And if you're hiking, stay on the
trail, tuck your pants into your socks and wear light-colored
clothing to make ticks visible.
</P>
<P>
   Spraying your pants and shoes with an insect repellent
containing DEET helps, too. Avoid spraying face and hands, because
DEET is toxic.
</P>
<P>
   Daily tick checks are a must. Nymphal ticks are tiny, and they
like moist areas, so look in spots like the groin, navel, and
behind the knees.

   Adam Stettner racked his brains trying to figure out when it
happened. Could it have been while he was out jogging in the park?
Or when he wandered into the woods near the golf course to hunt
down a stray ball?
</P>
<P>
   Stettner never felt a bite or saw a rash. But sometime during
the summer of 1994, he was bitten by a tick infected with Borrelia
burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, the bacterium went to work, stealthily
winding its way through his bloodstream and ultimately wreaking
havoc with his nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I knew anything was wrong was in February
1995,'' Stettner says. ``I was walking down the hall at work and
suddenly the whole office started moving. It was like somebody took
my brain and put it in a blender.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next three years, Stettner submitted to test after test
_ blood chemistries, CT scans, MRIs, spinal taps, anything doctors
could think of to find the cause of his dizziness, nausea, memory
lapses and debilitating fatigue. Finally, down to 130 pounds from
160, he tested positive for Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't wish what happened to me on anybody,'' Stettner
says, a 26-year-old Wall Street trader. ``I lost a part of my life
I can never get back.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent FDA approval of a new Lyme disease vaccine has raised
hopes that stories like Stettner's may someday be relegated to
medical history books.
</P>
<P>
   This year people who live or vacation in tick-infested areas can
take a series of three Lyme immunization shots.
</P>
<P>
   But the good news is tempered by some disquieting facts. The
vaccine is approved only for adults, and it is not fully
protective. One out of five who receive the vaccine and are bitten
by infected ticks will still contract Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, vaccinated people might be tempted to let their guard
down. And this, of all years, is not a time to take chances.
</P>
<P>
   Ecologist Richard Ostfeld, who has spent the better part of the
decade figuring out the boom-and-bust cycles of the Lyme bacterium
as it circulates among ticks, mice and deer, is convinced that the
conditions for spreading the disease will he more dangerous this
summer than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things go as predicted, eastern oak forests and surrounding
areas will be teeming with infected ticks,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Chalk it up to the robust acorn count of 1997. Many other
factors contributing to the risk of exposure to Lyme disease are
familiar: human encroachment into forests, growing deer populations
and recent warm winters that have allowed more ticks to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The new variable comes from untangling the web of relationships
that link the tick life cycle, the feeding habits of mice and deer
and the species survival instincts of oak trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it the acorn connection,'' says Ostfeld, of the
Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins deep in oak forests where every few years oak
trees undergo a process called masting, when they produce a bumper
crop of acorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an evolved reproductive strategy,'' Ostfeld says. ``If
they dribble out a few acorns every year, there is a risk that all
the nuts will be eaten by squirrels and deer and all the other
things that eat acorns. But if the oak trees produce an enormous
bumper crop every three or four years, then some acorns will
survive and become seedlings.
</P>
<P>
   Ostfeld's analysis of this boom-and-bust cycle has led him to
conclude that two years after oak trees have their mast years, the
risk of getting Lyme disease in an oak forest goes up dramatically.
Conversely, two years after a low acorn production year, the risk
in oak forests is much lower.
</P>
<P>
   The timetable revolves around the reproductive cycles of ticks
and white-footed mice, the prime reservoirs of the Lyme bacterium.
</P>
<P>
   In a mast year, the bumper crop of acorns lures deer into the
oak forest. The deer are generally carrying a full cargo of adult
ticks. So the ticks, when done feeding, fall to the ground and lay
the eggs that will hatch into tick larvae the following summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever the deer are in the fall,'' Ostfeld says, ``that's
where the larval ticks will hatch the next summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, white-footed mice are also enjoying the acorn boom.
The mice, almost 100 percent of which are infected with Lyme from
previous tick encounters, spend the autumn munching acorns and
storing reserves to get them through the winter.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the tick larvae hatch that next August, the forest
is crawling with mice, Ostfeld says. ``Ticks get it from mice, mice
get it from ticks _ they pass it back and forth. Which came first,
nobody knows,'' Ostfeld says.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear, though, is that by the next June or July, two
years after the mast year, there are a lot of 1-year-old ticks, or
nymphs, in oak forests, and they stand an excellent chance of being
infected.
</P>
<P>
   That's worrisome because nymphs pose the greatest danger to
people. Nymphs feed during June and July, months when people tend
to spend time outdoors; adult ticks feed in the fall. And unlike
the adult tick, which is generally easy to spot and remove before
it transmits bacteria into the blood, the nymph tick is so tiny
(the size of a poppy seed) that it often escapes detection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1994 was a really good acorn year,'' Ostfeld says, ``we
predicted there would be lots of larvae and mice in 1995, and lots
of infected nymphs in 1996. It came true: 1996 saw a substantially
higher number of Lyme case in humans. In Connecticut, reported
cases more than doubled, rising from 1,548 in 1995 to 3,104 in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ostfeld hopes to use the acorn count each year to predict when
and where nymph ticks are likely to feed two years later, offering
people another weapon in their Lyme prevention arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main means of protecting ourselves is still going to be
not putting ourselves at risk, and the way to do that is to figure
out when the ticks are out and where they are. I envision what I
call Smokey the Tick warning people about what parks are liable to
be particularly risky for Lyme,'' Ostfeld says.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their successes, researchers admit that Lyme is far
from beaten. To maintain immunity people will probably need annual
booster shots. That may prove too demanding for those unaccustomed
to regular doctor visits.
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible, in theory, that some people with a specific
genetic makeup could develop an adverse reaction, similar to
arthritis, to the antibodies the vaccine arouses.
</P>
<P>
   Even with these concerns, researchers generally agree that the
vaccine is a major advance for people living in places where there
are lots of infected ticks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THWARTING TICKS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because the new Lyme vaccine is not 100 percent effective, the
best defense against the disease remains a good offense. Avoid
woody, overgrown or grassy areas. And if you're hiking, stay on the
trail, tuck your pants into your socks and wear light-colored
clothing to make ticks visible.
</P>
<P>
   Spraying your pants and shoes with an insect repellent
containing DEET helps, too. Avoid spraying face and hands, because
DEET is toxic.
</P>
<P>
   Daily tick checks are a must. Nymphal ticks are tiny, and they
like moist areas, so look in spots like the groin, navel, and
behind the knees.

<P>
   Trolling 50 miles off Cape Cod, charterboat captain Cookie
Murray glances aft, eyeing the nylon lines trailing in the wake.
Then he turns to the depth meter to see if anything is swimming
underneath the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at 2:45 p.m., a line on one of the baited poles at the
stern pops. Fisherman Everett Petronio leaps into the fighting
chair. This is the last day of the bluefin tuna season, and the
right bluefin could bring in tens of thousands of dollars in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The bluefin takes off and Petronio responds, cranking countless
circles with his right hand, bracing the pole with his left. The
struggle seems impossible, endless. Yet it is repeated thousands of
times a year on deep-sea fishing boats all along the United States
coasts.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing unusual is that a biologist, Molly Lutcavage, an
athletic woman in her early 40s, is on board. While Petronio fights
with his catch, Lutcavage is methodically attaching a massive dart
to the end of a hammer.
</P>
<P>
   The bluefin begins to tire, floating toward the surface. The
fish is beautiful, with opalescent skin. It is also gargantuan: 7.5
feet long and 400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   First mate Anthony Mendillo pulls the exhausted but thrashing
fish over to the side of the hull. Second mate Delmer Bacelis
swings the hammer and _ bang! _ implants the dart behind the rear
dorsal fin of the bluefin.
</P>
<P>
   Bacelis works the hook out of the fish and everyone leaps back.
The bluefin rights and swims away. The dart it carries is a
transmitter designed to record the tuna's journey for the next six
or seven months.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the great value of bluefin, biologists know little about
them. Except that the bluefin is a remarkable swimming machine and
can hold on to its body heat even in icy North Atlantic waters.
</P>
<P>
   A bluefin can go 20 miles an hour; rushing through the sea it
can build massive amounts of muscle in a short time. With a life
expectancy of more than 30 years, the fish can grow to well over 10
feet long and reach a weight of more than 1,400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, size and speed have proved to be little
protection. As Japan grew more affluent in the 1980s, the price for
bluefin tuna skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators tried to control the fishing frenzy that followed
with quotas, basing policies on the belief that there are two
distinct stocks of tuna: a western stock spawned in the Gulf of
Mexico, migrating along the U.S. coast and into Canadian waters,
and an eastern stock spawned in the Mediterranean Sea, migrating
along the European coast to northern waters.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 fishing for bluefin was so intense in Europe and the
Mediterranean that the quota was broken, with the catch reaching an
estimated 46,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
   If the stocks are distinct, the fortunes of one shouldn't mean
much to the other. But if that assumption is wrong, overfishing in
part of the Atlantic could threaten bluefin throughout the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   To know more, scientists developed an advanced tag to put on
bluefins. They are equipped with microprocessors and transmitters
in waterproof containers that float free from the fish. At a
programmed time, they bob to the surface and begin broadcasting
data.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage was one of the first biologists to put an advanced tag
on a bluefin. In 1993 she was hired by the New England Aquarium to
conduct an aerial survey of bluefin in the Gulf of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, there were calls to cut fishing quotas in half.
Environmentalists warned that the bluefin would soon be endangered,
while fishermen in New England claimed they saw increasing numbers
of bluefin.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage organized pilots to fly a survey off the coast of Cape
Cod. In their first year they photographed 4,984 fish in one day _
equal to about a quarter of the estimated western Atlantic stock.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, a pilot photographed a single school of
about 4,500 fish. Lutcavage's survey helped to forestall a quota
cut and to bring about a review by the National Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The academy concluded that the bluefin tuna population in the
western Atlantic had been stable since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage continued her aerial surveys until 1997. She also
tracked the fish with underwater microphones and learned that
bluefin make deep dives to the bottom at sunrise and sunset and
that after they are tagged they recover from the trauma quickly and
rejoin their schools.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997 she began tagging tuna with light tags
weighing less than an ounce. Light tags don't slow tuna down, and
they can be built to resist the high water pressures of a deep
dive.
</P>
<P>
   But the data they transmit are limited. Once on a bluefin, the
tag starts logging the temperature once an hour. At the end of each
day the tag's computer averages the temperatures and stores the
figure. After 60 days of taking temperatures, the computer shuts
down and the tag floats free.
</P>
<P>
   The data _ when the tag surfaced, its location and the average
daily temperatures _ are transmitted to a weather satellite that
passes overhead every 102 minutes. Eventually, the data move as
e-mail to a scientist.
</P>
<P>
   The process of fully transmitting all the data collected by a
single tag takes two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage programmed her tags to pop up between March and July
last year, the spawning season for tuna. The data suggest that
bluefin tagged off Cape Cod move out of New England waters after a
couple of weeks, probably crossing the warm Gulf Stream into the
cooler mid-Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   By the time spawning season came, the fish were all in a region
of the mid-Atlantic bounded by Bermuda on the west and the Azores
on the east. None of the tagged fish were in primary spawning
grounds during spawning time.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Block of Stanford, working off Cape Hatteras, N.C., has
started to work with an archival tag. Lodged in a fish's abdomen,
the tag measures not just water temperature, but also light, depth
and internal temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Two years into the archival program, the evidence shows that
bluefin tend to feed in the morning and bask in the sun in the
afternoon, that they spend most of their time in the upper water
layers but also make deep dives of more than 800 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the tags show the fish going to the mid-Atlantic
and not crossing. Block believes that bluefin have the capacity to
migrate distances that could take western bluefin into eastern
waters, but it's not clear if many actually make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   But the fishing season is over and with it the tagging season.
Now comes the wait. A tag must surface, a satellite must pass by, a
signal must be sent. Out there the true story of one of the ocean's
giants remains to be told.

   Stettner never felt a bite or saw a rash. But sometime during
the summer of 1994, he was bitten by a tick infected with Borrelia
burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, the bacterium went to work, stealthily
winding its way through his bloodstream and ultimately wreaking
havoc with his nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I knew anything was wrong was in February
1995,'' Stettner says. ``I was walking down the hall at work and
suddenly the whole office started moving. It was like somebody took
my brain and put it in a blender.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next three years, Stettner submitted to test after test
_ blood chemistries, CT scans, MRIs, spinal taps, anything doctors
could think of to find the cause of his dizziness, nausea, memory
lapses and debilitating fatigue. Finally, down to 130 pounds from
160, he tested positive for Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't wish what happened to me on anybody,'' Stettner
says, a 26-year-old Wall Street trader. ``I lost a part of my life
I can never get back.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent FDA approval of a new Lyme disease vaccine has raised
hopes that stories like Stettner's may someday be relegated to
medical history books.
</P>
<P>
   This year people who live or vacation in tick-infested areas can
take a series of three Lyme immunization shots.
</P>
<P>
   But the good news is tempered by some disquieting facts. The
vaccine is approved only for adults, and it is not fully
protective. One out of five who receive the vaccine and are bitten
by infected ticks will still contract Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, vaccinated people might be tempted to let their guard
down. And this, of all years, is not a time to take chances.
</P>
<P>
   Ecologist Richard Ostfeld, who has spent the better part of the
decade figuring out the boom-and-bust cycles of the Lyme bacterium
as it circulates among ticks, mice and deer, is convinced that the
conditions for spreading the disease will he more dangerous this
summer than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things go as predicted, eastern oak forests and surrounding
areas will be teeming with infected ticks,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Chalk it up to the robust acorn count of 1997. Many other
factors contributing to the risk of exposure to Lyme disease are
familiar: human encroachment into forests, growing deer populations
and recent warm winters that have allowed more ticks to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The new variable comes from untangling the web of relationships
that link the tick life cycle, the feeding habits of mice and deer
and the species survival instincts of oak trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it the acorn connection,'' says Ostfeld, of the
Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins deep in oak forests where every few years oak
trees undergo a process called masting, when they produce a bumper
crop of acorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an evolved reproductive strategy,'' Ostfeld says. ``If
they dribble out a few acorns every year, there is a risk that all
the nuts will be eaten by squirrels and deer and all the other
things that eat acorns. But if the oak trees produce an enormous
bumper crop every three or four years, then some acorns will
survive and become seedlings.
</P>
<P>
   Ostfeld's analysis of this boom-and-bust cycle has led him to
conclude that two years after oak trees have their mast years, the
risk of getting Lyme disease in an oak forest goes up dramatically.
Conversely, two years after a low acorn production year, the risk
in oak forests is much lower.
</P>
<P>
   The timetable revolves around the reproductive cycles of ticks
and white-footed mice, the prime reservoirs of the Lyme bacterium.
</P>
<P>
   In a mast year, the bumper crop of acorns lures deer into the
oak forest. The deer are generally carrying a full cargo of adult
ticks. So the ticks, when done feeding, fall to the ground and lay
the eggs that will hatch into tick larvae the following summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever the deer are in the fall,'' Ostfeld says, ``that's
where the larval ticks will hatch the next summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, white-footed mice are also enjoying the acorn boom.
The mice, almost 100 percent of which are infected with Lyme from
previous tick encounters, spend the autumn munching acorns and
storing reserves to get them through the winter.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the tick larvae hatch that next August, the forest
is crawling with mice, Ostfeld says. ``Ticks get it from mice, mice
get it from ticks _ they pass it back and forth. Which came first,
nobody knows,'' Ostfeld says.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear, though, is that by the next June or July, two
years after the mast year, there are a lot of 1-year-old ticks, or
nymphs, in oak forests, and they stand an excellent chance of being
infected.
</P>
<P>
   That's worrisome because nymphs pose the greatest danger to
people. Nymphs feed during June and July, months when people tend
to spend time outdoors; adult ticks feed in the fall. And unlike
the adult tick, which is generally easy to spot and remove before
it transmits bacteria into the blood, the nymph tick is so tiny
(the size of a poppy seed) that it often escapes detection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1994 was a really good acorn year,'' Ostfeld says, ``we
predicted there would be lots of larvae and mice in 1995, and lots
of infected nymphs in 1996. It came true: 1996 saw a substantially
higher number of Lyme case in humans. In Connecticut, reported
cases more than doubled, rising from 1,548 in 1995 to 3,104 in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ostfeld hopes to use the acorn count each year to predict when
and where nymph ticks are likely to feed two years later, offering
people another weapon in their Lyme prevention arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main means of protecting ourselves is still going to be
not putting ourselves at risk, and the way to do that is to figure
out when the ticks are out and where they are. I envision what I
call Smokey the Tick warning people about what parks are liable to
be particularly risky for Lyme,'' Ostfeld says.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their successes, researchers admit that Lyme is far
from beaten. To maintain immunity people will probably need annual
booster shots. That may prove too demanding for those unaccustomed
to regular doctor visits.
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible, in theory, that some people with a specific
genetic makeup could develop an adverse reaction, similar to
arthritis, to the antibodies the vaccine arouses.
</P>
<P>
   Even with these concerns, researchers generally agree that the
vaccine is a major advance for people living in places where there
are lots of infected ticks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THWARTING TICKS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because the new Lyme vaccine is not 100 percent effective, the
best defense against the disease remains a good offense. Avoid
woody, overgrown or grassy areas. And if you're hiking, stay on the
trail, tuck your pants into your socks and wear light-colored
clothing to make ticks visible.
</P>
<P>
   Spraying your pants and shoes with an insect repellent
containing DEET helps, too. Avoid spraying face and hands, because
DEET is toxic.
</P>
<P>
   Daily tick checks are a must. Nymphal ticks are tiny, and they
like moist areas, so look in spots like the groin, navel, and
behind the knees.

<P>
   Trolling 50 miles off Cape Cod, charterboat captain Cookie
Murray glances aft, eyeing the nylon lines trailing in the wake.
Then he turns to the depth meter to see if anything is swimming
underneath the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at 2:45 p.m., a line on one of the baited poles at the
stern pops. Fisherman Everett Petronio leaps into the fighting
chair. This is the last day of the bluefin tuna season, and the
right bluefin could bring in tens of thousands of dollars in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The bluefin takes off and Petronio responds, cranking countless
circles with his right hand, bracing the pole with his left. The
struggle seems impossible, endless. Yet it is repeated thousands of
times a year on deep-sea fishing boats all along the United States
coasts.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing unusual is that a biologist, Molly Lutcavage, an
athletic woman in her early 40s, is on board. While Petronio fights
with his catch, Lutcavage is methodically attaching a massive dart
to the end of a hammer.
</P>
<P>
   The bluefin begins to tire, floating toward the surface. The
fish is beautiful, with opalescent skin. It is also gargantuan: 7.5
feet long and 400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   First mate Anthony Mendillo pulls the exhausted but thrashing
fish over to the side of the hull. Second mate Delmer Bacelis
swings the hammer and _ bang! _ implants the dart behind the rear
dorsal fin of the bluefin.
</P>
<P>
   Bacelis works the hook out of the fish and everyone leaps back.
The bluefin rights and swims away. The dart it carries is a
transmitter designed to record the tuna's journey for the next six
or seven months.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the great value of bluefin, biologists know little about
them. Except that the bluefin is a remarkable swimming machine and
can hold on to its body heat even in icy North Atlantic waters.
</P>
<P>
   A bluefin can go 20 miles an hour; rushing through the sea it
can build massive amounts of muscle in a short time. With a life
expectancy of more than 30 years, the fish can grow to well over 10
feet long and reach a weight of more than 1,400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, size and speed have proved to be little
protection. As Japan grew more affluent in the 1980s, the price for
bluefin tuna skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators tried to control the fishing frenzy that followed
with quotas, basing policies on the belief that there are two
distinct stocks of tuna: a western stock spawned in the Gulf of
Mexico, migrating along the U.S. coast and into Canadian waters,
and an eastern stock spawned in the Mediterranean Sea, migrating
along the European coast to northern waters.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 fishing for bluefin was so intense in Europe and the
Mediterranean that the quota was broken, with the catch reaching an
estimated 46,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
   If the stocks are distinct, the fortunes of one shouldn't mean
much to the other. But if that assumption is wrong, overfishing in
part of the Atlantic could threaten bluefin throughout the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   To know more, scientists developed an advanced tag to put on
bluefins. They are equipped with microprocessors and transmitters
in waterproof containers that float free from the fish. At a
programmed time, they bob to the surface and begin broadcasting
data.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage was one of the first biologists to put an advanced tag
on a bluefin. In 1993 she was hired by the New England Aquarium to
conduct an aerial survey of bluefin in the Gulf of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, there were calls to cut fishing quotas in half.
Environmentalists warned that the bluefin would soon be endangered,
while fishermen in New England claimed they saw increasing numbers
of bluefin.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage organized pilots to fly a survey off the coast of Cape
Cod. In their first year they photographed 4,984 fish in one day _
equal to about a quarter of the estimated western Atlantic stock.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, a pilot photographed a single school of
about 4,500 fish. Lutcavage's survey helped to forestall a quota
cut and to bring about a review by the National Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The academy concluded that the bluefin tuna population in the
western Atlantic had been stable since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage continued her aerial surveys until 1997. She also
tracked the fish with underwater microphones and learned that
bluefin make deep dives to the bottom at sunrise and sunset and
that after they are tagged they recover from the trauma quickly and
rejoin their schools.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997 she began tagging tuna with light tags
weighing less than an ounce. Light tags don't slow tuna down, and
they can be built to resist the high water pressures of a deep
dive.
</P>
<P>
   But the data they transmit are limited. Once on a bluefin, the
tag starts logging the temperature once an hour. At the end of each
day the tag's computer averages the temperatures and stores the
figure. After 60 days of taking temperatures, the computer shuts
down and the tag floats free.
</P>
<P>
   The data _ when the tag surfaced, its location and the average
daily temperatures _ are transmitted to a weather satellite that
passes overhead every 102 minutes. Eventually, the data move as
e-mail to a scientist.
</P>
<P>
   The process of fully transmitting all the data collected by a
single tag takes two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage programmed her tags to pop up between March and July
last year, the spawning season for tuna. The data suggest that
bluefin tagged off Cape Cod move out of New England waters after a
couple of weeks, probably crossing the warm Gulf Stream into the
cooler mid-Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   By the time spawning season came, the fish were all in a region
of the mid-Atlantic bounded by Bermuda on the west and the Azores
on the east. None of the tagged fish were in primary spawning
grounds during spawning time.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Block of Stanford, working off Cape Hatteras, N.C., has
started to work with an archival tag. Lodged in a fish's abdomen,
the tag measures not just water temperature, but also light, depth
and internal temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Two years into the archival program, the evidence shows that
bluefin tend to feed in the morning and bask in the sun in the
afternoon, that they spend most of their time in the upper water
layers but also make deep dives of more than 800 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the tags show the fish going to the mid-Atlantic
and not crossing. Block believes that bluefin have the capacity to
migrate distances that could take western bluefin into eastern
waters, but it's not clear if many actually make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   But the fishing season is over and with it the tagging season.
Now comes the wait. A tag must surface, a satellite must pass by, a
signal must be sent. Out there the true story of one of the ocean's
giants remains to be told.

<P>
   Trolling 50 miles off Cape Cod, charterboat captain Cookie
Murray glances aft, eyeing the nylon lines trailing in the wake.
Then he turns to the depth meter to see if anything is swimming
underneath the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at 2:45 p.m., a line on one of the baited poles at the
stern pops. Fisherman Everett Petronio leaps into the fighting
chair. This is the last day of the bluefin tuna season, and the
right bluefin could bring in tens of thousands of dollars in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The bluefin takes off and Petronio responds, cranking countless
circles with his right hand, bracing the pole with his left. The
struggle seems impossible, endless. Yet it is repeated thousands of
times a year on deep-sea fishing boats all along the United States
coasts.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing unusual is that a biologist, Molly Lutcavage, an
athletic woman in her early 40s, is on board. While Petronio fights
with his catch, Lutcavage is methodically attaching a massive dart
to the end of a hammer.
</P>
<P>
   The bluefin begins to tire, floating toward the surface. The
fish is beautiful, with opalescent skin. It is also gargantuan: 7.5
feet long and 400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   First mate Anthony Mendillo pulls the exhausted but thrashing
fish over to the side of the hull. Second mate Delmer Bacelis
swings the hammer and _ bang! _ implants the dart behind the rear
dorsal fin of the bluefin.
</P>
<P>
   Bacelis works the hook out of the fish and everyone leaps back.
The bluefin rights and swims away. The dart it carries is a
transmitter designed to record the tuna's journey for the next six
or seven months.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the great value of bluefin, biologists know little about
them. Except that the bluefin is a remarkable swimming machine and
can hold on to its body heat even in icy North Atlantic waters.
</P>
<P>
   A bluefin can go 20 miles an hour; rushing through the sea it
can build massive amounts of muscle in a short time. With a life
expectancy of more than 30 years, the fish can grow to well over 10
feet long and reach a weight of more than 1,400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, size and speed have proved to be little
protection. As Japan grew more affluent in the 1980s, the price for
bluefin tuna skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators tried to control the fishing frenzy that followed
with quotas, basing policies on the belief that there are two
distinct stocks of tuna: a western stock spawned in the Gulf of
Mexico, migrating along the U.S. coast and into Canadian waters,
and an eastern stock spawned in the Mediterranean Sea, migrating
along the European coast to northern waters.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 fishing for bluefin was so intense in Europe and the
Mediterranean that the quota was broken, with the catch reaching an
estimated 46,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
   If the stocks are distinct, the fortunes of one shouldn't mean
much to the other. But if that assumption is wrong, overfishing in
part of the Atlantic could threaten bluefin throughout the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   To know more, scientists developed an advanced tag to put on
bluefins. They are equipped with microprocessors and transmitters
in waterproof containers that float free from the fish. At a
programmed time, they bob to the surface and begin broadcasting
data.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage was one of the first biologists to put an advanced tag
on a bluefin. In 1993 she was hired by the New England Aquarium to
conduct an aerial survey of bluefin in the Gulf of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, there were calls to cut fishing quotas in half.
Environmentalists warned that the bluefin would soon be endangered,
while fishermen in New England claimed they saw increasing numbers
of bluefin.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage organized pilots to fly a survey off the coast of Cape
Cod. In their first year they photographed 4,984 fish in one day _
equal to about a quarter of the estimated western Atlantic stock.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, a pilot photographed a single school of
about 4,500 fish. Lutcavage's survey helped to forestall a quota
cut and to bring about a review by the National Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The academy concluded that the bluefin tuna population in the
western Atlantic had been stable since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage continued her aerial surveys until 1997. She also
tracked the fish with underwater microphones and learned that
bluefin make deep dives to the bottom at sunrise and sunset and
that after they are tagged they recover from the trauma quickly and
rejoin their schools.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997 she began tagging tuna with light tags
weighing less than an ounce. Light tags don't slow tuna down, and
they can be built to resist the high water pressures of a deep
dive.
</P>
<P>
   But the data they transmit are limited. Once on a bluefin, the
tag starts logging the temperature once an hour. At the end of each
day the tag's computer averages the temperatures and stores the
figure. After 60 days of taking temperatures, the computer shuts
down and the tag floats free.
</P>
<P>
   The data _ when the tag surfaced, its location and the average
daily temperatures _ are transmitted to a weather satellite that
passes overhead every 102 minutes. Eventually, the data move as
e-mail to a scientist.
</P>
<P>
   The process of fully transmitting all the data collected by a
single tag takes two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage programmed her tags to pop up between March and July
last year, the spawning season for tuna. The data suggest that
bluefin tagged off Cape Cod move out of New England waters after a
couple of weeks, probably crossing the warm Gulf Stream into the
cooler mid-Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   By the time spawning season came, the fish were all in a region
of the mid-Atlantic bounded by Bermuda on the west and the Azores
on the east. None of the tagged fish were in primary spawning
grounds during spawning time.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Block of Stanford, working off Cape Hatteras, N.C., has
started to work with an archival tag. Lodged in a fish's abdomen,
the tag measures not just water temperature, but also light, depth
and internal temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Two years into the archival program, the evidence shows that
bluefin tend to feed in the morning and bask in the sun in the
afternoon, that they spend most of their time in the upper water
layers but also make deep dives of more than 800 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the tags show the fish going to the mid-Atlantic
and not crossing. Block believes that bluefin have the capacity to
migrate distances that could take western bluefin into eastern
waters, but it's not clear if many actually make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   But the fishing season is over and with it the tagging season.
Now comes the wait. A tag must surface, a satellite must pass by, a
signal must be sent. Out there the true story of one of the ocean's
giants remains to be told.

   Adam Stettner racked his brains trying to figure out when it
happened. Could it have been while he was out jogging in the park?
Or when he wandered into the woods near the golf course to hunt
down a stray ball?
</P>
<P>
   Stettner never felt a bite or saw a rash. But sometime during
the summer of 1994, he was bitten by a tick infected with Borrelia
burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few months, the bacterium went to work, stealthily
winding its way through his bloodstream and ultimately wreaking
havoc with his nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I knew anything was wrong was in February
1995,'' Stettner says. ``I was walking down the hall at work and
suddenly the whole office started moving. It was like somebody took
my brain and put it in a blender.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next three years, Stettner submitted to test after test
_ blood chemistries, CT scans, MRIs, spinal taps, anything doctors
could think of to find the cause of his dizziness, nausea, memory
lapses and debilitating fatigue. Finally, down to 130 pounds from
160, he tested positive for Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't wish what happened to me on anybody,'' Stettner
says, a 26-year-old Wall Street trader. ``I lost a part of my life
I can never get back.''
</P>
<P>
   The recent FDA approval of a new Lyme disease vaccine has raised
hopes that stories like Stettner's may someday be relegated to
medical history books.
</P>
<P>
   This year people who live or vacation in tick-infested areas can
take a series of three Lyme immunization shots.
</P>
<P>
   But the good news is tempered by some disquieting facts. The
vaccine is approved only for adults, and it is not fully
protective. One out of five who receive the vaccine and are bitten
by infected ticks will still contract Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, vaccinated people might be tempted to let their guard
down. And this, of all years, is not a time to take chances.
</P>
<P>
   Ecologist Richard Ostfeld, who has spent the better part of the
decade figuring out the boom-and-bust cycles of the Lyme bacterium
as it circulates among ticks, mice and deer, is convinced that the
conditions for spreading the disease will he more dangerous this
summer than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   ``If things go as predicted, eastern oak forests and surrounding
areas will be teeming with infected ticks,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Chalk it up to the robust acorn count of 1997. Many other
factors contributing to the risk of exposure to Lyme disease are
familiar: human encroachment into forests, growing deer populations
and recent warm winters that have allowed more ticks to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The new variable comes from untangling the web of relationships
that link the tick life cycle, the feeding habits of mice and deer
and the species survival instincts of oak trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it the acorn connection,'' says Ostfeld, of the
Institute of Ecosystem Studies in Millbrook, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The story begins deep in oak forests where every few years oak
trees undergo a process called masting, when they produce a bumper
crop of acorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an evolved reproductive strategy,'' Ostfeld says. ``If
they dribble out a few acorns every year, there is a risk that all
the nuts will be eaten by squirrels and deer and all the other
things that eat acorns. But if the oak trees produce an enormous
bumper crop every three or four years, then some acorns will
survive and become seedlings.
</P>
<P>
   Ostfeld's analysis of this boom-and-bust cycle has led him to
conclude that two years after oak trees have their mast years, the
risk of getting Lyme disease in an oak forest goes up dramatically.
Conversely, two years after a low acorn production year, the risk
in oak forests is much lower.
</P>
<P>
   The timetable revolves around the reproductive cycles of ticks
and white-footed mice, the prime reservoirs of the Lyme bacterium.
</P>
<P>
   In a mast year, the bumper crop of acorns lures deer into the
oak forest. The deer are generally carrying a full cargo of adult
ticks. So the ticks, when done feeding, fall to the ground and lay
the eggs that will hatch into tick larvae the following summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wherever the deer are in the fall,'' Ostfeld says, ``that's
where the larval ticks will hatch the next summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, white-footed mice are also enjoying the acorn boom.
The mice, almost 100 percent of which are infected with Lyme from
previous tick encounters, spend the autumn munching acorns and
storing reserves to get them through the winter.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the tick larvae hatch that next August, the forest
is crawling with mice, Ostfeld says. ``Ticks get it from mice, mice
get it from ticks _ they pass it back and forth. Which came first,
nobody knows,'' Ostfeld says.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear, though, is that by the next June or July, two
years after the mast year, there are a lot of 1-year-old ticks, or
nymphs, in oak forests, and they stand an excellent chance of being
infected.
</P>
<P>
   That's worrisome because nymphs pose the greatest danger to
people. Nymphs feed during June and July, months when people tend
to spend time outdoors; adult ticks feed in the fall. And unlike
the adult tick, which is generally easy to spot and remove before
it transmits bacteria into the blood, the nymph tick is so tiny
(the size of a poppy seed) that it often escapes detection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1994 was a really good acorn year,'' Ostfeld says, ``we
predicted there would be lots of larvae and mice in 1995, and lots
of infected nymphs in 1996. It came true: 1996 saw a substantially
higher number of Lyme case in humans. In Connecticut, reported
cases more than doubled, rising from 1,548 in 1995 to 3,104 in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ostfeld hopes to use the acorn count each year to predict when
and where nymph ticks are likely to feed two years later, offering
people another weapon in their Lyme prevention arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main means of protecting ourselves is still going to be
not putting ourselves at risk, and the way to do that is to figure
out when the ticks are out and where they are. I envision what I
call Smokey the Tick warning people about what parks are liable to
be particularly risky for Lyme,'' Ostfeld says.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their successes, researchers admit that Lyme is far
from beaten. To maintain immunity people will probably need annual
booster shots. That may prove too demanding for those unaccustomed
to regular doctor visits.
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible, in theory, that some people with a specific
genetic makeup could develop an adverse reaction, similar to
arthritis, to the antibodies the vaccine arouses.
</P>
<P>
   Even with these concerns, researchers generally agree that the
vaccine is a major advance for people living in places where there
are lots of infected ticks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THWARTING TICKS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Because the new Lyme vaccine is not 100 percent effective, the
best defense against the disease remains a good offense. Avoid
woody, overgrown or grassy areas. And if you're hiking, stay on the
trail, tuck your pants into your socks and wear light-colored
clothing to make ticks visible.
</P>
<P>
   Spraying your pants and shoes with an insect repellent
containing DEET helps, too. Avoid spraying face and hands, because
DEET is toxic.
</P>
<P>
   Daily tick checks are a must. Nymphal ticks are tiny, and they
like moist areas, so look in spots like the groin, navel, and
behind the knees.

<P>
   Trolling 50 miles off Cape Cod, charterboat captain Cookie
Murray glances aft, eyeing the nylon lines trailing in the wake.
Then he turns to the depth meter to see if anything is swimming
underneath the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at 2:45 p.m., a line on one of the baited poles at the
stern pops. Fisherman Everett Petronio leaps into the fighting
chair. This is the last day of the bluefin tuna season, and the
right bluefin could bring in tens of thousands of dollars in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The bluefin takes off and Petronio responds, cranking countless
circles with his right hand, bracing the pole with his left. The
struggle seems impossible, endless. Yet it is repeated thousands of
times a year on deep-sea fishing boats all along the United States
coasts.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing unusual is that a biologist, Molly Lutcavage, an
athletic woman in her early 40s, is on board. While Petronio fights
with his catch, Lutcavage is methodically attaching a massive dart
to the end of a hammer.
</P>
<P>
   The bluefin begins to tire, floating toward the surface. The
fish is beautiful, with opalescent skin. It is also gargantuan: 7.5
feet long and 400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   First mate Anthony Mendillo pulls the exhausted but thrashing
fish over to the side of the hull. Second mate Delmer Bacelis
swings the hammer and _ bang! _ implants the dart behind the rear
dorsal fin of the bluefin.
</P>
<P>
   Bacelis works the hook out of the fish and everyone leaps back.
The bluefin rights and swims away. The dart it carries is a
transmitter designed to record the tuna's journey for the next six
or seven months.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the great value of bluefin, biologists know little about
them. Except that the bluefin is a remarkable swimming machine and
can hold on to its body heat even in icy North Atlantic waters.
</P>
<P>
   A bluefin can go 20 miles an hour; rushing through the sea it
can build massive amounts of muscle in a short time. With a life
expectancy of more than 30 years, the fish can grow to well over 10
feet long and reach a weight of more than 1,400 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, size and speed have proved to be little
protection. As Japan grew more affluent in the 1980s, the price for
bluefin tuna skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators tried to control the fishing frenzy that followed
with quotas, basing policies on the belief that there are two
distinct stocks of tuna: a western stock spawned in the Gulf of
Mexico, migrating along the U.S. coast and into Canadian waters,
and an eastern stock spawned in the Mediterranean Sea, migrating
along the European coast to northern waters.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 fishing for bluefin was so intense in Europe and the
Mediterranean that the quota was broken, with the catch reaching an
estimated 46,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
   If the stocks are distinct, the fortunes of one shouldn't mean
much to the other. But if that assumption is wrong, overfishing in
part of the Atlantic could threaten bluefin throughout the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   To know more, scientists developed an advanced tag to put on
bluefins. They are equipped with microprocessors and transmitters
in waterproof containers that float free from the fish. At a
programmed time, they bob to the surface and begin broadcasting
data.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage was one of the first biologists to put an advanced tag
on a bluefin. In 1993 she was hired by the New England Aquarium to
conduct an aerial survey of bluefin in the Gulf of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, there were calls to cut fishing quotas in half.
Environmentalists warned that the bluefin would soon be endangered,
while fishermen in New England claimed they saw increasing numbers
of bluefin.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage organized pilots to fly a survey off the coast of Cape
Cod. In their first year they photographed 4,984 fish in one day _
equal to about a quarter of the estimated western Atlantic stock.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, a pilot photographed a single school of
about 4,500 fish. Lutcavage's survey helped to forestall a quota
cut and to bring about a review by the National Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The academy concluded that the bluefin tuna population in the
western Atlantic had been stable since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage continued her aerial surveys until 1997. She also
tracked the fish with underwater microphones and learned that
bluefin make deep dives to the bottom at sunrise and sunset and
that after they are tagged they recover from the trauma quickly and
rejoin their schools.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1997 she began tagging tuna with light tags
weighing less than an ounce. Light tags don't slow tuna down, and
they can be built to resist the high water pressures of a deep
dive.
</P>
<P>
   But the data they transmit are limited. Once on a bluefin, the
tag starts logging the temperature once an hour. At the end of each
day the tag's computer averages the temperatures and stores the
figure. After 60 days of taking temperatures, the computer shuts
down and the tag floats free.
</P>
<P>
   The data _ when the tag surfaced, its location and the average
daily temperatures _ are transmitted to a weather satellite that
passes overhead every 102 minutes. Eventually, the data move as
e-mail to a scientist.
</P>
<P>
   The process of fully transmitting all the data collected by a
single tag takes two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Lutcavage programmed her tags to pop up between March and July
last year, the spawning season for tuna. The data suggest that
bluefin tagged off Cape Cod move out of New England waters after a
couple of weeks, probably crossing the warm Gulf Stream into the
cooler mid-Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   By the time spawning season came, the fish were all in a region
of the mid-Atlantic bounded by Bermuda on the west and the Azores
on the east. None of the tagged fish were in primary spawning
grounds during spawning time.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Block of Stanford, working off Cape Hatteras, N.C., has
started to work with an archival tag. Lodged in a fish's abdomen,
the tag measures not just water temperature, but also light, depth
and internal temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Two years into the archival program, the evidence shows that
bluefin tend to feed in the morning and bask in the sun in the
afternoon, that they spend most of their time in the upper water
layers but also make deep dives of more than 800 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the tags show the fish going to the mid-Atlantic
and not crossing. Block believes that bluefin have the capacity to
migrate distances that could take western bluefin into eastern
waters, but it's not clear if many actually make the trip.
</P>
<P>
   But the fishing season is over and with it the tagging season.
Now comes the wait. A tag must surface, a satellite must pass by, a
signal must be sent. Out there the true story of one of the ocean's
giants remains to be told.

 &HT;    HILLARY CLINTON URGES WOMEN TO SUPPORT GORE'S CANDIDACY

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton urged women to
support Vice President Al Gore's presidential bid Tuesday, giving
his campaign a jump start with a key Democratic constituency.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is an exceptional father and husband, a tireless advocate
for children and families, and he is my choice, and I hope your
choice, for the next president of the United States,'' Clinton said
at a Gore campaign rally.
</P>
<P>
   The rally included the release of 4,500 pledges of support from
prominent Democratic women around the country, including Sens.
Barbara Boxer of California and Patty Murray of Washington, 12
House members, Gov. Joan Finney of Kansas and former Gov. Ann
Richards of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, in his remarks, pledged to put women's health issues at
the top of his agenda and to fight for equal pay for equal work. He
also vowed to kill any Republican attempts to limit abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Gore called Mrs. Clinton ``a powerful role model'' and ``a
cherished friend.'' He made no mention of the fact that she is
considering running for the the U.S. Senate seat being vacated in
New York next year by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's wife, Tipper, alluded to Clinton's political
ambitions in her remarks to the crowd at the Mayflower Hotel. ``I
wish I had a chance this morning to endorse someone for some other
race,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, during a two-day visit to Texas last week, said he was
``excited'' about the prospect of Clinton running of the Senate in
New York while he is running for president. He said her candidacy
would motivate Democratic activists up and down the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary would only complement Gore and energize voters who
have not been very energized recently,'' said Stephanie Cohen of
Emily's List, a political action committee that raises money for
women Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Gore needs help with women, whose vote was crucial to Bill
Clinton's election in 1992 and re-election in 1996. A Pew Research
Center poll in April found that the ``gender gap'' that helped the
Clinton-Gore ticket in those elections is evaporating following the
past year's impeachment proceedings and the military conflict in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In Pew's hypothetical horse race, Gore lagged behind Texas Gov.
George W. Bush among women, 52-42 percent. By comparison, in 1996,
women preferred Bill Clinton over Bob Dole, 55-37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Hawkesworth, director of the Center for the American Woman
and Politics at Rutgers University, said the defection of women
from the Democratic Party was apparent in the 1998 congressional
election, with older women leading the way. ``There has been a
great deal of speculation that ethical concerns underlie this
defection,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Lichtman, a presidential historian at American University,
said a Senate campaign by Mrs. Clinton could ``keep all the Clinton
administration controversies alive'' and ``make the emergence of
Gore as his own man more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, as a consequence, Gore has sought to distance himself
from the sexual scandals of the Clinton presidency by frequently
citing his 29 years of faithful marriage, his four children and the
expected birth of his first grandchild at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's rally, as he does in most campaign appearances, he
referred to Tipper as ``my very best friend and lifelong love.'' He
said she has ``taught me the meaning of a strong, loving
partnership that lasts for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Gore's lone opponent for
the 2000 Democratic nomination, has a breakfast fund-raiser
scheduled Wednesday with women supporters. The speaker is author
and former journalist Anna Quindlen, who will endorse Bradley.

George W. Bush among women, 52-42 percent. By comparison, in 1996,
women preferred Bill Clinton over Bob Dole, 55-37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Hawkesworth, director of the Center for the American Woman
and Politics at Rutgers University, said the defection of women
from the Democratic Party was apparent in the 1998 congressional
election, with older women leading the way. ``There has been a
great deal of speculation that ethical concerns underlie this
defection,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Lichtman, a presidential historian at American University,
said a Senate campaign by Mrs. Clinton could ``keep all the Clinton
administration controversies alive'' and ``make the emergence of
Gore as his own man more difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, as a consequence, Gore has sought to distance himself
from the sexual scandals of the Clinton presidency by frequently
citing his 29 years of faithful marriage, his four children and the
expected birth of his first grandchild at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's rally, as he does in most campaign appearances, he
referred to Tipper as ``my very best friend and lifelong love.'' He
said she has ``taught me the meaning of a strong, loving
partnership that lasts for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, Gore's lone opponent for
the 2000 Democratic nomination, has a breakfast fund-raiser
scheduled Wednesday with women supporters. The speaker is author
and former journalist Anna Quindlen, who will endorse Bradley.

THE SAGA OF SOPHIE'S BREAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Thank goodness there'll always be an England. Lacking a
monarchy of our own, where else could we get such vicarious
thrills?
</P>
<P>
   British politicians were tending to business last week as usual:
Parliament erupted in a furor over welfare reform, Prime Minister
Tony Blair stuck his neck out again to press for continued NATO
bombing of the Serbs, the Welsh opened their experimental new
assembly and Queen Elizabeth blessed the fabulous annual Chelsea
garden show.
</P>
<P>
   But the big news that gripped the public was the naked right
breast of Prince Edward's fiancee, Sophie Rhys-Jones, and the giant
press dust-up it produced.
</P>
<P>
   Here in America we like to snoop into the private lives of the
rich and famous every bit as much as the British, but we don't have
the flair they do for being nosy amid dramatic hair-pulling and
theatrical whining and wailing.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky was a long-running sexy American distraction,
yet our reaction to her tawdry little affair with President Clinton
was to despise her and try to fire him. Too serious. No fun in
that.
</P>
<P>
   But with her exposed bosom Sophie, 34, has suddenly replaced the
late Diana as a glamorous, wronged royal (she will shortly become
one when she marries Queen Elizabeth's youngest son on June 19.)
Her new role is enhanced by the fact that her betrayer, former
colleague Kara Noble, is a satisfactorily nasty villain in the
tradition of Linda Tripp. Now this is the stuff of great gossip.
</P>
<P>
   The London Sun, an irrepressible and irresponsible tabloid,
printed an 11-year-old snapshot of Sophie giggling in the back seat
of a car after a male colleague pulled up her bikini top to expose
her breast. Noble, who snapped the picture, was said to be jealous
of Sophie for hitting the marital jackpot. In a fury because she
was not invited to the wedding, Noble sold the photo to the Sun for
an estimated $165,000.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next was a verbal hurricane, British style.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusually tart response, the palace condemned the
publication of the picture as ``premeditated cruelty'' and
threatened to haul the Sun before the independent Press Complaints
Commission. The radio station for which Noble worked summarily
sacked her. The Daily Record called Noble a ``female Judas'' whose
lucre was ``filthily and foully earned.''
</P>
<P>
   London's other newspapers also weighed in angrily, attacking the
Sun for committing what they called an inexcusable atrocity against
a happy bride-to-be. Newspapers in Germany, Belgium, Italy and
Holland ran excitable stories hyping the incident and thoughtfully
reproducing the offending picture so their readers could see what
the fuss was all about.
</P>
<P>
   Here in America, however, public reaction was relatively tame.
We have seen half-naked women before. And we have yet to be
captivated by the fair Sophie, clothed or not.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Ferguson, the estranged wife of Prince Andrew, once
titillated us with that beau who kissed her toes, but now she is a
matronly shill for diet products and a tad boring. It is still up
to Prince Charles and his longtime love Camilla Parker Bowles to
feed basic public curiosity about the royals. And the fun couple
didn't fail us last week; Camilla's son Tom Parker Bowles was
caught using drugs, for which he was supposedly upbraided by
Charles.
</P>
<P>
   But the London newspapers worked themselves into a frenzy over
Sophie's bare breast because after Diana's death press honchos had
piously promised to lay off the royals and treat them with more
respect. The bad tabloid days were supposed to be over. Even David
Yelland, the Sun editor, had observed that the game of harassment,
misrepresentation and invasion of privacy that the press had played
with Diana went too far.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's outcry drove the Sun to apologize for publishing the
picture, trying to grovel its way out of trouble by admitting a
mistake. But the Daily Telegraph harrumphed that the apology was
nothing but an insincere ``preemptive cringe'' designed to get
Buckingham Palace to withdraw its official complaint. (So far, the
Palace is sticking to its guns.)
</P>
<P>
   A major rival, the Mirror, ran a front page headline over
Yelland's picture asking, ``Is this the most stupid man in
Britain?'' The Daily Record went the Mirror one better by asking,
``Is this the most cruel man in Britain?''
</P>
<P>
   The Times sniffed, ``Sorry doesn't quite fit the bill.''
</P>
<P>
   The backlash even reached the Sun's reclusive owner. ``What is
it with Rupert Murdoch?'' the Telegraph asked sarcastically, noting
that the 68-year-old publisher had asked his peers to avoid
``intrusive publicity'' about his own marriage breakup and romance
with a 31-year-old woman. ``Yet his papers offer no mercy to other
members of the human race,'' the Telegraph complained.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this furor was undoubtedly born of genuine sympathy for
the humiliated Sophie. But it is not irrelevant that London's many
newspapers are engaged in an intense circulation war, trying every
twist and turn to win readers. In America, most cities support only
one or two newspapers. But in London newspapers breed like rabbits.
</P>
<P>
   It's a media jungle out there. Being polite doesn't sell
newspapers, particularly tabloids. Screaming and hollering do.

THERE'S POETIC JUSTICE IN RUSSIANS' RUSH TO CELEBRATE PUSHKIN'S
BICENTENARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: The first two lines should be set as poetry.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Not all of me is dust. Within my song,
</P>
<P>
   safe from the worm, my spirit will survive.
</P>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ With days to go before the 200th anniversary of the
birth of Russia's greatest and most beloved poet, it is a wonder
that Russians are not sick of Alexander Pushkin.
</P>
<P>
   Take Moscow, the city of his birth. Every other billboard
carries a picture of his puckish face or sloping profile,
accompanied by his verse. Theaters and concert halls are running
back-to-back productions either of his works or of reworked
interpretations of his life.
</P>
<P>
   A national television program has been marking off the days
until the birth date itself, on Sunday, June 6. Newspapers and
magazines delve daily into his importance for Russia, its
literature, its culture, its troubled soul.
</P>
<P>
   But if there is one thing that Russians never tire of, it is
Pushkin, no matter how often his image has been used and abused: by
a czarist regime that glorified him as a loyal son of imperial
Russia, by a Stalinist system that cast him as an atheist and
rebel, and now by a crass commercialization that shamelessly puts
his name on everything from chocolates to vodka.
</P>
<P>
   There are some who fear that all this idolatry could kill
Russia's love for Pushkin, just as Boris Pasternak once wrote that
Vladimir Mayakovsky, the bard of the Russian Revolution, died a
second death when Stalin issued a decree declaring him Russia's
best poet.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly overkill is a danger. ``It always seems to us that by
accepting Alexander Sergeyevich into our company, we are bestowing
honor upon him, but my God, how vulgar all this makes him,'' wrote
the literary critic Stanislav Rassadin in a recent article, ``Our
Privatization of Pushkin.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pushkin is too much part of the national psyche to risk
displacement or debasement. By age 7, most Russian children already
know at least one of his poems by heart, not just because his verse
is part of the national curriculum but because it is so accessible,
so clear and so human that it slips effortlessly into memory, like
a child's prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love for Pushkin _ not so easy for foreigners _ is a genuine
sign of a person who is a bearer of Russian culture,'' Lydia
Ginzburg, a Russian philologist, wrote recently. ``Any other
Russian writer may be loved or not _ it is a matter of taste. But
Pushkin, as a phenomenon, is a must for us. Pushkin is the backbone
of Russian culture, holding together all the previous and
subsequent links. Remove the backbone _ all the links will
collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost, there are his writings, varied and
voluminous for one who died at 37, starting with the early
folkloric epics like ``Ruslan and Ludmilla,'' on through the
masterpiece of spurned love ``Eugene Onegin'' and in his later
years prose, like the novel ``The Captain's Daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is his life: the dashing young nobleman with African
lineage who, as with so many Russian writers, was toyed with by the
authorities and picked at by the censors, embraced one day by the
Czar, pushed into internal exile the next.
</P>
<P>
   Finally there is his death: a duel fought in the snow over the
honor of his beautiful, careless wife, then a lingering death scene
at his home in the imperial capital of St. Petersburg, with
mourners crowding the street outside, keeping vigil.
</P>
<P>
   Stripped of its old-world romance _ the balls, the country
estates, the gambling and that old Russian standby, aristocratic
ennui _ the story of Pushkin is one that has recurred again and
again in Russian history. The poet loved by the people (or at least
those who love poetry), feared by the authorities, is officially
adopted after death as a secular saint. It is a story line that
picks up again with figures like Anna Akhmatova, and in a more
populist vein Vladimir Visotsky, the actor-bard whose funeral in
1980 was a rare occasion when Soviet citizens could, by honoring a
poet, show their disdain for his tormentors.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Like Russian history, the Pushkin story has been pulled in
different directions by different rulers. ``The state model of
Pushkin was introduced in 1899, on the 100th anniversary,'' said
Sergei Fomichev, the resident Pushkin scholar at the Pushkin House
museum in Moscow (not to be confused with the memorial Pushkin
apartment or the Pushkin Museum of Fine Arts). ``Then it was
explained that he was a monarchist and a believer. In 1937, on the
100th anniversary of his death, the opposite model was given.''
</P>
<P>
   The year Stalin's great terror began, 1937, was an ominous one
for Russia and for its intelligentsia, whose members were killed,
exiled and sent to labor camps by the hundreds of thousands. It was
also the year that the communist authorities, with perverse timing,
laid claim to Pushkin by marking the 100th anniversary of his death
with a gala ceremony and with celebrations at his family estate in
the Pskov region.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the year of ``My Pushkin,'' the title of a poem by
Marina Tsvetayeva but also a way of signifying the many varied and
deeply private interpretations of the man and his works, kept safe
from the state's crude grasp.
</P>
<P>
   All this is enough to explain the extraordinary flood of
Pushkiniana that continues to pour through Russian publishing
houses into libraries and bookstores. Hundreds, maybe even
thousands, of books by and about Pushkin have been readied for this
year's anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is ``Pushkin's Hidden Love,'' a collection of
scholarly guesses about the identity of the woman, known in
Pushkin's notes only as ``N.N.,'' believed to have been his one
true and secret love.
</P>
<P>
   Also new is yet another piece of historical detective work about
the origins of the fateful duel with the man all Russians are
brought up to hate, the arrogant Frenchman Georges d'Anthes, who
never expressed regret for firing the fatal shot.
</P>
<P>
   It is a Russian tradition to celebrate jubilees; by neat
historical symmetry, this year also brought the 100th anniversary
of the birth of Vladimir Nabokov, a Russian-born writer whose works
were banned in his homeland during his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the advance warning, the celebrations of the Pushkin
bicentenary have the feel of a last-minute rush job, another
Russian tradition. Only in the last few weeks did work pick up for
the restoration of the lovely Church of the Ascension in Moscow,
where Pushkin married Natalya Goncharova in 1831. With the city's
gala celebrations just days away, the churchyard is still full of
building materials.
</P>
<P>
   At Pushkinskiye Gory, the town in Pskov where Pushkin lived
alone and in exile from 1824 to 1826 and lies buried at the
Svyatgorsky monastery, the authorities are bracing for hundreds of
thousands of visitors during the official ceremonies. Both
President Boris Yeltsin and Aleksy II, the patriarch of the Russian
Orthodox Church, are expected.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the flow of visitors to the ``Pushkin Places,'' a
trio of charming and surprisingly modest wooden houses typical of
the early-19th-century Russian gentry, peaked at 600,000 a year.
(There is Mikhailovskoye, where Pushkin lived; Trigorskoye, the
home of his friends and neighbors, the Osipov-Wulfs, and
Petrovskoye, built by the son of Hannibal, Pushkin's maternal
great-grandfather, the Ethiopian prince who was adopted and brought
to Russia by Peter the Great.) Since the collapse of the communist
system, which had organized tourism, the numbers have plunged to
about 100,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle to preserve the Pushkin legacy while making it
appealing to a more worldly Russian tourist is a challenge that the
directors of the Pushkin sites share with the country as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $5 million allocated this year for the restoration of the
various estates, one-quarter had to be spent fixing up a museum
built in the center of town to handle the overflow of Pushkin
pilgrims. It looks more like a North Korean mausoleum than a shrine
to a 19th-century Russian poet, and, seven years after its
completion it is already falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the money has gone toward restoring the three
estates (one of them is still closed) and their surrounding parks
to a pristine state that elicits a shudder from Pushkin purists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The park was never so tidy as it is now,'' said Fomichev.
``They cleared away everything. It looks good. But so many trees
have been cut down.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pushkinskiye Gory museum-park's director, Georgi Vasilevich,
stands his ground, noting that the buildings have been destroyed
and rebuilt several times since Pushkin's time, during the
revolution and again during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   That anything was preserved at all, he said, is due only to
Russia's reverence for its dead poets.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the revolution the estates of the Russian gentry were of
no interest to anyone, and many were destroyed,'' he said. ``It was
only because of names like Pushkin, Tolstoy, Chekhov and Turgenev
that that part of our history was saved for us.''

`PARIS TRANCE': OLD BLISS, IN A NEW ARRONDISSEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By RICHARD EDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Centuries ago, it was politic for authors to begin with a note
to their public or patron disclaiming the virtues of their story.
Our post-modern equivalent is to disclaim its reality. Thus the
title of Geoff Dyer's novel: ``Paris Trance'' instead of
``France.''
</P>
<P>
   Dyer, a wickedly accomplished young Englishman, came out last
year with a book about self-consciousness and the impossibility of
writing, or even, if you look closely, of living. Naturally, the
book, ``Out of Sheer Rage'' was both well-written and lively. It
also did protest too much. Dyer wrote like a solipsist dragged to a
party he knows he is going to be the life of once he stops kicking
and screaming.
</P>
<P>
   Among those books that his book found impossible to write was a
novel about young expatriates in Paris. Now he has written it,
announcing at the start that his finely recognizable Paris is not
the real one. He also tells us that his protagonist, a young
Werther with a short shelf life, has found it impossible to write a
novel about young Parisian expatriates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trance'' recounts the year or so that two pairs of lovers,
Luke and Nicole and Alex and Sahra, spend in blissful camaraderie
of the we-were-young-together-in-Paris genre. Dyer brings it up to
date.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, there is the economics. His novel is an early
specimen of what you might call European Community fiction. Luke,
the vaguely intending writer, and Alex are British and need no
papers to get laboring jobs in a book warehouse. Nicole, a Yugoslav
immigrant, and Sahra, an American, are employed more formally: the
first as a secretary, the second as an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   For another (the novel as rolling gentrification), young
expatriate bliss has relocated from successively romantic and
subsequently unaffordable literary neighborhoods to the 11th
arrondissement, out east. Finally, in the blithe mix of
cafe-hopping, free-form talk, moviegoing, wine, drugs and sex, the
sex and drugs are more insistently detailed than they used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paris Trance'' is up-to-date social comedy with an implicit
minatory shadow. The comedy, for the most part, is brilliantly
handled. The doomy implicitness _ as if Don Giovanni's Commendatore
had sent an e-mail message instead of arriving by statue _ is
hesitant and self-conscious.
</P>
<P>
   Dyer, depicting a culture that is divorced from consequences and
suffers the consequences of the divorce, voices his theme too
abstractly. He locates but does not quite deliver the ``lost'' of
his contemporary lost generation.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, though, everything is exuberantly found. The author
evolves a wonderfully aimless routine of late-century lotus-eating
for his characters, none of whom have any particular reason for
being in Paris stronger than the need to be away from some
particular other place.
</P>
<P>
   The aimlessness makes the pace rather desultory; for a while,
interest lies mainly in the author's clever writing and
generational and social detail. ``Together they gave off a double
helping of solitude,'' he observes of two young men who, knowing
nobody else at a party, talk to each other.
</P>
<P>
   The encounters of Luke with Nicole and Alex with Sahra provide
the book's most infectious energy. Dyer writes splendid courtship
riffs of two different kinds. Luke meets Nicole casually as she
strolls past a lunchtime soccer game he is playing.
</P>
<P>
   On their first date, they cross and re-cross the nighttime
Seine, spinning a comically disjointed series of conversational
fantasies while quietly checking each other out. Whimsy provides
cover as the erotic charge builds and (never mind how, but a stray
dog is responsible) discharges.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Luke and Nicole, who fall into bed that same evening and
are instantly inseparable, Alex and Sahra conduct a canny series of
advances and retreats. Alex has the original notion of bringing his
friends along the first time they go out.
</P>
<P>
   In the bouncy and zigzag evening that ensues, the future couple
are able to observe and maneuver free of the metered confidences
and probings of a one-to-one date. The detours are severe as well
as comic; when the two finally come together after no little
suspense, there is a sense less of spectacular passion than quieter
necessity.
</P>
<P>
   For a year or so the foursome makes playful use of France and
the quite bearable lightness of late-century, pre-Kosovo Europe.
Also of their own youth, erotic and intellectual fizz, and the
lightening of a single couple's emotional burdens when there are
two couples to shift them.
</P>
<P>
   Dyer is a genial revels-master of meals, games (they vie to
recite by heart every film, cinema and showtime listed in
Pariscope), trips to the country and great swirling loops of talk.
He is also a virtuoso with graphic sex and its shortfalls. Not that
there is not authentic feeling, but that the feeling is somehow
unlived and unearned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paris Trance'' is a fictional neutron bomb: places, things,
pastimes, even emotions remain standing; it is the people who are
gone. The point of Dyer's book and the problem with it are the
same: both lodge in that ``Trance.'' For his post-modern European
young, and perhaps for a wider Western culture, ugly reality has
been tamed and dissipated to the point where it has lost governance
of the perceptions. The playground world is not a world.
</P>
<P>
   In his attempt to suggest this, the adept Dyer loses hold in a
number of ways. For one thing, he separates Luke, as advocate of
pure sensation, from the other three, who recede into various kinds
of reality. The author is trying to assert this reality, but it
seems uncongenial; as a result we get little sense of it other than
being told about it.
</P>
<P>
   The telling device is faulty. One of the four is narrator as
well as character, and the author makes an irritating mystery of
who it is, though we easily guess. More seriously there is an
unsustainable grandiloquence as this narrator awkwardly drops
cautionary notes into his account of the revels, alternates them
with bursts of glorifying Luke, and finally recounts the ruin he
has come to. Beautiful and damned, in other words: the culture as
well as the individual.
</P>
<P>
   Only _ and it is a very big ``only'' _ we haven't seen Luke as
especially more beautiful than the others; and when the damning
comes it is trivial. This miniaturized Werther, his romantic
illusion shattered, accomplishes his fate with no more than the
equivalent of a popgun.
</P>
<P>
   An intended generational message, but intentions aren't fiction
and in ``Paris Trance'' they go awkwardly with the accomplished
social comedy that is.

   Anyone who has visited Les Crayeres, the Michelin three-star
restaurant and hotel in Reims, France, has seen the ornate
buildings of the house of Pommery, just across the street. Louise
Pommery, one of the famous Champagne widows, put the company on the

</P>

   Some years ago, the house went through a rough period, and the

   WASHINGTON _ An alliance of conservatives and liberals asked
presidential contenders Tuesday to oppose a move doubling the
salary of the job they are seeking.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president suffers no real privations,'' said a letter that
asked the candidates how they stand on a congressional effort to
increase the pay to $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you know,'' it continued, ``the President currently enjoys
a salary of $200,000 per year, with perquisites, a $50,000 expense
allowance, living expense benefits that befit a king, plus a near
certain prospect, if desired, of becoming a multimillionaire upon
leaving office.''
</P>
<P>
   Signers of the letter included liberals such as consumer
activist Ralph Nader and the environmentalist Green Party, as well
as conservative leader Paul Weyrich of the Free Congress
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   A House subcommittee last month, with little public notice,
added a provision to a spending bill to increase the salary of the
next president when he or she takes office in 2001. Some public
interest groups and former presidential aides have advocated the
pay hike, which would be the first in 30 years for the chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   However, opponents charge that the salary boost for the
president is a disguised effort to increase pay for many senior
officials. As long as the president's salary is held to its current
level, it ``acts as a cap on the salaries of Members of Congress
and federal judges,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-pay raise coalition sent their letter to 11 of the top
presidential contenders, with the exception of former Red Cross
chief Elizabeth Dole, who has already denounced the pay increase.
</P>
<P>
   In the first responses, Lamar Alexander declined to take a
position. ``I should not help to set the salary I will receive as
president,'' said the third-time Republican candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign of Republican magazine mogul Steve Forbes, whose
personal fortune is bankrolling his campaign, issued a one-line
statement that he is ``opposed to the presidential pay increase.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole, a Republican hopeful, sent a letter last week to House
Speaker Dennis Hastert calling the proposal ``ill-advised'' and
saying that she will urge its defeat in the full House. The
``perks'' of the presidency such as a Camp David weekend retreat, a
bowling alley, a putting green, and movie theaters add up to
millions of dollars in value, Dole wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Other candidates had no immediate response to the letter.

`PHANTOM MENACE' IS LATEST TO RELY ON COMPUTER-GENERATED IMAGERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KEAY DAVIDSON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Alien spaceships fire laser blasts amidst
hurtling asteroids; a dinosaur stomps through New York City,
crushing skyscrapers, yuppies and taxis; a luxury liner rams an
iceberg and slowly sinks into a haunting North Atlantic abyss.
</P>
<P>
   And it looks real _ as real as a National Geographic documentary
_ to popcorn-munching movie-goers who pack the multiplexes to see
the latest action flicks using computer-generated imagery, or CGI.
</P>
<P>
   Computers have revolutionized filmmaking in the six summers
since audiences first gasped at the dinosaurs IN ``Jurassic Park.''
These slithering, ravenous, building-sized critters looked real _
more real, some critics sneered, than the human characters they
tried to munch.
</P>
<P>
   Today, viewers are flocking to the latest CGI-driven film, ``The
Phantom Menace,'' the fourth installment in filmmaker George Lucas'
``Star Wars'' series.
</P>
<P>
   In filmmaking, more and more of the film is made of digital
``backlots'' and ``sets,'' says Christian Rouet, senior technology
officer at Industrial Light &AMP; Magic, Lucas' CGI firm in San Rafael,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of delivering their lines and movements on a sound
stage, actors increasingly emote in front of a ``blue screen'' _
literally, a blue screen _ onto which the sets, spaceships,
dinosaurs, aliens, tornadoes, tsunamis, volcanoes or whatever are
later digitally ``painted.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, in ``Phantom Menace,'' Liam Neeson, Natalie Portman
and the other actors spend much of their time talking to, fighting
with or running away from characters who are not really ``there'' _
not, that is, until they're painted onto a digitized screen by a
computer artist.
</P>
<P>
   The amphibious alien Jar Jar Binks owes his existence to a
radical digital mutation of actor Ahmed Best's performance.
</P>
<P>
   With a computer, ``You can create entire worlds. You can take a
city street and add buildings and add crowds or add monuments. You
can change the weather,'' says Ron Kutak of the International
Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees in Los Angeles, which is
pushing to unionize CGI workers.
</P>
<P>
   All is not well in the CGI world, though.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, CGI is apparently here to stay. It isn't just a
short-lived Hollywood gimmick like Sensurround, Smell-O-Vision and
3-D eyeglasses.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, CGI hasn't lived up to all of its
expectations. Contrary to prophecies in the early 1990s, CGI hasn't
cut filmmaking costs by replacing expensive sets with digitally
generated images. Rather, movie making costs have soared _ in part,
ironically, because of the high cost of CGI itself.
</P>
<P>
   While filmmakers seriously underestimated the costs of CGI, the
technology isn't entirely to blame. Movies with $100 million-plus
budgets are no longer uncommon. ``Titanic,'' which relies heavily
on CGI, reportedly cost $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Pixar Animation Studios of Richmond, Calif., said its
first-quarter profits had plunged 76 percent, despite its highly
profitable, all-computerized movie ``A Bug's Life.''
</P>
<P>
   The bigger they are, the harder they fall: The heavy reliance on
costly CGI means filmmakers risk losing everything _ perhaps entire
studios _ by sinking fortunes into big, special effects-driven
films. Hence, they launch marketing campaigns so aggressive _ like
that of ``The Phantom Menace'' _ that they risk irritating
audiences before the movie even comes out.
</P>
<P>

<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, just before the financial flop of the CGI-generated
thriller ``Godzilla,'' CGI leaders warned filmmakers about
over-relying on special effects.
</P>
<P>
   A good story is essential to a film, ``which is something they
seem to have forgotten,'' Steve Ross, a top executive at CGI firm
Digital Domain, warned at an industry conference in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Flustered by the ``Godzilla'' embarrassment, some studios have
cut back on CGI. Others have stopped contracting CGI work to
outside firms and, instead, are saving money by having the work
performed by in-house teams.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some independent CGI firms are laying off workers.
Kutak, who is executive director of Local 700 of IATSE _ the
Editors Guild for film editors _ expects the layoffs to make it
easier to unionize CGI workers.
</P>
<P>
   Many CGI workers haven't been interested in joining a union
until recently because most tended to be computer-savvy young
people who, because of their age, ``don't think about medical
benefits, pension etc.,'' observes Cate Bangs, a TV and film
production designer who is also president of Local 847 of IATSE in
Sherman Oaks, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Kutak says that although CGI is here to stay and has replaced
traditional filmmaking technologies, for now the business is a
``very low-profit business . . . because it's competitively bid.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another union issue is the possibility that filmmakers might
begin using digitally generated ``actors.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Rouet's many goals is to create digitized ``actors'' as
real-looking and believable as humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good actors have the ability to really go into a character and
be so touching and expressive,'' Rouet says. ''We want to achieve
exactly the same thing with digital characters.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, TV advertisers began using digital techniques
to portray dead actors such as Fred Astaire and John Wayne. Union
officials want to be sure filmmakers don't digitally reproduce an
actor's face without payment, according to Rafe Greenlee of the
Screen Actors Guild in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Digitized filmmaking raises aesthetic concerns as well.
</P>
<P>
   Having to act in front of something that isn't there is tough on
actors, acknowledges Stan Winston, who co-founded one of the
leading CGI firms, Digital Domain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you talk to the greatest actors, 50 percent of a
performance is reacting: An actor gives his best performance when
he is acting against another great actor,'' says Winston, who works
in Van Nuys, Calif. ``Now, take the actor away and give the actor
no one to act with, (and) you do not have the possibility of the
strongest performance.''
</P>
<P>
   The real cinematic revolution might come when computerized
filmmaking allows every personal computer user to be his or her own
``director'' _ to make an entire movie just by pointing and
clicking a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Rouet envisions the day when CGI will be so cheap that ordinary
people can create their own movies, complete with sets and
``actors,'' on a tabletop personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very clear,'' Rouet says, ``that the (computer)
technology is going to become affordable at some point.''

CAKE-UPMANSHIP IS HERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MONIQUE P. YAZIGI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When a woman walked into Magnificent Confections a
few weeks ago, she wanted a simple cake for her son's 30th
birthday. But by the end of her visit, she had ordered a white
sculptured elephant, with its trunk turned up, dressed with jewelry
made of shiny gold dragees. Every day she called up to add more
details.
</P>
<P>
   By the end, the elephant was standing on four tiers, wearing a
hat and earrings and covered with an intricately patterned blanket.
</P>
<P>
   ``She got obsessed,'' said Lege Sulit, a co-owner of the tiny
bakery in Manhattan. But in New York today, she isn't alone in her
obsession. The party cake has become an over-the-top symbol of
creativity and, some would say, competitive excess.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the city's bakeries are beginning to look like little
jewelry stores _ the ones where most of the good jewels are kept in
the back vault.
</P>
<P>
   Prices are jewel-like, too. A very basic, tiny cake for four
not-very-hungry people costs at least $30. Ms. Sulit's elephant
cake was $600. And it is not at all unusual for elaborate,
hand-sculptured creations to cost thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Dimitri Pauli, an owner of Sant Ambroeus, a chic baker on
Madison Avenue and in Southampton, N.Y., said that three weeks ago
a customer ordered a three-dimensional Corvette convertible sponge
cake, filled with white and dark chocolate, covered with almond
paste and painted metallic blue with a silver tone. It was 40
inches long and 16 inches wide, served 100 and cost $2,220.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a competition going on,'' Pauli said. ``It feels like
in the past year everyone is trying to top everyone else. They want
to create the more extravagant cake. They want people to say
`Ah.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bakers like him and Ms. Sulit are the beneficiaries. In Ms.
Sulit's 450-square-foot storefront, business has gone up 300
percent to 400 percent this year. ``Eighty-five percent of our
business is from custom couture cakes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that the cake is returning to the pedestal it once
inhabited. In the 16th century, sugar was an expensive indulgence
for the upper class, and cakes were ``a luxury, used for festive
meals only for the wealthy,'' said Barbara Wheaton, a culinary
historian and author.
</P>
<P>
   By the 18th century, Ms. Wheaton said, cakes were being made
into wonderful architectural fantasies that were not meant to be
eaten. They were pure symbols of wealth and class _ the more
intricate, the higher the status of the host.
</P>
<P>
   Pauli said his customers do research, identifying the most
exclusive bakeries, and demand two things: everything on the cake
must look real, and everything on the cake must be edible. After
that, anything goes.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few weeks, bakers have produced cakes in the
shapes of a horse and rider (the rider having been thrown from the
horse, to recreate an embarrassing incident), a cell phone,
portraits in marzipan, an ornate vase of flowers and the head of
the birthday boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they were at a party and they saw the box-of-cigars
cake,'' said Bill Schutz, the owner of Creative Cakes in Manhattan,
``and they say, `The cake was fabulous _ I have to have a better
one.' Better and different.''
</P>
<P>
   At Creative Cakes, a place known for its sculptured chocolate
fudge cakes, customers having a party for 50 tend to order cake to
serve 100. ``So it's more impressive,'' said Schutz, whose cakes
start at $200.
</P>
<P>
   When Debra Ellenoff recently decided to give a party for her
best friend, she chose the location, set the guest list and ordered
the invitations within hours. The bulk of her time, in planning the
party, was spent finding the right cake.
</P>
<P>
   To tell the tale, Ms. Ellenoff, who lives in Manhattan, pulled
out pages full of cake notes: best chocolate cake; who makes good
edible sculptures; where do the people at Grace's Marketplace
recommend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted it to be great,'' Ms. Ellenoff said. She spent weeks
on the search.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ellenoff's personal statement took the form of a white
sponge cake, filled with chocolate mousse and frosted with a
mixture of sugar paste, blue and white, mixed with gum arabic from
the acacia tree, to give it elasticity.
</P>
<P>
   The cake looked like a picnic table, set with edible spoons and
covered with a checkered tablecloth that looked as if it were made
out of real fabric. Guests oohed and ahed, and ate every piece. But
at many parties, eating is not always the point.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, Ms. Sulit and her partner, Rudolfo Melchor,
spent more than a week making a 5-foot-4-inch cake for a going away
party for Charles D. Peebler Jr., who was leaving his post as
president of True North Communications. The price: $3,200.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never had any intention of eating it,'' Ms. Sulit said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sulit, a former florist, and Melchor, a former sculptor,
spent days making perfect cubes out of vanilla chiffon filled with
white chocolate mousse resembling gift boxes stacked on top of each
other, sitting in a bed of sugar flowers. They spent hours
sculpturing blue bows around the buttercream-covered boxes.
</P>
<P>
   For dessert, Ms. Sulit said, the guests were served some plated
dessert.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cake was only for cutting,'' she said sadly. ``Oh yes, and
for the picture.''

   DISABLED-COMPUTERS _ GAINESVILLE, Ga. _ Tony Perrone of
Gainesville lost the use of his legs in 1986 when a jack under a
truck he was working on broke. He had been a network administrator
for an international company. When he recovered, he still had his
knowledge of computers, but found companies unwilling to give him a

they're so caught up in the ongoing fascination with things

'Stang is visually comparable to a pyramid. Those Egyptian
pyramids, they should remember, have been stuck, immovable and

TRAINING ANIMALS A CLICK AT A TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Pet owners who have attempted to train their
animals know the frustration of trying to communicate and to judge
how quickly a pet learns. But clicker training, which uses sounds
and positive reinforcement, offers some hope.
</P>
<P>
   The method was originally developed by marine mammal trainers
for work with dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've ever seen the killer whale shows at Sea World,
you've seen clicker training in action,'' said Alexandra Kurland,
author of ``Clicker Training for your Horse'' ($24.95, Sunshine
Books, 1998) and a specialist in animal behavior. The resident of
Delmar, N.Y., owns horses and is an experienced rider, teacher and
trainer.
</P>
<P>
   The clicker method is among those used to teach horses the
proper carriage for dressage, a special type of riding that
requires the horse to maneuver and perform difficult steps
controlled by slight movements of the rider.
</P>
<P>
   The clicker method takes its name from the acoustical toy
clickers used by some trainers to signal a positive answer to the
animal. Others use vocal signals such as a click or cluck with the
tongue or snap of the fingers. The sound means that the animal has
earned a reward: a chance to try again, a small piece of kibble, a
pat or voice response of ``good boy'' or ``good girl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clicker training represents a radical departure from many
traditional training methods that are often based on physical force
and punishment,'' Kurland said. She has also studied round-pen
training with John Lyons, an advocate of nonviolent training, and
is a graduate and teacher of Linda Tellingham-Jones' Touch, a
system of using manual contact to improve physical and behavioral
problems in horses.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kurland, clicker training is very forgiving, using
positive reinforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your horse is always alert, waiting for the click and trying
to figure out what is it that it has to do to earn this
reinforcement,'' Kurland said. She said children, too, can learn to
clicker train their pets.
</P>
<P>
   The method also works with llamas, dogs, goldfish, iguanas,
hamsters, goats, chickens, parrots and cats, according to Kurland.
``Cats naturally target,'' she said. ``Anyone who has ever played
with a cat knows this. My target-trained cats follow me everywhere
I go around the house, and they come instantly when they're
called.''
</P>
<P>
   The author said that she started clicker training in 1993 just
to amuse herself and her horse, but quickly found that the two were
learning to communicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start out in clicker training, never start with your
goal,'' she said. ``With clicker training, you are always creating
comfort zones for your animal with this bridging signal that links
a desired behavior to a reward.''
</P>
<P>
   The signal and reward have to be timed so the animal associates
the goal and the treat. A delay will only confuse the animal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can give your horse important information just by changing
your treat,'' said Kurland, who gives her horses peppermints for
special behavior. ``Jackpot! When that mint comes out, they know
they have done something particularly wonderful and will make an
extra effort the next time.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurland recommends the following steps for introducing a horse
to the clicker:
</P>
<P>
   Start by teaching it to touch any safe target, such as a very
small orange lane-marking cone, a ball on a stick or a plastic lid.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, keep the horse in the stall with a stall guard
across the door so it can move around freely yet keep you safe if
it gets too excited. If treats make the horse rambunctious, don't
scold, simply step out of range.
</P>
<P>
   Begin target training by holding the cone or other object up in
front of the horse. When it sniffs the object, instantly click and
provide the treat. If the horse starts nudging you for treats while
you are offering the cone, step away. Let the horse explore and
think things through until it learns that going directly to the
vending machine _ you _ never earns a treat. The horse will soon
learn that it is in control and can make you click when it bumps
the cone, not when it sniffs your fingers, pushes or bumping you.
</P>
<P>
   Never demand behavior from your horse. Raise your standards in
small enough steps so that the horse continues to be successful.
Remember that horses learn at different rates and some may need
more intermediate steps than others.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your horse loses interest or seems confused, you may have
been asking for too much, too soon,'' Kurland said. ``Go back to a
point in the training where your horse can be successful and
rebuild form there.''
</P>
<P>
   Horses catch on to it pretty quickly, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kurland said that solving a horse's training problems can be
like unraveling the clues in a detective story.
</P>
<P>
   ``You keep following the threads until they bring you to the
core issues your horse or pet is facing,'' Kurland said. ``If you
let them, they will take you to the most basic layers of training
that need work.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   VOZROZHDENIYE ISLAND, Uzbekistan _ In the spring of 1988, germ
scientists 850 miles east of Moscow were ordered to undertake their
most critical mission.
</P>
<P>
   Working in great haste and total secrecy, the scientists in the
city of Sverdlovsk transferred hundreds of tons of anthrax bacteria
_ enough to destroy the world many times over _ into giant
stainless-steel canisters, poured bleach into them to decontaminate
the deadly pink powder, packed the canisters onto a train two dozen
cars long and sent the illicit cargo almost a thousand miles across
Russia and Kazakhstan to this remote island in the heart of the
inland Aral Sea, American and Central Asian officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Here Russian soldiers dug huge pits and poured the sludge into
the ground, burying the germs and, Moscow hoped, a grave political
threat.
</P>
<P>
   While Mikhail S. Gorbachev was pressing his glasnost and
perestroika campaign and warming ties with the West, intelligence
evidence was mounting in Washington that the Soviet Union, contrary
to its treaty pledges, was producing tons of deadly germs for
weapons that the world had banned. The stockpile had to be
destroyed in case the United States and Britain demanded an
inspection, Russian scientists close to the program said.
</P>
<P>
   Vozrozhdeniye Island was a natural choice. Until the military
left here for good in 1992, Renaissance Island, as it translates
from the Russian, had been the Soviet Union's major open-air
testing site. Today, Renaissance Island, which the former Soviet
republics of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan now share, is the world's
largest anthrax burial ground.
</P>
<P>
   For the United States, it is an intelligence gold mine. At the
invitation of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, American military
scientists and intelligence experts have secretly been traveling
here for the past four years _ most recently last October _ to
survey the island and take samples of the buried bacteria,
according to senior Uzbek and American officials.
</P>
<P>
   What they have found is stunning, the experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Tests of soil samples from six of 11 vast burial pits show that,
although the anthrax was soaked in bleach at least twice, once
inside the 66-gallon containers and again after it was dumped into
the sandy pits and buried for a decade under 3-to-5 feet of sand,
some of the spores are still alive _ and potentially deadly.
</P>
<P>
   Tests on the samples performed by American military laboratories
have shown that the anthrax vaccine now being given, in six shots
and a yearly booster, to 2.4 million Americans in uniform is
effective against the Russian strain of this ancient, deadly
scourge _ at least the strain found on the island.
</P>
<P>
   While this has reassured the Clinton administration, the
discovery of live spores has alarmed Kazakhstan and especially
worries Uzbekistan, which has been exploring for oil on the
two-thirds of the island it controls.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Aral Sea is shrinking _ the result of wrongheaded
Soviet irrigation policies _ this now-deserted, isolated island has
grown from 77 square miles to 770 and will soon be connected to the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Uzbek and Kazakh experts fear the buried anthrax spores could
escape their sandy tomb, stirred up by carriers like gophers and
other rodents, lizards and birds, and be brought to Uzbek and
Kazakh territory. The disease is spread from animals to people by
direct contact; it is treatable with antibiotics if detected
immediately. As a weapon, it would be disbursed as an aerosol, for
inhalation.
</P>
<P>
   Central Asian and American officials fear that, as access to the
island eases, the buried anthrax could be used by terrorists to
make more of the deadly agent.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, officials said, exposure to the spores could add a
new threat to a population whose health is already considered
abysmal. International medical experts are just starting to assess
which of their many chronic ailments are attributable to poverty
and environmental degradation and which might be linked to the
region's biological and chemical legacy.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, which have both
renounced weapons of mass destruction, have independently asked the
United States for help in assessing, or cleaning up this terrible
biological legacy of Soviet rule. In addition, Uzbekistan permitted
this correspondent to visit Renaissance Island earlier this year _
the first visit by a journalist _ and to interview officials and
scientists concerned about the biological hazards here.
</P>
<P>
   The trip, coupled with interviews with about two dozen
scientists, government officials and military experts in Central
Asia, Russia and the United States, has shed light on one of the
most closely guarded biological secrets of the Cold War. Although
Russian President Boris Yeltsin issued an edict in 1992 closing the
site and vowing that the laboratory would be dismantled and
decontaminated within three years, the cash-strapped Moscow
government never followed through. And Russia has never
acknowledged responsibility for the anthrax cemetery here.
</P>
<P>
   Military scientists at the U.S. Army Medical Research and
Material Command and other laboratories where the samples are being
studied refused comment on the island and the tests. But other
officials said the labs were still deciphering the Russian
anthrax's molecular structure and trying to determine why spores
collected from some of the pits did not die.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always known that anthrax is hard to kill,'' said one
military expert, who would only discuss this highly classified
activity if he were not identified. ``But this strain has proven
especially durable, and this wasn't even the most powerful strains
the Soviets made.''

   Signs of life diminish as the Soviet-era MI-8 helicopter speeds
toward this island, a 90-minute flight from Nukus, the nearest
Uzbek military base. As the chopper approaches the island,
fishermen in their wooden boats disappear as what was once a living
sea becomes marshland. Scraggly trees give way to patches of
sagebrush until, finally, there is nothing left to see below save
salt-covered, cement-colored sand that the sea once covered, now as
dry and cracked as an ancient face. Nothing seems to live here, not
even birds.

   Given its remote location and inhospitable climate, the island
was long a favored Russian spot for secretive arrangements. A study
soon to be published by the Monterey Institute of International
Studies in California concludes that the island and the former port
city of Aralsk, now about 60 miles from the sea and part of
Kazakhstan, were first used by the KGB's predecessor as exile camps
for kulaks, the private farmers whom Stalin repressed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936, wrote Gulbarshyn Bozheyeva, the study's principle
author, Vozrozhdeniye and the city that administered the island
were placed under the Ministry of Defense, which in 1954 built a
biological weapons test site on the island, calling it Aralsk-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of vegetation,'' she wrote, ``hot and dry climate,
and sandy soil reaching 140 degrees Fahrenheit in summer'' were
perfect for germ testing in that they would ``reduce the spread and
survival of pathogenic organisms.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials said that although satellites recorded some
unusual activity on the island in 1988, the United States did not
learn that the Soviets had buried anthrax from Sverdlosk here until
1992, when Dr. Kanatjan Alibekov, or Ken Alibek, as he is now
known, a high-ranking germ weapons official, defected. Alibek had
been the director of the giant Soviet anthrax production plant at
Stepnogorsk, which is now in Kazakhstan. Between 1988 and his
defection, he was the deputy director of Biopreparat, the secret
network of some 40 supposedly peaceful facilities, including
Stepnogorsk, that provided civilian cover for bio-weapons work.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, ``Biohazard'' (Random House, 1999), Alibek does not
disclose either that anthrax was buried on the island or what he
told American officials during his debriefing. But he does report
that such germ weapons as tularemia, Q-fever, brucellosis, glanders
and plague were tested on Vozrozhdeniye beginning in the 1970s. In
1986 and 1987, he added in an interview, a strain of plague that
was resistant to standard antibiotics was tested. In 1987, the book
states, Alibek's scientists tested the powerful anthrax that he had
developed at Stepnogorsk.
</P>
<P>
   The Monterey study and Alibek say that the Soviet military labs
also tested typhus, botulinum toxin, Venezuelan equine
encephalitis, smallpox and microbial strains with characteristics
useful in warfare, such as high virulence, resistance to
ultraviolet rays or heat, and genetically engineered strains
developed in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Today, evidence of the grim research abounds. Clearly visible as
one approaches the vast laboratory complex and test range are the
telephone poles one kilometer apart on which detectors to measure
germ agents were mounted and to which animals were tied during
open-air testing.
</P>
<P>
   The abandoned laboratory and high-containment unit that once
handled the deadliest of agents have been stripped of equipment,
pipes and even their floor and wall-tiles _ shiny, light-green
mosaics decorated with a fish motif. What the Soviets left behind,
scavengers, apparently impervious to the potential danger of
contamination, have stripped away for sale, intelligence experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   The enclosed vivaria that once housed thousands of smaller
animals killed in the testing _ rabbits, guinea pigs, white mice
and hamsters, as well as such larger animals as horses, sheep,
donkeys, monkeys and baboons _ are empty, their windows smashed or
missing, their roofs collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of small cages are stacked together in a dilapidated
storage room; in another stands a human-sized cage, apparently for
what scientists call ``non-human primates,'' or man-sized monkeys.
Hundreds of them died hideous deaths, sometimes in a single
experiment, say Russian and American scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The stench of the laboratory is familiar to veterans of the
gruesome world of germ warfare _ a mixture of bleach, dust, animal
dung and death.
</P>
<P>
   On the northern part of the site, less than a mile from the
laboratory, are the three-story barracks, residential homes,
kindergarten, and cafeteria used by the Russians scientists who
worked here and their families, about a thousand people in all.
</P>
<P>
   Russian scientists who worked here said that most of the
children were not vaccinated against the agents that were tested
only a few miles downwind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't test unless the wind was blowing south, away from
the living quarters,'' said Dr. Gennadi L. Lepyoshkin, the former
Soviet colonel who was Stepnogorsk's director after Alibek and was
vaccinated against many of the lethal pathogens he tested.

<P>
   In a recent interview at Stepnogorsk, Lepyoshkin, who is now
director of Kazakhstan's peaceful National Center for Biotechnology
and a co-author of the Monterey study, spoke almost nostalgically
of his weeks here in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The island was smaller and beautiful then, and the lab much
closer to the sea,'' Lepyoshkin, displaying the water colors he
painted and landscapes he sketched when he wasn't working with
deadly microbes, playing volleyball, drinking vodka, or engaging in
other island pastimes.

   In interviews in Tashkent, Uzbek officials said that only after
their country became independent in 1992 did they understand the
implications of their biological legacy. ``We were shocked when we
first learned the real picture,'' said Isan M. Mustafoev,
Uzbekistan's deputy foreign minister. Alarmed by the health and
environmental impact of unconventional weapons, Islom Karimov,
Uzbekistan's president, renounced them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, after Moscow refused to tell Uzbekistan what chemical
or biological facilities had been built on Uzbek territory or what
had been tested or buried here, Tashkent asked Washington for help,
Mustafoev explained. [On May 25, the United States and Uzbekistan
signed a bilateral agreement that provides up to $6 million in
American aid to dismantle and decontaminate a former Soviet
chemical weapons testing facility near the Aral Sea.)
</P>
<P>
   Kazakhstan had quietly permitted Pentagon officials to visit
Vozrozhdeniye in 1995. Two years later, Uzbekistan independently
invited more American experts to take samples of the buried
anthrax, Mustafoev said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Uzbek Ministry of Defense was responsible for the
American mission, Mustafoev said that his ministry was not told
precisely what the tests showed about the samples that American
teams collected in 1995, 1997 and last October. The last mission's
goal, American officials said, was to determine why the some of the
anthrax had survived.

   In their major forays, the experts added, the Americans wore
white, space-suit-like protective clothing and gas masks with
respirators. All team members were vaccinated. ``It was like a moon
landing,'' one official said. ``Only scarier.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists said much can be learned from the material.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Dr. William C. Patrick III, who made germ weapons for the United
States before President Richard M. Nixon outlawed them nearly three
decades ago, said the samples would enable scientists to determine
not only the strength of the Soviet strain, or strains, but also
whether the anthrax had been genetically engineered, or enhanced in
other ways for virulence or other desirable qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Patrick nor any officials directly involved in the
missions would discuss what the samples had shown. But several
experts confirmed that the tests indicated that the anthrax vaccine
now being given American soldiers was effective. Molecular testing
on the strains was continuing, they added.
</P>
<P>
   Mustafoev said Uzbek's national oil company, which is exploring
for oil on its part of the island, was not drilling close to the
buried anthrax. ``No amount of oil is worth risking human lives,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Uzbekistan is deeply concerned about the potential
danger, decontaminating the island, given its size and the amount
of anthrax buried here, would be prohibitively expensive, he and
American officials agreed. But Kazakhstan has asked Washington's
help in surveying the Renaissance area to assess contamination
levels, which the Clinton administration is encouraging Uzbek and
Kazakh officials to work jointly on with American experts.
Meanwhile, all three capitals have been quietly pressing Moscow to
provide more information about what happened here.
</P>
<P>
   Milton Leitenberg, a professor and expert on Russia's
unconventional weapons programs, said that Moscow in 1987 had
listed the town of Aralsk, the island's staging area, but not the
island itself, in its first declaration of germ weapons
related-sites which is required by the 1972 Biological Weapons
Convention banning germ warfare. In its 1992 declaration, Russia
finally listed the island, but as a site where only defensive
testing for vaccines and materials had been performed. ``The
Russians,'' he concludes, ``have never come clean about these
programs.''
</P>
<P>
   The people who live near the island know all too well how little
Moscow cared for their safety and welfare. No region of Uzbekistan
has been harder hit by the Soviet Union's economic policies or its
relentless pursuit of unconventional weapons than Karakalpakstan,
the Uzbek semi-autonomous republic inhabited by almost 5 million
people with their own distinct ethnic traditions, language and
culture. Karakalpakstan, the home of the Aral sea, has seen its
once thriving fishing industry devastated, its arable land ruined
by overuse of fertilizers and pesticides, and its ground water
polluted.
</P>
<P>
   Yusup S. Kamalov, an Uzbek scientist who heads the Union for the
Defense of the Aral Sea, an independent environmental group, called
the situation ``next to hopeless.'' The sea's surface water has
shrunk by half, its volume reduced by 75 percent. ``The sea is
dying,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Karakalpaks, said Ian Small, the country manager of Medecins
Sans Frontieres, the volunteer physicians group, are among the most
``chronically sick people in the former Soviet Union.''
Ninety-eight percent of pregnant women are anemic. Infant mortality
rates are comparable to that of sub-Saharan Africa. Two-thirds of
the population suffer from some chronic illness, often
tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen an alarming increase in kidney disease and various
cancers,'' he said. ``But because there has been no census since
1989 and health statistics are either nonexistent or unreliable,
it's impossible to know whether what we're seeing is the result of
the region's general poverty and environmental degradation or the
past chemical and biological testing.''
</P>
<P>
   While local and Uzbek officials try to provide decent health
care, he said, they and his small group, the only international
charity in the region, are overwhelmed. Medecins is beginning to
conduct a base-line health survey that may shed some light not just
on the incidence of diseases, but their causes.
</P>
<P>
   Most germ weapons scientists familiar with Vozrozhdeniye said
there was little immediate danger to the local population. But with
the continued shrinking of the sea, the island is becoming more
readily accessible. In some of the pits, anthrax sludge is
beginning to leach up through the sand, said one recent visitor
here.
</P>
<P>
   Although Uzbek officials have kept Renaissance Island closed,
local inhabitants will inevitably come in contact with the still
deadly bacteria once it is linked to the mainland. ``We're now
totally in the dark,'' Small said. ``It's scary not to know what
we're dealing with.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It began innocently enough, like one of Miss Marple's trips to
the village store and its post office in St. Mary Mead.
</P>
<P>
   Edith Finke and Evelyn Mellon, casually obsessive experts on
British television who both live on New York's Long Island, were
struck by the number of people who would ask whether the actress
playing Jane Bennet in ``Pride and Prejudice'' was the same one who
played Sarah Layton in ``The Jewel in the Crown.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, no, of course not. It was Susannah Harker in ``Pride and
Prejudice'' and Geraldine James in ``The Jewel in the Crown.'' But
the questions left them more convinced than ever that there was a
universe of people out there as obsessed with the prim minutiae of
British television as they were.
</P>
<P>
   For several years the two had talked of finding a way to keep up
with the programs and actors on British television, and now they
have decided that while, heaven forbid, there may not always be an
England, there will always be Anglophiles. A result, beginning with
the first issue in December 1997, was The Anglo-Files: A Newsletter
for Fans of British Television, which Ms. Finke produces each month
with stray contributions from or consultations with Ms. Mellon.
</P>
<P>
   It is a numbingly detailed and exhaustive compendium on the
period dramas, murder mysteries and reborn classics of British
television and allied planets in theater and film, as well as a
reminder that in a culture addicted to New! More! Hotter! Sexier!
there is still a fiercely loyal constituency for old, less, cooler
and a bit dowdy.
</P>
<P>
   Each issue of their 'zine for the BBC and PBS set includes nine
single-spaced pages of listings, notes, gossip and trivia about
British programs being broadcast in the United States. (The
newsletter is always nine pages because any more would tip the
scale toward extra postage.) There is a summary of each show, a
complete cast listing and jauntily written, Playbill-like notes on
each performer.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Finke, as editor, does nearly all the work. Ms. Mellon has
the prestigious post of correspondent at large. Her 86-year-old
English mum, Mabs Turner, who sends along relevant clippings from
British newspapers, is listed as the United Kingdom correspondent.
Ms. Finke's computer, Sir Winston, and her printer, Lady Macbeth,
round out the masthead.
</P>
<P>
   So far, they are only up to 169 loyal subscribers, who pay $30
for 12 issues. But Ms. Finke, who is 68 and lives in East Quogue,
N.Y., said she was sure that there was a silent majority out there
whose idea of a great night was sitting at home watching Paul
McGann in Charles Dickens' ``Our Mutual Friend,'' Joan Hickson as
Agatha Christie's Miss Marple, anything on Mobil Masterpiece
Theater or the rest of the imported British canon.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we started this, I said to Eve that you and I are two
people in a majority that's out there that's just as crazy as we
are,'' Ms. Finke said. ``I guarantee you that we are not the only
people who sit bolt upright in bed and think, `Where did I see that
actor before?'''
</P>
<P>
   The Anglo-Files can trace its beginnings to the mid-1980s, when
Ms. Mellon and Ms. Finke became friends while working for a
child-care agency, Little Flower Children's Services. Ms. Finke, a
former assistant producer for a German television station, came to
the United States from Hamburg, which she calls ``surely the most
English of German cities.'' Ms. Mellon grew up in Herne Bay, a
seaside village on the Kentish coast of England, and now lives in
Port Jefferson, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   During drives to Brooklyn for visits with the families of
children in foster care, the women would discuss their mutual
passion for British television, which for Ms. Finke began with
``The Forsythe Saga'' and ``The Pallisers'' and reached the level
of addiction with her first (and still favorite) Miss Marple
mystery, ``Murder at the Vicarage.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Finke began taping every British television program and
writing down the cast listings, with each actor cross-referenced to
earlier performances. In 1996 she decided to turn her fixation into
the newsletter. She and Ms. Mellon began searching for preview
information from Bravo, PBS and A&AMP;E listings, and went into
business. Ms. Finke put up library notices, took out small
advertisements in publications favored by Anglophiles and sent
letters to people who seemed likely customers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Finke keeps her two televisions running regularly,
programming the VCR on one and setting the VCR manually on the
other. She spends a week writing and at least two hours a day
researching clippings and notes in American newspapers, press
releases, a British television guide and the Daily Mail of London.
And then there are the countless hours spent stuffing envelopes or
corresponding with subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   The publication is nowhere near the break-even point, but it is
more a labor of love than a business proposition for Ms. Finke, who
is retired.
</P>
<P>
   A typical issue might open with a seasonally appropriate
quotation from Swinburne, Wordsworth or Dylan Thomas. Then comes an
essay or reminiscence, like Ms. Finke's account of a visit 43 years
ago to the Greek island of Paros or an important news flash, like
British showings in the Oscars or Tonys.
</P>
<P>
   The guts of each issue are the listings of all the British
dramas scheduled that month on PBS or cable stations, with plot
summaries and knowing sketches of the players. The initiated
understand the shorthand, like MP for ``Mobil Masterpiece
Theater,'' MM for Miss Marple and SH for Sherlock Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the listings sound like the cast of an Edward Gorey
black comedy: ``Robert Lang was the odious Colonel Prothero in
`Murder at the Vicarage'; Chief Superintendent in Morse: `The
Settling of the Sun'; Gladstone in MP-`Parnell and the
Englishwoman'; and a cameo in MP-`Bramwell' III, `Cholera'
episode.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they get a little catty, as in the casting of
``Frenchman's Creek'' for ``Mobil Masterpiece Theater'': ``Anthony
Delon. Speaking of assets _ he is the son of the French actor Alain
Delon and has inherited his father's great looks, but apparently
not his acting talents.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Aficionados can learn that Struan Rodger, ``red hair, pale face,
looks like a young Red Buttons''; that Peter Jeffreys ``belongs to
the vast store of British actors with very prominent noses,'' and
that Ian McNeice, ``a little butterball, was the nasty George in
MP-`The Blackheath Poisonings.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkled in are notes from subscribers, mea culpas, obituaries
(most recently of the actors Sir Dirk Bogarde and Oliver Reed), and
assorted digressions, like an item wondering just why the Queen
needs a handbag or irregular features like Actor of the Month.
</P>
<P>
   Of the June 1998 honoree David Jason, for example, there is this
description: ``Short, cocky, bug-eyed, he reminds me of my demented
pug, Ling-Ling, who in an earlier incarnation must have been
responsible for the creation of the word pugnacious.'' Ling-Ling,
it must be reported, has passed on, but Jason continues to prosper.
</P>
<P>
   This year's March issue had a helpful breakdown for those having
problems with their Nigels, Ians and Iains, differentiating, among
others, Nigel Bruce from Nigel Davenport from Nigel Terry from
Nigel Hawthorne; Ian Bannen from Ian Brimble from Ian Richardson
from Ian McKellen and Iain Glen from Iain Cutherbertson from Iain
Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   April's issue threw in the Ruperts for good measure, giving the
particulars for Rupert Everett, Rupert Graves, Rupert Penry-Jones,
Rupert Holiday-Evans and Rupert Vansittart.
</P>
<P>
   With her cramped work space overflowing with 200 tapes, dry
sense of humor and tendency to rattle on cheerfully, Ms. Finke has
the air of someone who belongs in her own listings. She works from
her one-story bungalow, with its daffodils and magnolias and
English garden out back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oops, just kicked the baby kitten, but that's redundant isn't
it?'' she said. ``I hope you're not drowning in my palaver.''
</P>
<P>
   She sees the appeal of British drama as its complex mixture of
an idealized past and the stuff of human existence then and now.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times it's a return to what we think of as a nicer world,''
she said, ``but there's nothing nice in most of Dickens or if
you're a servant in `Upstairs Downstairs.' So it's a dream world in
some ways of thatched cottages and quaint villages. But then we
know the English have the same problems we have with race relations
and drug abuse and child abuse and spousal abuse. The Daily Mail
says that even the queen mother is 4 million pounds in debt.''
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest appeal of British television, Ms. Mellon said,
is probably that it is not American television.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the lure, Ms. Finke plows ahead, heartened by the
response to new programs like ``Berkeley Square,'' a variation on
the theme of ``Upstairs, Downstairs,'' and convinced that her brand
of Anglophilia is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must say, for once, I think I hit this right at the right
time,'' she said. ``Look at the Oscars. Look at Broadway. It's
wall-to-wall Brits. They're taking over the U.S., aren't they?''

TURKS SURPRISED AND TANTALIZED BY OCALAN'S APPARENT CHANGE OF
HEART  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ When the Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan
finished his extraordinary testimony on the opening day of his
treason trial on Monday, he left many Turks and Kurds dazed and
surprised. His abject apology for years of war and avowed
determination to re-invent himself as a democrat seemed dubious but
also tantalizing.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ocalan spoke for about 40 minutes, punctuating his
words with sweeping gestures inside the glass box from which he
views the courtroom, a single word was at the center of his
message.
</P>
<P>
   That word is ``devlet,'' which is Turkish for ``state.'' Ocalan
used it several times in his testimony, making clear that he was
not only apologizing to families of war victims, offering to adopt
a new ideology and ready to call his fighters down from the
mountains. He also said he wanted to help ``Turk devleti,'' the
Turkish state.
</P>
<P>
   In this insistently secular country, the concept of ``devlet''
or ``Turk devleti'' takes on near-mystical importance. Many Turks
harbor a profound respect for the state tinged with a bit of fear,
a willingness to assume the best about the state and its
intentions, and a conviction that whatever is good for the state is
good for all citizens. They view attacks on the state or its
fundamental principles as dangerous heresy, and supporting or
contributing to the state as highly honorable.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan, obviously aware of this central fact of Turkish
psychology, told the court, ``I want to work for brotherhood and
the state.'' He called on his rebel group to ``give up its stance
against the state.'' These remarks made his already startling
testimony even more provocative. They seemed certain to attract the
attention of senior generals and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   These are the figures who, in the end, will decide whether they
should take Ocalan up on his offer to end the 15-year-old Kurdish
war in exchange for political and cultural concessions. In doing
so, they will also be deciding whether or not to hang Ocalan. He
evidently hopes that over the course of his trial, he can convince
them that keeping him alive as a political weapon against Kurdish
separatism would be in their best interests.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony on Monday, Ocalan not only pledged to help the
state, but also signaled that he shares one of its favorite
beliefs, contempt for the hypocrisy of Europe. Government and
military leaders are angry at the European Union for what they say
is its arrogant and mendacious treatment of Turkey. Ocalan made the
same point from another angle, singling out Greece and Italy as
despicable partners for having supported him in good times but then
refusing to grant him asylum when he was in need.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over how seriously to take Ocalan's newfound views
has already begun in Turkey. Some newspapers have been skeptical,
running their accounts under headlines like ``Too Late'' and
``Smell of Blackmail.'' Others were more intrigued.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at a point where we have to decide what we want, to
punish Ocalan or to end terror in Turkey,'' the columnist Avni
Ozgurel wrote in the Istanbul daily Radikal. ``On the first day of
his trial, Ocalan clearly submitted himself to the state. He said,
`Use me, don't kill me!' So Ankara has to make a choice. The death
penalty may be reduced to life imprisonment without parole.''
</P>
<P>
   The fluid ``leadership council'' that has been running Ocalan's
guerrilla group since his capture in October is apparently no more
certain how to react to his testimony than are his onetime enemies.
A Brussels-based spokesmen for the group, Mizgin Sen, would say
only that it was ``premature to make a comment.''

THE SAGA OF SOPHIE'S BREAST

<P>
   LONDON _ Thank goodness there'll always be an England. Lacking a
monarchy of our own, where else could we get such vicarious
thrills?
</P>
<P>
   British politicians were tending to business last week as usual:
Parliament erupted in a furor over welfare reform, Prime Minister
Tony Blair stuck his neck out again to press for continued NATO
bombing of the Serbs, the Welsh opened their experimental new
assembly and Queen Elizabeth blessed the fabulous annual Chelsea
garden show.
</P>
<P>
   But the big news that gripped the public was the naked right
breast of Prince Edward's fiancee, Sophie Rhys-Jones, and the giant
press dust-up it produced.
</P>
<P>
   Here in America we like to snoop into the private lives of the
rich and famous every bit as much as the British, but we don't have
the flair they do for being nosy amid dramatic hair-pulling and
theatrical whining and wailing.
</P>
<P>
   Monica Lewinsky was a long-running sexy American distraction,
yet our reaction to her tawdry little affair with President Clinton
was to despise her and try to fire him. Too serious. No fun in
that.
</P>
<P>
   But with her exposed bosom Sophie, 34, has suddenly replaced the
late Diana as a glamorous, wronged royal (she will shortly become
one when she marries Queen Elizabeth's youngest son on June 19.)
Her new role is enhanced by the fact that her betrayer, former
colleague Kara Noble, is a satisfactorily nasty villain in the
tradition of Linda Tripp. Now this is the stuff of great gossip.
</P>
<P>
   The London Sun, an irrepressible and irresponsible tabloid,
printed an 11-year-old snapshot of Sophie giggling in the back seat
of a car after a male colleague pulled up her bikini top to expose
her breast. Noble, who snapped the picture, was said to be jealous
of Sophie for hitting the marital jackpot. In a fury because she
was not invited to the wedding, Noble sold the photo to the Sun for
an estimated $165,000.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next was a verbal hurricane, British style.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusually tart response, the palace condemned the
publication of the picture as ``premeditated cruelty'' and
threatened to haul the Sun before the independent Press Complaints
Commission. The radio station for which Noble worked summarily
sacked her. The Daily Record called Noble a ``female Judas'' whose
lucre was ``filthily and foully earned.''
</P>
<P>
   London's other newspapers also weighed in angrily, attacking the
Sun for committing what they called an inexcusable atrocity against
a happy bride-to-be. Newspapers in Germany, Belgium, Italy and
Holland ran excitable stories hyping the incident and thoughtfully
reproducing the offending picture so their readers could see what
the fuss was all about.
</P>
<P>
   Here in America, however, public reaction was relatively tame.
We have seen half-naked women before. And we have yet to be
captivated by the fair Sophie, clothed or not.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Ferguson, the estranged wife of Prince Andrew, once
titillated us with that beau who kissed her toes, but now she is a
matronly shill for diet products and a tad boring. It is still up
to Prince Charles and his longtime love Camilla Parker Bowles to
feed basic public curiosity about the royals. And the fun couple
didn't fail us last week; Camilla's son Tom Parker Bowles was
caught using drugs, for which he was supposedly upbraided by
Charles.
</P>
<P>
   But the London newspapers worked themselves into a frenzy over
Sophie's bare breast because after Diana's death press honchos had
piously promised to lay off the royals and treat them with more
respect. The bad tabloid days were supposed to be over. Even David
Yelland, the Sun editor, had observed that the game of harassment,
misrepresentation and invasion of privacy that the press had played
with Diana went too far.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's outcry drove the Sun to apologize for publishing the
picture, trying to grovel its way out of trouble by admitting a
mistake. But the Daily Telegraph harrumphed that the apology was
nothing but an insincere ``preemptive cringe'' designed to get
Buckingham Palace to withdraw its official complaint. (So far, the
Palace is sticking to its guns.)
</P>
<P>
   A major rival, the Mirror, ran a front page headline over
Yelland's picture asking, ``Is this the most stupid man in
Britain?'' The Daily Record went the Mirror one better by asking,
``Is this the most cruel man in Britain?''
</P>
<P>
   The Times sniffed, ``Sorry doesn't quite fit the bill.''
</P>
<P>
   The backlash even reached the Sun's reclusive owner. ``What is
it with Rupert Murdoch?'' the Telegraph asked sarcastically, noting
that the 68-year-old publisher had asked his peers to avoid
``intrusive publicity'' about his own marriage breakup and romance
with a 31-year-old woman. ``Yet his papers offer no mercy to other
members of the human race,'' the Telegraph complained.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this furor was undoubtedly born of genuine sympathy for
the humiliated Sophie. But it is not irrelevant that London's many
newspapers are engaged in an intense circulation war, trying every
twist and turn to win readers. In America, most cities support only
one or two newspapers. But in London newspapers breed like rabbits.
</P>
<P>
   It's a media jungle out there. Being polite doesn't sell
newspapers, particularly tabloids. Screaming and hollering do.

A YEAR AFTER RIOTS, ELECTION-TIME MOOD IN INDONESIA IS CALM  
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SERPANG, Indonesia _ This time, Enin Supriyanto is ready. Like
other ethnic Chinese here, he has his escape plan, his emergency
telephone numbers and his extra rations.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, surrounded by the music of frogs and the
sweet scent of clove cigarettes, he took his turn on neighborhood
watch, sitting by a barbed-wire barricade at the gated entrance of
his housing complex until well past midnight.
</P>
<P>
   One year after a paroxysm of rioting in which ethnic Chinese
were the targets of widespread vandalism, arson and rape, Chinese
all across the country have been preparing for new attacks before
the general election next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Some bought guns. Some are paying military units to guard
commercial areas. Many of those who can afford to have left the
country.
</P>
<P>
   But something utterly unexpected has happened. The election
campaign, in most parts of the country, has so far been mainly
peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   The threatening telephone calls to Chinese residents and the
anonymous leaflets and rumors of attacks that have circulated in
Chinese communities have not reappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting by their barbed-wire barricade, Enin and a dozen of his
neighbors strummed a guitar, played cards and discussed their
tennis strokes over late-night snacks and glasses of hot Ovaltine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are playing cards, we are eating noodles, we are talking
nonsense,'' Enin said, happily relieved.
</P>
<P>
   Although Indonesia's Chinese people know that they can become
targets of violence at any time, as they have been periodically
over the decades, there is an emerging hope here that something
fundamental may be starting to change.
</P>
<P>
   The cautiously upbeat mood among the residents here in the
western suburbs of Jakarta is repeated among political analysts _
both Chinese and non-Chinese _ as they survey the national scene.
</P>
<P>
   After the shock of the riots and the forced resignation of
President Suharto last year, the analysts say, Indonesia's Chinese
may be inching toward the mainstream of society.
</P>
<P>
   Adapting a pattern set by centuries of Dutch colonization,
Suharto created what one analyst called a ``golden cage'' for the
Chinese. They were offered economic opportunity in exchange for
their support and their exclusion from the country's political and
cultural life.
</P>
<P>
   They constitute less than 4 percent of the population in this
country of more than 200 million, but they control the bulk of its
private commerce _ ranging from small rice merchants to billionaire
tycoons.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's departure after 32 years of rule opened the way for a
reorganization of all aspects of society, from freeing the press to
forming political parties to redefining the role of Indonesians of
Chinese ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   Led by a better-educated, better-integrated younger generation,
many of the Chinese have begun to seek a new, more active place in
society.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had been convinced for about 30 years that everything was
fine,'' said Daniel S. Lev, an expert on Indonesia at the
University of Washington. ``They were isolated in a sense _ they
were denied any right to participate politically, but there was, at
the higher levels, a payoff: you got rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for many, what happened last May came as a really brutal
shock, because the part of the deal they forgot was that if things
got serious they would have to serve as scapegoats.''
</P>
<P>
   Hari Tjan, a political analyst with the independent Center for
Strategic and International Studies, who is an ethnic Chinese, said
of the riots, ``The cost was very high, but it is a learning
process that has been started.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, he said, there has also been a change in the
attitudes of indigenous political leaders, who he said ``don't want
to play this Chinese card anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am amazed that their conscience as human beings has
revived,'' Tjan said, ``and it is a wonderful, encouraging
development. Nearly all the parties are now embracing the Chinese
and telling them, `You are one of us. Please work together for the
country.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In a country where Chinese schools, newspapers, signboards and
public ceremonies were banned by Suharto, it has been an
extraordinary sight at some political rallies to see, among the
crowds, traditional Chinese lion and dragon dances.
</P>
<P>
   As they feel freer to redefine their role, Chinese people here
have launched a debate over whether to assert their cultural
separateness or to try to blend in to the broader national
identity.
</P>
<P>
   Some Chinese have banded together to form a culturally based
political party. Others have chosen not to emphasize their
separateness and have joined some of the other 47 parties engaged
in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Some responded to the riots by reaching out in solidarity to the
overseas Chinese diaspora in other nations, said Anugerah Pekerti,
an Indonesian Chinese who is chairman of World Vision Indonesia, an
aid organization.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Pekerti himself, advocate instead a process he
calls ``Indonesianization,'' in which the country's scores of
disparate ethnic groups will draw closer together in a common
identity.
</P>
<P>
   The debate illustrates an essential and wide-ranging change from
Suharto's father-knows-best era: Indonesians are reconstructing
their nation on their own terms.
</P>
<P>
   And the basic lesson the Chinese seem to be applying, in the
often-quoted words of the Indonesian Chinese political analyst
Arief Budiman, is: ``If you remain timid, you will forever be
trampled on.''

BOTHA'S CONTEMPT CONVICTION REVERSED
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa _ An appeals court on Tuesday set aside
the contempt conviction of former President P.W. Botha for refusing
to appear before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which was
created to investigate the crimes of the apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling makes it unlikely that the defiant Botha, 83, will
suffer any punishment for the killings and bombings conducted by
his government or for refusing to say whether he had directly
ordered any of them.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, the appeals panel went out of its way to praise
the work of the commission. It made its ruling entirely on the
basis of a technicality related to the date on which the subpoena
for Botha was issued.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a face-to-face plea from Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the
commission's chairman, Botha had repeatedly refused to appear
voluntarily. On Dec. 5, 1997, the commission issued a subpoena
commanding him to meet with it on Dec. 19. After he failed to
appear, a court in the town of George, near his retirement home in
Wilderness, found him guilty of contempt and sentenced him to
either a year in jail or a fine of about $1,600.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, the Cape High Court ruled that on Dec. 5, the
commission's legal mandate to exist was due to expire on Dec. 14,
so it had acted beyond its power by issuing a subpoena for Dec. 19.
Only on Dec. 10 did President Nelson Mandela sign legislation
extending the commission's life.
</P>
<P>
   In the court's decision, Judge Selwyn Selikowitz noted that the
commission ``has undertaken a noble and invaluable task for the
country, but it still remains a statutory body.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial judge in George had refused to allow Botha's legal
team to make an argument over the dates, and Selikowitz said on
Tuesday that he had ``misdirected himself.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling could add to the irritation of blacks who feel that
the courts are biased against them. The judge who found Botha
guilty was black; both judges on the Cape High Court panel that
overruled him are white.
</P>
<P>
   After the ruling, Botha responded to interview requests by
reading a statement over the telephone. It did not discuss the
merits of the decision or the role of the commission, but expressed
his family's gratitude and pleasure that the judges had acted
independently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our beautiful country cannot afford to be in a state of
despair,'' Botha went on, not making it exactly clear what state of
despair he referred to. ``Minority rights as well as cultural
rights should be maintained. South Africa should press on in the
knowledge that God is in control.''
</P>
<P>
   Botha governed the country for 11 years, during which the
half-secret war against black liberation guerrillas became ever
more brutal, with activists simply kidnapped and killed. After
Botha suffered a stroke in 1989, he was replaced by F.W. de Klerk,
who ultimately invited the guerrillas to return and started the
process that led to the 1994 elections.
</P>
<P>
   A Truth Commission spokesman said he hoped that the decision
would not slow down reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are disappointed in the verdict, but we have to respect the
court's decision,'' the spokesman, Pila Ngqumba, told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   A prosecutor said the government would study the ruling and
decide whether to appeal.

CALDER SCULPTURE MAY HEAD TO MUSEUM IN BAY AREA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: San Francisco)  (dal) 
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An important Alexander Calder sculpture, once
promised to the Whitney Museum of American Art but sold at auction
to an anonymous private collector two weeks ago, may be headed for
a museum collection after all. But it is likely to be the San
Francisco Museum of Modern Art, not the Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   The buyer of the Calder, a painted wood-and-wire work called
``Constellation,'' has been identified as Donald G. Fisher, the
founder of the Gap, by several people with knowledge of his
collection. They added that Fisher and his wife, Doris, who are
among the San Francisco museum's largest benefactors, usually
bought with the intention of giving the works to the museum. Fisher
is a longtime trustee there.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher is traveling and could not be reached for comment. David
A. Ross, the director of the San Francisco museum, also declined to
comment for the record. Ross headed the Whitney until a year ago,
leaving for San Francisco after seven often stormy years in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Calder made ``Constellation,'' which is considered the most
complex work in his constellation series, in 1941 for Philip
Johnson, the architect, and his sister, Theodate Severns. In 1981,
Mrs. Severns and her husband, Scott, promised the work to the
Whitney. Several months ago, however, Mrs. Severns, who is 91 and
is ill, asked to be released from her promise.
</P>
<P>
   The Whitney, in a move that stunned the museum world, allowed
``Constellation'' to be sold at Sotheby's, where on May 18 it
brought $1.9 million, more than double the presale estimate.
Proceeds from the sale are going into a trust that will provide
income to the Severns for the rest of their lives. The Whitney will
then receive what is left.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the deal said the Whitney should have bought an
annuity for the Severns and kept ``Constellation'' for its
collection. ``The Whitney lost a masterwork, without a doubt,''
said Alexander S.C. Rower, the director of the Calder Foundation
and the artist's grandson.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd at Sotheby's seemed to agree. The Fishers, who are
well-known collectors of Calder's work, had to compete with four
other bidders for ``Constellation.'' ``Don loves Calder and has a
wonderful Calder collection,'' Rower said. ``His collection is
certainly growing.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, ``Constellation'' seemed destined to go to San
Francisco, because the underbidder was Charles Schwab, the
investment company founder, whose wife, Helen, is also on the board
of the San Francisco museum. A spokeswoman for Schwab declined to
comment.

NATO DISCUSSES DETAILS OF POSSIBLE PEACEKEEPING FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO military planners heard on Tuesday how
many troops and tanks the allies and other countries would provide
for the beefed-up, 45,000-strong peacekeeping force planned for
Kosovo if diplomacy brings a settlement. But allied officials said
Russia, a key diplomatic player, was keeping its distance.
</P>
<P>
   The allies kept up the military pressure on Serbian forces with
778 missions Monday night, including 319 bombing runs and 89
attacks on Serbian air defenses. Air attacks on Serbian forces
fighting rebel Kosovo Liberation Army troops near the Albanian
border continued Tuesday, and international observers reported that
seven bombs fell on Albanian territory.
</P>
<P>
   One allied official said the attacks, in an area where Serbian
forces have often shown little concern about crossing the border,
were deliberate, and allied spokesmen said the bombing would
continue to intensify in what could be a crucial two weeks of
negotiations. ``It's a convergence of increased bombing and
diplomacy,'' one Western diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   If peace does break out, Britain has alerted up to 12,000 light
infantry soldiers to be ready to join its 5,300 troops already in
Macedonia for a peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, and France said
this week that it could provide 6,000 to 7,000 troops, about as
many as the United States has said it is willing to offer. Italy
also has close to 8,000 soldiers in Albania, where they are helping
refugees from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The 19 NATO allies agreed last week that because of widespread
destruction and dislocation in Kosovo, restoring normal life and
security there would take more than the 28,000 peacekeeping
soldiers they had planned to send in earlier this spring if
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic had accepted a negotiated
settlement providing autonomy for the province.
</P>
<P>
   Many European officials say they are now hoping that a new
diplomatic push by former Russian Prime Minister Viktor S.
Chernomyrdin could produce Yugoslav agreement to an international
peacekeeping force. They also hope that Russia would join the push
by the time eight industrial democracies, including the United
States and Russia, gather in Cologne, Germany, on June 18 for a
summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The Cologne meeting is seen as a crucial negotiating deadline,
but whether Chernomyrdin can persuade Milosevic to accept terms
that would get the allies to stop the bombing is still uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   One allied official said Tuesday that the larger NATO force now
being planned if diplomacy does succeed would have about 45,000
soldiers from NATO countries and other neutral or formerly
communist nations that have cooperation agreements with the
alliance. Another 10,000 troops would remain outside Kosovo
providing supplies and other support, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Military representatives from NATO and 12 non-NATO countries
attended a conference on the peacekeeping mission Tuesday at the
allied military headquarters in Mons, Belgium. They offered
individual combat, logistical, and engineering units for an
international force big enough to move into the province after the
fighting stops and escort hundreds of thousands of refugees back to
their shattered homes. Officials said final decisions would be made
after allied commanders reviewed the offers and some participating
countries got approval from their parliaments.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeepers would go in, according to NATO, only if a new round
of diplomacy finally produced agreement by Milosevic to stop the
fighting and withdraw Serbian forces from Kosovo. If diplomacy
fails by the time of the June 18 meeting, one official here said,
the allies might then have to start formal planning for a much
larger force to fight its way into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, which has about 1,500 peacekeepers serving with allied
forces in Bosnia, has refused so far to participate in planning for
a peacekeeping force, according to officials here. Russia suspended
all formal cooperation with the alliance after it started bombing
military targets in Yugoslavia on March 24.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bombing, an allied military spokesman, Maj. Gen.
Walter Jertz, said on Tuesday that 40,000 Serbian troops remained
in Kosovo, about as many as there were when the allies started the
air operation 70 days ago.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance's spokesman, Jamie P. Shea, said Milosevic was
forcing men in their 50s to join the Yugoslav army. ``He is now
drawing on his last human resources to keep the numbers level,''
Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   Jertz described ``fierce fighting'' between Serbian forces and
the ethnic Albanian KLA near the border with Albania on Monday, and
said that NATO airplanes had bombed 84 pieces of Serbian combat
equipment in the battle zone.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, Jertz said, the allies had bombed 314 Serbian
artillery pieces, 120 tanks and 203 other armored vehicles in
Kosovo since the beginning of the air campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The allies hoped bombing would force a halt to Serbian attacks
against the ethnic Albanian majority in the province.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Milosevic's army, police and paramilitary forces
continued combat operations that have now driven 800,000 ethnic
Albanians out of Kosovo and forced most of the rest, nearly
600,000, to take to the hills.
</P>
<P>
   The allies have flown 31,529 individual missions in 70 days,
Jertz said, including thousands of strikes against Serbian
anti-aircraft missiles and the radar and communications sites that
the air defense system uses to target attacking planes.
</P>
<P>
   Allied air attacks, Jertz said, had done moderate to severe
damage to all nine military airfields in Serbia, destroyed more
than 100 Serbian warplanes, and driven most of the rest out of the
skies during NATO operations. About two-thirds of the least
sophisticated Serbian anti-aircraft missiles had been destroyed, he
said, and 12 percent of the more advanced SA-6 missiles had been
eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   But despite more than two months of bombing, according to the
allies, the Serbian military still has 59 percent of its petroleum
reserves. More than 40 percent of Yugoslavia's joint
military-civilian fuel reserves and 63 percent of its oil storage
plants remain untouched by the bombing, and 71 percent of the
ammunition storage capacity remains, the alliance says.
</P>
<P>
   With allied attacks focusing more and more on installations like
power plants, bridges and roads that civilians are also using, Shea
said, it was inevitable that there would be more Yugoslav civilian
casualties, though allied pilots do their best to avoid striking
civilian targets.

IRISH POLICE DIG FOR REMAINS OF IRA VICTIMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ The family of Jean McConville, a mother of 10
who was executed by the Irish Republican Army in 1972 because she
comforted a dying British soldier, waited and hoped Tuesday that
her remains would be found by Irish police.
</P>
<P>
   Police were excavating a beach in the Irish Republic near the
Northern Ireland border. Seven other families and scores of
relatives also waited to see whether police would find remains of
their loved ones _ also IRA victims, most of them Roman Catholics,
who were executed as traitors.
</P>
<P>
   Irish police were acting on information provided last week by
the overwhelmingly Catholic IRA, which acknowledges the executions
but has not apologized for them. Police are digging and dredging in
four counties of the Irish Republic for the remains of eight
persons executed in the 1970s and 1980s, at the height of the
sectarian violence between Northern Ireland's Protestant majority
and the Catholic minority.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA moved the bodies across the border apparently to avoid
any involvement with its enemies in the north _ the police of the
Royal Ulster Constabulary.
</P>
<P>
   The highly public search has become an emotional issue both here
in the Irish Republic and in British Northern Ireland, further
complicating the stalled peace effort in the north.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Irish national television reported that the
IRA had said that it had given all the information it had and that
it hoped the bodies would be found to ``end the anguish'' of the
waiting families. But Seamus McKendry, a son-in-law of Mrs.
McConville, said he wants more details on how to find the bodies.
``If they want to end the anguish,'' he said, ``let them do it. Or
nobody's going to trust them as a political party.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRA disclosure of the information was apparently designed to
improve its image and to help Sinn Fein, its political wing, in
both the peace effort and local elections on June 11.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA has observed a cease-fire for 22 months, but has refused
to disarm. This has given Protestant leaders grounds for denying
Sinn Fein cabinet-level posts in the new Northern Ireland Assembly,
which was created to carry out political changes approved last year
in the Belfast peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is intended to give minority Catholics more power
in the north, and to increase the influence in northern affairs of
the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic, to the south.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, acting on information provided by the IRA through a
Catholic priest, police found the remains of one man, Eamon Molloy,
in a coffin in a church cemetery in County Louth, near the Northern
Ireland border. But other locations identified by the IRA have been
dug and dredged by hundreds of police for three days without the
discovery of other remains.
</P>
<P>
   The Sinn Fein president, Gerry Adams, has called on the IRA to
provide full details to help police find the remains. But other
northern politicians, including Dr. Phillip McGarry, the president
of the mainstream Alliance Party, a 60-40 mix of Protestants and
Catholics, have attacked the Sinn Fein statements as disingenuous.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McConville, a 39-year-old Protestant married to a Catholic,
was abducted in the presence of her children by an IRA gang a few
days before Christmas 1972. A local guerrilla committee had judged
her a traitor for comforting the dying soldier, who had been shot
in front of her home.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, some of the McConvilles gathered near a beach in the
village of Templetown, just across Carlingford Loch from Northern
Ireland. As police dug with huge mechanical excavators and ordinary
shovels, some of her children said they would wait longer, but that
they were losing hope. At dinner time, the police were still
searching.

MANY CAR SHOPPERS BEING DRIVEN TO LEASE  
 (ADV: MATERIAL FOR THREE BOXES AT END) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RUSS WILES  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Hardly anybody walks into an auto showroom these days
without drawing up a budget and checking it twice.
</P>
<P>
   Cars are so expensive that few consumers can buy one outright.
That means some kind of financing will be necessary, and monthly
payments will result.
</P>
<P>
   Yet car shoppers who focus too much on the monthly outlays to
the exclusion of other costs may live to regret it. That's because
a preoccupation with payments often leads car shoppers to leasing,
which frequently is more expensive than buying, say consumer
advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people are paying the full sticker price or more for
leased cars,'' consumer advocate W. James Bragg writes in his book
``Car Buyer's and Leaser's Negotiating Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Hegyi, an assistant Arizona attorney general, estimates
that dealers make three to four times the profit on leases than on
sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``In two or three years your lease will end, and dealers will
have another chance to earn several thousand dollars in commissions
by selling or leasing you a new car,'' Hegyi said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that leasing is inherently worse than buying. The
financial attractiveness of either approach depends largely on the
numbers you input.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that because the leasing process is more complex and
consumers don't understand it as well, dealers have the advantage.
It's not merely a matter of bickering over prices, car options and
trade-in values, as with a sale. You also have to contemplate
factors such as the likely number of miles you may drive and the
car's residual value at the end of the term.
</P>
<P>
   ``These transactions are so complicated that most people don't
know if they're getting a good or bad deal,'' Hegyi said.
</P>
<P>
   He adds that people who lease cars typically must carry more
extensive auto insurance, which may add several hundred dollars a
year in expenses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, people who exceed the annual mileage allowance _
usually 12,000 to 15,000 _ face additional outlays at the end of
the lease. So do those who don't keep their cars in good shape. If
you don't keep up with oil changes and other required maintenance,
``the lender can even declare you in default in midlease and
repossess the car,'' Hegyi said.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, you'll face a hefty penalty if you terminate a
rental agreement early.
</P>
<P>
   Adding insult to injury, some finance companies won't let you
leave the state with a leased car, according to Hegyi.
</P>
<P>
   Given all of these drawbacks and more, what explains the
considerable popularity of leasing, which accounts for about
one-third of all auto transactions?
</P>
<P>
   For starters, leasing may be the only recourse for cash-strapped
individuals who can't afford a large down payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most consumers, the monthly payment is still the Number 1
issue on their minds,'' said Greg Swan, general sales manager for
Midway Chevrolet Isuzu in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Those monthly lease payments are almost always lower than what
you would face in purchasing, for the obvious reason that you're
not paying for a vehicle's residual value.
</P>
<P>
   While you will face various upfront fees with leasing _
including sales taxes, vehicle-registration charges, the first
month's payment, a refundable security deposit and the oddly named
``lease-acquisition'' fee _ the total outlay will be less than if
you're buying.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, supporters say leasing provides more flexibility
than buying in that you can exercise an option to purchase the car
or simply turn it back to the dealer after the rental period
expires. No headaches about maintenance bills and no need to sell
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather have the option to return the car than be stuck
with it,'' Swan said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, leasing, with the lower monthly payments involved, may be
the only way for some people to gain access to a luxury car. Let's
face it _ car shopping is a highly emotional exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leasing lets you drive a larger, more powerful,
better-equipped BMW,'' a marketing blurb on the German automaker's
Web site reads.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates also point out that the the lack of a down payment on
a lease frees up cash that you can invest or put to other uses.
Virtually all vehicles depreciate, so it may be unwise to invest
thousands of dollars in one, the argument goes.
</P>
<P>
   Depreciation perhaps explains why leasing has become more
common. Although most Americans would rather own their own home
than rent, they don't seem to feel the same way about cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find that people would rather own real estate because
there haven't been too many times over the last 100 years that real
estate has lost money,'' said Mike Mullan, fleet manager at Midway
Chevrolet Isuzu.
</P>
<P>
   Tax laws don't necessarily provide any advantages for people who
lease.
</P>
<P>
   If you use the car for work, you can deduct that portion of your
lease payment attributable to business use, along with normal
operating costs and maintenance. But you also can deduct operating
costs and maintenance for business usage on a purchased car.
</P>
<P>
   Even though you can't directly write off the interest you pay to
buy a new car, you can get a deduction by financing a purchase
through a home-equity loan _ a nice break if you're not using the
vehicle for business.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Osinski, a Phoenix certified public accountant, says the
primary tax advantage associated with leasing reflects the fact
that you face limits on how much depreciation you can deduct on a
purchase. As a general rule, he says leasing makes sense from a tax
standpoint only if you use the vehicle for business and expect to
replace it within three years. The tax rules are tricky, however,
so it's wise to consult an adviser if you use a car for business
and think the this angle may be decisive.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, taxes are only one of many aspects that weigh on
the lease-or-buy decision. Emotional satisfaction, cash flow and
upfront money all factor in, as do your negotiating skills,
financial acumen, driving habits and plans.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the longer you're willing to drive the same car, the
more attractive purchasing becomes from a financial standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to squeeze every drop of value from the money you
spend on a car,'' Bragg writes, ``is to drive it until the wheels
fall off.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
BUY OR LEASE? &QL; 
 &QL; 
You make the call &QL; 
The decision to lease or buy a new vehicle largely boils down to
personal circumstances and attitudes. Answer yes or no to the
following questions, which were adapted from the ``Car Buyer's and
Leaser's Negotiating Bible'' by W. James Bragg, to determine which
option may be best for you. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Do you value the image of driving a late-model vehicle?
</P>
<P>
   2. Do you look forward to receiving title to your car?
</P>
<P>
   3. Would you prefer to drive a more expensive car than you can
afford to buy?
</P>
<P>
   4. Do you typically keep your vehicles five years or more?
</P>
<P>
   5. Would you invest the money that you don't have to spend on a
down payment?
</P>
<P>
   6. Do you drive considerably more than 15,000 miles a year?
</P>
<P>
   7. Are you likely to need a different vehicle in three years?
</P>
<P>
   8. Are you able to make a fairly large down payment?
</P>
<P>
   9. Do you always want to drive a car covered by the original
manufacturer's warranty?
</P>
<P>
   10. Is pride of ownership in a car important to you? &QL; 
Scoring: Leasing makes sense if you mostly answered ``yes'' to the
odd-numbered questions and ``no'' to the even-numbered ones. Buying
makes sense if you mostly did the reverse. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
DOING IT RIGHT &QC; 
 &QL; 
Getting a good lease &QL; 
Assuming you plan to lease a car, here are some recommendations for
doing it right, as suggested by Hugh Hegyi of the Arizona Attorney
General's office.
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Don't focus on the monthly payment amount to the exclusion of
other costs.
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Plan to negotiate these six factors: the value of the car,
the amount due at the time of signing, all miscellaneous fees, the
depreciation amount, the yearly mileage allowance and the cost of
buying the vehicle at the end of the lease.
</P>
<P>
   - Discuss each cost component, and ask for an itemization in
writing.
</P>
<P>
   - Avoid ``open-end'' leases, which require you to pay more if
the car is worth less than expected at the lease's termination.
</P>
<P>
   - Shop for interest rates before you get to the dealer, and
remember that this also can be negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   - Be willing to back away from a deal if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   - Make sure you understand everything in the lease, and don't
rush into a decision.
</P>
<P>
   - Take as many notes as possible. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE LANGUAGE OF LEASING &QC; 
 &QL; 
Key terms &QL; 
 &QL; 
- Capitalized cost: The price of a leased vehicle, including
upfront charges.
</P>
<P>
   - Depreciation: The amount the vehicle's value erodes over time.
</P>
<P>
   - Finance rate: The number, expressed as either a percentage or
``money factor,'' that indicates how costly a leasing package is.
</P>
<P>
   - Money factor: A decimal that relates to the interest rate on
some leasing contracts. You multiply it by 24 _ regardless of how
long the term of the lease is _ to get the approximate interest
rate. For example, a money factor of 0.00345, when multipled by 24,
equals an interest rate of 0.0828, or 8.28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   - Residual value: The estimated worth of the car when the rental
period expires. The residual value equals the capitalized cost less
depreciation. &QL;

which frequently is more expensive than buying, say consumer
advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people are paying the full sticker price or more for
leased cars,'' consumer advocate W. James Bragg writes in his book
``Car Buyer's and Leaser's Negotiating Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Hegyi, an assistant Arizona attorney general, estimates
that dealers make three to four times the profit on leases than on
sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``In two or three years your lease will end, and dealers will
have another chance to earn several thousand dollars in commissions
by selling or leasing you a new car,'' Hegyi said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that leasing is inherently worse than buying. The
financial attractiveness of either approach depends largely on the
numbers you input.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that because the leasing process is more complex and
consumers don't understand it as well, dealers have the advantage.
It's not merely a matter of bickering over prices, car options and
trade-in values, as with a sale. You also have to contemplate
factors such as the likely number of miles you may drive and the
car's residual value at the end of the term.
</P>
<P>
   ``These transactions are so complicated that most people don't
know if they're getting a good or bad deal,'' Hegyi said.
</P>
<P>
   He adds that people who lease cars typically must carry more
extensive auto insurance, which may add several hundred dollars a
year in expenses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, people who exceed the annual mileage allowance _
usually 12,000 to 15,000 _ face additional outlays at the end of
the lease. So do those who don't keep their cars in good shape. If
you don't keep up with oil changes and other required maintenance,
``the lender can even declare you in default in midlease and
repossess the car,'' Hegyi said.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, you'll face a hefty penalty if you terminate a
rental agreement early.
</P>
<P>
   Adding insult to injury, some finance companies won't let you
leave the state with a leased car, according to Hegyi.
</P>
<P>
   Given all of these drawbacks and more, what explains the
considerable popularity of leasing, which accounts for about
one-third of all auto transactions?
</P>
<P>
   For starters, leasing may be the only recourse for cash-strapped
individuals who can't afford a large down payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most consumers, the monthly payment is still the Number 1
issue on their minds,'' said Greg Swan, general sales manager for
Midway Chevrolet Isuzu in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Those monthly lease payments are almost always lower than what
you would face in purchasing, for the obvious reason that you're
not paying for a vehicle's residual value.
</P>
<P>
   While you will face various upfront fees with leasing _
including sales taxes, vehicle-registration charges, the first
month's payment, a refundable security deposit and the oddly named
``lease-acquisition'' fee _ the total outlay will be less than if
you're buying.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, supporters say leasing provides more flexibility
than buying in that you can exercise an option to purchase the car
or simply turn it back to the dealer after the rental period
expires. No headaches about maintenance bills and no need to sell
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather have the option to return the car than be stuck
with it,'' Swan said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, leasing, with the lower monthly payments involved, may be
the only way for some people to gain access to a luxury car. Let's
face it _ car shopping is a highly emotional exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leasing lets you drive a larger, more powerful,
better-equipped BMW,'' a marketing blurb on the German automaker's
Web site reads.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates also point out that the the lack of a down payment on
a lease frees up cash that you can invest or put to other uses.
Virtually all vehicles depreciate, so it may be unwise to invest
thousands of dollars in one, the argument goes.
</P>
<P>
   Depreciation perhaps explains why leasing has become more
common. Although most Americans would rather own their own home
than rent, they don't seem to feel the same way about cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``You find that people would rather own real estate because
there haven't been too many times over the last 100 years that real
estate has lost money,'' said Mike Mullan, fleet manager at Midway
Chevrolet Isuzu.
</P>
<P>
   Tax laws don't necessarily provide any advantages for people who
lease.
</P>
<P>
   If you use the car for work, you can deduct that portion of your
lease payment attributable to business use, along with normal
operating costs and maintenance. But you also can deduct operating
costs and maintenance for business usage on a purchased car.
</P>
<P>
   Even though you can't directly write off the interest you pay to
buy a new car, you can get a deduction by financing a purchase
through a home-equity loan _ a nice break if you're not using the
vehicle for business.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Osinski, a Phoenix certified public accountant, says the
primary tax advantage associated with leasing reflects the fact
that you face limits on how much depreciation you can deduct on a
purchase. As a general rule, he says leasing makes sense from a tax
standpoint only if you use the vehicle for business and expect to
replace it within three years. The tax rules are tricky, however,
so it's wise to consult an adviser if you use a car for business
and think the this angle may be decisive.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, taxes are only one of many aspects that weigh on
the lease-or-buy decision. Emotional satisfaction, cash flow and
upfront money all factor in, as do your negotiating skills,
financial acumen, driving habits and plans.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the longer you're willing to drive the same car, the
more attractive purchasing becomes from a financial standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to squeeze every drop of value from the money you
spend on a car,'' Bragg writes, ``is to drive it until the wheels
fall off.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
BUY OR LEASE? &QL; 
 &QL; 
You make the call &QL; 
The decision to lease or buy a new vehicle largely boils down to
personal circumstances and attitudes. Answer yes or no to the
following questions, which were adapted from the ``Car Buyer's and
Leaser's Negotiating Bible'' by W. James Bragg, to determine which
option may be best for you. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Do you value the image of driving a late-model vehicle?
</P>
<P>
   2. Do you look forward to receiving title to your car?
</P>
<P>
   3. Would you prefer to drive a more expensive car than you can
afford to buy?
</P>
<P>
   4. Do you typically keep your vehicles five years or more?
</P>
<P>
   5. Would you invest the money that you don't have to spend on a
down payment?
</P>
<P>
   6. Do you drive considerably more than 15,000 miles a year?
</P>
<P>
   7. Are you likely to need a different vehicle in three years?
</P>
<P>
   8. Are you able to make a fairly large down payment?
</P>
<P>
   9. Do you always want to drive a car covered by the original
manufacturer's warranty?
</P>
<P>
   10. Is pride of ownership in a car important to you? &QL; 
Scoring: Leasing makes sense if you mostly answered ``yes'' to the
odd-numbered questions and ``no'' to the even-numbered ones. Buying
makes sense if you mostly did the reverse. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
DOING IT RIGHT &QC; 
 &QL; 
Getting a good lease &QL; 
Assuming you plan to lease a car, here are some recommendations for
doing it right, as suggested by Hugh Hegyi of the Arizona Attorney
General's office.
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Don't focus on the monthly payment amount to the exclusion of
other costs.
</P>
<P>
   -  &UR; Plan to negotiate these six factors: the value of the car,
the amount due at the time of signing, all miscellaneous fees, the
depreciation amount, the yearly mileage allowance and the cost of
buying the vehicle at the end of the lease.
</P>
<P>
   - Discuss each cost component, and ask for an itemization in
writing.
</P>
<P>
   - Avoid ``open-end'' leases, which require you to pay more if
the car is worth less than expected at the lease's termination.
</P>
<P>
   - Shop for interest rates before you get to the dealer, and
remember that this also can be negotiated.
</P>
<P>
   - Be willing to back away from a deal if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   - Make sure you understand everything in the lease, and don't
rush into a decision.
</P>
<P>
   - Take as many notes as possible. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE LANGUAGE OF LEASING &QC; 
 &QL; 
Key terms &QL; 
 &QL; 
- Capitalized cost: The price of a leased vehicle, including
upfront charges.
</P>
<P>
   - Depreciation: The amount the vehicle's value erodes over time.
</P>
<P>
   - Finance rate: The number, expressed as either a percentage or
``money factor,'' that indicates how costly a leasing package is.
</P>
<P>
   - Money factor: A decimal that relates to the interest rate on
some leasing contracts. You multiply it by 24 _ regardless of how
long the term of the lease is _ to get the approximate interest
rate. For example, a money factor of 0.00345, when multipled by 24,
equals an interest rate of 0.0828, or 8.28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   - Residual value: The estimated worth of the car when the rental
period expires. The residual value equals the capitalized cost less
depreciation. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Along Ninth Avenue and on East 96th Street in
Manhattan, on Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn and Ocean Parkway in
Queens _ in fact, in almost any neighborhood in America where
Muslims make their home _ halal meat shops are the new butchers in
an old-fashioned way.
</P>
<P>
   Where small storefronts once housed Italian, French and kosher
butchers, shops now declare that their meat is halal.
</P>
<P>
   To non-Muslims the shops can be mysterious, even intimidating.
But to others they are a happy addition to the checkerboard of
tiny, specialty food shops in the city, places with impeccable meat
and intensely personal service. Even as the production of meat
nationwide becomes increasingly industrialized, analysts say that
halal meat is nevertheless the fastest growing style of specialty
butchering in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The halal sign promises that the meat has been ritually
slaughtered according to Islamic law. The signs also signal a spot
where, in rooms behind the meat counter, small groups gather for
prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the morning, at noon, at dusk and again late at night,
there is taxicab gridlock in front of halal butchers on Ninth
Avenue in Manhattan as drivers stop for prayer. After feeding their
spirits, the drivers often pick up several pounds of halal meat on
the way back to their taxis.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny storefront butchers are intimate places where the
butcher knows his customers' names, family news and favorite cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The shops stock only beef, goat and lamb, and cut it to a
customer's specifications or to suit a particular recipe.
</P>
<P>
   To many of halal's admirers, religious and secular, it signifies
clean, fresh meat. By custom, halal meat is delivered to butchers
in whole carcasses, rather than cut into pieces before shipping.
</P>
<P>
   It is handled in much smaller quantities and by fewer people
than fresh packaged meat or conventional butcher-shop meat. And it
is generally fresher. But except for the religious ritual
surrounding the slaughter, its processing and handling are governed
by the same Agriculture Department regulations that affect all meat
in this country.
</P>
<P>
   The word halal is a Koranic term meaning that which is untied or
loosened. According to Islamic law, halal meat is killed by a
Muslim using a sharp knife, deploying no more than two strokes to
the jugular vein and invoking the name of Allah.
</P>
<P>
   Meat killed in any other fashion is considered haram, or
forbidden, food, along with meat from cloven-foot animals, donkeys,
horses, predatory animals and carrion-feeding birds.
</P>
<P>
   Around this simple code have evolved a host of Muslim eating
traditions, ranging from eating only with the right hand and eating
only when seated on the floor to celebrating certain foods, dates
for instance.
</P>
<P>
   These customs, said Phil Parshall, the author of ``Inside the
Community: Understanding Muslims Through Their Traditions'' (Baker
Books, 1994), emulate Mohammed's habits and are descriptive of some
Muslims, but not proscriptive to all Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Among devout Muslims, sensual pleasure is suspect. Islam's
teachings focus on morality and enlightenment, hard work and
harmony. The believer eats to live but does not live to eat. The
toothsome character of halal meat, therefore, arises by
coincidence, not design.
</P>
<P>
   But among food-loving Americans willing to pay a premium of up
to 30 percent, halal meat, typically tender and delicate in flavor,
is finding thousands of devotees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my customers drive over an hour to get here,'' said
Mohammed Hebbar, the owner of Salama Halal Meat in San Francisco.
``Lots of them aren't even Muslims. They come because they know
halal meat is the best.''
</P>
<P>
   Halal regulations, like much Islamic dietary law, are similar to
those governing kosher meat, but this is not the reason that Jews,
Christians, Buddhists and agnostics have begun to buy from halal
butchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about religion,'' said Serena Arenson, 36, who
teaches at an elementary school in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In front of the glass display case at Nusrat Comak Halal Meat
Shop on Ninth Avenue, Ms. Arenson said that stories about
contaminated meat throughout the country, along with the demise of
local kosher butchers and the rise of kosher meat empires, prompted
her interest in halal meat, which is typically sold from tiny
family-owned storefronts.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship she has developed over four years with Comak,
the store's owner, as well as the quality of meat he sells, make
her unwilling to shop elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Muslims, on the other hand, are bound to cook and eat only halal
meat. With more than a billion adherents to Islam worldwide and, it
is estimated, six million to eight million followers in the United
States, Muslims alone would create a substantial market for halal,
leaving out of account all the health-conscious and
quality-conscious non-Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Abe Batcha, the owner of Halal Meat USA, one of the two major
halal slaughterhouses on the East Coast, said that his sales have
doubled each of the 12 years he has operated his squat, cinderblock
processing plant in Paterson, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The plant, he said, processes 1,500 to 2,000 head of beef, goat
and lamb each week. He supplies 300 small shops in New York, New
Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania, as well as four major
wholesalers, who sell halal meat as far south as North Carolina and
as far west as Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, he can't meet the demand. More people are
turning Muslim, especially younger people, said Batcha, who was a
farmer in his native Russia. And with the end of farm supports,
which subsidized the labor-intensive raising of small farm animals,
the supply of small animals is going down.
</P>
<P>
   One week recently, for instance, Batcha ordered 400 lambs but
was able to buy only 40.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one other major Agriculture Department-approved
halal processing center, in Trenton, N.J., Batcha said, and the
beef, lamb and goat he and his competitor can buy are virtually the
only halal meat available in the New York metropolitan region.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Islamic dietary code, many customs relating to meat
handling have evolved. Halal meat, for instance, is almost never
more than two days old, is never frozen and is almost always sold
by the slaughterhouse to the retailer as a whole carcass, rather
than cut into portions.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Islamic slaughtering procedure, the animal must
be treated gently, must never see the knife and must be killed by
one, or a maximum of two, swift slices to the jugular vein by a
Muslim who evokes the name of Allah while slaughtering the animal.
Afterward, the blood must be completely drained from the carcass.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to make holy, swift and humane as possible the loss
of life,'' said Mrat Olgun, who emigrated from Turkey and oversees
the ritual slaughter. ``We are forbidden to use guns or kill for
pleasure, only for food. That is what it means, halal.''
</P>
<P>
   The killing floor at Halal Meat USA bears little resemblance to
conventional slaughterhouses. Like most meat processors, the 30 men
who work the 8,000-square-foot concrete floor wear blood-splattered
aprons, shin-high rubber boots, down vests and baseball caps.
</P>
<P>
   But when I visited Halal Meat USA in May, unlike other
meat-processing centers I have seen, a mood of calm reverence
prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Even under duress.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, a young steer panicked in the narrow corridor that
runs from the dock where trucks unload the cattle as far as the
killing floor.
</P>
<P>
   Although less than 2 years old, the steer weighed more than
1,000 pounds and was so agitated that, instead of following in the
steps of hundreds of thousands of heads of cattle that have been
herded down the hall over the last 12 years, it jumped the
four-foot gate between the corridor and the killing floor.
</P>
<P>
   The meat processors, a federal meat inspector and two observers
backed away, as six other men subdued the steer using nothing more
than their hands and their wits. There were no stun guns, no clubs,
no curses. The killing floor became a gentle rodeo as the six men
cajoled and massaged the steer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on,'' they cooed. ``Come on.'' They whispered and petted
the animal to his knees and, finally, to his side on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Only then did Olgun stride toward the steer, with a 22-inch
butcher knife tucked behind his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the name of Allah, Allah is great,'' Olgun whispered in
Arabic.
</P>
<P>
   The razor-sharp edge of his knife flashed as it arced through
the air. ``In the name of Allah, Allah is great,'' he whispered
again. In one swift motion, Olgun slit the steer's throat. ``In the
name of Allah, Allah is great,'' he said a third time.
</P>
<P>
   Olgun stood still as the slaughtered steer was clamped into a
harness and raised about 10 feet above the floor by a winch. Except
for wiping his knife clean, he didn't move for the eight minutes it
took for the blood to drain from the carcass.
</P>
<P>
   Among Muslims, Olgun is considered holy. Like every halal
butcher interviewed, Mohamed Soliman, who owns Halal Meat Market on
Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, said that meat is only as pure as the
heart of the one who slaughtered the animal.
</P>
<P>
   Such conviction, however, does little to convince traditional
American steak eaters, who tend to dismiss halal meat as too young
and lean to be well marbled, too fresh to have garnered the
distinct flavor of a steer that is three to four years old and
whose meat has been aged up to two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   History could have predicted that halal food would eventually
stand at an ecumenical and multicultural crossroads. Islamic
culture has long overleaped racial and ethnic boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   The perception of Muslim culture has for some time been formed
in the United States by thoughts of terrorists and black
separatists, breakaway groups, which are shunned by most Muslims.
Likewise, even sophisticated diners who heard the word halal used
to think exclusively of Arabic-style cooking.
</P>
<P>
   But as Muslims emigrate to this country and conversions to Islam
increase, the diversity of the culture and cuisine are becoming
better known. Arab, Indonesian, Pakistani, East African, North
African, Turkish, Greek, French, Cambodian and American halal cooks
have over the centuries each developed distinct cooking styles.
</P>
<P>
   As with any lean, unaged beef, halal meat is at its best
simmered slowly with full-flavored seasonings, aromatic vegetables
and spices. Likewise, the unassertive meat tastes better when
marinated or treated to a boisterous spice rub before grilling or
sauteing.
</P>
<P>
   One need look no further than a halal meat shop for cooking
inspiration: most carry cinnamon, ginger, black pepper, curry
powder, coriander, cloves and turmeric. But this selection alone
would be contrary to the spirit of halal cooking and would
needlessly limit the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Technique alone may not be enough to bring out the best in halal
meat. Sipping the tea that is customarily offered to customers in
many halal meat shops, a shopper recently complimented the brew and
asked what sort of tea leaf had been used.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah,'' Comak said at his halal market. ``It tastes good because
I make it with an open heart. If I made it any other way, the tea
would taste bitter to you.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   SAMPLING OF SHOPS
</P>
<P>
   For first-time shoppers, a halal meat shop can be confusing. The
meat is not displayed in ready-to-cook cuts. The spices and
condiments are often unfamiliar. The butcher sometimes speaks
little English and can therefore seem unhelpful.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the 30 or so halal butchers who were interviewed for
this article were knowledgeable, and once the language barrier was
surmounted, eager to please. Most shops display a poster of
standard meat cuts, and pointing, gestures and smiles make for a
common language. Many halal butchers also delight in seeing the
recipe, or a picture of the dish that a customer is shopping for.

or lamb, and toss well. Season with salt, and toss. Raise heat to
medium high, add coconut oil and continue cooking, stirring often,
until meat is brown on all sides, about 4 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Add black pepper, bird pepper, garlic, onions and red pepper,
and stir. Add chicken broth, reduce heat to low, cover pot and
simmer for an hour, checking to be sure the meat is covered with
liquid and adding water, if necessary, to cover.
</P>
<P>
   3. Add raisins and coconut, and bring the mixture to a boil.
Remove from heat, beat in the coconut milk and serve over rice,
garnished with peanuts.

 &HT;    CLINTON ORDERS STUDY OF MARKETING VIOLENT ENTERTAINMENT
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, leveling some of his strongest
crtiticism of the entertainment industry for marketing violence to
children, ordered a $1 million study Tuesday to determine whether
movie makers, TV networks and video game manufacturers
inappropriately target youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our children are being fed a dependable daily dose of
violence,'' Clinton declared in a Rose Garden ceremony in which he
displayed video game advertisements, one of which stated, ``Kill
your friends, guilt free.''
</P>
<P>
   I know this stuff sells, but that doesn't make it right,'' the
president said.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the administration's opposition to the ``Joe Camel''
advertising of the tobacco industry, Clinton said, ``If you look at
some of these ads, it's hard to argue with a straight face that the
games were made for adults in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   The presidential study of the entertainment industry's marketing
techniques will be conducted jointly by the Justice Department and
the Federal Trade Commission over the next 12 to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Both agencies have subpoena power, and White House officials
suggested that their study would use that power in order to obtain
private documents from the industry reflecting their strategy for
marketing their products to children.
</P>
<P>
   FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky, on hand for the White House
announcement, said his staff will, as in probes of the tobacco and
alcohol industries, look into the entertainment companies' internal
marketing records even if that requires subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope we could talk to these companies and get
voluntary compliance,'' Pitofsky said. ``But certainly if we feel
that we can't complete our responsibility here, we're going to turn
to compulsory processes.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno said, ``We want to work with the
entertainment industry and not against it.'' She added, ``We hope
to improve the industry's knowledge base so that it too can make
better choices that are in the best interest of parents and
children.''
</P>
<P>
   The president also used the ceremony to urge stricter
enforcement of rating codes for movies and to criticize the
television networks for including new violent programs in their
schedules for next fall. ``The time has come to show some
restraint,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a White House fact sheet cited a study last year as
saying only 9 percent of video-game rental outlets stopped minors
from renting material deemed suitable only for adults.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate response from the Motion Picture
Association of America, Hollywood's primary lobbying organization
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But last month, the group's president, Jack Valenti, cautioned
the White House and Congress against taking aim ``at easy targets''
to blame for the recent student shootings at Columbine High School
in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Littleton tragedy, however, the president has
repeatedly criticized the gun manufacturing and entertainment
industries and the gun owners lobby. The gun industry has long been
a political opponent of Clinton's, but entertainment industry
giants are among the president's staunchest financial backers.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton, joining the president at Tuesday's
ceremony, observed that the shootings at Columbine High School
``has literally pierced the heart of America'' and that consensus
is building to ``do all we can'' to change ``America's culture of
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The president and the first lady both cited studies dating back
25 years documenting links between violence in the media and the
effects it has on children's behavior. The president noted that by
the time the typical American child reaches the age of 18, he or
she has seen 200,000 dramatized acts of violence and 40,000
dramatized murders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boundary between fantasy and reality violence, which is a
clear line for most adults, can become very blurred for vulnerable
children,'' the president said. ``Kids steeped in the culture of
violence do become desensitized to it and more capable of
committing it themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the president's guests at the ceremony was 9-year Arthur
Sawe, a fourth grader in Seattle, Wash., who alerted his mother to
video game ads that touted a game as ``more fun than shooting your
neighbor's cats.'' His actions eventually brought the ad to the
attention of the news media and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I might get in trouble with my mommy,'' he said in
introducing the president, ``but instead I am here at the White
House today.''

   BRONTE, Texas _ Just off U.S. 277, about 11 miles northeast of
this West Texas town, there is a part of Texas history crumbling
away amid prickly pear cactus, spreading mesquites and a thumping
oil well pump. It is Fort Chadbourne, one of a line of U.S. forts
built in the mid-1800s to protect the settlers from angry Comanches
and to halt the Comanches' traditional trek through the West Texas
plains into Mexico. It is part of the state's history, but it

 &HT;    MONOPOLY POWER KEY ISSUE AS MICROSOFT TRIAL RESUMES
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Microsoft antitrust trial resumed Tuesday after
a three-month break with the government arguing that the software
giant had won the Internet browser wars and needed to be curbed as
an illicit monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Fisher, economics professor at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, testified that Microsoft's monopoly power
harms consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the packed federal courtroom, David Boies, the lead
Justice Department attorney, said before 10 network TV cameras that
Fisher had summarized the key points of the case while ``gently
correcting some of the errors of his former student.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies was referring to MIT professor Richard Schmalensee,
Microsoft's own economic witness, who contended earlier in the
trial that such emerging technologies as handheld computers
threaten Microsoft's Windows dominance over computer operating
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Under friendly questioning from Boies, Fisher characterized
Schmalensee's conclusion that Microsoft lacks monopoly power as
``muddled,'' ``mixed up,'' ``confused,'' and ``deeply flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great mistake to think that we are talking about
competition in software in general,'' he said at one point. ``We're
not.''
</P>
<P>
   The broader issues within the computer software industry, which
Schmalensee saw as undergoing dynamic change, are ``not relevant
here,'' Fisher said. ``This question is about the personal computer
operating system.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, who also testified for the government during the trial's
first phase, claimed that Microsoft's monopoly perch enables the
company to charge ``super-high prices'' and make ``super-high
profits'' from Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's tactics sufficiently eroded rival Netscape
Communications Corp.'s market share to rule out the chance that
software vendors would switch from Windows to Netscape as an
applications platform, Fisher claimed.
</P>
<P>
   In presenting its own rebuttal case, Microsoft is likely to
focus on America Online Inc.'s purchase of Netscape. That dealt,
originally announced as a $4.2 billion acquisition on Nov. 23,
later rose in price to around $10 billion as stock prices soared.
</P>
<P>
   The government and 19 states have accused Microsoft of using its
dominance over operating systems to gain unfair market share in
other sectors, including the browser software needed to surf the
World Wide Web.

TAX DOLLARS FOR RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS WILL CORRUPT RELIGION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is

<TEXT>
<P>
   It takes a special kind of arrogance to fly in the face of
history and the wisdom of our founding fathers. Those who are
pushing school voucher or tuition tax credit legislation in order
to fund private and religious schools ignore the fact that our
nation has enjoyed religious liberty precisely because we have kept
government and taxpayer dollars away from religion.
</P>
<P>
   School voucher systems are touted as allowing a parent to choose
a private or religious school instead of a public school for their
child.
</P>
<P>
   The taxpayer money that the state normally gives the public
school for each enrolled student would then go to the private
school the parent selects. Experience has shown, however, it's the
religious and private schools who select student applicants. The
parents don't have the choice.
</P>
<P>
   Tuition tax credit systems give parents who send their child to
a religious or private school a tax write-off on their state taxes.
In other words, it exempts parents who send their children to
private schools from the amount of tax they would normally have to
pay. It's a back-door approach to funding religious schools with
tax dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Jefferson and James Madison understood the problems with
taxing to fund church institutions. And they resisted any tax
support of religious institutions as corrosive of religions,
damaging to individual conscience, and dangerous to government.
</P>
<P>
   After Virginia repealed its tax laws in support of the Anglican
Church in 1779, some state legislators under pressure from the
Anglican Church sought to pass legislation for a general tax in
support of all Christian religions. Madison responded with his
famous `Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessment` in
which he argued that religion be left to the conviction and
conscience of the individual. Religious beliefs, he maintained,
should be `totally exempt` from the state's funding or
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Not afraid of strong, even inflammatory language, Madison wrote
against government or tax support to help establish religions,
`experience witnesseth that ecclesiastical establishments, instead
of maintaining the purity and efficacy of Religion, have had a
contrary operation ... What have been its fruits? More or less in
all places, pride and indolence in the Clergy; ignorance and
servility in the laity; in both, superstition, bigotry and
persecution.`
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, in his Statute for Establishing Religious Freedom,
which was adopted by Virginia in 1786, states that `to compel a man
to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions
which he disbelieves, is sinful and tyrannical; that even forcing
him to support this or that teacher of his own religious
persuasion, is depriving him of the comfortable liberty of giving
his contributions to the particular pastor, whose morals he would
make his pattern, and whose powers he feels more persuasive to
righteousness.`
</P>
<P>
   It should be clear that forcing anyone to pay taxes to religious
institutions violates that person's conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, 15 states are currently considering voucher systems that
would use taxpayer funds to help support religious schools. The
governors of New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Florida and Texas have urged
passage of voucher laws. And 10 states are presently considering
tuition tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the states in our country, including Wyoming
and Florida, have specific language in their declarations or bills
of rights that forbids giving tax money to any church, sect,
religious group or sectarian institution. In many of the remaining
states, the language isn't that specific, but has been understood
to forbid such a distribution of state money.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, at least two state legislatures, Alaska and Michigan,
are considering constitutional amendments to allow tax dollars to
go to religious institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Voucher and tuition tax credit plans are sold to the public as a
way for the poorer children to attend private or religious schools.
In practice, however, voucher plans do not give students the amount
of money necessary to enter most private schools. Parents must
spend additional money to pay the costs. Vouchers, where they have
been tried, have not helped students from poor families. And in
order to use the tuition tax credit, a family must have enough cash
on hand to meet the tuition and wait for tax time to have a portion
repaid.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ohio's voucher program that was just struck down by the
Ohio Supreme Court hurt the poor. The Cleveland voucher system
diverted $5.25 million from Ohio's program to aid disadvantaged
students.
</P>
<P>
   So far, however, religious organizations have been fortunate;
only one state's voucher system has withstood court challenges --
Wisconsin's.
</P>
<P>
   The state supreme court upheld the Milwaukee voucher program.
The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal. Fortunate,
because inevitably and rightfully with taxpayer dollars comes
government regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The Milwaukee voucher plan requires private and religious
schools to use `random selection` in choosing students. Two
Lutheran schools were disqualified from participating in the
voucher system based upon applicant questionnaires that favored
children raised as Lutherans. The schools were ordered to resubmit
a random selection plan by the state department of public
instruction or be denied access to the program.
</P>
<P>
   Already, those religious schools that participate in the
Wisconsin voucher system are feeling the pressure of government
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Voucher systems or tuition tax credit plans will give government
agencies the opportunity and the power to insert themselves into
religious schools. There will inevitably be state education
department evaluations of the academic programs in religious
schools. Teachers in those schools will eventually have to reach
the state's requirements for qualification as a teacher. Hiring and
firing, which in church organizations has been exempt from state or
federal labor practices, will undoubtedly fall under these laws,
after the first court challenge by someone fired from a church
school that accepts state voucher funds.
</P>
<P>
   Rightfully, when taxpayer funds are being spent for these
programs, government scrutiny of church schools will dramatically
increase. And along with increased scrutiny there will be further
state regulations.
</P>
<P>
   There is always a steep price to be paid when an organization
accepts government funds. Church schools will be no exception.
</P>
<P>
   And if government funding of a specific church denomination's
schools becomes not only important but necessary, think what
leverage that will give powerful political alliances in terms of
demanding church support in return for continued funding. How
corrosive will that be to religion?
</P>
<P>
   Only short-sighted or naive church leaders back these government
funding schemes. To keep religion free, keep it separated from
government -- that's the Jefferson-Madison message. It's true
today.

FLORIDA'S NICKNAME IN A STATE OF FLUX  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID GRIMES    
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many thanks to the readers who suggested alternatives to
``Sunshine State'' a s Florida's nickname; a tad fewer thanks to
those who think our nickname is fine as it is, and no thanks
whatsoever to the Venice woman who thought Florida's new nickname
should be, ``Florida: Where Papers Pay and Publish Rambling
Idiots.''
</P>
<P>
   (Dear R.F.: I hope you get your wish and your new license plate
is so wide and heavy that your rear bumper scrapes on the ground
when you drive. Phhhpppttt!)
</P>
<P>
   So much for that.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on to the nominations, which I would loosely classify in
three categories: Not Bad, Too Obvious, and Perhaps Congress Should
Consider a Five-Day Waiting Period for Typewriters.
</P>
<P>
   In the Not Bad category, Barbara Smith of Sarasota suggests
``The Altered State'' ``because ever since I got here people have
been telling me how much everything has changed and how much better
it used to be, but then they go on changing it.''
</P>
<P>
   This would be a good alternative nickname were it not for the
fact that outsiders, not to mention the Chamber of Commerce, will
interpret this nickname to mean that we're soft on drugs, rather
than deeply alarmed about unchecked development. Also, I believe it
is the title of a movie, which would only add to the confusion and
misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Clarence Diersing was clearly riding the same train of thought
when he came up with ``The Transient State'' ``because things are
always in a state of flux and the population is always changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Diersing apparently realized quickly that inviting more homeless
to Florida might not be a good idea for a variety of reasons, so he
came up with a second, much better, suggestion: ``The Melting Pot
State'' ``Because 1) Florida's population is composed of many
different groups of people from all parts of the world, and 2) If
you hang around all summer like we do, you will definitely melt!''
</P>
<P>
   Many people latched on the Tourist/Retiree theme, which is
certainly understandable. Many cast their ballots, so to speak, for
``The Snowbird State.'' Snowbird was so popular that some even
favored making it the state bird, if for no other reason than to
throw a wrench into the mockingbird/scrub jay debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``God's Waiting Room'' got several votes, though you've got to
think the ACLU would tie that one up in court forever.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the ornithological theme, Gordon Mills of
Sarasota suggested ``Early Birdland,'' apparently making reference
to some people's penchant for late-afternoon dining, not their
taste for earthworms.
</P>
<P>
   Some people think our license plates should send a message to
tourists. Jim Brenock of Sarasota suggested ``We're Glad You're
Gone for the Summer'' and Carlton Martin of Holmes Beach was
thinking along the same lines with ``Come Visit But Don't Stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of tourists, the anti-Disney contingent also had
something to say. ``The Mickey Mouse State'' was a popular
suggestion and I like it, too, except I fear it will only inspire
Michael Eisner to even greater depredations.
</P>
<P>
   Weather and critters weighed heavily on the minds of some
respondents. ``The Hurricane State'' got a lot of votes, though I
think the folks in North Carolina may have something to say about
that one.
</P>
<P>
   Mosquitoes, alligators and cockroaches had their advocates,
though I was rather disappointed that no one shared my enthusiasm
for the lowly love bug.
</P>
<P>
   Several voted for ``The Lightning State,'' a plausible
suggestion given our leadership in that category. However, I
believe a Tampa Bay sports team calls itself that, and it hasn't
proven particularly lucky. Similarly, we probably want to avoid
intra-state squabbles with our new nickname, which rules out
Gators, Seminoles and even Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   Some folks in Arizona got wind of this contest and many wrote to
wonder what the heck I was complaining about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calling yourself `The Sunshine State' is kind of presumptuous,
inasmuch as Arizona gets more days of sunshine per year than does
Florida. We also have a higher rate of melanoma in Tucson than you
do, so melanoma state is out,'' said Don LaVanway of Green ``it's
not really green'' Valley, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Penny, also of Arizona, points out that Tucson, known as
``The Old Pueblo,'' tried to change its name to ``The Sunshine
Factory'' a few years ago and has since changed back to ``The Old
Pueblo.'' I don't bring this up for any reason other than point out
that it is never too late to correct the error of our ways.
</P>
<P>
   Some other suggestions I liked include ``The Lawnmower State,''
``Whatever Happened to the Lotto Money State,'' ``The Strip-Mall
State,'' ``Giant Theme Park Overkill State,'' ``Armadillos Make
Good Eating State'' and ``The Mildew State.''
</P>
<P>
   My favorite? A tough call. But I think we've got to go with the
suggestion of Marty Hahne, who said he came up with this one after
breathing bug spray all morning:
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida: The Optional Stop On Red State.''
</P>

 &HT;    South Africans go to polls in all-race elections
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The task awaiting Thabo Mbeki must seem like following Muhammad
Ali as heavyweight champion or succeeding George Washington as
president.
</P>
<P>
   Voters are lining up at polling places across South Africa today
to participate in the country's second all-race elections. If the
results go as has been widely predicted, Mbeki will become the
country's new president _ succeeding Nelson Mandela, the
prisoner-turned-president and Nobel Peace Prize winner who inspires
reverence both inside and outside South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Today's elections are to choose a new parliament. Polls show
that the African National Congress party _ Mandela's party _ will
again win an overwhelming victory. The newly elected members will
convene June 16 to choose the new president, Mbeki, who has already
succeeded Mandela as party leader.
</P>
<P>
   The only question most analysts have is whether the ANC will win
the two-thirds majority that would enable the party to amend the
constitution without the votes of other parties. Opponents have
urged voters to deny the ANC that margin, saying it is a mistake to
hand too much to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela, 80, will retire having realized most of his dreams. Not
only has South Africa's governmental oppression of the black
majority been overturned, but Mandela is credited by many with
fostering a spirit of forgiveness and racial reconciliation that,
while far from complete, has progressed further than almost anyone
predicted a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki will face much different challenges. Unemployment is 38
percent. Rampant crime is discouraging foreign investment. Wealth
remains concentrated in white hands, while many blacks lack
adequate schools, housing, water and electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki, who turns 57 this month (and whose name is pronounced
TAH-bo mm-BECK-y), is the son of Govan Mbeki, a prominent ANC
activist who spent time imprisoned with Mandela. The younger Mbeki
spent most of his life in exile, earning a master's degree at
Sussex University in England, undergoing guerilla training in the
Soviet Union and serving the ANC as a spokesman, diplomat and
negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   He has left his Marxist leanings behind, and has advocated an
``African renaissance'' based on devotion to African culture
combined with free-market capitalism. No sudden shifts in policy
are expected, as Mbeki, now deputy president, has already been
overseeing the day-to-day operations of the government as Mandela
concentrated on broader themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thabo has been running the government for several years,''
Mandela said recently, ``and I have only been the nominal
president.''
</P>

A COOL AND CREEPY SUMMER FOR BOOK-LOVERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It was the best of times, it was the worst of times ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Where new books are concerned, Summer '99 is half of Charles
Dickens' famous line from ``A Tale of Two Cities.'' The ``good''
half. Whether you like fiction or nonfiction, finely crafted
literature or blood-and-sex potboilers, Bob Woodward or Patricia
Cornwell, the next few months offer the perfect books for you. Even
Ralph Ellison and Ernest Hemingway are back from the grave. There
may never have been a better, more eclectic batch of
June/July/August titles to take to the beach or the mountains or
just to read while scrunched up in your favorite chair at home.
</P>
<P>
   They will include:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hannibal'' by Thomas Harris (Dell/Delacorte, $27.95).
</P>
<P>
   You want this book because: Hannibal Lecter's back, and nobody
writes a creepier whodunit than Harris. It would be almost
impossible for ``Hannibal'' to live up to its advance hype, but
they've been saying that about ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom
Menace,'' and the lines outside movie theaters remain long. The
publisher has ordered 1 million copies for ``Hannibal's'' first
printing; 100,000 is the average for a sure-fire bestseller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juneteenth,'' by Ralph Ellison (Random House, $25).
</P>
<P>
   You want this book because: The deceased author was a literary
treasure. ``Invisible Man'' remains a classic, and we can assume or
at least hope canny posthumous editing will result in a novel that
is almost if not equally as insightful and moving. It's unusual for
much-anticipated ``literary'' fiction to be released during the
summer, when lighter reading fare is the tradition, but the title
makes the June 19 release date obligatory. (''Juneteenth'' is the
annual celebration of June 19, 1865, when Texas slaves finally
learned they had been emancipated by Abraham Lincoln two years
earlier.)
</P>
<P>
   The plot involves a racist senator, who, shot by a would-be
assassin, calls to his side a black preacher he has known since
childhood. Their tangled relationship can be viewed as a microcosm
of 1960s American race relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black Notice,'' by Patricia Cornwell (Putnam, $25.95).
</P>
<P>
   You want this book because: Cornwell's brainchild, Dr. Kay
Scarpetta, is once again on the trail of a fiendish serial killer,
this one imported to the United States from France. As usual,
Cornwell's graphic descriptions of autopsies and Scarpetta's
ongoing emotional flounderings fill up lots of fast-paced pages.
Fans of the series will not be disappointed; this is the best
Scarpetta yarn in years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shadow: Five Presidents and the Legacy of Watergate,'' by Bob
Woodward (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $27.50).
</P>
<P>
   You want this book because: The author is arguably the American
journalist who has the most insights (and sources) involving modern
American government. True, some of Woodward's last books have been
tired tomes crammed with rehashed political gossip. ``Five
Presidents'' is rumored to be much, much better.
</P>
<P>
   ``True at First Light,'' by Ernest Hemingway, edited by Patrick
Hemingway (Scribner, $26.)
</P>
<P>
   You want this book because: Ernest Hemingway wrote it, sort of.
Son Patrick reworked a dusty, previously unpublished 800-page
manuscript about one of Papa's African dalliances. This being the
100th anniversary of Hemingway's birth, his fans will gladly invest
$26 to see whether ``True at First Light'' might be a final,
glorious gift from a great writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buxton Spice,'' by Oonya Kempadoo (Dutton, $21.95).
</P>
<P>
   You want this book because: Advance buzz has Kempadoo pegged as
the hot new writer of '99. She's a native of Guyana, and, natch,
this tale of young Lula and her hometown of Tamarind Grove is set
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The First World War,'' by John Keegan (Knopf, $35).

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Unsettled weather will cover most of the Western states
Wednesday as an expansive whirlpool of high-level chill moves
southeast from the Pacific Northwest. Clusters of showers and some
strong thunderstorms will develop near the west slopes of the
central and northern Rockies during afternoon as a series of jet
stream disturbances embedded in the whirlpool cause the moist,
unstable air to rise rapidly. Strong wind gusts and hail will
accompany some of the storms especially in Wyoming and Montana.
Farther west, unseasonably cool air will surge south through the
Pacific Northwest. Scattered coastal and mountain showers will
occur in the chilly air.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the day will have ample sunshine from the eastern
Rockies to the central Mississippi Valley. Late in the day, potent
thunderstorms will erupt from the eastern slopes of the Rockies to
the western Plains as the disturbance over the Western states moves
slowly east. Clusters of strong thunderstorms will continue into
the night over the western and central Plains, but tranquil
conditions will linger farther east.
</P>
<P>
   Warm and humid weather will persist over most of the East.
Coastal areas will have a mixture of clouds and limited hazy
sunshine with little chance for rain. Meanwhile, showers and
thunderstorms will develop from the eastern Ohio and Tennessee
valleys to the Appalachians as a sluggish cold front moves east. In
the wake of the front, clouds will linger for a time, but less
humid conditions will spread across the northern Mississippi Valley
and Great Lakes states during the day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Hurricane Season &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The six-month Atlantic hurricane season began Tuesday, but the
most active time in the season is still a few months away. Although
tropical oceans have warmed above the 80 degree temperature
threshold for hurricane development, vigorous winds near 50,000
feet will rip apart most seedling clusters of thunderstorms roaming
the Atlantic. These winds will relax as the summer progresses, with
the heart of hurricane season arriving in the middle of September.
A normal season produces 10 tropical storms, six of which reach
hurricane status with winds of at least 65 knots. &QL;

UNDATED: Knopf, $35). 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You want this book because: Megabestselling novelist Tom Clancy
declares Keegan ``is the best historian working today, period.''
All Keegan's books condense complex military strategy into
understandable, gripping prose that reads like the finest fiction.
Besides, read this 700-page monster on the beach and you'll impress
everyone with your intellectualism and bulging biceps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Timbuktu,'' by Paul Auster (Holt, $22).
</P>
<P>
   You want this book because: Paul Auster is arguably the finest
living American writer, period. His novels are each brilliantly
crafted and fabulously quirky; ``Timbuktu,'' for instance, views
the world through the eyes of Mr. Bones, a dog who follows his
grubby master on a Don Quixote-like adventure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comrades,'' by Stephen Ambrose (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $21).
</P>
<P>
   You want this book because: Ambrose's gritty, unsentimental
style is perfect for creating word portraits of a dozen men whose
courage, ambition and/or downright decency set them apart. Another
critic has referred to ``Comrades'' as ``Ambrose Lite''; a better
term would be ``Ambrose reader-friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``White Oleander,'' by Janet Fitch (Little, Brown, $24).
</P>
<P>
   You want this book because: Oprah said so, and, for the first
time in a while, her TV Book Club selection has launched an obscure
novel onto the bestseller list. In truth, this yarn, narrated by
12-year-old Astrid as she grows up in a series of foster homes
while her mother serves out a jail term, is populated with
predictable characters; the writing isn't all that great if you
break it down sentence by sentence. Somehow, though, the sum of the
whole overcomes the mediocrity of the parts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nudist on the Late Shift and Other True Tales of Silicon
Valley,'' by Po Bronson (Random House, $25).
</P>
<P>
   You want this book because: It's nice to learn that people who
struck it rich are even dafter than the rest of us. We've always
assumed that entrepreneurs in this Bay Area high-tech enclave were
oddballs _ Apple's Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak were the first
early examples _ and Bronson assures us they are in especially
entertaining ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Granny Dan,'' by Danielle Steel (Delacorte, $19.95).
</P>
<P>
   You want this book because: You always enjoy Steel's
adjective-laden, hormone-pulsating prose. This time around, a
lovely 17-year-old faces the dangers and excitement of 1902 Russia.
The big love scene begins on Page 102, if you want to skip ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farewell: A Memoir of Texas Childhood,'' by Horton Foote
(Scribner, $24).
</P>
<P>
   You want this book because: Among all these other books,
``Farewell'' may be the best. Foote, one of Texas's most beloved
wordsmiths, hits new literary heights with recollections of a
childhood spent among colorful relatives and family friends.
</P>
<P>
   Also noteworthy:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Girl's Guide to Hunting and Fishing,'' by Melissa Banks
(Viking, $23.95): Banks' agent got this book extra publicity by
offering it only to female publishing-house buyers. It's funny in
several places, but not as consistently hilarious as Viking
publicists would like you to believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Turn of the Century,'' by Kurt Andersen (Random House,
$24.95): Because Andersen is already so well-known as a staff
writer for New Yorker magazine, this failed attempt at social and
political satire has received far more attention than it deserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Whole Woman,'' by Germaine Greer (Knopf, $25): ``The
Female Eunuch'' taught us that anger tempered with common sense is
constructive; ``The Whole Woman'' proves that anger tempered with
more anger is simply bile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Stranger Here Myself,'' by Bill Bryson (Broadway, $25):
Bryson is the funniest author among all modern-day humorists. This
collection of short essays about the whiny expatriot's return to
America is hysterically entertaining enough to bring a smile to the
face of, well, Germaine Greer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deadlines &AMP; Datelines,'' by Dan Rather (Morrow, $23): Hey, Tom
Brokaw had a bestseller with ``The Greatest Generation,'' didn't
he? Even if this collection of career anecdotes proves Rather
doesn't have much to say in print, he doesn't want to be left out.

   TONY-AWARDS (New York) _ When did Broadway become the provinces?
The suspicion has been hovering for several decades, now that the
once-sophisticated mecca of American theater is really just a mall
in Squaresville: a forum for automated theme park shows, with doses
of high culture provided by visitors from more adventurous places.
All the same, when the Tony Award nominations were announced last
month, they seemed to offer especially disheartening confirmation
of the idea, giving off what Lorenz Hart once described as ``the
faint aroma of performing seals.'' It's not that there won't be
things to celebrate at the Gershwin Theater Sunday night, when the
awards are handed out. (The live telecast will begin at 8 p.m. on

   END-OF-AFFAIR-FILM (London) _ The remake of Graham Greene's
``End of the Affair'' by the screenwriter and director Neil Jordan
has recently finished its six-week shoot in various spots around
England, including London, where streets were turned back into
those of wartime and its aftermath. The movie, which is tentatively
scheduled for release at the end of the year, stars Ralph Fiennes
as Maurice Bendrix, the jealous novelist who falls passionately in
love with a married woman and whose tortured narration describes
the sad unraveling of the affair. Julianne Moore plays Bendrix's
lover, Sarah Miles, a woman who makes a devil's bargain with God
himself. And Stephen Rea, the melancholy staple of Jordan films,
plays Henry, Sarah's husband, whose asexual dullness conceals a
deep reservoir of emotion. By Sarah Lyall. &QL;

   SOCIAL-CLUB-FILM (Undated) _ A sadness permeates Wim Wenders'

   COWARD-THEATER (New York) _ His name notwithstanding, he missed
being born on Christmas by more than a week. His name
notwithstanding, he was a brave man, brave enough to fire off
epigrams for the West End in London in the wake of Oscar Wilde. The
world has not forgotten Noel Coward (eventually Sir Noel),
playwright of ``Hay Fever'' and ``Private Lives,''
composer-lyricist of ``Mad About the Boy'' and ``Mad Dogs and
Englishmen,'' unmatched interpreter of his own mischief. Sheridan
Morley, the London theater critic for The Spectator and Playbill,
summed up Coward's genius in the title of his biography, the first:
``A Talent to Amuse.'' Coward died in 1973. Were he alive, he would
be celebrating his 100th birthday on Dec. 16. One of many

Morley's Off Broadway valentine, ``If Love Were All,'' opens on

Graham's company in 1982 to run her own troupe, has taken an
unusual step by sharing artistic direction equally with her spouse,
the former Graham dancer David Brown. On Tuesday, when the company
long known as Elisa Monte Dance opens a two-week season at the
Joyce Theater, the marquee for the first time will read Monte/Brown
Dance. The dancers will perform three new works by Brown along with
two by Ms. Monte. The couple shares credit for a sixth new piece,
``Run to the Rock,'' a rhapsodic solo danced to Nina Simone's husky
rendition of ``Sinnerman.'' By Christopher Reardon. &QL;

   SANFRAN-MUSIC (Berkeley, Calif.) _ They probably didn't plan it
that way, but San Francisco's leading classical-music organizations
will come into an interesting collision this week. At the War
Memorial Opera House, the San Francisco Opera will stir up pagan
ecstasy with several complete cycles of Richard Wagner's ``Ring of
the Nibelung,'' beginning on Wednesday. Meanwhile, beginning on
Thursday across the street at Davies Symphony Hall, and in a couple
of other spots around town (including a Roman Catholic church),
Michael Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco Symphony will celebrate
the life and times of Igor Stravinsky, who loved to bill himself as
Wagner's Antichrist, and for whom the ``Ring,'' with its ``miasmic
vapors'' and its labyrinth of leitmotifs, amounted to nothing more
than ``a sort of vast musical city directory.'' By Richard
Taruskin. &QL;

   WAGNER-RING (Undated) _ Once again, the Wagnerites are
descending on San Francisco for the four-day spiritual adventure
that is the ``Ring of the Nibelung,'' offered in four overlapping
cycles, beginning on Wednesday. The production, unveiled in 1985,
last saw service in 1990. Of the original principals, the Wotan of
James Morris remains. Along with the new cast of other gods,
giants, dwarves and assorted demigods _ among them, the redoubtable
Jane Eaglen as Brunnhilde _ the current edition also introduces a

version that probably makes the most sense in the age of Monicagate
and the Washington follies, suggests that it's people's little

are really the products of mood swings and temper tantrums. ``The
Sopranos,'' the groundbreaking HBO series that begins reruns of its
first 13 episodes on Wednesday at 9 p.m., subscribes to this absurd
view. Ruffled pride, paranoia and childish score settling, rather
than any grand plan, determine its characters' fates. By Stephen

WALL STREET JOURNAL EUROPE, GERMAN PAPER ANNOUNCE PARTNERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Hoping to fend off the Financial Times of
London in Continental Europe, Dow Jones &AMP; Co. on Tuesday announced
an alliance with Germany's biggest daily business newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, Dow Jones agreed to exchange a stake in the Wall
Street Journal Europe for a stake in Handelsblatt, owned by
Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck of Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The newspapers plan to use each other's reporting, with each
allowing the other to translate and publish its material on the
same day.
</P>
<P>
   The new alliance is the latest turn in a heated rivalry to
dominate Europe's business press.
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Times, owned by Pearson PLC, has teamed up with
the German magazine publisher Gruner &AMP; Jahr to introduce a new
German-language version of its salmon-colored daily.
</P>
<P>
   Employing about 100 reporters and editors in Germany, the
newspaper is expected to start later this year and compete directly
with Handelsblatt.
</P>
<P>
   Dieter von Holtzbrinck, chairman of Holtzbrinck in Duesseldorf,
said his partnership with the Journal was not a defensive reaction
to The Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a reaction, but it is really a coincidence,'' he
said at a news conference here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Elliott House, president of Dow Jones International, said
the alliance would strengthen both papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point here is not to homogenize these two publications,''
she said. ``We want to use our relative strengths to enhance each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Established in 1983, the Wall Street Journal Europe says its
circulation is about 70,000, with about 57,000 outside Britain. The
Financial Times claims a circulation of about 367,000, about
113,000 in Continental Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe's increasingly integrated economy, the competition to
dominate its business media has become increasingly important and
heated.
</P>
<P>
   The newest stage of the rivalry poses an intriguing test for two
opposing language strategies in Europe's polyglot market.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because English is the most common denominator for many
Europeans, both the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal
Europe come closer than any other daily newspapers to being
Europe-wide publications.
</P>
<P>
   But the German-speaking region of Europe is substantial _ more
than 80 million people in Germany plus those in Austria and much of
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Dow Jones refuses to provide financial details about the Wall
Street Journal Europe, though the company says it has been
profitable for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Holtzbrinck, owned by the Holtzbrinck family, is one of
Germany's biggest publishing and media groups. Besides
Handelsblatt, it owns book publishers including Henry Holt, Farrar
Straus &AMP; Giroux in the United States, and scientific and technical
journals and the influential German weekly Die Zeit.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Holtzbrinck will acquire 49 percent of the
Wall Street Journal Europe, while Dow Jones will acquire 22 percent
of Handelsblatt. In addition, Holtzbrinck is acquiring part of Dow
Jones' minority stakes in a Czech publishing venture and the German
financial news agency VWD.

 &HT;    Lighthouse being readied for new location as residents voice
concerns about move
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUXTON, N.C. _ As a brisk breeze hinted at the official start of
the Atlantic hurricane season, moving expert Peter Friesen said
Tuesday not even powerful winds would deter this month's relocation
of the 129-year-old Cape Hatteras Lighthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it is not going to fall over,'' Friesen said as workers
made final preparations for the historic Outer Banks beacon's
disputed move, expected to start in mid-June and take a month.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many opponents of the move are Dare County officials,
who sued in federal court to block the $11.8 million federal
project but decided to drop the lawsuit in April. They had argued
that once the lighthouse was moved, the sand dunes and man-made
erosion control barriers that had protected the tower would be
allowed to deteriorate. According to the suit, erosion would
threaten nearby N.C. 12 and the fishing and tourist village of
Buxton, washed over by Hurricane Emily in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``The locals who fought hard to stop the move of this lighthouse
are now waiting to see what will happen,'' said Dewey Parr, 68, a
Buxton businessman and a columnist for The Island Breeze, a local
newspaper. ``They are not wanting it to fall. It is the most
treasured monument we've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   National Park Service officials said contractors have taken
precautions, including the installation of monitors to signal
whether the 200-foot-tall lighthouse leans or existing cracks
worsen during the relocation. As it is being moved, the tower could
withstand hurricane winds up to 180 mph, said Friesen, of Lynden,
Wash., who has moved more than 4,000 buildings, including three New
England lighthouses.
</P>
<P>
   The company moving the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse, International
Chimney Corp. of Buffalo, N.Y., hired 77-year-old Friesen as a
consultant for the critical job of lifting and pushing the
lighthouse to its new home 2,900 feet inland.
</P>
<P>
   The preparation work since January has been tedious, slow and
sandy, with a stream of tourists snapping pictures from a nearby
parking lot. The black-and-white candy-striped lighthouse,
threatened by waves striking 150 feet from its base, is now closed
to the public. It is scheduled to reopen in a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a big waste of money,'' said Cecil Pope, 49, of
Richmond, Va., vacationing this week on North Carolina's Outer
Banks. ``I would say just let things go.''
</P>
<P>
   Based upon the recommendation of the National Academy of
Sciences that moving the lighthouse would be the best way to
protect it, the National Park Service secured congressional funding
to relocate the lighthouse and three other structures. Two are
houses once occupied by lighthouse keepers, and the third is a
brick building that once stored oil for the lighthouse flame.
``Anything can happen,'' said Friesen, who nearly tumbled out of a
pickup truck during the news briefing when the tailgate popped open
as the truck traveled along the lighthouse's route. ``But we've
always got it under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Crews have chipped away the lighthouse's granite underpinnings
and braced its base and sides with temporary supports. Seven
massive steel beams have been slid under the tower's base.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Friday or Saturday, 100 hydraulic jacks attached to the
steel beams will begin the week-long process of lifting the tower
five feet from its sandy hole. Once the lighthouse is lifted, crews
will begin replacing the temporary supports underneath the
lighthouse with ``roll beams.'' Attached to those beams are 100
metal rollers, which will travel along a mat of hardened steel laid
out in the lighthouse's path. Underneath the steel is a foot of
gravel over packed sand. Hydraulic devices will then push the
lighthouse, traveling up to 100 feet during a 12-hour workday,
until it finally arrives at its recently poured concrete
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be boring,'' Friesen said, ``if you are going to
spend days watching.''

U.S. OFFICIALS SOUND FLEXIBLE AS PEACE EFFORT GAINS STEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL And ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States moved Tuesday to bolster
accelerating diplomatic efforts to end the 70-day-old conflict in
Yugoslavia by signaling a willingness to suspend allied bombing and
to consider a smaller U.S. role in a post-war security force in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon announced that U.S.-led air strikes will ease in
Kosovo beginning on Thursday to permit air drops of humanitarian
supplies by civilian aircraft arranged by the private International
Rescue Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials voiced new U.S. flexibility on
the eve of Wednesday's peace mission to Belgrade by former Russian
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin and Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari, the Balkan envoy for the 15-nation European Union.
</P>
<P>
   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who coordinated delicate
preparations for the mission during meetings in Bonn with
Chernomyrdin, Ahtisaari and U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott, struck an optimistic note.
</P>
<P>
   The Belgrade-bound envoys ``are on the way of finding a
political solution to the conflict'' with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, Schroeder said.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott, a confidante of President Clinton and fluent Russian
speaker who has been leading U.S. efforts to fashion a U.S.-Russian
peace plan, was more cautious. The envoys' success ``depends on
hard decisions by the Belgrade leadership,'' Talbott said in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials in Washington said the envoys
would press Milosevic to clarify his announcement that Yugoslavia
is willing to halt the ouster of ethnic Albanian Muslims from
Kosovo, withdraw most of the 40,000 Serbian troops from Kosovo and
accept an international security force authorized by the U.N.
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials said in a letter delivered Tuesday to German
officials that Milosevic will accept ``a United Nations presence,
mandate and other elements to be decided by a U.N. Security Council
resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the envoys need to
see Milosevic personally because ``it is important for there to be
an explanation by Milosevic as to what it is he means.''
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart opened the door to
suspension of U.S.-led bombing raids as well as a smaller U.S. role
in the post-war security force planned to oversee the return of
more than one million Kosovo refugees to their homes inside the
Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have long avoided public discussion of a
suspension of the bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have basically said what we need to see to see a
suspension,'' Lockhart told reporters. ``We've been very clear on
what they need to do for a suspension of the bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   To win a bombing halt, Lockhart said, Milosevic must halt ethnic
cleansing in Kosovo, begin troop withdrawals and agree to allied
conditions for a post-war security force.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart also raised the possibility that the Clinton
administration might consider a post-war international security
force for Kosovo with a smaller U.S. contingent than previously
envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   A smaller U.S. component might address Milosevic's demands that
troops from the United States, Britain and France be excluded from
the post-war security force because the nations' forces took part
in the grueling bombardment of his country for more than two
months.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said it is ``difficult to imagine'' that a post-war
security force in Kosovo could be effective without U.S.
participation. But he added that the White House would be willing
to ``take a look'' at a plan for a reduced U.S. role.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the White House will only insist that the
international security force that heads into Kosovo be clearly
under NATO's command, with clear lines of authority.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said Clinton was expected to announce the
U.S. share of the peace-keeping force during a commencement address
at the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo., on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the U.S. component of the
peace-keeping force will be no more than 15 percent of the
50,000-member post-war security force or about 7,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in a Memorial Day address at Arlington National
Cemetery on Monday, underscored that the United States will take a
more modest role than it took in 1995 when U.S. forces made up half
of the 60,000- strong allied force that went into Bosnia to enforce
a U.S.-brokered peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this military campaign, the United States has borne a large
share of the burden, as we must, because we have a greater capacity
to bear that burden,'' Clinton declared. ``But all Americans should
know ... that when the peacekeeping force goes in there, the
overwhelming majority of people will be European.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahtisaari said that the composition of the post-war
international security force in Kosovo ``is something that we
should look as a practical issue and not try to politicize it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahtisaari said the international security force that heads into
Kosovo has to be able to create a secure environment that will
encourage displaced Kosovar refugees to return to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   That means that the participation of ``certain countries is of
vital importance so that we can create that security feeling _
which is absolutely vital,'' Ahtisaari said.

 &HT;    `Musical shoe' would have children tapping their feet
 &HT;    By Gene Tharpe
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Will Van Straden, an opera singer, is serious about
music _ but he also wants it to be fun for amateur musicians,
especially children. That wish led to his being issued U.S. Patent
5855080 in January.
</P>
<P>
   The patent protects a ``musical shoe'' that's played by tapping
your feet. But this isn't your old-fashioned tap-dance shoe. Van
Straden's shoe is battery-powered and plays music with an
electronic sound similar to a keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   Van Straden, a Netherlands native who now lives in Atlanta, was
sitting at a piano one day and picking out a tune.
</P>
<P>
   And, as so many musicians and would-be musicians do, he was
tapping his feet as he played.
</P>
<P>
   That's when he had the idea for a musical shoe that would be
simple to play, that would play music with a ``non-annoying'' sound
that could be turned off when the player _ or parents _ wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each shoe has eight color-coded buttons embedded in the bottom
of the sole, and each button plays one of eight notes in an octave,
which means different tunes can be played,'' said Van Straden, 41.
One shoe has eight notes in a lower octave, the other eight notes
in a higher octave.
</P>
<P>
   As some people can ``play by ear'' on pianos, some people would
be able to ``play by foot,'' picking out tunes as they step on the
buttons.
</P>
<P>
   For those who have no sense of music, they could use simple
sheet music, pointing out which buttons, and in what sequence, to
step on to play a tune.
</P>
<P>
   The small batteries, a switch and other electronic elements of
the music apparatus can be embedded in the rubber soles of sport
shoes or other types of casual shoes.
</P>
<P>
   When turned off, the shoes are regular shoes. When turned on,
tunes can be played while strolling down the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more of a novelty item than anything else, but I think
children would love the shoes,'' said Van Straden, who works
through a New York agent to sing with various opera companies in
the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is the place to be for novelties and toys,'' he said.
``It's a multibillion-dollar market.''
</P>
<P>
   He is seeking a manufacturer to make and market the shoes.

 &HT;    Air system nearly ready for 2000, FAA reports
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The millennium bug hasn't shut down a single computer
at the Federal Aviation Administration, but it has still given the
agency that regulates the country's air space a pretty rough ride
in the past several months.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Congress gave the FAA a failing grade for its
efforts to prepare its vast network of computer systems for the Y2K
bug. And that report generated lots of negative publicity for the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   But the FAA and the airlines say the brickbats from Congress and
the media are undeserved. Industry and agency officials say the
nation's air traffic control systems will be Y2K-compliant by the
end of June.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, 92 percent of the air traffic control network is
Y2K-compliant. The remaining 8 percent is being fixed now.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, for example, the work at Hartsfield International
Airport is 98 percent complete. Only two minor subsystems remain to
be fixed, say FAA officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be Y2K-compliant six months ahead of schedule,'' says
Dennis Koehler, division manager for air traffic services in the
FAA's Southern region, which includes Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   To demonstrate how safe the air traffic system is, the head of
the FAA plans to fly all day long across the country on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the FAA has spent $340 million on its Y2K project.
</P>
<P>
   If the FAA has done such a good job, why then has it received so
much bad press about its Y2K efforts? Koehler attributes it to a
difference in perception.
</P>
<P>
   The agency got its failing grade from Congress because it missed
a May 1 deadline set by congressmen for federal agencies to be
Y2K-compliant.
</P>
<P>
   But the FAA says it missed the deadline on purpose, having
decided to take more time in ensuring its 636 computer systems
would recognize the year 2000, says Koehler.
</P>
<P>
   On April 10-11, the agency did a test run of Y2K-complaint
systems at the Denver airport. The test was completed without a
hitch.
</P>
<P>
   But the FAA says it wasn't satisfied. It wanted another month to
analyze the data from the test, comparing the findings to current
operations at airports nationwide. The agency also hired an
independent consultant to verify its Y2K fixes and tests.
</P>
<P>
   Koehler says that analysis is complete and passed the test. Now
the FAA is in the final phase of implementing its Y2K fixes across
the country.

 By Kim Severson  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; An expensive new margarinelike spread that
promises to lower your cholesterol level hit grocery store shelves
last week.
<P>
   Called Benecol, the spread promises to cut LDL cholesterol
levels by as much as 14 percent if consumers eat at least three
11/2 teaspoon servings a day.
</P>
<P>
   The figures are based on study published last year in the New
England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration earlier this month cleared the
way for spreads like Benecol, which are among the first wave of
``nutraceuticals'' or ``functional foods.'' The products are
fortified with compounds targeting specific health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other low-cholesterol margarines that help limit intake
of LDL _ the most harmful type of cholesterol _ Benecol promises to
help stop the body from absorbing cholesterol. Some studies
indicate that, in addition to blocking bad cholesterol, it also
blocks the good.
</P>
<P>
   The secret in Benecol is stanol ester, a plant compound
extracted from pine fiber used to make paper. Several studies,
including a long-term look at 500 people in Finland who ate Benecol
regularly over several years, showed reductions in cholesterol by
as much as 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The spread is sold in 5-ounce boxes of 21 individual servings
for $4.50-$5.50 at several supermarkets and pharmacies, including
Safeway, Lucky, Walgreens and Long's.
</P>
<P>
   Benecol's manufacturers report the spread has no harmful side
effects. However, other studies show that, in some people, the body
compensates for loss of cholesterol by producing more of it. And
the absorption of some nutrients, like beta-carotene and lycopene,
which help the body fight heart disease and cancer, may be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   But the small amounts recommended aren't a risk, says Liz
Applegate, a professor of nutrition at the University of California
at Davis, who discusses Benecol in her latest book, ``Eat Your Way
to a Healthy Heart'' (Prentice Hall, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually quite safe,'' she says. People consume small
amounts of naturally occurring stanol esters every day, she says.
</P>
<P>
   But, Applegate warns, it doesn't mean you can put Benecol on
your bagel and then slather it with cream cheese or eat a plate of
bacon and eggs and hope to attain lower cholesterol levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the point. You need to eat it as part of a
heart-healthy diet,'' she notes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Benecol should be substituted for other butters or margarines,
not eaten in addition to them, she says.
</P>
<P>
   The light version, which isn't recommended for cooking but is
slightly sweeter and less greasy than the regular version, has 3
grams of fat and 30 calories per 11/2 teaspoons. The regular
version contains 5 grams of fat _ some of it unhealthy saturated
fat _ and 45 calories per 1 teaspoon serving.
</P>
<P>
   McNeil Consumer Healthcare, the pharmaceutical arm of Johnson &AMP;
Johnson, created the product. For a look at the studies behind the
new spread, see McNeil's Web site at  &LR; www.benecol.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Look for other spreads using stanol ester to be on supermarket
shelves soon. Among them is Take Control, a product from Lipton
that promises a 7 percent to 10 percent reduction in cholesterol
levels.

TASTER'S CHOICE  
  
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON   By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  People may be looking for shortcuts, but when it
comes to margaritas, the answer does not lie in prepared mixes.
Today's panel tasted nine mixes from grocers' shelves, freezers and
refrigerator cases, but only one broke the 50-point mark.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unlike a homemade margaritas, the mixes were composed primarily
of water and high-fructose corn syrup. Only one had fresh lime
juice; the others were made with concentrates or with a blend of
citric acid and natural and artificial flavors.
</P>
<P>
   The panel tasted the mixes plain and then combined with the
amount of tequila recommended by each product manufacturer.
Panelists were divided on what they liked and disliked, but all
agreed that none of the mixes produced a margarita even close to a
homemade version.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Sauza  &LR; (1-liter bottle, $2.99 at Beverages &AMP; More!) took top
honors. One panelist described it as nicely balanced, and another
thought it tasted like a ``classic margarita.'' But others
perceived a chemical flavor and aroma. Two would buy it, two might
buy it, and one would not.
</P>
<P>
   Two products tied for second place:  &UR; Bacardi &LR;  (10-ounce frozen
can, $1.99 at many supermarkets) and  &UR; Mr.&AMP; Mrs. T &LR;  (1 liter, $3.99
at many supermarkets).
</P>
<P>
   With Bacardi, two panelists thought the proportion of tequila to
mix was too high. One panelist liked the mix alone but not with
tequila. But another thought it looked ``like fresh-squeezed lime
juice.'' One would buy it, two might buy it, and two would not.
</P>
<P>
   One taster liked Mr. &AMP; Mrs. T with tequila added, and another
thought it was well balanced even though the finish was bitter. But
others detected a medicinal taste. One would buy it, two might buy
it, two would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jose Cuervo &LR;  (1 liter, $3.99 at many supermarkets) scored one
point lower than Bacardi and Mr. &AMP; Mrs. T. One panelist described
its taste as clean with a ``good sour finish.'' But others thought
it was not balanced and tasted bitter. One would buy it, one might
buy it, and three would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Trader Joe's  &LR; (32-ounce refrigerated jug, $1.99 at Trader
Joe's) _ the only brand with fresh juices _ scored just one point
lower than Jose Cuervo. Despite the fact that the label said it was
made with fresh juices, two panelists thought it tasted artificial.
One likened it to limeade, but others found it bracing and sharp.
Two would buy it; three would not.
</P>
<P>
   Four mixes scored too low to rate: Ruffner, Finest Call, Major
Pete's and Ass Kickin'.

 EDITORS NOTE: Marion Cunningham, best known for her revisions
of  the Fannie Farmer cookbooks, now crusades to get more people
to 
 cook at home. This column, based on her book ``Learning to Cook 
 With Marion Cunningham'' (Knopf, 1999), is expected to be 
 available every two weeks from the San Francisco Chronicle via 
 New York Times News Service. It especially targets novice cooks. 
 &HT;     This week, we present the main story, a sidebar on preparing 
 fruit for dessert and the recipe for the main-dish soup.   LEARNING TO COOK: Try Corn Soup and Tortillas for Supper  
   
 By Marion Cunningham  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Mexican Corn Soup makes a very good supper, served
with warm tortillas. Put small dishes of sour cream, chopped green
chiles and fresh coriander leaves on the table. You can add any or
all of these condiments to the soup or sprinkle them on the warm
tortillas, then fold them into quarters.
<P>
   As for dessert, beginning cooks often think that few ingredients
and simple directions mean the recipe isn't as good as one with
many ingredients and more complicated instructions. Nothing could
be further from the truth _ generally, the simpler the better.
</P>
<P>
   Try either of the accompanying ideas for serving fruit as a
finale. Both are close to foolproof, and I predict you will make
them many times.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; TIPS
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Preparing the Corn.  &LR; If you are using fresh ears of corn, pull
off the husks and silks (silks are the shiny threadlike strings
that are under the husks) and discard them.
</P>
<P>
   To cut the corn kernels off the cob, hold each ear of corn
upright, with the small end of the cob on the cutting surface.
Using a sharp knife, cut the kernels away from the cob, cutting two
or three rows off at a time. Discard the cobs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Masa Harina.  &LR; Masa harina can be found in most supermarkets.
Buy the package labeled ``Masa Harina,''  &LR; not  &LR; ``Instant Masa
Harina.'' Masa harina is a corn flour commonly used in Mexico and
made from cooked, dried corn. It is added to today's soup recipe to
give flavor and to act as a thickener. Store the leftover masa in
the refrigerator or freezer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Marion Cunningham, Bay Area cooking teacher, is the author of
``Learning to Cook,'' ``Cooking With Children,'' ``The Fannie
Farmer Cookbook'' and ``The Breakfast Book,'' among others.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; AND FOR DESSERT, TRY FRUIT &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; Strawberries &LR; . When strawberries are sweet and ripe, try serving
them with their stems on with a bowl of sour cream and one of brown
sugar, so you can dip them into the cream and sugar, then pop them
right into your mouth.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; Oranges &LR; . Peel 4 or 5 oranges and separate them into individual
sections. Cut the sections crosswise into 4 or 5 pieces. Put the
pieces of orange in a bowl, and stir in about 2/3 cup of orange
marmalade. Stir to mix and coat the orange pieces with the
marmalade. Cover the bowl and chill. Serve in pretty stemmed
glasses.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; MEXICAN CORN SOUP &LR;
</P>
<P>
   This soup makes a whole meal. Top it with sour cream, chopped
green chiles and cilantro. Serve it with corn tortillas that you
have wrapped in foil and warmed in a 350 degree oven for 15
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ingredients: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   4 cups fresh corn kernels (about 6 ears), or frozen corn kernels
</P>
<P>
   41/2 cups milk
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   21/2 tablespoons masa harina
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup water
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sour cream
</P>
<P>
   4 to 6 teaspoons chopped green chiles (from a 4-ounce can)
</P>
<P>
   A few sprigs cilantro
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Instructions: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Preparing Fresh Corn: &LR;  If using fresh corn, first cut the
kernels from the cob with a sharp knife. The best way is to stand
the cob upright on a cutting board, with one hand securing the
upper end. Using a large sharp knife, cut downward, slicing the
kernels from the cob. You'll be surprised how easy this is.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Making the Soup:  &LR; Put the corn _ fresh or frozen _ into a
heavy-bottom pot with the milk and salt and set over medium heat.
Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook gently for 15
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In a pint (2-cup) jar with a lid, vigorously shake together the
masa harina and the water. Add the mixture to the soup, stirring to
blend in well and heat through, about 4 to 5 minutes. The masa
harina will thicken the soup as well as flavor it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Serving the Soup: &LR;  Ladle soup into warm bowls. Drop a
tablespoon of sour cream in the center of each bowl, add a heaping
teaspoon of chopped green chiles, and finish with some cilantro
leaves and a sprinkle of freshly ground pepper.
</P>

 COOK'S BOOKS _ `A Spoonful of Ginger' Aims to Soothe and Comfort    By Kim Severson  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Just before I hopped a plane to Seattle, I tucked
Nina Simonds' ``A Spoonful of Ginger'' into my bag.
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was heading north to spend a few days caring for my best
friend, a recently retired chef who had abdominal surgery and faced
weeks in bed.
</P>
<P>
   The book promises irresistible, health-giving recipes from Asian
kitchens. What better way to test the claim than with an old friend
in need of some restorative food?
</P>
<P>
   We both fell in love with the book, which is much more than
prescriptions for healing broths infused with Chinese herbs
(although there are plenty of those recipes).
</P>
<P>
   ``A Spoonful of Ginger'' is a solid guide through a wide range
of generally simple-to-prepare Korean, Chinese and Japanese
recipes. A smart collection of lists and sidebars provides history,
philosophy and practical tips for using Asian ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Simonds, a Westerner who has studied Asian cooking for 25 years,
doesn't pretend to be an expert in medical cooking. Rather, she
presents health information in the form of reporting, using
herbalists, doctors and restaurateurs as experts.
</P>
<P>
   She promotes preventive eating based on the Eastern theory of
combining foods that are yin and yang _ that is, cooling or
heating. Health depends on finding a balance between the two, as
well as eating food that matches the season. Beef, for example, is
warming and good for winter dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Crab is considered a yin, or cooling, food and helps activate
blood circulation. Paired with ginger, as in Steamed Crabs with
Ginger Dipping Sauce, which I made one night, it is said to help a
person fight infections and regain strength. It's wonderfully
flavorful, too. That is part of the charm of Simonds' book. Unlike
many health-oriented cookbooks focusing on what  &LR; not  &LR; to eat, ``A
Spoonful of Ginger'' emphasizes what  &LR; to &LR;  eat.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Chinese approach to food as medicine centers on
soup, which Simonds says is second only to tea as a preferred way
of dispensing healing herbs and tonics. I'm sold on her
clear-steaming method. It produces an intense, clear broth without
leaving the soup's solid ingredients flavorless.
</P>
<P>
   For Clear-Steamed Chicken Soup with Ginger, I steamed the
ingredients for two hours in a dish sealed tightly with foil and
set over simmering water. I used one of her variations _
eliminating the salt and adding thin squares of prosciutto before
the two-hour steam bath and ripe cantaloupe balls at the end _ to
produce a wondrous dish with a floral perfume and a perfect balance
of sweet and salt.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, we gave the book high marks for clean, sensible layout;
an extensive array of soups and congees (rice porridges); and a
list of tonics with ingredients spelled out in Chinese _ perfect
for taking to the local Chinese herbalist.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike many books on Chinese cooking, where the ingredient
list can be 30 items long and techniques complex, ``A Spoonful of
Ginger'' makes Asian cooking accessible.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; One exception might be scallion pancakes. I made a stack to serve
with the soup. The recipe was labor-intensive, requiring three
sessions of technical kneading, rolling and resting and a long time
to fry each disk individually in hot corn oil.
</P>
<P>
   They were terrific, but I'm not sure I'd go through the effort
again _ unless a sick friend said they'd make her feel better.

 &LR; CLEAR-STEAMED CHICKEN SOUP WITH GINGER
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 chicken, about 3 to 31/2 pounds
</P>
<P>
   6 cups boiling water
</P>
<P>
   13/4 cups rice wine, preferably Shaoxing wine
</P>
<P>
   10 whole scallions, ends trimmed and smashed lightly with the
flat side of a knife
</P>
<P>
   10 slices fresh ginger, the size of a quarter, smashed with the
flat side of a knife
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; Instructions: Remove any fat from the cavity opening and around
neck of chicken. Rinse lightly and drain. Using a heavy knife or
cleaver, cut the chicken into 10 to 12 pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Heat 2 quarts water until boiling and blanch the chicken pieces
for a minute after the water boils to cleanse them. Drain the
chicken (discard the water), then rinse in cold water and drain
again.
</P>
<P>
   Place the chicken pieces and the rest of the ingredients, except
the salt, in a heat-proof pot or 2-quart souffle dish. Cover
tightly with heavy-duty aluminum foil and place on a steamer tray
or small rack.
</P>
<P>
   Fill a wok with enough water to just reach the bottom of the
steamer rack or tray; heat until boiling. Place the rack or tray
over the boiling water, cover and steam for 2 hours over high heat,
replacing boiling water in the wok as necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, steam the soup in the oven: Preheat the oven to
425 degrees. Place the ingredients in a Dutch oven or casserole
with a lid and, before putting on the cover, wrap the top tightly
with heavy-duty aluminum foil.
</P>
<P>
   Place the pot in a lasagna pan or a casserole and fill with 11/2
inches of boiling water. Bake for 2 hours, replenishing the boiling
water as necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Skim the top of the broth to remove fat and impurities. Add the
salt. Remove the ginger and scallions. Ladle the soup and chicken
pieces into serving bowls.
</P>
<P>
   To reheat and retain a clear broth, steam or bake in a closed
pot for 10 to 15 minutes, or until piping hot.
</P>

 Viva Tequila! Bay Area connoisseurs discover Mexico's
upscale  liquid gold   By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  First there was single-malt scotch. Then
small-batch bourbons. Then vodka was the rage. Now the latest in
liquor is tequila.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Where tequila was once confined to margaritas in Mexican cafes,
now top restaurants across the country _ and not just those serving
Mexican food _ are adding tequila lists to their bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tequila is a primary component of what we do here,'' says Bo
Thompson, manager at the newly opened Gordon's House of Fine Eats
in San Francisco. ``Sales are very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's _ which specializes in American cuisine _ offers more
than 15 upscale tequilas. And it has good reason to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are going for tequila in a big way. According to the
Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a trade
association, consumption has risen 112 percent since 1985 to almost
16 million gallons per year, making it the fastest-growing
distilled spirit in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Bowden, spirits buyer for the Beverages &AMP; More! chain
headquartered in Concord, says retail tequila sales are way up.
``We had growth of about 18 percent at the high end,'' he says,
indicating that consumers are becoming more selective in their
tequila buying. Ultra-premium _ and quite costly _ Chinaco, Patron
and Porfidio brands are selling especially well, he points out.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden says the store is starting to get single-estate bottled
tequilas from Mexico _ and consumers are buying them despite the
$50-$60 per-bottle price tag.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly sudden interest in the beverage that was solely
the drink of Mexico's poor is the result of the discovery by
restaurateurs and their customers of high-end tequilas, some of
which are considered on a par with fine brandy and Cognac.
</P>
<P>
   Cuervo Gold may be the most recognized brand of tequila in the
United States, but what's selling now is far more refined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't go through one liter of Cuervo Gold in a year at
Tommy's,'' says Julio Bermejo of Tommy's Mexican Restaurant in San
Francisco's Richmond district. But the restaurant has no problem
selling the other 110 top-of-the-line tequilas stocked in the bar.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, locally and nationally, much of the promotion of
upscale tequila has come from Bermejo, whose passion for the stuff
has led him to stock the bar at his parents' restaurant with more
types of 100 percent agave tequilas than at any other restaurant
outside of Mexico, he claims.
</P>
<P>
   Bermejo says he started his quest to educate people about
tequila a decade ago because he was tired of people thinking the
liquor was cheap. He was well acquainted with the better tequilas
because he traveled to Mexico frequently to visit distilleries.
</P>
<P>
   But when Bermejo first started stocking the bar at Tommy's with
ultra-premium brands, he had trouble selling those without
recognizable names like Cuervo and Sauza. So he began a tequila
club, taking the idea from the beer club run by Raleigh's, a bar he
frequented while a student at University of California at Berkeley.
Raleigh's customers had to taste every beer in the house to become
a member.
</P>
<P>
   To reach the apex of Bermjo's tequila club, members _ there are
more than 2,700 _ must first try 35 tequilas, then pass a
100-question test about the spirit and try an additional 10 to 20
reserve brands and, finally, visit the tequila distilleries in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Only 14 of the members have reached the top level, but all flash
their membership cards in pride. And mention tequila to Northern
California aficionados and the name Julio Bermejo isn't far behind.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bermejo was instrumental in developing the tequila list
and training the staff at Gordon's, Beach Chalet, Harry Denton's
Starlight Room and Left at Albequerque. He has also consulted with
the Bellagio Hotel in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Part of his education program includes an presentation on how
tequilas are made and what sets the good tequilas apart.
</P>
<P>
   A key factor of top tequilas is they are made entirely from blue
agave, a plant that resembles a cactus but is a member of the lily
family. A similar spirit called mezcal that's frequently confused
with tequila can be made from any member of the agave family. So
while tequila is always mezcal, mezcal is not always tequila _ much
the way Champagne is always sparkling wine, but sparkling wine is
not always Champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Lesser-quality tequilas that were prevalent in this country
until a few years ago are actually a blend of tequila and fermented
cane juice.
</P>
<P>
   Tequila is made by baking the pina _ the huge pineapple-looking
center of the plant _ to convert the starches to sugar. The pina is
then crushed and the juice extracted and transferred to
distillation tanks.
</P>
<P>
   There are four types of tequila, based on what happens after
distillation (see related article), with flavors ranging from crisp
and peppery to deeply complex and oakey. But, like wine _ and
unlike most distilled spirits _ fine tequila tastes in part like
the plant from which it's made, in addition to flavor nuances
resulting from manufacturing techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Other restaurateurs who may not be as passionate about their
tequila lists as is Bermejo have also noticed an upswing in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Treg Finney, bar manager at Jardini &LR; e &LR; re, says the prominent
placement of the bottles plays a part in sales. ``This is a martini
and Champagne bar,'' he says, ``but we get a ton of questions about
tequila.''
</P>
<P>
   Finney has also put two tequila tastings on the menu, which
become popular once one patron orders it. Customers see the lineup
of glassware, and suddenly everyone wants one,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Some people have started drinking the super-premium tequilas,
especially a &LR; n &LR; ejos, instead of Cognac or single-malt scotches as
after-dinner drinks. But margaritas remain the main form of tequila
consumption.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of tequila at Tommy's is made into
margaritas,'' Bermejo says.
</P>
<P>
   ``At most places, it's a waste to make an a &LR; n &LR; ejo into a
margarita, but at Tommy's we use so much tequila, it's not bad.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; At Maya, the upscale Mexican restaurant south of Market, shots are
ordered as often as margaritas, but don't expect salt and lime as
accompaniments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pour shots with a spicy-sweet tomato juice back called
sangrita, which complements the tequila,'' bar manager Matt Jenness
says. ``You just sip back and forth between the tequila and the
sangrita.''
</P>
<P>
   Other restaurants are urging patrons to try tequilas as an
after-dinner drink to refine their palates. Gordon's is
implementing a program where the servers will take two or three
bottles of super-premium tequilas to the table and let customers
have a small sample to encourage them to try tequila in a different
way.
</P>
<P>
   No one is sure why super-premium tequila is the latest craze in
the bar scene, but many say the strong economy gives people more
freedom to try new things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people want something new and fun,'' Gordon's Thompson
says. ``Prices have gone up dramatically, and now it seems cool and
Californian.''
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of as many as 200 new tequila brands over the
last five years indicates the tequila craze is not just a fad.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going more for the flavors of tequila instead of
something to spike a sweet drink,'' Thompson adds.
</P>
<P>
   Good tequila is here to stay, Bermejo says, because of its
exceptional quality coupled with the liquor's casual reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like tequila because you can drink it in sandals and shorts.
You don't have to be wearing a smoking jacket and driving a
Rolls.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL; 
The best tequilas are made from 100 percent blue agave, but all
tequila falls into one of the following four categories. All but
the first category have wonderful selections.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Joven abocado.  &LR; This term for ``young and smooth'' describes the
low end of the scale. In Mexico, anything made with 51 percent
fermented from blue agave can be legally called tequila, but up to
49 percent may be fermented cane juice. These lack the character
and complexity of 100 percent agave tequila.
</P>
<P>
   This type _ which includes brands such as Cuervo Gold _ also
gets its golden hue from the addition of caramel color, not from
aging _ which leads to the description ``adulterated.'' These
tequilas run about $10 for a 750-milliliter bottle.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; Silver (plato) or white (blanco) &LR; . These unaged tequilas are
usually crystal clear and have a crisp, peppery flavor. Some
brands, like Herradura, spend a little time in oak for more
complexity, but not enough time to pick up heavy oak tones.
Herradura Silver is the house tequila at Tommy's, Maya and Gordon's
House of Fine Eats. Most silver tequilas are $25-$35 for a
750-milliliter bottle.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; Reposado &LR; . These ``rested'' tequilas have been aged for two months
to one year in oak, producing a natural golden-brown hue and an oak
flavor that varies from producer to producer.
</P>
<P>
   Many aficionados consider reposados made by Herradura and El
Tesoro to be excellent. Rock star Sammy Hagar owns a company that
makes a decent reposado called Cabo Wabo. Reposados usually cost
$30-$40 per bottle, though some can cost more.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; Anejo.  &LR; These aged tequilas are generally considered to be the
highest-quality tequilas available. To be called a &LR; n &LR; ejo, the
tequila must be aged in 53-to-55-gallon oak barrels for at least
one year.
</P>
<P>
   This category is traditionally the most expensive and includes
the 4-year-old Chinaco and Herradura Seleccion Suprema. Prices for
a &LR; n &LR; ejos can run from $40-$250 or more per bottle.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Margaritas are personal drinks, and many restaurants have their own
signature combinations.
</P>
<P>
   At Maya in San Francisco and New York, the bar serves four
different versions, ranging from a frozen version flavored with
hibiscus to a top-shelf version made with Cointreau and a floater
of Grand Marnier.
</P>
<P>
   The secret to the margarita at Gordon's House of Fine Eats in
San Francisco is lots of fresh lime juice and a drop of sweetened
lemon juice.
</P>
<P>
   At Tommy's Mexican Restaurant in San Francisco, tequila
connoisseur Julio Bermejo selects his limes carefully, and the
bartenders taste every margarita they make. ``Would you cook
without tasting?'' Bermejo asks.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy's margaritas are made to showcase the flavor of the
tequila used in the drink, and the drink changes substantially
depending on the type and brand of tequila. The house tequila at
Tommy's is Herradura Silver, which makes a delicious crisp,
slightly peppery margarita.

 By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
   
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Sometimes the best recipes also have the most
interesting stories. The lamb skewers from Oberon are based on a
family recipe given to owner Zoran Matulic by his mother, who lives
in the coastal town of Split in what is now Croatia.
<TEXT>
<P>
   This recipe has it all _ the lamb skewers are easy to put
together, are done ahead and are perfect for outdoor grilling.
</P>
<P>
   The ground lamb mixture is stirred together the day before and
allowed to rest. The chile-mint yogurt sauce can also be made ahead
to blend flavors or at the last minute, depending on the cook's
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   When it's time to serve, the host needs only to form the logs,
thread the skewers and quickly cook the meat. The combination of
sweet onions, scallions and garlic really helps to bring out a
sweet, intense flavor in the lamb.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the best dishes served at Oberon, which has
accents of Middle Eastern, French and Italian cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Matulic, the owner and host, had been the ``front man'' at many
of the city's best restaurants before going out on his own at
Oberon. He's a consummate host, and the restaurant has become
popular among those who want to have a comfortable, pampering place
for a quiet conversation. Prices are moderate, which helps make it
a prime neighborhood destination.

 &HT;    Borders to begin 'Sprout'ing books
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta-based Sprout Inc. has landed a deal with
Borders Group Inc. to help the giant bookstore chain print
paperback books inside stores while customers wait.
</P>
<P>
   Sprout, a digital book wholesaler, was launched two years ago as
a high-tech middleman for obscure and out-of-print books. With
Sprout's on-demand publishing technology, retailers can print
high-quality paperbacks in single or multiple copies in about 15
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Borders, which bought a 20 percent interest in Sprout, will give
the fledgling wholesaler a major avenue of distribution for the new
technology. Borders, the nation's second-largest book chain, will
first test Sprout's technology at the retailer's distribution site
in LaVergne, Tenn. Next year, Borders will likely start printing
paperbacks in as many as 260 stores around the country. ``This is a
new technology in the industry, so we want to get comfortable with
it first,'' said Borders spokeswoman Ann Binkley. On-demand print
capability has been available for several years, but publishers and
retailers have been slow to react.
</P>
<P>
   Borders, which trails Amazon.com and Barnes &AMP; Noble in Web book
sales, sees the alliance with Sprout as a way to buffer Internet
competition by offering more in-store services, Binkley said.
Borders also plans to work with Sprout to expand the number of book
titles available on digital databases. Sprout currently has about
1,300 titles.
</P>
<P>
   For book retailers, on-demand printing cuts the costs of storing
and shipping, and it frees up shelf space occupied by slow-moving
titles. Store return about a third of their inventory to publishers
because the books don't sell. ``Our technology should help
eliminate the availability and returns problems that have plagued
this industry,'' said Pat Brannan, chief executive of Sprout.
</P>
<P>
   Sprout is looking to land similar pacts with other large chains
and independent booksellers. Sprout's printing setup, which
consists of digital printers and book binders, costs about $40,000
to buy, or about $1,000 a month to lease. Sprout also gets a
portion of the sale of each book printed by the retailer.

SLEEPWALK-TRIAL-5 (Phoenix) - From the facts alone, it would seem
that Scott Falater was a very deliberate, very efficient murderer.
After stabbing his wife, Yarmila, 44 times in their Phoenix home in
1996, court records show, Falater put on gloves, dragged her body
to their pool, rolled her in and held her head under. He then
sealed a blood-splattered face guard, clothes and the knife in a
Tupperware container, stuffed it in a garbage bag and hid it in the
back of his Volvo. But Falater _ an engineer, inventor, loving
father and leader in his church _ said he cannot remember any of
it. Instead, he claims, he wasn't even awake. Day 5 of the trial.

these days without drawing up a budget and checking it twice. Cars
are so expensive that few consumers can buy one outright. That
means some kind of financing will be necessary, and monthly
payments will result. Yet car shoppers who focus too much on the
monthly outlays to the exclusion of other costs may live to regret
it. That's because a preoccupation with payments often leads car
shoppers to leasing, which frequently is more expensive than
buying, say consumer advocates. With material for three boxes. By

   VOZROZHDENIYE ISLAND, Uzbekistan _ In the spring of 1988, germ
scientists 850 miles east of Moscow were ordered to undertake their
most critical mission.
</P>
<P>
   Working in great haste and total secrecy, the scientists in the
city of Sverdlovsk transferred hundreds of tons of anthrax bacteria
_ enough to destroy the world many times over _ into
stainless-steel canisters, poured bleach into them to decontaminate
the deadly pink powder, and sent the cargo almost a thousand miles
to this remote island in the inland Aral Sea, American and Central
Asian officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Here Russian soldiers dug pits and poured the sludge into the
ground, burying, Moscow hoped, a grave political threat.
</P>
<P>
   While Mikhail Gorbachev was warming ties with the West, evidence
was mounting in Washington that the Soviet Union, contrary to its
treaty pledges, was producing germs for weapons that the world had
banned. The stockpile had to be destroyed, Russian scientists close
to the program said.
</P>
<P>
   Vozrozhdeniye Island was a natural choice. Until the military
left in 1992, Renaissance Island, as it translates from the
Russian, had been the Soviet Union's major open-air testing site.
Today, Renaissance Island, which the former Soviet republics of
Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan now share, is the world's largest anthrax
burial ground.
</P>
<P>
   For the United States, it is an intelligence gold mine. At the
invitation of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, American military
scientists and intelligence experts have secretly been traveling
here for the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Their tests show that some of the spores are still alive _ and
potentially deadly.
</P>
<P>
   Tests also have shown that the anthrax vaccine now being given
to 2.4 million Americans in uniform is effective against the
anthrax.
</P>
<P>
   While this has reassured the Clinton administration, discovery
of live spores has alarmed Kazakhstan and especially worries
Uzbekistan, which has been exploring for oil on its part of the
island.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Aral Sea is shrinking _ the result of wrongheaded
Soviet irrigation policies _ this deserted island has grown from 77
square miles to 770 and will soon be connected to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Uzbek and Kazakh experts fear the spores could escape, stirred
up by carriers like rodents, lizards and birds. The disease is
spread by direct contact; it is treatable with antibiotics if
detected immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Central Asian and American officials fear that, as access to the
island eases, the buried anthrax could be used by terrorists to
make more of the deadly agent.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan have asked the United
States for help in assessing, or cleaning up this biological legacy
of Soviet rule. Uzbekistan permitted this correspondent to visit
Renaissance Island this year _ the first visit by a journalist _
and to interview officials and scientists concerned about the
hazards.
</P>
<P>
   The trip, coupled with interviews with scientists, government
officials and military experts in Central Asia, Russia and the
United States, has shed light on one of the most closely guarded
biological secrets of the Cold War. Although President Boris
Yeltsin of Russia issued an edict in 1992 closing the site and
vowing that the laboratory would be dismantled and decontaminated
within three years, the cash-strapped Moscow government never
followed through. And Russia has never acknowledged responsibility
for the anthrax cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Military scientists at the U.S. Army Medical Research and
Material Command and other laboratories refused comment. But other
officials said the labs were still trying to determine why spores
collected from some of the pits did not die.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   A study soon to be published by the Monterey Institute of
International Studies in California concludes that the island and
the former port city of Aralsk, now about 60 miles from the sea and
part of Kazakhstan, were first used by the KGB's predecessor as
exile camps for kulaks, the private farmers whom Stalin repressed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936, the study said, Vozrozhdeniye and the city that
administered the island were placed under the Ministry of Defense,
which in 1954 built a biological weapons test site on the island.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said the United States did not learn that the
Soviets had buried anthrax here until 1992, when Kanatjan Alibekov,
or Ken Alibek, as he is now known, defected. Alibek had been the
director of the giant Soviet anthrax production plant at
Stepnogorsk, which is now in Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, ``Biohazard'' (Random House, 1999), Alibek does not
disclose that anthrax was buried on the island, but he says that
such germ weapons as tularemia, Q-fever, brucellosis, glanders and
plague were tested on Vozrozhdeniye beginning in the 1970s. In 1986
and 1987, he added in an interview, a strain of plague that was
resistant to standard antibiotics was tested. In 1987, the book
states, Alibek's scientists tested the powerful anthrax that he had
developed at Stepnogorsk.
</P>
<P>
   The Monterey study and Alibek say that the Soviets also tested
typhus, botulinum toxin, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, smallpox
and microbial strains with characteristics useful in warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Today, evidence of the research abounds. Clearly visible as one
approaches the vast laboratory complex are the telephone poles one
kilometer apart on which detectors to measure germ agents were
mounted and to which animals were tied during open-air testing.
</P>
<P>
   The enclosed vivaria that once housed thousands of animals
killed in the testing _ rabbits, guinea pigs, white mice, hamsters,
horses, sheep, donkeys, monkeys and baboons _ are empty, their
windows smashed or missing, their roofs collapsed.

   Hundreds of small cages are stacked together in a dilapidated
storage room; in another stands a human-sized cage, apparently for
what scientists call ``non-human primates,'' or man-sized monkeys.
Hundreds of them died hideous deaths, sometimes in a single
experiment, say Russian and American scientists.
</P>
<P>
   On the northern part of the site, less than a mile from the
laboratory, are the barracks, homes, kindergarten and cafeteria
used by the scientists and their families, about a thousand people.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews in Tashkent, Uzbek officials said that only after
their country became independent in 1992 did they understand the
implications of their biological legacy. ``We were shocked when we
first learned the real picture,'' said Isan Mustafoev, Uzbekistan's
deputy foreign minister. In 1995, after Moscow refused to tell
Uzbekistan what chemical or biological facilities had been built on
Uzbek territory or what had been tested or buried here, Tashkent
asked Washington for help, Mustafoev explained. (On May 25, the
United States and Uzbekistan signed a bilateral agreement that
provides up to $6 million in American aid to dismantle and
decontaminate a former Soviet chemical weapons testing facility
near the Aral Sea.)
</P>
<P>
   Kazakhstan had quietly permitted Pentagon officials to visit
Vozrozhdeniye in 1995. Two years later, Uzbekistan independently
invited more American experts to take samples of the anthrax,
Mustafoev said.
</P>
<P>
   Mustafoev said that his ministry was not told precisely what the
tests showed about the samples that American teams collected in
1995, 1997 and last October.
</P>
<P>
   William C. Patrick III, who made germ weapons for the United
States before President Richard Nixon outlawed them nearly three
decades ago, said the samples would enable scientists to determine
not only the strength of the Soviet strain, or strains, but also
whether the anthrax had been genetically engineered, or enhanced in
other ways.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Patrick nor any officials directly involved in the
missions would discuss what the samples had shown. But several
experts confirmed that the tests indicated that the anthrax vaccine
now being given American soldiers was effective.
</P>
<P>
   Though Uzbekistan is deeply concerned about the potential
danger, decontaminating the island would be prohibitively
expensive, Mustafoev and American officials agreed. All three
capitals have been quietly pressing Moscow to provide more
information about what happened here.
</P>
<P>
   Milton Leitenberg, a professor and expert on Russia's
unconventional weapons programs, said that Moscow in 1987 had
listed the town of Aralsk, the island's staging area, but not the
island itself, in its first declaration of germ weapons
related-sites which is required by the 1972 Biological Weapons
Convention banning germ warfare. In its 1992 declaration, Russia
finally listed the island, but as a site where only defensive
testing for vaccines and materials had been performed. ``The
Russians,'' he concludes, ``have never come clean about these
programs.''
</P>
<P>
   The people who live near the island know all too well how little
Moscow cared for their safety and welfare. No region of Uzbekistan
has been harder hit by the Soviet Union's economic policies or its
relentless pursuit of unconventional weapons than Karakalpakstan,
the Uzbek semi-autonomous republic inhabited by almost 5 million
people. Karakalpakstan, the home of the Aral sea, has seen its once
thriving fishing industry devastated, its arable land ruined by
overuse of fertilizers and pesticides, and its ground water
polluted.
</P>
<P>
   Yusup Kamalov, an Uzbek scientist who heads the Union for the
Defense of the Aral Sea, an independent environmental group, called
the situation ``next to hopeless.'' The sea's surface water has
shrunk by half, its volume reduced by 75 percent. ``The sea is
dying,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Karakalpaks, said Ian Small, the country manager of Medecins
Sans Frontieres, the volunteer physicians group, are among the most
``chronically sick people in the former Soviet Union.'' Two-thirds
of the population suffer from some chronic illness, often
tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because there has been no census since 1989 and health
statistics are either nonexistent or unreliable, it's impossible to
know whether what we're seeing is the result of the region's
general poverty and environmental degradation or the past chemical
and biological testing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most germ weapons scientists familiar with Vozrozhdeniye said
there was little immediate danger to the local population. But the
island is becoming more readily accessible, and anthrax sludge is
beginning to leach up through the sand, said one recent visitor
here.
</P>
<P>
   Although Uzbek officials have kept Renaissance Island closed,
local inhabitants will inevitably come in contact with the still
deadly bacteria once it is linked to the mainland. ``We're now
totally in the dark,'' Small said. ``It's scary not to know what
we're dealing with.''

THE POP LIFE: OF DIFFICULTIES IN DOWNLOADING MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I like to think of myself as pretty competent with technology. I
can set alarm clocks, program VCRs, make bids on items in Ebay and
mix cake batter without getting any on the walls. When it comes to
listening to music on the Internet, I'm what statisticians call an
early adapter, working with an Internet radio station blaring or
downloading free songs onto my MP3 player with customized skins and
cool visual plug-ins.
</P>
<P>
   So it was with a light heart that I set about downloading the
rap group Public Enemy's ``There's a Poison Goin' On'' last
weekend. The album is the first new record by a major artist being
sold through direct Internet download before being made available
in record stores. Or, to put it more sensationally, it is what
companies from Sony to IBM to Microsoft think will be the future of
music.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the music business has been sprinting faster and
faster toward selling albums online in this manner: meeting behind
closed doors, forming alliances with competitors and generally
making a mess of things in the same way that cleaning up a house
requires throwing it into greater disorder first.
</P>
<P>
   The quest to download Public Enemy's ``There's a Poison Goin'
On'' provided a firsthand example of this mess. As I write this,
three days have passed, I have spent 12 hours on the computer, I
may or may not have spent $16 on my credit card for the $8 album
and only moments ago I had the hard-earned privilege of hearing the
first of its songs.
</P>
<P>
   I began the process with my home computer, which is connected to
America Online via standard phone lines. I went to Atomicpop.com, a
Web site, and followed the path to the album. I clicked on an icon
to begin the download at 12:34 p.m. Four hours and 23 minutes later
the album had supposedly arrived on my computer. All I had to do
was find the file I had just downloaded on my hard drive and fill
out a form with my e-mail address, street address and credit card
information, and then the company would send me a password that
would free the music from its security system.
</P>
<P>
   I followed instructions, received the password three minutes
later, typed it in and clicked on the unlock icon. Then I waited,
and waited, and waited. Nothing happened. I searched for the Public
Enemy album or a song from it, and there was nothing. Even the
unlocking program itself had disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour of fruitless searching and phone calls to
computer-savvy friends, I called and sent e-mail to Broadcast.com,
the security company, for help. No response.
</P>
<P>
   I decided to cheat to see if I could find the album free online.
There were three methods at my disposal: I posted a request for the
album with several newsgroups, downloaded a program intended to
circumvent the ``unboxed'' security system and went to the site
mp3.lycos.com to search for the album. I probably could have gotten
the album through at least one of these means, but my eyes were
glazed over and I decided to stick with the original plan.
</P>
<P>
   The next night I used a computer with a stronger Internet
connection _ T1 lines _ and tried my luck. It took three hours for
the album to download. I filled out the forms with my credit card
information again, and waited for a password. It never came. I
e-mailed and called. No response, again.
</P>
<P>
   While waiting until the next working day to call, I returned to
the site Launch.com, which was offering free copies of a new
Beastie Boys song and donating a dollar for each download to Kosovo
relief charities. The company had packaged the files in a newer
secure system (Windows Media Technology), and this was its
downfall. Several days earlier I had reluctantly signed up for a
free Launch membership to get the song but couldn't download the
music. This time my e-mail received a response, a form letter
explaining that there was a problem in Windows Media Technology's
security system, called Reciprocal. ``Launch will be making the
donation for each new member that comes to the site,'' the e-mail
reassured me, ``regardless of whether or not they get the download,
so don't worry about that.''
</P>
<P>
   This time the Beastie Boys song downloaded successfully. Flush
with success, two days later I called Broadcast.com to try for an
encore with Public Enemy. A nice woman who identified herself as
the only troubleshooter at the company answered my call, and after
fiddling with what she described as ``a very slow computer'' and
``a stupid search engine'' solved one problem. She had no
explanation for the first failed attempt, but the second attempt
did not work, she said, because her computers had rejected the
order as a duplicate.
</P>
<P>
   She gave me a new password, I typed it in and the album was
unlocked. I waited about the amount of time it would take me to
walk to my local record store, and the album transferred to my hard
drive. The songs were suddenly laid out in a folder for me to
select and play on my computer, but the thrill was long gone.
</P>
<P>
   The hassles downloading Public Enemy and the Beastie Boys had
nothing to do with the technology involved in extracting music from
the Internet: it was the security systems (created so record
companies get their money, artists receive their royalties and the
music cannot be copied and passed around free) that made the
processes daunting.
</P>
<P>
   Going to a record store suddenly seemed like a very easy and
progressive concept. And unless record companies decide to abandon
the Sisyphean task of trying to find a secure delivery system on
the Internet (which is about as likely as record companies'
abandoning the practice of passing gay singers off as
heterosexual), the future of music probably still belongs to the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Family Values Tour
</P>
<P>
   The Family Values Tour started last year by the slob-rock band
Korn is following in the footsteps of Lollapalooza, the Ozzfest and
the Lilith Fair to become an institution with a short but
prosperous future. Though the Firm, the management company that
handles the tour, did not return phone calls in time for
publication, it is believed to have as headliners Limp Bizkit, with
the rappers Redman, Method Man and DMX performing along with the
rock bands Filter and possibly the Foo Fighters. The tour is to
begin in the fall.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH ADAMS, Mass. _ The Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary
Art, the sprawling complex that opened last weekend in the heart of
this old New England mill town, looks like a museum that the
Shakers might have built, if the Shakers had liked very large,
multimedia works of art and performance events poised on the
cutting edge of computer imaging technology.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, more than 10 years in the making, has a home so
plainly beautiful it barely needs art. Given the horrors that
regularly pass for museums in the late 20th century, this
represents a much better than average start, maybe even a miracle
that is undiminished by a few missteps in the opening shows and an
awkward just-moved-in sense of presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Carved out of five buildings in a 27-structure mill complex
dating from the 19th century, the arts center is the work of Henry
Moss and Simeon Bruner of Bruner/Cott &AMP; Associates of Cambridge,
Mass. Their redesign has created a series of linked spaces, large
and small, most of them elegant and serene in proportion and bathed
in natural light.
</P>
<P>
   Some galleries are distinguished by double-height ceilings;
others have been opened up by replacing columns with ingenious
systems of ceiling struts that look like they've been there all
along. And while new white walls were built in many places, plenty
of other walls were simply cleaned and patched, leaving layers of
plastering and distressed paint or mismatched brick patterns that
suggest abstract frescoes.
</P>
<P>
   As with Moss and Bruner's overall plan, these contrasting walls
express an exemplary balance of old and new, paying homage to the
building's history while enhancing its new incarnation.
</P>
<P>
   This incarnation was touch and go for most of a decade. The
brainchild of Thomas Krens while he was director of the Williams
College Museum of Art, the center, known as Mass MOCA, was made a
reality by Joseph Thompson, who took over when Krens left for the
directorship of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in 1988. It has
subsequently overcome many obstacles, with Thompson sometimes
working without salary and with only one other staff member. Last
fall the Dia Center for the Arts, which had been on the brink of
agreeing to lend large chunks of its collection, found its own
building, in Beacon, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   It is perhaps to be excused that after these challenges, the
center's opening slate of exhibitions and performance events is a
mixed bag in terms of quality. The largest exhibition, ``Test
Site,'' is freighted with less-than-inspiring works by big-name
artists, most of them borrowed from other institutions, especially
the Guggenheim, at the last minute. In galleries featuring works by
Carl Andre, Robert Morris, Bruce Nauman, John Chamberlain and James
Rosenquist, the art often feels much like furniture in a model
home, a stand-in for something real. In some cases this may reflect
first-time-out inexperience: several sculptures seem shoved into
spaces too small for them, most egregiously in the case of Dan
Flavin's fluorescent light works, forced to compete with muscular
ventilation ducts that obtrude from an uncharacteristically low
ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the inaugural weekend was electric with a sense of
relief, delight and possibility. The good news is that, overall,
there are several instances where the center's stated mission is
shown to be worthy and attainable _ that is, to show large works of
art that other museums would have difficulty displaying and to
commission and otherwise foster works that mix disciplines and
media in new ways.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's ability to handle extra-large artworks, for
example, is confirmed by Robert Rauschenberg's ``\ Mile or 2
Furlong,'' a typically exuberant work of painting, sculpture,
collage and assemblage that involves 206 panels, takes up much of
the available wall space in a gallery nearly the size of a football
field and is the centerpiece of ``Test Site.''
</P>
<P>
   Begun in 1981 and still in progress, this work has some ups and
downs of its own, but it looks quite a bit better here than it did
last year at the Ace Gallery in SoHo during Rauschenberg's
two-museum retrospective at the Guggenheim.
</P>
<P>
   It is in fact a retrospective in its own right, a spectacular
summation of Rauschenberg's involvement with found materials
(especially fabrics), his appetite for photographic imagery and the
myriad transfer techniques, often of his own invention, by which he
incorporates these images into his art.
</P>
<P>
   Further evidence of the big-is-better approach is the display of
Joseph Beuys' ``Lightning With Stag in Its Glare,'' a handsome,
funereal sculptural installation centering on a 16-foot-high slab
of heavily worked bronze suspended by a noose from the ceiling. The
work belongs to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, which cannot
exhibit it until it raises the roof of one of its galleries and was
happy to lend it while it does so.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Generally things are more interesting when the displays edge
into new territory with younger or unknown artists. The museum's
intention to commission works of art is well represented by ``Tree
Logic,'' a Magritte-like installation piece by a young Australian
artist named Natalie Jeremijenko that consists of six good-size
saplings suspended upside down in the newly sodded and cobblestoned
courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   Another commission, Tony Oursler's installation ``Optics,''
feels a bit like a work in progress, but it shows this artist,
known for animating objects and dummies with little video images,
moving successfully away from his signature formula. This new work
involves several forms of video projection, glass sculptures and a
talking light bulb.
</P>
<P>
   It tackles the history of optics, reminds us that Lucifer means
light, and plays on the fact that the first lenses were used in the
13th century to view shadow plays _ often involving struggles
between angels and devils.
</P>
<P>
   It includes a small freestanding glass screen across which a
tiny naked figure magically slithers, crawls and shape-shifts, like
a soul trapped for eternity within the tendrils of a manuscript
illumination.
</P>
<P>
   Other technological feats include Bill T. Jones'
``Ghostcatching,'' which uses something called ``motion-capture
technology'' to transform the dancer's body into an astoundingly
fluid yet corporeal drawing in space that multiplies, divides and
moves through thickets of drawn line.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly impressive was ``Jet Lag,'' a performance
collaboration between the artists/architects Diller &AMP; Scofidio and
the Builders Association, which was founded five years ago by
Marianne Weems, a former member of New York's Wooster Group, which
had its American debut on Friday night. Performed in the center's
new black-box theater, the work told two true stories concerning
what I would call travel in extremis. In the process they combined
real actors and video images or computer-generated sets in ways
that often made the audience gasp.
</P>
<P>
   Most memorably, two actors stood on the stage while a huge
digital image created the illusion that they were on a moving
walkway in an airport. Luckily the drama, acting and staging
withstood such potentially sensational effects: the story was about
a Long Island grandmother who in 1969 kidnapped her grandson and
flew with him between New York and Paris more than 150 times in
seven months, never leaving the airport in either city, and finally
dying of jet lag.
</P>
<P>
   There are obvious pros and cons to be gleaned from the museum's
maiden voyage. Like other new museums, it needs to be wary of
bigness for the sake of bigness. Large works of art can be like
blockbuster exhibitions: as with famous names like van Gogh or
Monet, scale can create the illusion of importance where little
exists. To devote the center's enormous spaces only to large works
of art would limit both Mass MOCA's program and its audience's
understanding of art.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting-edge technology, like size, can also be impressive for
its own sake. Luckily, after the building itself, the biggest cause
for celebration so far are the works of Oursler, Jones and Diller &AMP;
Scofidio. They prove that in the right hands, the latest
technological wizardry is just another viable artistic material.

 By RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Small-cap stocks are on a tear, but can they make up all the
lost ground of the last few years?
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by the strengthening economy, frenetic takeover activity
and hints of higher inflation that would make it easier for smaller
concerns to raise prices, small-company stock indexes have jumped
10 percent since April after lagging behind the larger companies
that fill the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index by the widest
margins in a generation. Small stocks even held up well the last
three weeks, while the broad market dropped about 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many market strategists expect small-cap companies _ with market
values up to $1 billion to $2 billion _ to continue to outperform
the larger-company stocks that have fueled the stock market boom.
Despite their strong returns so far in the second quarter,
smaller-company stocks remain near their cheapest valuations in
memory, compared with other stocks. Not only could that give them
an extra boost if the stock market goes up, but, perhaps as
demonstrated this month, it could provide a cushion compared with
bigger-company stocks if the market falters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this could be the real thing for a while,'' said
Jeremy Siegel, professor of finance at the Wharton School at the
University of Pennsylvania. ``I am impressed with the relative
strength they've been showing over the last several weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   But even small-cap fans are not sure these stocks will ever
approach the valuations they often achieved in the past, when they
occasionally traded at more than twice the price-to-earnings ratios
of bigger stocks.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   First, while small stocks used to be the only place many
investors put money allocated for higher-risk investments, nowadays
emerging markets, Internet stocks, options and other riskier bets
draw much of that money. Second, larger companies will benefit more
from continued economic globalization. And third, some say, the
generally inflationary era of the last few decades is not likely to
repeat itself.
</P>
<P>
   T. Rowe Price's New Horizons fund has been a longtime barometer
for small-cap valuations. Until this year, the fund's
price-to-earnings ratio fluctuated between one and two times the
P/E of the S&AMP;P 500. But it fell to 0.78 at the end of March, the
lowest level in 38 years.

   Investors should get used to seeing smaller-company stocks trade
at lower relative valuations mostly because the rising prices of
goods and services that has paced small-stock performance since the
end of World War II will not be a big factor again, predicts James
Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management, the
investment-management arm of Wells Fargo &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to a new relative valuation range,'' he said.
``All of these historical relationships are going by the wayside.
Small-cap investors at least have to give some thought to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Siegel agrees. ``I'm still not of the belief that they're going
to outperform big stocks'' over the long term, he said. ``The
globalization of the world economy is still going to be a major
theme in the next decade, and big-cap stocks are going to benefit
most from that scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that any of that will hurt small-cap stocks anytime soon,
given how much they have trailed the rest of the market. The
Russell 2000 index of small-company stocks had its worst year ever
against the S&AMP;P in 1998, lagging behind by 30.8 percent. And the
last two times the New Horizons fund's P/E relative to the S&AMP;P
dipped below one _ it hit 0.95 in March 1977 and September 1990 _
small stocks subsequently outperformed for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Further, predicts Mary Lisanti, a longtime small-cap fund
manager, smaller company stocks' earnings growth will eventually
overtake that of larger companies, causing their current valuation
discounts to narrow. ``There's no question they're cheap; everybody
knows that,'' said Ms. Lisanti, chief investment officer for
equities at Northstar Investment Management in Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the best of times'' to be a small-cap investor,
she added. ``The risk is still relatively low, the fundamentals are
starting to improve, and no one is paying attention. You have a
window of opportunity here for a couple of months before everybody
gets excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Corporate insiders have noticed. ``We're seeing a higher level
of buying in small-cap stocks'' by executives of these companies,
said Bob Gabele, director of insider research at First Call/Thomson
Financial. ``Insiders play for value, and they're saying there's a
lot of value in these small-cap companies.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most compelling evidence in support of a small-cap
renaissance may be what amounts to a wave of corporate arbitrage
that is washing over small stocks. Larger companies have been
acquiring small-cap companies this year at a furious pace.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch predicts the number of small-cap mergers and
acquisitions this year involving companies with market values of
under $2 billion will be the highest in a decade. Most notable is
the surge in leveraged-buyout activity, in which an investor group
acquires a company mostly with debt and uses its cash flow or asset
sales to repay the money. In fact, Merrill Lynch estimates there
will be as many small-cap leveraged buyouts in 1999 as in the
previous four years.
</P>
<P>
   Why so many deals? In large part because bigger companies have
been able to offer good-sized premiums to persuade small company
managements and shareholders to sell. At the same time, the bigger
players still are able to use the acquisitions to bolster their
per-share earnings immediately by paying for them with their own
more richly valued stock.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is even some irony here: Stocks are trading at their
loftiest levels since the heyday of the Nifty 50, the large growth
stocks that led the market's charge in the late 1960s and early
1970s, as many investors have abandoned the notion of Benjamin
Graham and David Dodd that stocks should be bought at prices that
reflect their underlying value. But by rapidly buying these small
companies on the cheap _ and using their own more expensive stock
to pay for it _ larger companies are taking advantage of the sort
of unusual price discrepancies that students of the famous
investing scholars love.
</P>
<P>
   The current activity amounts to ``a Graham-and-Dodd behavior
that we haven't seen in the market'' in some time, said Satya
Pradhuman, the director of small-cap research at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Preston Athey, manager of the T. Rowe Price Small-Cap Value
fund, said 18 out of about 210 companies in his fund have been
taken over in the last seven months.
</P>
<P>
   Never before has takeover activity been so high among small
companies, he said. ``This is new and different,'' Athey added.
``The disparity in valuations has become so large that the
economics of doing a deal are just overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   For mutual-fund investors, small-cap funds with strong
three-year returns through April 30 include Robertson Stephens
Emerging Growth A, with a 29.6 percent three-year annualized
return; Berger New Generation, 23.4 percent; Oppenheimer Enterprise
A, B and C shares, 23.2 percent, 22.3 percent and 22.3 percent,
respectively; Value Line Special Situations, 22.5 percent; Dreyfus
Emerging Leaders, 21.9 percent, and Baron Growth and Income, 19.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The funds are open to new investors, have at least $100 million
in net assets and require no more than a $5,000 initial purchase.
All data are from Morningstar Inc., the fund tracking company in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   One reason often cited for the difficulty small stocks may have
in the future is their lack of liquidity _ the ability to buy or
sell large blocks of stocks easily without affecting the price
through your own transaction. That could keep many large
institutional investors away. But that very effect has contributed
to small stocks' recent rally, says Jean-Marie Eveillard, the
Societe General fund manager.
</P>
<P>
   Since large stocks had been beating small stocks by such wide
margins until recently, pension funds, foundations and other large
money managers have had to buy huge blocks of smaller-company
stocks to bring their portfolio weightings back in line with their
targets, Eveillard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After four years of big stocks doing so much better, you
probably have entire portfolios that are almost 100 percent in
big-growth stocks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy for them to rebalance,'' he added, because
liquidity is with the big growth companies, not with smaller ones.
So when big portfolio managers do go into the market to buy smaller
companies, shareholders in those stocks get a significant pop.
</P>
<P>
   Eveillard predicts the valuation gap will continue to narrow,
though he is less certain how that will happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two ways the gap in valuations can close,'' he said.
``One is for small stocks to catch up; another way is for big
stocks to catch down. So far it has been more a matter of small
stocks catching up, but who knows?''

STUDENT WRITER WINS $43,000 PRIZE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maryland)  (dal) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHESTERTOWN, Md. Over a million students graduated from American
colleges this spring, but it is a safe bet that few enjoyed the day
more than Luke Owens.
</P>
<P>
   At the graduation ceremony of Washington College here on May 23,
Owens received the Sophie Kerr Prize, awarded each year to the best
writer in the senior class. With it came a tax-free cash grant of
$43,238.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised,'' said Owens, who had submitted a 27-page
poetry portfolio including poems like ``The Art of Lifting
Stones,'' which deftly linked muddy riverbeds to memories of his
father to man's relationship with God. ``Lots of people told me
that I deserved it, which is incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Owens 21, of Rising Sun, in the northeastern corner of Maryland,
plans to use the money to pay off his student loans. He says he
will continue to write and perhaps go on to graduate school in
English.
</P>
<P>
   Every graduating senior is eligible for the prize, though only
14 students submitted entries this year. The reward is rich: Its
cash value is more than four times larger than the National Book
Award and eight times larger than the Pulitzer Prize.
</P>
<P>
   The Sophie Kerr Prize comes from a $500,000 trust fund given in
1965 to Washington College, a liberal arts institution with about
1,000 students, by Sophie Kerr, an Eastern Shore native and romance
novelist.
</P>
<P>
   Why she chose Washington College is not entirely clear. She grew
up on a farm 60 miles from the college and later attended nearby
Hood College, in Frederick, Md. Her affinity for Washington College
might have come from an honorary degree she received there in 1942.
</P>
<P>
   The Kerr will stipulates that half the annual earnings from her
estate must ``be awarded to the senior student at graduation who
shall have been chosen as having the best ability and promise for
future fulfillment in the field of literary endeavor.'' The other
half of the income subsidizes scholarships and visiting speakers.
</P>
<P>
   The selection committee is composed of English Department
faculty members and Washington College's president, John S. Toll.
The committee reads portfolios and then meets, usually for about
four hours, to choose a winner by secret ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept telling myself that if I didn't get it, I was not going
to cry at graduation,'' said Janet Ely, a senior from Towson, a
suburb north of Baltimore ``But I get sweaty palms thinking about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other contenders take a more light-hearted approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of money, but people make such a big deal out of
it,'' said Ray Cummings of Owings Mills, northwest of Baltimore.
``I refuse to let myself get hung up on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee members say they understand how stressful the
selection process can be. And they acknowledge that the sheer
amount of prize money is worrisome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be taken the wrong way: the odds are in my favor, the
gods are with me,'' said Robert Mooney, an English professor. ``But
no one is going to hit the jackpot on writing right away. My sense
is that maturity does prevail. This is not necessarily indicative
of the writing life.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the Sophie Kerr Prize will be worth an estimated
$55,000.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the department say the Sophie Kerr Fund helps improve
the writing program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps bring students to the college who are very serious
about literature,'' said Richard Gillin, chairman of the English
Department. ``We're very fortunate to have an awful lot of students
who are interested in writing. It has had a campus cultural
effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Some student writers at Washington College are indeed serious
about their enterprise. The Literary House, a rambling old building
on the outskirts of campus, is a center of intellectual life for
them. The house is filled with sofas and comfortable chairs;
students convene there to critique one another's work and hold
poetry readings. The house cat, named Edith Wharton, wanders freely
and often curls up in the lap of a reading student.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the young writers dream of winning their school's top
prize even though it has inspired a superstition, the Sophie Kerr
Curse: No winner of the prize has yet become a great or even
notable writer.
</P>
<P>
   While the curse evokes eye-rolls and groans from members of the
English Department, it is alive and well in the minds of students.
</P>
<P>
   This year's winner, Owens, laughed when asked about the hex and
said, ``This is my chance to prove it wrong for the record.''

<P>
   SERPANG, Indonesia _ This time, Enin Supriyanto is ready. Like
other ethnic Chinese here, he has his escape plan, his emergency
telephone numbers and his extra rations.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, surrounded by the music of frogs and the
sweet scent of clove cigarettes, he took his turn on neighborhood
watch, sitting by a barbed-wire barricade at the gated entrance of
his housing complex until well past midnight.
</P>
<P>
   One year after a paroxysm of rioting in which ethnic Chinese
were the targets of widespread vandalism, arson and rape, Chinese
all across the country have been preparing for new attacks before
the general election next Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Some bought guns. Some are paying military units to guard
commercial areas. Many of those who can afford to have left the
country.
</P>
<P>
   But something utterly unexpected has happened. The election
campaign, in most parts of the country, has so far been mainly
peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   The threatening telephone calls to Chinese residents and the
anonymous leaflets and rumors of attacks that have circulated in
Chinese communities have not reappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting by their barbed-wire barricade, Enin and a dozen of his
neighbors strummed a guitar, played cards and discussed their
tennis strokes over late-night snacks and glasses of hot Ovaltine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are playing cards, we are eating noodles, we are talking
nonsense,'' Enin said, happily relieved.
</P>
<P>
   Although Indonesia's Chinese people know that they can become
targets of violence at any time, as they have been periodically
over the decades, there is an emerging hope here that something
fundamental may be starting to change.
</P>
<P>
   The cautiously upbeat mood among the residents here in the
western suburbs of Jakarta is repeated among political analysts _
both Chinese and non-Chinese _ as they survey the national scene.
</P>
<P>
   After the shock of the riots and the forced resignation of
President Suharto last year, the analysts say, Indonesia's Chinese
may be inching toward the mainstream of society.
</P>
<P>
   Adapting a pattern set by centuries of Dutch colonization,
Suharto created what one analyst called a ``golden cage'' for the
Chinese. They were offered economic opportunity in exchange for
their support and their exclusion from the country's political and
cultural life.
</P>
<P>
   They constitute less than 4 percent of the population in this
country of more than 200 million, but they control the bulk of its
private commerce _ ranging from small rice merchants to billionaire
tycoons.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto's departure after 32 years of rule opened the way for a
reorganization of all aspects of society, from freeing the press to
forming political parties to redefining the role of Indonesians of
Chinese ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   Led by a better-educated, better-integrated younger generation,
many of the Chinese have begun to seek a new, more active place in
society.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had been convinced for about 30 years that everything was
fine,'' said Daniel S. Lev, an expert on Indonesia at the
University of Washington. ``They were isolated in a sense _ they
were denied any right to participate politically, but there was, at
the higher levels, a payoff: you got rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for many, what happened last May came as a really brutal
shock, because the part of the deal they forgot was that if things
got serious they would have to serve as scapegoats.''
</P>
<P>
   Hari Tjan, a political analyst with the independent Center for
Strategic and International Studies, who is an ethnic Chinese, said
of the riots, ``The cost was very high, but it is a learning
process that has been started.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, he said, there has also been a change in the
attitudes of indigenous political leaders, who he said ``don't want
to play this Chinese card anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am amazed that their conscience as human beings has
revived,'' Tjan said, ``and it is a wonderful, encouraging
development. Nearly all the parties are now embracing the Chinese
and telling them, `You are one of us. Please work together for the
country.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In a country where Chinese schools, newspapers, signboards and
public ceremonies were banned by Suharto, it has been an
extraordinary sight at some political rallies to see, among the
crowds, traditional Chinese lion and dragon dances.
</P>
<P>
   As they feel freer to redefine their role, Chinese people here
have launched a debate over whether to assert their cultural
separateness or to try to blend in to the broader national
identity.
</P>
<P>
   Some Chinese have banded together to form a culturally based
political party. Others have chosen not to emphasize their
separateness and have joined some of the other 47 parties engaged
in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Some responded to the riots by reaching out in solidarity to the
overseas Chinese diaspora in other nations, said Anugerah Pekerti,
an Indonesian Chinese who is chairman of World Vision Indonesia, an
aid organization.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Pekerti himself, advocate instead a process he
calls ``Indonesianization,'' in which the country's scores of
disparate ethnic groups will draw closer together in a common
identity.
</P>
<P>
   The debate illustrates an essential and wide-ranging change from
Suharto's father-knows-best era: Indonesians are reconstructing
their nation on their own terms.
</P>
<P>
   And the basic lesson the Chinese seem to be applying, in the
often-quoted words of the Indonesian Chinese political analyst
Arief Budiman, is: ``If you remain timid, you will forever be
trampled on.''

SUPREME COURT OVERRULES CONVICTION OF DRUG KINGPIN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Chicago, San Francisco)   (dal) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that in order to
convict a drug kingpin of running a ``continuing criminal
enterprise,'' jurors must unanimously agree that the defendant
committed each of a series of individual drug offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-to-3 decision placed a new burden on federal prosecutors
to use precision in framing cases brought under one of the more
powerful laws in the federal anti-drug arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   The 1970 law imposes a minimum 20-year sentence for engaging in
a continuing criminal enterprise, defined as a ``continuing series
of violations'' of federal drug laws. The Justice Department, along
with most of the federal appeals courts, including the 7th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, in Chicago, in this case, took the view
that a jury need only agree that the prosecution had proven a
``series'' of crimes, without the need for all jurors to vote to
convict on the individual crimes that made up the series.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling Tuesday, the Supreme Court set aside the 1994
conviction of the leader of a Chicago drug gang, the Undertaker
Vice Lords. The defendant, Eddie Richardson, who received a life
sentence, was convicted of running a continuing criminal enterprise
through repeated sales of cocaine and heroin from 1984 through
1991.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors had been instructed that they did not all have to
agree on the specific crimes that comprised the series _ a total of
at least three crimes, under the trial judge's instructions,
although the statute itself does not specify a number _ as long as
they did agree that there had been a series of them. Under this
view, the element of the offense that required a unanimous jury
verdict was the ``series.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the majority on Tuesday, Justice Stephen G. Breyer
said that the individual offenses were themselves elements of the
offense, at least three of which had to be proven beyond a
reasonable doubt to the satisfaction of a unanimous jury.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer said this interpretation both reflected the traditional
way of interpreting a criminal law, to require proof of each
element of the offense, and also guarded against ``the dangers of
unfairness'' that would result from permitting ``wide disagreement
among the jurors about just what the defendant did, or did not,
do.'' Noting that federal drug offenses include a wide range of
behavior, from the relatively trivial to the extremely serious,
Breyer said failure to require specificity from the jury would
raise constitutional problems.
</P>
<P>
   In a dissenting opinion, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy warned that
the ruling would be ``disruptive'' and would make convictions under
the statute ``remarkably more difficult.'' He said the ``whole
design and purpose of the statute'' was to attack a pattern, rather
than just a few individual crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In reply, Breyer countered that it should not be unduly
difficult for prosecutors to prove a few specific crimes among the
many that are typically involved in a criminal enterprise case. On
the other hand, he said, if it turns out to be difficult in a given
case, ``would that difficulty in proving individual specific
transactions not tend to cast doubt upon the existence of the
requisite `series'?''
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, along with Justices John
Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia, David H. Souter and Clarence Thomas,
joined the majority opinion in Richardson vs. U.S., No. 97-8629.
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg signed Justice
Kennedy's dissenting opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to its six opinions last week and five the week
before, the court issued only one opinion on Tuesday. The
early-June lull, so close to the end of the term, was due to the
fact that many difficult cases were argued in late April, with
first drafts of opinions in those cases only now beginning to
circulate among the justices.
</P>
<P>
   Among the court's other actions on Tuesday were these:

   A week after ruling that the police violate the Constitution
when they permit reporters and photographers to accompany them into
a private home to witness a search or arrest, the court declined to
address the question of the news media's own liability for
participating in such ``ride-alongs.''
</P>
<P>
   Without comment, the justices turned down an appeal by CNN from
a ruling by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in San
Francisco. In one of the cases the justices addressed last week,
the search by federal wildlife agents of a Montana ranch, the 9th
Circuit ruled last year that the network was effectively a joint
``government actor,'' sharing the agents' legal status and
liability.
</P>
<P>
   The justices' refusal to hear the network's appeal, CNN vs.
Berger, No. 97-1914, had little if any practical significance,
because the 9th Circuit was already obliged to reconsider the case
under the court's ruling last week. There are a number of factual
disputes to be resolved over what parts of the ranch were searched
and whether the owners consented to the agents' entry into their
home. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COPYRIGHT DISPUTE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Also without comment, the court refused to hear an appeal by the
West Publishing Co., a dominant presence in the field of legal
publishing, from a decision that it was not entitled to copyright
the system of page numbering that it uses, as well as some factual
information that it adds, to the judicial opinions it publishes.
</P>
<P>
   The opinions themselves, as public documents, may not be
copyrighted. West has fought a long battle to prevent electronic
competitors from undercutting its market by making its distinctive
arrangements of the opinions easy to cite without buying its
products.
</P>
<P>
   In two rulings last year, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals,
in New York, ruled against West and in favor of two CD-ROM
publishers. The appeals court based its rulings on a 1991 Supreme
Court case that rejected a copyright claim for arrangements of
facts, such as those in a telephone directory. The cases on Tuesday
were West Publishing vs. Matthew Bender &AMP; Co., No. 98-1500, and
West Publishing vs. HyperLaw Inc., No. 98-1519.

BRUINS SIGN ONE DRAFTEE, LOSE ANOTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Bruins beat the midnight deadline for locking up
one of their draft picks Tuesday but failed to come to terms with
another.
</P>
<P>
   In the fold is defenseman Eric Van Acker, a 6-foot-5-inch,
220-pound blue liner from Baie Comeau of the Quebec League. Van
Acker, 20, was selected in the ninth round (No. 218 overall) in the
1997 draft. In 65 games this season, Van Acker had one goal and six
assists as well as 202 penalty minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant general manager Mike O'Connell said Van Acker has work
to do to improve enough to play in the NHL. ``He has to work on his
agility,'' said O'Connell. ``He has good hockey sense and a great
attitude. Eric has shown improvement with his junior team since we
drafted him in 1997 and he has had the benefit of attending two of
our training camps (1997 and '98).''
</P>
<P>
   The defenseman the Bruins were unable to sign was 20-year-old
Jim Baxter, a 6-2, 186-pounder from Oshawa of the Ontario League.
Baxter was taken with the 180th pick (seventh round) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In 66 regular-season games, Baxter had 22 goals and 74 points
before racking up 12 points, four of them goals, in 14 playoff
games. Baxter will go back into the entry draft, which is scheduled
for June 26 at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   The situation with unsigned defenseman Ben Clymer is
significantly less clear. Clymer, who was taken by Boston in the
second round in 1997 (No. 27 overall), left the University of
Minnesota to play junior hockey for the Seattle Thunderbirds of the
Western Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   He is currently listed as a defected player. Because of a
loophole in the collective bargaining agreement, Clymer believes,
he should be declared a total free agent since he has been unable
to come to terms with the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   The club, on the other hand, believes that it retains his
rights, so the conflict will go to arbitration.

A HORSE NAMED BOB
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: This story also moved in the ``a'' national news file)  
 By LEAH GARCHIK  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   The mounted patrol of the San Francisco Police Department will
hold a christening ceremony on June 9 in the Golden Gate Park
stables for a horse named Bob.
</P>
<P>
   The horse, bought for the patrol with the name Chip, is to be
renamed after  &UR; Bob Geary &LR; , the officer who in 1988 campaigned
against proposed city budget cuts that would have done away with
the mounted unit. The 86 percent vote for the city proposition to
keep the horses was the highest proportion of any vote before then.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the horses in the unit arrive with other names and are
renamed after legendary cops, the unit's  &UR; Laura Bianchi  &LR; said. The
unit presently includes horses named Tom, Jack and Bill, for cops
famous in the '40s and '50s, and Ernie, after the late  &UR; Ernie &LR; 
 &UR; Provost &LR; , the first African American officer in the mounted patrol.
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted _ despite the Lone Ranger's ``Heigh-ho,
Silver'' _ that the equine Bob won't gallop into the Sunset
(Dd &LR; istrict) at the sound of his name. ``They don't respond to
their names,'' said Bianchi. ``They're not like dogs.''

screeching in response is ``one of the strangest and most
disturbing concerts you can hear anywhere. It builds up in
intensity as the planes approach ... and when the bombs start

GRAF, SELES, SANCHEZ VICARIO HEAD TO SEMIFINALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Like clockwork, their sorority meets once a year, every
year, on the red clay of Paris in springtime. For the past decade,
Steffi Graf, Monica Seles, and Arantxa Sanchez Vicario have exerted
a virtual monopoly on the French Open. The older they get, the
nicer it is to slide along on the clay and let the surface do their
walking for them. All three deployed that skill in reaching the
semifinals on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Second-seeded Lindsay Davenport, the defending U.S. Open
champion but an unwilling slider here, paid most for her inhibition
when Graf pulled off the only upset of the quarterfinals, 6-1, 6-7
(5-7), 6-3. Graf, seeded sixth after missing the 1998 French Open
because of knee surgery, thus achieved her first Grand Slam
semifinal since she won at Flushing Meadows in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Also making his first Grand Slam semifinal since Flushing
Meadows in 1996 was Andre Agassi, the only American-born player
left in either singles. Agassi's surprising French Open run, which
continued on Tuesday with a 6-2, 6-2, 6-0 quarterfinal rout of
Marcelo Filippini, is even more surprising because sliding is not
part of his game and clay is not his best surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially on clay, experience obviously helps, and patience
at times,'' said Graf, a 16-year veteran whose 85 victories
represent a Roland Garros record.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surface obviously has specialists, like Arantxa, like
Monica,'' said Graf, who modestly left herself off the list of
dirtball doyennes when referring to Sanchez Vicario and Seles.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the top-ranked and precocious Martina Hingis, a
champion at all three other Grand Slam events when she was only 16,
has been able to crack this exclusive club in Paris. Only Croatia's
Iva Majoli, who captured the 1997 title and has not won anything
since, has had the temerity to join the triumvirate.
</P>
<P>
   But an injured Majoli did not play here this year, and on
Tuesday the usual threesome, along with the omnipresent Hingis,
moved into the semifinals to the surprise of nobody, Davenport
included.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the games I was winning were a struggle,'' said
Davenport, who claimed only four combined in the first and third
sets.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport scraped through the second set's tiebreaker, but Graf
saved one set point by ripping a raucous forehand crosscourt but
succumbed to the backhand drive and forehand drop-shot combination
that Davenport invented on the second.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was getting some shots on clay that maybe on another
surface you can't get to; maybe because it's a little slower you
can slide to the ball,'' Davenport said. ``I don't move so great
anyways, and on clay it makes it even worse. It's slippery and I
don't like that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Graf, Seles and Sanchez Vicario do like it, and have the
trophies to prove it. At 29, Graf is a five-time French Open
champion and eight-time finalist; Seles is a three-time champion
who fell in last year's finale to Sanchez Vicario, also a
three-time winner here.
</P>
<P>
   Seles, now 25, reached the semifinals for the seventh time
Tuesday following a 6-1, 6-4 demolition of Spain's Conchita
Martinez, whose 18 titles on clay qualified her for honorable
mention on Graf's list of surface specialists but did not help her
handle Seles' brute power.
</P>
<P>
   An out of shape and out of sorts Seles performed here last year
only three weeks after the death of her father-coach, Karolj. This
year's version is fitter and more inclined to be a fighter, a
quality Seles will need in her semifinal against Graf, who leads
their rivalry by 9-5. But Graf was the runner-up when Seles
collected her 1990 and 1992 French Open titles and lost, 7-5, 6-1,
in their most recent Grand Slam confrontation at the Australian
Open quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez Vicario, 27, loves Roland Garros so much she named her
Yorkshire Terrier after it. On Tuesday, she kept her title defense
on track with a 6-2, 6-4 victory against Austria's 34th-ranked
Silvia Plischke, playing in her first Grand Slam quarterfinal.
Sanchez Vicario, who had decided against wrist surgery at the end
of last year, pronounced herself an improved player with each
passing round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I think I've always done very well here; I've won three
times,'' said Sanchez Vicario, whose claim on the 1999 championship
has been overlooked. ``There's something special when I come here,
even my game is getting better and better every day. Even when I'm
not doing so well, I raise to play my best tennis here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez Vicario figures to need her best tennis when she takes a
1-9 record against the aspiring champion, Hingis, in Thursday's
semifinals. Hingis carved up Barbara Schwartz, the 125th-ranked
Austrian qualifier, 6-2, 6-2. Schwartz had shocked fifth-seeded
Venus Williams in the Round of 16.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Williams, who confessed to underestimating and
underscouting Schwartz, Hingis did not merely research her
opponent's game, she assimilated it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best is just to get everything back and don't think where
it goes to,'' Hingis said. ``She had to have some part of a game
which is good, pretty dangerous, I think, into the future.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the present, the 18-year-old Hingis had all the answers
to the 20-year-old Schwartz. ``I anticipated much better toward the
middle of the first set already, just made her a little bit nervous
because of that,'' Hingis said. ``I was there, maybe sometimes
unexpected. I almost didn't miss anything; I just made her play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Venus, she was there, but then somehow she probably lost her
mind,'' Hingis said about Williams, who blew a 6-2 one-set lead
against Schwartz. ``I think I played very clever today.'' &QL;

A HORSE NAMED BOB

<TEXT>
<P>
   The mounted patrol of the San Francisco Police Department will
hold a christening ceremony on June 9 in the Golden Gate Park
stables for a horse named Bob.
</P>
<P>
   The horse, bought for the patrol with the name Chip, is to be
renamed after  &UR; Bob Geary &LR; , the officer who in 1988 campaigned
against proposed city budget cuts that would have done away with
the mounted unit. The 86 percent vote for the city proposition to
keep the horses was the highest proportion of any vote before then.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the horses in the unit arrive with other names and are
renamed after legendary cops, the unit's  &UR; Laura Bianchi  &LR; said. The
unit presently includes horses named Tom, Jack and Bill, for cops
famous in the '40s and '50s, and Ernie, after the late  &UR; Ernie &LR; 
 &UR; Provost &LR; , the first African American officer in the mounted patrol.
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted _ despite the Lone Ranger's ``Heigh-ho,
Silver'' _ that the equine Bob won't gallop into the Sunset
(Dd &LR; istrict) at the sound of his name. ``They don't respond to
their names,'' said Bianchi. ``They're not like dogs.''

ONE PRO BASEBALL PROSPECT TO PASS OVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The baseball draft is Wednesday. The Red Sox have the 17th pick
(for Mo Vaughn), plus ``sandwich'' picks at Nos. 40 and 48 (don't
you think all the ``sandwich'' picks should involve Mo?). The Sox
also have one second-round selection and two third-round picks.
</P>
<P>
   Shame on Boston if it uses any of its picks to select Wichita
State righthander Ben Christensen. As far as I'm concerned,
Christensen is the Christian Peter of this year's baseball draft.
</P>
<P>
   It's doubtful you've heard of Christensen. He's touted as a
high-round pick even though he hasn't pitched since April 23, when
he intentionally threw a ball at the head of Evansville's Anthony
Molina before Molina had even come to bat.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the scene: Christensen, a junior with a 21-1 career
record, was warming up for his start when he thought he detected
Molina trying to time his pitches from a spot about halfway between
the visitor's dugout and the on-deck circle. In accordance with
lessons taught by his manager, Gene Stephenson, and pitching coach,
Brent Kemnitz, Christensen believed this perceived infraction of
baseball etiquette gave him the right to throw at Molina.
</P>
<P>
   Christensen told the Wichita Eagle, ``If the on-deck hitter is
standing too close to home plate, you brush him back.''
</P>
<P>
   Molina was standing about 30 feet to the side of home plate, not
looking at the pitcher, when Christensen drilled him in the head.
The ball struck Molina in his left eye, fracturing the socket in
three places and opening a 1-inch gash that took 23 stitches to
close.
</P>
<P>
   Christensen was immediately thrown out of the game, while Molina
was rushed to Wichita's Wesley Medical Center. A week later, the
Missouri Valley Conference suspended the pitcher and the pitching
coach for the rest of the season. Christensen hired an attorney to
contest the suspension, but the penalty was upheld by the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   Molina, a junior catcher with no pro potential, will need laser
surgery on a left eye in which his vision was reduced from 20/10 to
20/160. As a result of the ``purpose pitch,'' he is legally blind
in that eye. He filed assault charges against Christensen, but they
were dismissed by nitwit local officials, making me wonder exactly
what constitutes assault in Wichita. Molina is said to be
contemplating a civil suit.
</P>
<P>
   After the episode, Stephenson said, ``Nobody intentionally hit
someone else. Hey, we're the ones who got hurt out of the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement alone should have cost Stephenson his job.
</P>
<P>
   Proving that there is a hardball god, Wichita State was
eliminated from the NCAA tournament last Sunday, losing twice to
Oklahoma State.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson must have been really steamed after his team was
knocked out. Just think what they might have been able to do if
Christensen hadn't been suspended for that ``minor'' infraction.
(Two messages left at the sports information office at Wichita
State went unreturned.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Christensen waits to be drafted Wednesday. This is
wrong. The young man should be banned from organized baseball until
he shows a little contrition. This episode is simply too heinous,
and there has to be some admission of wrongdoing and expression of
remorse.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to hear about baseball's ``unwritten rules,'' or
the code of the West. It's one thing to brush back a hitter or send
a message to a batter who is obviously stealing signs from the
catcher. At least the guy in the batter's box knows it might be
coming. But throwing a baseball at the head of someone who isn't
even looking _ some 30 feet to the side of home plate _ is a
criminal, cowardly act.
</P>
<P>
   Christensen was 9-1 this year with a 2.40 ERA and 77 strikeouts
in 71 1/3 innings. Opponents hit just .182 against him and he is
rated among the top 25 college players in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette said, ``He's supposed to be
a pretty accomplished pitcher. In a situation like this, we always
look into the particulars and find out the background and see what
type of impact it will have on his career.''
</P>
<P>
   Would the Sox be deterred by Christensen's hardball crime?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather not say how our team would approach an individual
decision,'' said Duquette. ``It's not in our interest to reveal
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine. Don't play your hand, Dan. Just don't pick Christensen.
Let some other organization pay a whopping bonus to this hardball
criminal.

EVEN IN A CHANGED SOUTH AFRICA, RACE IS STILL A FACTOR IN
ELECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa _ Even on the eve of South Africa's
second post-apartheid elections, race was still a dominating
factor: Thabo Mbeki, who is virtually certain to become this
country's next president, on Tuesday put out an open letter not to
all South Africans, but to whites.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki, who is President Nelson Mandela's heir apparent, said in
the letter, printed in newspapers on Tuesday, that there are some
in the country who insist on issuing negative messages suggesting
that whites are an endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is done to gain short-term political advantage without
regard to either the truth or the well-being of the white
population,'' he wrote, adding that whites should ``reject the
message of fear and despair'' peddled by opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
   As South Africans go the polls Wednesday, they have much to
celebrate. In 1994, the year of the first all-race elections, the
fear of civil war hung in the air and violence crackled on the
ground. During the campaign season, whites hoarded canned goods and
ammunition, while blacks died by the thousands in bloody clashes.
</P>
<P>
   None of that is true today. Indeed, a mere five years later,
South Africans seem so adept at democracy that there has been a
kind of ho-humness to this campaign season. But race continues to
divide this society and despite all the campaigning, South Africans
of different races are expected to go their separate ways when they
step into the voting booth.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela, who has had an unerring sense of the gesture that
could, at least for a few moments, bring out the patriotism in all
South Africans, will retire. But his African National Congress
party is expected to win easily, capturing the vast majority of
black votes and perhaps even two-thirds of the seats in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The 80-year-old Mandela, who has often campaigned until he is
hoarse, remains beloved. But his departure is not unexpected, and
many South Africans are taking it in stride. They talk with
fondness of a hero who needs help climbing stairs now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is tired,'' said Rebecca Dlamini, 36, a nurse's aide from
Soweto. ``He should be allowed to go rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Some South Africans even look forward to the leadership of
Mbeki, 56. He is seen here as a man who may crack the whip better
than Mandela did. Bookish, pipe-smoking and reserved, Mbeki does
not have Mandela's moral authority. But he is considered a shrewd
administrator: perhaps the man to tackle the country's most
persistent problems and, as he promises, to speed up change.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months, the British-educated Mbeki has been
working on his image, often trading in his crisp suits for sport
shirts and plunging into crowds to shake hands. Polls indicate that
his popularity has risen about 10 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   But polls also indicate that the ANC has not managed to attract
most of the white or mixed-race voters _ about 23 percent of the
population. Two white-led parties have been locked in a tight
battle for those voters, with both parties harping on the fears of
these groups that the country's black majority will ignore their
rights.
</P>
<P>
   One of the parties is the the National Party, which first
imposed apartheid on South Africa and has renamed itself the New
National Party. It is feeding whites' fears with posters referring
to the president of neighboring Zimbabwe, Robert Mugabe, who is
trying to expropriate land from white farmers without paying them
for it.
</P>
<P>
   The other largely white party, the Liberal Democratic Party, has
been even more forthright with its slogan, ``fight back.'' Its
leader, Tony Leon, regularly warns his audiences that a two-thirds
majority could mean a lifetime presidency for Mbeki or ``anything
else the ANC wants.''
</P>
<P>
   The country that Mbeki will inherit is already far different
than the one of which Mandela took charge. Under the leadership of
the ANC, the country has adopted a new constitution _ one of the
most liberal in the world. And it has passed more than 500 laws,
revamping a legal system that once did not allow blacks to vote and
contended that they needed only a rudimentary education.
</P>
<P>
   More than half a million new homes have been built since the
last election, and telephone and electric lines now crisscross even
squatter camps. Millions of people have been given access to clean
water, health care and school feeding programs.
</P>
<P>
   But problems still abound. The crime rates have soared. More
than 500,000 jobs have been lost as the country's once isolated and
protected economy has tried to compete on the global market.
Hoped-for foreign investment has not materialized. And the country
has one of the fastest-growing AIDS infection rates in the world.
Poor schools and corruption also remain issues.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the giddy feelings of triumph that accompanied
the country's first all-race elections have faded. And some South
Africans believe the country is more racially polarized than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys indicate that blacks and whites hold widely differing
views. Blacks are optimistic about the future. Whites are not _
though they still control the vast majority of the country's wealth
and have only a 4 percent unemployment rate, compared with nearly
40 percent for the country as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, blacks say joblessness is the country's
biggest problem. Whites say it is crime. The two groups even rate
leaders differently. Mandela is the most popular leader among
blacks. But Leon rates highest among whites.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   As the campaign came to an end, Mbeki's letter was just one sign
of the divisions. The campaign's waning days were marked by bitter
exchanges by all the participants. As he closed the ANC campaign at
a rally in Soweto, Mbeki taunted the opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the elections are over, the opposition parties will
continue to cry waa, waa, waa,'' Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Leon accused the state-owned television of
towing the ANC line. And the leader of the New National Party,
Martinus van Schalwyk, took Leon to task for being ``isolationist
and adverserial,'' and said he is trying to take a the same course
that whites took in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Violence has not been totally absent from the campaign trail.
And in some parts of the country _ particularly in rural areas and
in squatter camps _ political freedom is still elusive. There have
been clashes between ANC supporters and members of two other
black-led parties _ the new United Democratic Party, headed by
Bantu Holomisa, and the ANC's chief rival in 1994, the Inkatha
Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been nothing that compares with the level of
violence that existed five years ago. Nevertheless more than 80,000
soldiers and police officers will be deployed to keep the peace on
Wednesday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During the 1994 elections, each of South Africa's 22 million
voters could basically walk into a voting booth, present any kind
of document and vote. Some of the country's 15,000 polling places
are still just white plastic tents pitched on the side of the road
and furnished with cardboard stalls for privacy.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, voters will have to produce new bar-coded
identification documents if they want to vote, and hundreds of
computers will be collecting and counting the votes in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
   The euphoria of election day in 1994 is unlikely to be matched
Wednesday. But if voter registration is any indication, turnout
should be high. The country's election commission says that more
than 80 percent of the voting age population has registered. And
many blacks say the thrill of voting has not worn off yet.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when polls opened early for the elderly and the
infirm, Ernest Ndlamgisa, 71, who walks slowly and needs a cane,
was the first to make his mark at a voting booth in Thokoza, on the
outskirts of Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it's nice to vote,'' Ndlamgisa said. ``I like it. I still
want to vote next time too, if I'm still alive.''

<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ In he hours leading up to the clash, the sounds
were not quite what they were in the wee hours before Agincourt,
when, as Shakespeare related, the warriors in the near-flung French
and English camps saw each others' campfires, and listened as
``steed threatens steed'' and the ``armorers'' prepared the knights
``with busy hammers.''
</P>
<P>
   The day before and the morning before Game 2 in the Eastern
Conference finals between the Knicks and the Pacers Tuesday night
in Market Square Arena here, the sounds were the thump of a
basketball in practice, the squeak of sneakers and talk of
expectations, executions (in running their plays, that is) and
possible exaltations.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing how the Knicks had vanquished the favored and home-team
Pacers in the first game of the four-of-seven-game series, Mark
Jackson, the former Knick point guard and the current Pacer point
guard, was asked if his team felt a sense of desperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Same desperation as Game 1,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but an observer might nod and wonder, ``but only more
so?''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, all games in the playoffs are significant _ players
know that no matter how far ahead or how far behind a team is in a
series, there is always the chance for a reversal of fortune. But
staring the Pacers in their collective, determined faces was the
distinct and rather ugly possibility that if they lost again
Tuesday night they would go into Madison Square Garden to resume
the series, down two games to zero, and play the next two games
before that wild and crazy Gotham crowd.
</P>
<P>
   It is the same kind of crowd from which the rather cloistered
chess champ, Bobby Fischer, taken years ago to a basketball game at
the Garden for the first time and seated in the first row, heard
the thunderous roar of the crowd, turned and looked wide-eyed over
his shoulder, and asked his companion, ``Are they dangerous?''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not physically _ it wasn't a hockey crowd, after all _ but
possibly psychically.
</P>
<P>
   Of course an athlete must feel loose and confident if he is to
perform at his apex. And Larry Bird, the Pacers' head coach, and a
former player of some note, understands this fully. He acknowledged
that the Pacers would have to get back quicker on defense to stop
the Knick fast break, that Rik Smits his 7-foot-4-inch center had
to be more aggressive on offense and perhaps a little less
aggressive on defense _ no silly fouls! And he said, too, that his
estimable star sub, Jalen Rose, couldn't take his Knick
counterpart, Latrell Sprewell, as a personal insult, but must
remain in the flow of the team game, and he acknowledged that it
was important for Jackson to not only post-up effectively against
the likes of Chris Childs, but to make those jump hooks from four
feet out that he rolled off the rim in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   Given all that and more, Bird also laid the underpinnings for a
potential loss in Game 2. ``We're a good road team,'' he said.
``We've had success this season on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. And the success included no road losses to Milwaukee and
Philadelphia, since the Pacers swept the Bucks and 76ers in the
first two rounds of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   It is also true that Jackson, having played for the Knicks for
five seasons, starting in 1987, is hardly a stranger to the Garden,
nor are Chris Mullin or Sam Perkins, both of whom, like Jackson,
are from New York City. And when Jackson was asked about a New York
tabloid headline that called this series the ``Knicks versus
Hicks,'' he said he found it curious. ``We have three guys from New
York City,'' he said, ``I don't know where the Knick guys are from,
but I'd bet none of them have ever been to downtown Brooklyn.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing is from Jamaica (not Queens) and Boston; Allan
Houston is from Louisville; Larry Johnson is from Tyler, Texas;
Sprewell is from Milwaukee; Childs is from Bakersfield, Calif., and
Charlie Ward is from Tallahassee. Only Marcus Camby and Chris
Dudley are even neighbors, from Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   And to Reggie Miller, the Great Knick Villain, the Garden is
like a second home. Tensions with the Knicks are generally a happy
sop to him _ though his 3-point shot with his team down by a point
with 12 seconds to go in Game 1 ended by the ball hitting the front
rim. But it is only too quickly remembered by Knick fans how he
burned them for 39 points in Game 5 of the 1994 conference finals,
his 8 points in the final 8.9 seconds to co-opt Game 1 of the 1995
second-round series and his 3-pointer in last year's second-round
series, which necessitated an overtime, in which the Pacers
triumphed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thought Knicks-Pacers would be a war,'' Rose said.
``And now we have one.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, to paraphrase Jackson, same ol', same ol' desperation. &QL;

   CAIRO, Egypt _ It's not just that she's a blue-eyed blonde. Nor
is it just the revealing clothes that show off her famous figure.
The real trouble is that Barbie has a boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   To put it plainly, that plastic icon of Western girlhood is seen
in the Middle East, where modesty matters, as something of a tramp.
</P>
<P>
   As a better role model, children's advocates across the region
are now staking their hopes on Laila and Sara, dark-haired,
dark-eyed dolls who wouldn't be caught dead in a miniskirt and
whose idea of a good time is hanging out with their brothers, not
hopping into that vacation camper with Ken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbie wears a bikini and drinks champagne,'' said Dr. Abla
Ibrahiem, an official at the Cairo-based Arab League who has headed
the drive to develop one of the new dolls. ``We need to prevent our
children from feeling torn between their Arab traditions and the
life style that Barbie represents.''
</P>
<P>
   In capitals like Cairo and Tehran, many parents, who have grown
tired of shelling out between $30 and $150 for imported Barbies
that set the wrong examples, say they agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to explain to the kid just who that man is in
Barbie's life,'' said Jihan Abdel Aal, a Cairo television producer
who is the mother of a 7-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
   Hanaa Maamoun, an interior designer who is the mother of an
8-year-old daughter, said she looks forward to the introduction of
``a doll who looks like my girl, with dark hair and dark eyes _ an
Egyptian doll with an Egyptian spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter wants to wear high heels and miniskirts like
Barbie's,'' Mrs. Maamoun said. ``Of course I buy them, but I also
tell her than when she is grown up, she should not wear clothes
like that. It really is a horrible culture gap.''
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that censorship was the preferred method in the
Middle East of fending away what was seen as a corrupting Western
culture. Even today, in much of the region, films, books and
magazines are routinely subjected to a thorough scrub by government
censors; in some countries, even Internet use is policed.
</P>
<P>
   What is new in the tale of Barbie and her rivals is that instead
of banning what is no longer wanted, Middle East governments have
poured resources into the development of alternatives _ and plan to
peddle the new, non-Western dolls with modern, Western-style
marketing techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Iran, an Islamic republic whose leaders have long shunned
Western ways, is the home of the first project _ the introduction
(but not, of course, the unveiling) of Sara, who, in compliance
with the country's strict dress codes, would be covered from head
to toe in a severe black chador.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian government first spoke of the idea three years ago,
but the doll's debut has been delayed until later this year, so
that it can be linked to a Hollywood-style merchandising blitz of
films, cartoons, music and storybooks, said Majid Ghaderi, of the
government's Institute for the Intellectual Development of Children
and Young Adults.
</P>
<P>
   The delay hasn't sapped the anticipation of Iranian parents,
like those who stop in regularly at the Uncle New Year toy store, a
leading shop in downtown Tehran, ask whether Sara and her brother
Dara have arrived on the market, said Farshid Favili, the owner's
son.
</P>
<P>
   Cairo is the home of the other project, introducing Laila,
styled by Ibrahiem, the Arab League official, as a ``representative
Arab girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Since it decided last October to go forward with the project,
the 22-member Arab League has conducted feasibility studies to
persuade investors that there will be a lucrative market for the
doll in all of the member countries, which range geographically
from Mauritania to Iraq but do not include non-Arab Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The doll is to be manufactured privately, beginning sometime
next year, once the Arab League chooses among several bidders. But
the organization has already market-tested the name (Laila, a
non-religious moniker, is thought likely to appeal to both
Christians and Muslims), the costumes (along with modern,
Western-style outfits, they are to include traditional folkloric
dress from Egypt, Syria, Palestinian areas, North Africa and the
Persian Gulf region), the concept of a brother (still to be named)
as best friend, and the very idea of what a ``representative Arab
girl'' should look like.'
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the decidedly post-pubescent Barbie, Laila is to
be a girl somewhere between 10 and 12 years in age, with big black
eyes, long lashes, pink cheeks, full lips and wavy black hair.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of bras and bikini panties, Ibrahiem said, she will wear
children's underwear. In her Western-style clothing, Laila will
show more skin than the chador-draped Sara. But by Barbie's
standards, she will be an emblem of modesty.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a doll with decent clothes and a brother, not a
boyfriend,'' Ibrahiem said.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, dolls meant to look like the people who live here
have been scarce in the Middle East, in large part because few toys
are produced in the region. The prohibitive cost of imported raw
materials, usually subject to high duties, has usually made it more
economical for retailers to import finished goods, toy store owners
say.
</P>
<P>
   But Egyptian and Iranian officials said subsidies and exemptions
would allow them to sell Laila and Sara for as little as $10 _ not
cheap by the standards of an impoverished region, but a bargain
compared with Barbie. The bigger obstacle may be whether marketing
alone can overpower Western standards of beauty that are already
entrenched even among pre-teens.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it is not just Barbie, but American television shows
like ``Baywatch'' _ available by satellite _ that continue to set a
kind of worldwide standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is my best friend,'' said Nada Hamid, 7, of her Barbie.
For an Egyptian girl, Nada's hair, a curly brown, is light in
color, but Nada said she wished it were lighter. ``I want my hair
to be shiny and golden, too.''

CISNEROS LAWYER QUESTIONS GOVERNMENT'S KEY WITNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A lawyer for former Housing Secretary Henry
Cisneros said Tuesday he would attack the credibility of the woman
who has agreed to be the government's star witness when Cisneros
goes on trial for an alleged conspiracy to conceal payments he made
to her following their affair.
</P>
<P>
   And lawyer Barry Simon said the defense opposes the government's
use of tape-recorded telephone conversations that Linda Jones,
known by her married name Linda Medlar, had with Cisneros before
and after he was confirmed as the secretary of Housing and Urban
Development in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has admitted the tapes were altered,'' Simon told U.S.
District Judge Stanley Sporkin during a hearing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Jackowski, a prosecutor working with Independent Counsel
David Barrett, said the government would use the tapes to show
Jones, Cisneros and two of his aides, John Rosales and Sylvia Arce,
conspired to conceal $250,000 in payments Cisneros made to Jones
after their publicly acknowledged affair.
</P>
<P>
   Jackowski said Jones' testimony will make it easier for the
government to get the tapes admitted as evidence and would reduce
the expected length of the trial from eight to four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The four defendants were named in a 21-count federal indictment
in December 1997 alleging conspiracy and fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Sporkin, who has grown restless with delays in the case, has a
trial date of July 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``Folks, we have to get this thing going,'' Sporkin said. ``It's
been so long now, I really don't understand why this case cannot be
tried like any other case.''
</P>
<P>
   He ruled last year that the independent counsel had the right to
bring Cisneros to trial on charges that he lied to the FBI about
payments to Jones.
</P>
<P>
   A federal appeals court upheld that ruling this year, paving the
way for the trial to resume in Sporkin's court. Although Cisneros
can seek a review by the Supreme Court, his lawyers said he would
not ask for an emergency stay that would further delay the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are anxious for this case to come to trial,'' said Barrett,
who has spent more than $7 million investigating the affair of
Cisneros, a former mayor of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, of Lubbock, Texas, is serving time in a federal prison
for bank fraud, money laundering and obstruction of justice.
Prosecutors have offered a reduced prison sentence for Jones in
exchange for cooperation in the case against Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   ``Linda Medlar has agreed to testify on behalf of the United
States,'' Jackowski told the court.
</P>
<P>
   That set off legal bantering between prosecutors and Simon, who
recounted how Jones was first offered immunity, then indicted after
prosecutors discovered the tapes she had submitted were not the
originals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, Mrs. Medlar's second round of cooperation
complicates the hearing tremendously,'' Simon argued.
</P>
<P>
   Simon pledged to challenge the legality of the tapes under
wiretapping statutes and the authenticity of the recordings in
light of Jones' admission they were altered.
</P>
<P>
   Jackowski countered that Jones ``edited out very few of these
tapes.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosales and Arce have declined government offers to testify
against Cisneros, according to a source close to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, who was HUD secretary from 1993 to 1996, is president
of the Spanish-language television network Univision in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI says Cisneros told investigators he had paid Jones about
$60,000 before he was nominated for the HUD position. The
indictment charges Cisneros paid her $250,000, including $73,000
after he took office on Jan. 21, 1993.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In another action inspired by the killings at a
Colorado high school in April, two federal agencies will undertake
an investigation of the marketing of mayhem in movies, music and
video games aimed at children.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton announced Tuesday that he had asked the
Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission to study
whether the entertainment industry is violating its own voluntary
codes by luring children to watch violent films, listen to explicit
music, and play murderous video games.
</P>
<P>
   At a Rose Garden ceremony Tuesday morning, Clinton cited
advertising in magazines for video game players that invited the
readers to ``kill your friends guilt free,'' ``get in touch with
your gun-toting, cold-blooded murdering side'' or buy a game that
is ``more fun than shooting your neighbor's cat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this stuff sells,'' the president said. ``But that
doesn't make it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's announcement marked the second time in a month that
the Clinton administration has trumpeted a study of violence in
popular culture. In mid-May, the president directed the surgeon
general to study the possible link between between stylized
violence in popular culture and real violence by young people. The
surgeon general has done two previous studies on the subject over
the last 25 years, concluding there was a correlation between
viewing violent images and aggressive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said they do not expect the current inquiries
to result in any litigation or enforcement action because violent
movies and games are not illegal products. Advertising for them is
protected speech under the First Amendment unless it can be proven
to be false or deceptive.
</P>
<P>
   The study is expected to take 12 to 18 months and cost about $1
million, White House officials said. The long lead time will allow
Vice President Al Gore to answer Republican charges that the
administration is soft on Hollywood by saying that two studies are
under way and he is awaiting the results.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton chastised entertainment leaders for offering gruesome
fare to minors, he asked their voluntary support in reducing the
violent language and imagery on movie screens, television sets and
computer displays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't make young people want what your own rating systems say
they shouldn't have,'' Clinton said to a small audience of
supporters and a bank of television cameras. ``The time has come to
show some restraint, even if it has a short-term impact on the
bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   The president borrowed the idea of asking the FTC to study
advertising and violence from Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., who
proposed the investigation in an amendment to a juvenile-justice
bill that the Senate approved two weeks ago. The vote on
Brownback's amendment was 98-0.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's latest assault on Hollywood comes just three weeks
after he attended a $2 million political fund-raiser in Beverly
Hills at which he gently chided his hosts for including too much
violence in their products.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment executives reacted angrily to Clinton's latest
rhetorical attack, accusing him of using them as scapegoats for a
deeper societal problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music industry doesn't market violence to children, but of
course we'll cooperate with the FTC,'' said Hilary Rosen, president
of the Recording Industry Association of America. ``Our companies
don't have anything to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And apart from that,'' Ms. Rosen added, ``the president was
clearly looking for headlines today and he wanted to get credit for
an amendment that Senator Brownback had developed. I think it's
cynical and I think it will be viewed as such.''
</P>
<P>
   Another entertainment industry executive, who asked not to be
identified because he often works with the White House, was
harsher.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are furious,'' he said. ``Three weeks ago, in a White
House meeting we all attended, they were talking about holding
hands and working with us. Now all of a sudden they've taken the
gloves off and are beating us up with this investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   This industry official said Clinton had handed Republicans in
Congress an easy victory by failing to include gun manufacturers in
the study of advertising practices.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans tend to support gun-ownership rights _ and are
generously supported by the gun lobby for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood is largely Democratic turf, and Clinton has generally
pulled his punches when dealing with his reliable donor base in the
entertainment community.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the video game manufacturers was more measured
in his remarks, saying that his industry was looking at ways to
tone down the advertising for its more lurid games.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital
Software Association in Washington, said parents have the primary
responsibility for policing the games their children buy and play.

her main goal, she said, was to give the girls a chance to have a
better life. The lawyer who took her children to New York, she
said, ``told me he would build me two rooms with new tin for the
roof.'' Ms. Toscano never got her new house. Last week, the lawyer
and two women on Long Island were arrested and charged with running
a baby-smuggling ring. Some of the adoptive parents have complained
that the women lured them into illegal agreements by preying on
their desperation to have children. But, worlds away, in this

2ND-QUARTER SHORTFALL FOR AMERICAN HOME PRODUCTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   American Home Products, the drug maker that has been prone to
public calamities over the last several years, found itself in
another one Tuesday when it announced that its earnings for the
second quarter would be 20.5 percent less than expected because of
weak demand for its agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by the pharmaceutical company, the world's
seventh-largest, caught most analysts and investors by surprise and
was the latest entry in a growing list of troubles. The company had
two failed mega-mergers last year and withdrew several of its drugs
from the market because of health concerns, notably the diet drug
fen-phen.
</P>
<P>
   The second-quarter shortfall is expected to cut 11 cents a
diluted share, or 5.8 percent, from the company's estimated annual
income of $1.89 a share. With the revision, earnings at American
Home Products will most likely decline in the second quarter and
for the year, giving the company one of the worst performances in
the industry. Most large pharmaceutical companies have routinely
posted quarterly earnings gains of 12 percent or more, with some,
like Warner-Lambert, posting gains well above 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The news sent investors fleeing. The company's shares dropped
$5.625, or 9.7 percent, to $52. The setback erased the stock's 2
percent gain for the year, one of the industry's best, leaving it
with a negative return of 7.76 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   While analysts had long known that the company's agricultural
division was a lackluster performer, most were surprised by the
severity of the decline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bomb,'' Jack Lamberton, a managing director of HSBC
Securities, said of the announcement. ``American Home Products was
slow to recognize the threat of biotechnology in the agricultural
sector. They may have been trying to correct that last year with
their failed attempt'' to merge with Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   American Home Products, based in Madison, N.J., attributed the
declines in its agricultural sector to reduced demand for grain in
the United States and the company's international markets. The
company's agricultural division, which includes brand-name
herbicides Arsenal and Prowl, had pretax income last year of $494.9
million and sales of $2.19 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Tuesday that all agricultural companies had
suffered from declines in grain demand but that American Home
Products might have been especially hurt by price competition from
Monsanto. By reducing its prices on its popular Roundup herbicides,
Monsanto appeared to have lured sales away from the American Home
Products brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the past year, there has been a lot of repositioning in
the agricultural industry,'' said Tom Brakel, an analyst at Mehta
Partners, a biopharmaceutical research firm. ``American Home
Products didn't have an aggressive strategy like Monsanto or Du
Pont. Sales at American Home's agricultural business could be down
40 percent by the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts noted Tuesday that American Home's misfortunes with its
agricultural products might be a mixed blessed. Company executives
appear eager to sell it, a move that analysts applaud. American
Home's pharmaceutical division, which accounted for 66 percent of
the company's $13 billion in sales last year, has performed quite
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never liked the company being in agribusiness anyway,'' said
David Saks, a managing director at Gruntal &AMP; Co. ``This may be the
straw that breaks the company from expanding it. Now we may see
some kind of deal on the pharmaceutical end.''

   TIRANA, Albania _ NATO bombs strayed across the Kosovo border on
Tuesday and hit the Albanian town that is the main crossing point
for refugees fleeing Kosovo. One refugee was injured, though not
seriously, in the attack just after he had crossed the border, said
officials monitoring the border.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesmen said that the bombing was a mistake, although one
NATO official said the bombs were deliberately dropped.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the second day in a row of heavy bombing in southern
Kosovo, and despite the nearness of the explosions, 50 ethnic
Albanian refugees crossed the border into Morini. On Monday, the
bombs also fell within several hundred yards of refugees on the
move, raising fears that additional refugees could be injured or
possibly killed in the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, it's a major source of concern,'' said Andrea
Angeli, a spokesman for the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, which monitors regional military activity.
``But at the same time, we know there is increased military
activity of NATO in the area.''
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, Serbian forces stepped up their attacks on Albanian
border villages, shelling Morini, the town that NATO bombed. The
shelling damaged concrete border bunkers, but no one was hurt,
Angeli said.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian mortars, apparently for the first time in the conflict,
also hit an Albanian military position on this side of the border,
Angeli said. Until now, Serbian attacks into Albania over several
months had largely focused on areas where the Kosovo Liberation
Army rebels are reportedly based. ``What happened last night is
certainly an escalation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Angeli said seven bombs fell in the early afternoon, scattered
from 500 yards to within two miles of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Angeli said that a refugee, 30, whom the Serbian police had held
in prison, was hit by shrapnel but not seriously injured. The man,
also suffering from shock, was treated at an Italian refugee camp
near Kukes.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, Serbian forces continued shelling small border
villages used by the KLA as transit areas into Kosovo, destroying a
crossing in Pogaj. For the first time, four shells fell into the
largest town in the area, Krume. Two exploded, setting off panic,
but no one was injured, Angeli said.

   BELGRADE _ Raising hopes for a diplomatic end to the crisis in
Kosovo, a war-weary Yugoslavia said Tuesday it would accept the
general conditions of the Group of Eight nations' demands for
peace.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Balkans negotiator Viktor Chernomyrdin and Finnish
President Martii Ahtisaari were expected to head to Belgrade
Wednesday for what could be make-or-break talks with Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   At a separate meeting in Brussels, military officials from more
than 30 nations met to draft plans for an international security
force in Kosovo that would ensure that ethnic Albanians can return
to their homes safely.

   The group meeting at NATO's military headquarters, representing
19 NATO nations and 12 partner countries, will help create a force
of 50,000, nearly double the number originally envisioned more than
two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia, meanwhile, awaits word Wednesday on a legal attempt
to stop the bombing. A United Nations court is expected to decide
whether the NATO bombing is illegal and should be halted
immediately, as Yugoslavia claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are facing decisive days'' that could determine an
``escalation'' of the war or a genuine move toward peace, German
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said Tuesday, as Chernomyrdin and
Ahtisaari met in Bonn with their US colleague, Deputy Secretary of
State Strobe Talbott.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting Wednesday marks the fifth time Chernomyrdin has met
with Milosevic since NATO began bombing March 24, but it would be
the first time someone from the military alliance accompanied him.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's foreign minister, Zivadin Jovanovic, Tuesday sent a
letter to Fischer reiterating that Yugoslavia was ready to accept
the five principles laid out by the G-8. The G-8 consists of seven
industrialized nations plus Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions are that Yugoslav troops pull out of Kosovo, that
the fighting and repression in the province stop, that the hundreds
of thousands of refugees driven from Kosovo be allowed to return,
and that Milosevic allow an interim political administration of
Kosovo and an international peacekeeping force there.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials toned down their usual defiance of NATO and
emphasized their willingness to reach a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yugoslavia has accepted G-8 principles including a United
Nations presence, mandate, and other elements to be decided by a UN
Security Council resolution in accordance with the United Nations
charter,'' Jovanovic said.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, one Yugoslav cabinet minister, Goran Matic, was
optimistic that a deal could be done, but warned that the United
States and Britain might want to block a deal so the bombing could
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the acceptance of G-8 principles was the endgame,
Matic replied, ``I hope so. I think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain why, he said, ``Let's wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Matic was uncharacteristically conciliatory, saying: ``We are
ready to accept a peaceful solution based on the G-8 peace plan.
This is our basic principle.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Italy responded cautiously to Belgrade's
tentative olive branch, saying that Milosevic must meet NATO's
demands if he wants NATO to stop bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Western allies also are suspicious of Milosevic, who is
notorious for a negotiating tactic of bringing a crisis to the
brink, making a concession, then taking advantage of the breathing
room to escalate the crisis again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need evidence. We can't abide only by a general acceptance
of principles,'' said Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, in
Washington to meet with US Secretary of State Madeleine K.
Albright. ``Milosevic has shown time and time again'' that he
``wants to leave an opening, step forward, and then step back,''
Dini said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no time for tricks,'' Dini said.
</P>
<P>
   Ahtisaari said it was unclear whether Belgrade was willing to
accept the peace plan outlined by the G-8 principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clarity has to be sought from the Yugoslav end,'' he said
Tuesday night during a break with his talks with Chernomyrdin and
Talbott.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main sticking points _ a dispute that goes back to
the failed peace talks in France early this year _ is the makeup of
the peacekeeping force. The alliance is insisting that the troops
be NATO-led.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia, apparently uncomfortable with the idea of being
monitored by armed troops from the nations that have been bombing
Yugoslavia for more than two months, wants an international force
that excludes certain nations.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Yugoslav news organization Beta,
Yugoslav General Nebojsa Pavkovic said troops from the NATO
countries leading the bombing, the United States, Britain, France,
and Germany, would not be acceptable inside Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The G-8 principles do not specify the makeup of the peacekeeping
troops. Nor do they stipulate whether any Yugoslav troops could
stay in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia, anxious that the long-separatist ethnic Albanians
will take Kosovo away, does not want to pull all of its troops out.
Western allies worry that if Serb troops stay, many ethnic Albanian
refugees will be afraid to come back, and Milosevic might renew
trouble in the province.
</P>
<P>
   As diplomats pushed ahead with their mission, NATO conducted its
own, hammering Yugoslavia with bombs. In Kosovo, American
``Warthog'' attack planes hit Serbian forces who were fighting
Kosovo Liberation Army rebels along the Albanian border.
</P>
<P>
   By 9:30 p.m. Tuesday, NATO was bombing in and around Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Matic had predicted as much, saying that NATO always steps up
its bombing right after Chernomyrdin meets with Milosevic, or
whenever there is progress toward a political solution. ``We have a
saying in Belgrade: `Watch out, Chernomyrdin is coming,' '' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO planes also apparently hit four defensive bunkers on the
Albanian sideby mistake, according to an Albanian military officer.
NATO has not confirmed that account.
</P>
<P>
   The hills and shoreline of Albania are peppered with as many as
700,000 of the concrete, dome-shaped ``pillbox'' bunkers, a vestige
of the rule of Cold War Albanian dictator Enver Hoxha.
</P>
<P>
   Hoxha built the bunkers and provided Albania with a heavy
arsenal of small weaponry, insisting to his people that they were
under threat of an assault from the West. Most of the guns were
looted by Albanian rebels during riots two years ago, and some of
these weapons have been sold to ethnic Albanian fighters in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William S. Cohen said NATO will not compromise
on its demands for a peacekeeping force. ``There must be a command
and control structure that is NATO's in charge of any peacekeeping
operation,'' Cohen told reporters after making a speech to a
suburban Washington high school.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen also reiterated that NATO would not pause the bombing in
the face of diplomatic progress. Belgrade has insisted that bombing
must stop before there is a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pause would only serve Milosevic's interests,'' Cohen said.
``He is seeking to try to divide the alliance. He is seeking delay.
We are now at the point where the air campaign is being intensified
on a 24-hour basis.''

SPURS APPEAR PREDESTINED TO CLAIM WEST TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ None of the players and coaches involved wants to
admit it, but there is a sense of predestination looming over the
Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio Spurs, the fortunate team, will not acknowledge
what appears to be their fate because they want to avoid a letdown
this weekend on the road. And the Portland Trail Blazers, the
undone ones, refuse to give credence to the theory because the
seemingly inevitable is not in their favor.
</P>
<P>
   But as the clubs exited the Alamodome floor after the Spurs'
dramatic 86-85 victory on Monday night, the thought had to cross
their minds and linger.
</P>
<P>
   How else to explain the off-balanced, game-winning 3-pointer by
Sean Elliott that gave the Spurs their first lead with nine seconds
remaining? The slender forward has been known as an anticlutch
player throughout his 10-year career.
</P>
<P>
   How else to explain San Antonio's five victories in six meetings
this season with Portland, all of which were decided in the final
minute? How else to explain the Blazers' ability to play wisely
down the stretch against the seasoned Utah Jazz but make error
after error in the waning moments against the Spurs?
</P>
<P>
   Damon Stoudamire, the Portland point guard who missed an
opportunity to give the Blazers a 3-point lead by missing 1 of 2
free throws only three seconds before Elliott's miracle shot,
seemed to sense that his team was doomed when he spoke
exasperatedly about its ineffectiveness against the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just so sick and tired of losing to this team,''
Stoudamire said. ``They are a real thorn in our side.''
</P>
<P>
   A thorn that is halfway toward becoming a fatal injury. With
Game 3 scheduled for Friday night at Portland's Rose Garden, the
Spurs hold a two-games-to-none lead despite having failed to
dominate the Blazers in either of the first two games.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was the Blazers who controlled much of Monday's
game. Playing efficiently on both ends of the floor, the Blazers
led by 14 points at halftime and by 18 early in the third quarter.
Never in the two teams' five previous games had they been separated
by such a large margin.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the Spurs made their charges, the Trail Blazers seemed
prepared. After a 14-0 run pulled the Spurs within 3 points midway
through the third quarter, the Blazers pushed the lead back to 9
points early in the fourth. Later in the quarter, the Blazers did
it again, increasing a 1-point advantage with five minutes
remaining to 8 points three minutes later. With one minute left,
the Blazers' lead stood at a comfortable 6 points, making a victory
for the Spurs seem impossible.
</P>
<P>
   That is when unusual things started to happen, and the Blazers
lost their poise. Stoudamire committed his seventh turnover and
Elliott made him pay with a 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers' Rasheed Wallace made a weak pass attempt that ended
up in the hands of David Robinson, which led to two free throws by
Mario Elie for the Spurs. Then, after Stoudamire split his pair of
free throws, Stacey Augmon decided against playing it safe and
gambled for a steal of Elie's inbounds pass to Elliott, giving
Elliott just enough space to get off his wondrous 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   When two jump shots by the Blazers' Jimmy Jackson and Walt
Williams fell short of the basket on the final possession, Portland
felt the sting of losing the second straight game it could have
won. With seven seconds left in Game 1, Wallace missed an open
20-footer that could have tied the game.
</P>
<P>
   Isaiah Rider, the Blazers' shooting guard who missed the last 17
minutes of the game with a sore knee, was succinct in describing
the difference between the Spurs and the Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We choked,'' Rider said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the late collapse, Mike Dunleavy, the Blazers' coach,
found little fault with his team. He instead described the outcome
as something that was almost unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased with the way we played,'' Dunleavy said. ``It took
an incredible shot to beat us. I'm not down about this. I told the
guys you have nothing to hang your head about. This is progress.
It's getting harder and harder for this team to beat us here.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Spurs continue to do so, even when it seems they should
not win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Portland deserved to win,'' Elie said, ``but we didn't quit.
That's the sign of a champion.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is also the sign of destiny.
</P>

BUSINESS TRAVEL: BOOKING HOTEL ROOMS ONLINE; AIRFARES INCREASE
AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication warning: also moving in `t' category) 
(dal) 
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Business travelers who arrange their own accommodations know
that that it's seldom a simple matter to find out how much a hotel
room actually costs. A room rate can differ significantly on any
given day, depending on such variables as the current occupancy
level, discounts invoked, and even the ability or inclination of a
customer to haggle.
</P>
<P>
   Comparison shopping on the Internet makes this process easier.
But until recently, many hotel companies were not enthusiastic
about setting up stalls in the raucous online bazaar. This left
marketing openings for fast-growing Internet booking wholesalers
like the much-touted Hotel Reservations Network, a company that
buys hotel rooms in bulk and then sells them on its Web site
(www.180096hotel.com) at discounts that it claims are from 30
percent to as much as 65 percent off regular ``rack'' rates.
</P>
<P>
   Now the front-desk bell is ringing for the hidebound hotel
industry. Hotel-room sales on the Internet are expected to double
to about $1.1 billion this year from 1998, and hotel companies
expect Internet sales to account for 10 percent of all bookings
within five years. That's according to PhoCusWright Inc., a
travel-research company that did a survey at 16 major hotel
companies representing more than 50 hotel brands and 20,000
individual properties, and found that those companies sharply
increased investment last year in their own Web sites, to an
average of $20 million each.
</P>
<P>
   PhoCusWright anticipates that this surge will accelerate
sharply, as the hotel industry begins to appreciate the way that
the Internet is forcing fundamental changes in the millennia-old
relationship between innkeeper and customer.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, according to the research company, the U.S. hotel
industry raised room prices an average of 4.4 percent, while the
average occupancy rate slipped slightly to 64 percent and the total
supply of rooms rose 4 percent. Given these realities, and the
ruthless competition posed by the online booking intermediaries,
hotels are going to have to spend more, and devise creative online
marketing strategies, to cultivate the growing numbers of savvy
online customers who are markedly less loyal to brand names, said
Lorraine Sileo, PhoCusWright's vice president for information
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hotels are realizing that they are being mediated for the
first time'' by online customers able to easily compare location,
quality, services, amenities and especially price, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Customers obviously like online service, as shown by the
intermediary booking companies' success. But caveat emptor, as
always. Here are two recent experiences with pre-paying for hotel
rooms through an intermediary, in this case the Hotel Reservations
Network.
</P>
<P>
   For a business trip to San Francisco, Hotel Reservations Network
delivered a bargain: The Mark Hopkins Hotel at $189 a night (about
$60 off the regular seasonal rate). This included an unexpected
on-arrival upgrade to a bigger room on a limited-access floor at
the famous hotel on Nob Hill.
</P>
<P>
   For another business trip, last March, the Hotel Reservations
Network charged $102 a night for a room at the nondescript but
comfortable Clarion Airport Hotel adjacent to Miami International
Airport. At check-in, however, the same room was available for
$69.75 to anyone walking in cold. The desk clerk confirmed that
rooms were available.
</P>
<P>
   A letter to the Hotel Reservations Network in Dallas complaining
about the price discrepancy (and enclosing a hotel print-out that a
helpful clerk supplied showing the $69.75 rate) brought a curt and
bewildering response.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rate printed on the hotel receipt is our wholesale rate
and not a public rate,'' wrote a Hotel Reservations Network
customer-service agent. ``The public hotel rate for the date of
your stay was $119.95 per night due to a high occupancy demand at
the hotel at the time of your booking. I am not able to issue
credit since the rate you paid has already been discounted from the
hotel rate.''
</P>
<P>
   That reply brought to mind the comedian Richard Pryor's classic
line of indignant response: ``Who you gonna believe? Me or your
lying eyes?'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another Fare Increase
</P>
<P>
   The major U.S. carriers have raised domestic air fares 4 percent
in the industry's third increase this year.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest Airlines, a frequent holdout when fares are increased,
on Monday matched Friday's move by Continental Airlines. That was
followed by UAL's United Airlines, AMR's American Airlines, Delta
Air Lines, U S Airways and TWA.
</P>
<P>
   If all the airlines stick to the fare increase, domestic fares
will have risen 11 percent year to date. Business-class tickets
will not be affected by the most recent price increases.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Engel, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., said the fare
increases were ``symptoms of strong demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Airlines are prohibited from working together to set fares but
for competitive reasons often follow moves made by rivals. More
than a dozen attempts to raise fares last year failed because
Northwest would not go along. &QL;

COURT OVERTURNS BOTHA CONVICTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ Apartheid's last hard-line president, P.W. Botha,
Tuesday won his long legal battle with the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, the panel charged with investigating South Africa's
violent past.
</P>
<P>
   Botha appealed against a lower court conviction handed down last
August for defying a summons to appear before the panel, and his
sentence, a $1,600 fine and 12 months in jail, suspended for three
years, was set aside. The commission sought to question the former
president about his role in state-sanctioned human-rights. Botha
called the panel a witchhunt and a ``circus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The court is mindful of the fact that there will be many who
may consider that (the appeal ruling) is unjust,'' wrote Cape High
Court Judge Selwyn Selikowitz in his decision. Selikowitz made up
his mind on the basis of a technicality. ``This court is duty-bound
to uphold and protect the Constitution and administer justice to
all persons alike without fear, favor, or prejudice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, handed down on the eve of South Africa's second
all-race elections, is a potential setback in the country's attempt
to reestablish the rule of law after decades of racist brutality.
</P>
<P>
   The Truth and Reconciliation Commission was predicated on a
simple but unprecedented trade-off: perpetrators of human-rights
abuses could gain amnesty in exchange for full disclosure of acts
of politically motivated violence. Those who refused to appear
before the panel or failed to meet its criteria faced possible
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   But that deal has been undermined in recent months. The ruling
African National Congress tried to block the commission's final
report last October on grounds that human-rights violations
committed in the course of the struggle for liberation should not
be weighed on the same scale as those committed by the apartheid
state. The report held the ANC accountable for its actions. The bid
failed.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the ANC floated a proposal to amend the law
establishing the commission to include group as well as individual
amnesty. At the same time, the office of the national director of
public prosecutions has indicated that it will probably pursue
cases only against past perpetrators of murder.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility now exists that, after a long trial and
conviction for refusing to acknowledge the legitimacy of the
commission, Botha may never be brought to account, even though
senior generals from his security structures have testified under
oath before the commission that the former president gave the
command for a number of criminal acts, including the 1986 bombing
of the headquarters of the South African Council of Churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a blow at a symbolic level,'' said Brandon Hamber, an
analyst of the commission at the Center for the Study on Violence
and Reconciliation in Johannesburg. ``We are now confronted with a
case where a prominent figure could walk away scot-free'' without
facing legal scrutiny for past actions before either the commission
or a court.
</P>
<P>
   Selikowitz found that the commission issued its subpoena against
Botha five days after the commission's mandate had expired.
Parliament subsequently passed a law extending the commission's
life span, but at the time it issued its summons against the former
president, the commission did not technically have the authority to
do so.
</P>
<P>
   State prosecutor Bruce Morrison, acting on behalf of the
commission, has not decided whether to take the case to the
Constitutional Court.
</P>
<P>
   Botha, 83, ruled from 1978 to 1989 with escalating brutality,
but was edged out after a suffering a stroke by F.W. De Klerk, who
instituted sweeping reforms in 1990 leading to the demise of
apartheid.

the hotel at the time of your booking. I am not able to issue
credit since the rate you paid has already been discounted from the

   Another Fare Increase
</P>
<P>
   The major U.S. carriers have raised domestic air fares 4 percent
in the industry's third increase this year.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest Airlines, a frequent holdout when fares are increased,
on Monday matched Friday's move by Continental Airlines. That was
followed by UAL's United Airlines, AMR's American Airlines, Delta
Air Lines, U S Airways and TWA.
</P>
<P>
   If all the airlines stick to the fare increase, domestic fares
will have risen 11 percent year to date. Business-class tickets
will not be affected by the most recent price increases.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Engel, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., said the fare
increases were ``symptoms of strong demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Airlines are prohibited from working together to set fares but
for competitive reasons often follow moves made by rivals. More
than a dozen attempts to raise fares last year failed because
Northwest would not go along. &QL;

ISRAELI-ALLIED ARMY STEPS UP WITHDRAWAL

<P>
   KAFAR FALOUS, Lebanon _ As Israel's proxy army continued its
retreat Tuesday from a strategic position just north of the
Israeli-occupied zone, Hezbollah guerrillas showed they would not
lessen their resistance to the South Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah claimed responsibility for two road-side bombs that
killed two members of the retreating SLA and wounded one. The SLA
is a small Lebanese militia that Israel pays to help defend the
9-mile wide self-proclaimed security zone it occupies in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The roadside attacks, the trademark of Hezbollah in a war of
attrition that it appears to be winning, followed the SLA's
pullback from outposts of Jezzine that they had held for 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas also reportedly opened fire on an SLA convoy of
old tanks and personnel carriers Monday night as it withdrew from
the area of Jezzine.
</P>
<P>
   Although the SLA pullout is seen as setting the stage for a
larger Israeli withdrawal from the security zone, there was no sign
Tuesday that the fighting would end soon.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli warplanes struck back repeatedly at the guerrillas,
hitting a Hezbollah stronghold in the Iqlim al-Toufah ridges and
the Krum al-Arz mountain around the ``Jezzine pocket,'' a region of
rocky hillsides and villages that surround the predominantly
Christian town of Jezzine. Three civilians were reportedly injured
in those Israeli airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   Nadim Salem, who represents the Jezzine area in the Lebanese
parliament, said Tuesday that the Hezbollah attacks and the Israeli
reprisals only served to increase the anxiety many residents feel.
</P>
<P>
   That anxiety is increasing in the as the SLA pushes ahead with
what it claims will be a staged withdrawal over the next two weeks.
Many Christians fear the Shiite Muslim militants of Hezbollah may
detain and even execute as collaborators SLA loyalists, most of
whom are Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a breeze of optimism,'' Salem said, referring to the
announcement over the weekend that the SLA militia would be pulling
out of the town. ``Now it is the other way around. . . . It is an
atmosphere of fear.''
</P>
<P>
   As Salem spoke on a roadside near the checkpoint, his voice was
drowned out by the sound of Israeli warplanes streaking overhead.
Then there was a a thundering explosion as a missile slammed into a
hillside nearby as a plume of gray smoke rose over the horizon.
Moments later, Hezbollah mortar fire could be heard responding to
the Israeli attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want security,'' Salem added. ``They are not very
concerned about international policy. All they want is to live in
peace, to govern themselves, and to stay in their homes and their
land. That's all they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah leaders have insisted that those who collaborated with
the SLA should surrender now and face trial, but the
Iranian-financed and Syrian-backed resistance fighters maintain
that they would not enter the town by force. Since Lebanon is
officially at war with Israel, the militiamen are regarded as
traitors, their crime punishable by death.
</P>
<P>
   Most residents are hoping that the Lebanese Army will fill the
vacuum in Jezzine. The pullback is seen as a test of whether the
Lebanese government can maintain order if Israel withdraws.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials said the SLA withdrawal was an independent
decision of SLA leaders who have suffered substantial losses, even
losing two of their commanders, in recent weeks. Still, the move is
seen by most observers as a possible precursor of a total Israeli
withdrawal, promised within a year by new Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Just past the checkpoint on the road out of Jezzine Tuesday,
Fouad Issa, 45, who lives in Beirut but owns a business in Jezzine,
was optimistic about the the pullout of SLA forces and saw it as a
``liberation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Israelis came here in force. They did not ask any questions,''
he said. ``They must depart the same way. No conditions.''

LEGISLATURE PASSES CAP ON DAMAGE AWARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For more than a decade, no issue has divided Alabama
politics like that of tort revision, the effort to limit the
enormous damage awards that have made the state's juries fabled for
their generosity to plaintiffs. Even civil rights has been pushed
aside as the defining question for Alabama's politicians, whose
source of campaign money largely depends on their position on jury
verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   But last month, after a jury awarded $581 million to a family
that was overcharged $1,200 for two satellite dishes, even the
state's trial lawyers knew they could no longer prevent the
overhaul of the Alabama civil liability system long advocated by
business owners. The resulting compromise between the two sides led
the state Legislature to pass the state's first serious effort to
revise the tort system, the final and most important piece of which
was unanimously approved by the state House of Representatives on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which was earlier passed by the Senate and which Gov.
Donald Siegelman has promised to sign in the next week, places a
ceiling on punitive damages awarded by juries, the kind of damages
intended to punish a defendant for misconduct, which often soar
into the millions in Alabama. Business leaders were also hoping for
a limit on damages that compensate a plaintiff for financial losses
and pain and suffering, but were unable to achieve that in
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The bill limits punitive damages in noninjury cases against
large businesses to three times the compensatory damages, or
$500,000, whichever is greater. For verdicts against small
businesses, the limits are $50,000, or 10 percent of the business'
net worth, whichever is greater. In injury cases, the caps are
three times compensatory damages, or $1.5 million, whichever is
greater, for all businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama's journey to join 22 other states with caps or
prohibitions on punitive damages was a difficult one, and its
outcome was uncertain until just a few weeks ago. The state has a
long populist history of antagonism to insurance companies and
other big businesses, particularly in rural counties, and it also
has some of the weakest consumer protection regulations in the
country. The combination of those factors produced a series of jury
verdicts that often seemed so outlandish they became the
centerpiece of the national business-backed movement that its
leaders call tort reform.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, a nursing-home orderly sued a finance company for
overcharging him by $1,000 on a car loan; he was awarded $50
million in punitive damages by the jury. Two years earlier, a jury
awarded a man $4 million because his BMW had been repainted by the
automaker without his knowledge. That decision was struck down by
the U.S. Supreme Court, which called the award ``grossly
excessive''; it was later reduced to $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Breedlove, president of the Alabama Trial Lawyers
Association, argued that the big awards, and the fear they
engendered among business owners, created a de facto consumer
protection system in a state that lacks many of the antifraud laws
of other states. But he said the size of the satellite-dish award
provided the incentive both sides needed to reach an agreement that
had long proved elusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The courthouse has been the only place where the consumers of
Alabama get a real opportunity for justice,'' Breedlove said. ``I
think that is still the case under this compromise, and we have now
put behind us the most divisive issue of the last decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Breedlove said he was particularly pleased that the Legislature
had not placed caps on awards in wrongful-death cases, or on claims
of mental anguish.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the Business Council of Alabama, Bill O'Connor,
said business owners did not achieve everything they wanted but
were nonetheless glad to have settled an issue that he said had
hurt the state's business climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll never know how many businesses wouldn't consider Alabama
because of these outrageous verdicts that have been issued, how
often we didn't make the cut,'' O'Connor said. ``But we've got a
reasonable accord now that should eliminate that hurdle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature also passed a bill that limits
``jury-shopping,'' in which plaintiffs often filed their cases in
rural counties with histories of large verdicts, and a bill which
makes it harder to get a case certified as a class action. Both
those bills were signed last month by Siegelman, who has never been
known as a fervent proponent of tort revision. But in his campaign
last year he promised business leaders he would sign ``reasonable''
tort legislation, and he said in an interview on Tuesday that this
package meets that definition.
</P>
<P>
   ``In earlier years, we had proposals like forcing consumers to
be responsible for contracts they initialed, even if a business
lied to them,'' Siegelman said. ``That kind of thing just wasn't
reasonable, but putting a cap on these unfair lawsuits, which has
hurt our reputation in the business community, is what this state
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   In his various campaigns over the years, Siegelman, a Democrat,
has received hundreds of thousands of dollars from trial lawyers
groups, just as other candidates have received similar amounts from
business leaders, significantly driving up the cost of a statewide
campaign in Alabama. The support of business owners advocating tort
revision was crucial to the election last year of Lt. Gov. Steve
Windom, a Republican, who played a leading role in getting the
Senate to approve the compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue of trial lawyers versus business owners has almost
replaced the idea of political parties in Alabama,'' said Dr.
William H. Stewart, chairman of the political science department at
the University of Alabama. ``Now that it's over, I wonder what
we're all going to talk about.''

 &HT;    Supercomm trade show returns to Atlanta
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Here they come again.
</P>
<P>
   SuperComm, the premier telecommunications trade show, will
return to the Georgia World Congress Center starting Sunday.
Organizers promised more attendees, zippier demonstrations and
higher-energy executive presentations.
</P>
<P>
   About 46,000 people came to Supercomm in 1998, and more are
expected this this time around, said Matthew J. Flanagan, president
of the Telecommunications Industry Association, an event sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   As enticement, those who come to the show will have a show floor
with hundreds of company booths _ including the usual array of
magic shows and glitzy, big-screen videos _ as well as more than
200 conferences and 800 speakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strength of Supercomm has always been the conferences,''
Flanagan said. ``These are the movers and shakers of the
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Giving the event's keynote address Tuesday morning at 8 a.m.
will be Microsoft President Steven Ballmer.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Cisco Systems President John Chamber will speak.
Author John Naisbitt will give the closing address Thursday at 8
a.m. Other high-powered speakers include Carleton Firoina, group
president of Lucent Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Among innovations new to this year's show will be a series of
financial presentations by communications companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We noticed that last year we have 1,200 financial
professionals _ analysts, brokers and others,'' said Jack Chalden,
Supercomm general manager. ``We thought it would be wise to create
something for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The show itself is drawing a different shade of
telecommunications professionals as the long-discussed convergence
of broadcast and communications comes to be, said Roy Neal,
president of the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association.
``The seeds of the policy changes of the past are only now
beginning to take root.''
</P>
<P>
   The show now draws from the established corporate giants, as
well as the hyper-ambitious start-ups, he said. ``The next
Netscape, the new Microsoft, the next Lucent are at the show. We
just don't know who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Exhibit hours are from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Tuesday, June 8; from
9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on June 9, and from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. on June 10.
For information about the show, call (312-559-4600) or see the
event's site on the Internet's World Wide Web (www.iec.org).

CONTROL OF KEY MINING REGION MAY BE ISSUE IN KOSOVO PARTITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A number of unofficial partition plans have been drawn up for
the Serbian province of Kosovo, all raising the question of who
would control an important northern mining region.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing has made up-to-date production figures difficult to
come by. Experts say the resources include large deposits of coal,
along with some nickel, lead, zinc and other minerals. The
industries are important contributors to Yugoslavia's $21 billion
economy, and Belgrade would presumably be loathe to surrender them
in any plan to divide the province.
</P>
<P>
   One thought is that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic could
portray partition as a victory over NATO if Serbia retained control
over important churches and historic monasteries in Kosovo, as well
as the mines, which are around Mitrovica. But some experts said
they believed that after months of bombing, economic issues were no
longer paramount to Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his own eyes, Mr. Milosevic sees himself as protector of
Serbian nationhood,'' said Aurel Braun, a professor of
international relations at the University of Toronto who has
written two books on Eastern Europe. ``He is a man who basically
has ignored the economy, which was in a very bad condition before
this conflict started. So this is hardly a leadership that will
make any decision based on economic rationality.''
</P>
<P>
   Braun said he believed that Milosevic could see retaining
control of the region as a way to reward supporters after the
conflict ends, reinforcing his grip on power. ``He is corrupt and
he does want his cronies to make money,'' the professor said. ``But
he is primarily a political animal, and his power derives from
being a man who flies the Serbian flag. In this scheme of things,
economic factors are pretty low down on the scale.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the last year for which figures are generally
available, all of Yugoslavia produced 41 million metric tons of
coal, as well as significant quantities of pig iron, crude steel
and copper. How much of that came from Kosovo, the poorest part of
Serbia, is unknown.

 &HT;    Defense supercomputer gets major overhaul
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON,Ohio _ A supercomputer center at Wright-Patterson Air
Force Base is getting even more super under a $17 million upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The upgrade is being made to the Aeronautical Systems Center's
Major Shared Resource Center, one of four supercomputer centers in
the Defense Department. Military and university scientists around
the nation run massive problems on MSRC's computers over high-speed
data networks.
</P>
<P>
   Technicians were installing a Compaq Alphaserver ES40 system in
the the main computer room Tuesday when MSRC managers gave
reporters a tour of the center.
</P>
<P>
   The Compaq system will triple the center's computing power and
bring its peak performance to the equivalent of 2.4 million Pentium
II computers networked together, according to an Air Force
statement.
</P>
<P>
   All that computing power is packed into a cluster of nondescript
black cabinets. John Blair, MSRC deputy director, was almost
apologetic for the lack of flashy bells and whistles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we get something new in it gets less
sexy-looking,'' he said. But he added the new system has four times
the power, one tenth the cost and half the maintenance of the Cray
C90 system it's replacing.
</P>
<P>
   The upgrade also includes improvements in the center's memory,
storage and networking capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said scientists use the center's vast powers to simulate
the performance of things as small as molecules and as big as
battlefields. One scientist has been using it to simulate
techniques for making the B-1B bomber less visible to radar, Blair
said.
</P>
<P>
   Computer-based simulation is becoming such a basic tool in the
acquisition business that the Air Force Materiel Command, based at
Wright-Pat, is moving to what it calls simulation based
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said this means a new weapon or aircraft will be evaluated
in computer simulations from the time it's first conceived through
design, production and later upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third major upgrade the center has undergone since
it opened in 1996. Nichols Research Corp., based in Huntsville,
Ala., set up and supports the center under a contract worth $157.9
million over eight years

AS NATION VOTES, SOME AFRIKANERS PLOT TO SECEDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRETORIA _ About 18 million people are expected to vote
Wednesday in South Africa's second all-race elections. Jan
Groenewold is not one of them. Instead of marking a ballot,
Groenewold will be on a farm not far from the capital, laying the
first bricks of a secessionist Afrikaner state.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't mobilize and resist, blacks will run all over
us,'' he said. ``To establish the right relationship with South
Africa, we must find a political solution for our people first. We
must have a territorial base.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years after losing power, Afrikaners face their worst
crisis of identity and place since the Boer War a century ago. They
are disillusioned and deeply fragmented, chafing against black-led
overhaul of education, sports, and labor, and they are divided over
how to be part of a democratic society in which they are greatly
outnumbered.
</P>
<P>
   Some have embraced the end of minority rule. Others have
emigrated. Many just keep their heads down. And some are circling
the ox carts in the name of Volk _ the people _ and Fatherland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we're in bondage under democracy,'' said Constand
Viljoen, former chief-of-staff of the apartheid military machine,
who is fighting for Afrikaner self-determination as leader of the
Freedom Front, a political party. ``Our history is riddled with the
quest for freedom. We fought wars for it. We're still the same
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Afrikaners have no hope of regaining power. Five parties are
vying for their votes. The National Party, once led by stern,
finger-wagging guardians of white privilege, now has at its helm a
man derisively nicknamed ``Kortbroek,'' or ``short pants,'' because
he looks like a school boy.
</P>
<P>
   The arithmetic of political power is simple. Whites make up
about 10 percent of the South African electorate, with
Afrikaans-speakers accounting for a little more than half of the
white electorate, about 1 million votes. Divided among the five
parties, the numbers become negligible.
</P>
<P>
   The New National Party, a makeover of the organization that
ruled by apartheid for 46 years and won 20 percent of the overall
vote five years ago, is struggling for 5 percent this year,
according to most polls. It runs a real risk of losing control of
the one province it governs, the Western Cape, and its status as
the official opposition party to the ANC.
</P>
<P>
   Three other parties, including Viljoen's, might together net 2
percent of the total vote. Perhaps most insulting, the Democratic
Party, heir to a long tradition of white, liberal opposition during
the apartheid era, has vigorously sought and appears to be winning
the bulk of white Afrikaans-speaking voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election is the end of the road for Afrikaner politics,''
said Tom Lodge, a political scientist at the University of the
Witwatersrand in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   Since the demise of apartheid five years ago, Afrikaners have
watched the credibility of their elders crumble. The Dutch Reformed
Church admitted that it erred in promoting a biblical rationale for
apartheid. Senior politicians have been hauled before courts and
commissions to explain past deeds.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, there is confusion over who is and isn't an
Afrikaner. Jac Comradie, a language historian at the Rand Afrikaans
University in Johannesburg, argues that anyone who speaks Afrikaans
as a primary language should qualify as an Afrikaner. His
definition therefore includes as Afrikaners the mixed-race, or
``coloured,'' community spread across the southern coast. The
reality, he said, is that politicians and others seeking Afrikaner
self-determination see the Volk as white.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a people at war with ourselves,'' said A.J.
``Blokkies'' de Beer, director of Oranjewerkers, an organization
studying ways to preserve Afrikaner culture amid majority rule.
``We haven't ever been this disillusioned. While we were in power
we didn't have to do the soul-searching we must do now.''
</P>
<P>
   Afrikaner ancestors fled persecution and war in Europe. They
fought the British and the Zulus in Africa in a quest for autonomy.
Now, stuck without a motherland to return to, their descendents
want their own schools, churches, and police force. ``Freedom is
the essence of the Boere Afrikaner. Even right now, I feel it
here,'' de Beer said, gripping his gut.
</P>
<P>
   But forces are working against them. Not only have they lost
power, they lost the laws of racial separation that shielded them.
As democracy sinks its roots deeper, Afrikaner youth are being
exposed to new cultures and ways of thinking. Some are reaching out
to different religions.
</P>
<P>
   Groenewold says the only thing to do is start from scratch. The
mistake Afrikaners made, he argues, wasn't apartheid, but a
reliance on black labor. ``We need to occupy our own land, do our
own work, and defend it,'' he said. ``If you use others, you cannot
deny them rights.''
</P>
<P>
   A former cofounder of the extreme right-wing Afrikaner
Resistance Movement, Groenewold and others bought an idle farm 15
miles southeast of Pretoria three years ago, and are slowly
converting it into what they hope will become a completely
self-sufficient town. They scraped their own roads and tapped their
own water source. They have a formidable security gate at the
farm's entrance, a handful of houses, and a radio station. The
four-color flag of the 19th century Transvaal Republic flutters
over a makeshift school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to attract 5,000 people,'' he said. So far they are a
small collection of retired professionals and drifters.
</P>
<P>
   Viljoen isn't ready to abandon the political approach to
self-determination. The retired general has been negotiating with
Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress since 1993 for
some guarantee of Afrikaner group rights. His original thinking was
simple: If Afrikaners could not contain blacks in separate
homelands within South Africa, then they should have a homeland for
themselves, where they could run their own schools and provide
their own policing.
</P>
<P>
   For both political and logistical reasons, however, a
geographically defined Afrikaner homeland has been a nonstarter _
even though the ANC recognized in 1993 the principle of Afrikaner
self-determination. Viljoen now wants to create Afrikaner cantons,
towns and regions where the Volk are the majority. The problem is
that he may soon be out of job. If the Freedom Front stumbles badly
at the polls, Viljoen could lose his seat in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   It is not possible, however, for many Afrikaners to embrace the
ideal of a multiracial national identity. ``Our individual freedom
is tied to our freedom as a people,'' De Beer said. ``I cannot be
free if my people have no control as a group.''
</P>
<P>
   If that is so, the Volk will feel homeless in the land of their
birth for a long time.

DISCORD OVER INVESTIGATION OF ZEDILLO AIDE REFLECTS MISTRUST
BETWEEN U.S. AND MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By TIM GOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Earlier this year, as President Clinton prepared to
visit Mexico, law-enforcement officials there disclosed what they
cast as an extraordinary break from the country's long tradition of
immunity for those at the highest levels of power.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, officials said, they had been probing
allegations of drug corruption involving President Ernesto
Zedillo's closest aide, his powerful private secretary. After an
inquiry begun at the urging of the aide himself, investigators had
found the charges baseless, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to the Mexicans' dismay, the matter of the presidential
secretary, Jose Liebano Saenz Ortiz, has not been so easily put to
rest.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, senior officials including Attorney General Janet
Reno privately questioned the thoroughness of the Mexican inquiry,
prompting Reno's Mexican counterpart to insist that he would
consider any new evidence that emerged. But American officials said
they have grown only more suspicious, and have stepped up their own
intelligence efforts to learn about Saenz (pronounced ``signs'').
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that there is an issue of trust here,'' said the
Mexican attorney general, Jorge Madrazo. ``But I don't understand
how they can trust us on some issues and not on others. When we
have the evidence, we act.''
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. officials acknowledge that the accusations against
Saenz are unproven, the two governments' quiet discord over his
case reflects the deep mistrust that shapes their dealings on
matters of criminal justice. Officials said it also reflects the
difficulty that Washington has in handling reports of corruption
that involve high-level Mexican officials.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said they were confident that their concerns
about Saenz had reached President Zedillo. Still, they were openly
relieved last week after Zedillo decided against naming him
interior minister, a post vacated by Francisco Labastida Ochoa, who
is running for president.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials said the allegations against Saenz came from
half a dozen sources, including several drug traffickers. All of
these people offered second-hand information about the aide's
activities, or claimed ties to him that they could not prove. At
least one of them failed a lie-detector test, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But according to two U.S. officials, the CIA has deemed reports
about Saenz serious enough to place him in the category of
foreign-government officials about whom it believes there are
credible allegations of wrongdoing. The allegations were also aired
recently at a private congressional briefing by drug-enforcement
and intelligence officials, after which congressional officials
wrote leaders of both the Senate and the House to recommend they
hear the same presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Saenz, 49, has acted as the president's de facto chief of staff,
and as his trusted emissary in dealings with political groups,
military leaders and others.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   And like Zedillo, who was handed the governing party's
presidential candidacy after the assassination of Luis Donaldo
Colosio in 1994, Saenz reached the inner circle of Mexican politics
after a sudden, unlikely ascent.
</P>
<P>
   A famously affable man who graduated from Texas A&AMP;M University,
Saenz worked as a high-level administrator in the state tourism and
mining industries and the customs service. He later went to work
for Colosio and was one of the few Colosio aides who remained in
the campaign with Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, both the Mexican attorney general, Jorge Madrazo,
and Saenz traced some of the reports of his ties to illicit
activities to unscrupulous former associates who had sought to take
advantage of his political rise.
</P>
<P>
   A businessman with whom Saenz had been friendly while growing up
in Ciudad Juarez, for instance, was claiming that Saenz was his
friend and partner decades later, when the man's activities came
under scrutiny from federal drug-enforcement agents. Mexican
officials said the man's claims appeared to be completely false.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials also emphasized that it was Saenz who
initiated the federal investigation into his activities, in a
letter to Madrazo on May 24, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this is totally absurd to me,'' Saenz said in an
interview. ``I do not have any responsibility for dealing with
these matters. I do not go to meetings about them. I don't have
information about them.''
</P>
<P>
   Saenz went to the authorities after receiving a mysterious,
sealed envelope that contained a partial copy of notes taken on the
statement of a pilot for the country's biggest drug cartel. The
pilot was quoted as saying the cartel boss, Amado Carrillo Fuentes,
had given Saenz a house in a posh Mexico City suburb.
</P>
<P>
   The notes came to light after the army general who had taken
them, Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, was arrested on corruption charges
in February 1997, while serving as Mexico's drug-enforcement chief.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials said investigators searched extensively for
the house Saenz had purportedly received, checking property records
and canvassing two Mexico City suburbs. A similar effort was made
to trace a fleet of vehicles that a jailed drug smuggler claimed
had been given by traffickers to the press operation of Colosio's
campaign, which was directed by Saenz.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo said both searches were fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   Another allegation against Saenz emerged last year from a
U.S.Customs investigation into the laundering of illegal drug
profits along the border between the two countries. An American
undercover agent and his informant, posing as money launderers, had
been introduced to a Mexican state prosecutor who they thought was
corrupt. The prosecutor, too, was talking about Liebano Saenz.
</P>
<P>
   According to several American officials and a confidential U.S.
government report on the case, the Mexican prosecutor, Arturo Pacho
Ruiz, said Saenz might be interested in meeting the men to discuss
laundering some money of his own.
</P>
<P>
   But the meeting never happened. Still, the Customs Service chief
in San Diego, Edward W. Logan, passed the allegations along to the
head of an organized-crime force working for Madrazo. In an
interview, Madrazo said details of the case were conveyed to
President Zedillo, who ordered an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But Madrazo said the prosecutor had made several outrageous
claims, and retracted all of them after he was arrested. Saenz said
he had no recollection of Pacho Ruiz, who has been jailed on money
laundering charges, but acknowledged that the two of them had
apparently worked contemporaneously in the Mexican customs service,
where Saenz was the director of operations between late 1988 and
early 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Mexican organized-crime unit, Samuel Gonzalez
Ruiz, was hearing other stories about Saenz from a man who had
served as a bodyguard for Amado Carrillo Fuentes before the
trafficker's death in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   According to a copy of a sworn deposition given to Mexican
prosecutors on April 18, 1998, by the bodyguard, Jose Jaime Olvera
Olvera, after he entered Mexico's fledgling witness-protection
program, he had begun hearing a lot about Saenz.
</P>
<P>
   In May, 1996, he said, two of Carrillo Fuentes' associates told
the cartel leader that they had talked with ``people who were
directly with'' Saenz and that he should assemble the most of the
country's other major traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   At a summit of about 60 fellow traffickers at one of his Mexico
City homes, Carrillo Fuentes said Saenz had offered to assure the
protection of their smuggling activities in return for $100 million
and a strict ban on cocaine sales in Mexico, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Olvera said the traffickers eventually counteroffered $60
million, with Carrillo Fuentes paying half, and that the money was
delivered one morning in early August 1996.
</P>
<P>
   After lunch at a suburban Mexico City restaurant, the money was
delivered to an older man referred to as ``General'' and two
younger lawyers, Olvera stated.
</P>
<P>
   On the drive home, he added, Carrillo Fuentes told his bodyguard
``that everything was going to get better because everything had
been arranged with Liebano Saenz Ortiz.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is unclear whether the traffickers received
high-level support, U.S. and Mexican officials noted that the story
was one of several told by drug informants describing a huge payoff
by the Carrillo Fuentes gang. Yet it never made clear how Saenz,
who has no law-enforcement responsibilities, could assure the
traffickers' protection.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in an interview last September, Madrazo, the attorney
general, referred to him as one of the most important informants
ever developed by the organized-crime unit. But six months later,
in another interview in which he dismissed each of the allegations
against Saenz, Madrazo disparaged the bodyguard's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a guy who had psychiatric problems,'' Madrazo said,
citing a medical assessment. ``For us his information has no value.
His information is totally false.''
</P>
<P>
   Several U.S. officials disputed that view, saying American
drug-enforcement agents had met with Olvera and found him credible.
</P>
<P>
   Olvera was murdered on a Mexico City street last September, soon
after signing a letter asking that his government protection be
removed.
</P>
<P>
   American law-enforcement officials are skeptical about the
authenticity of the letter.
</P>
<P>
   United States officials said they were also troubled about the
Mexican investigation because Gonzalez Ruiz, the organized-crime
chief who ran the inquiry, was relieved of his job after he and
another official submitted Saenz to seven hours of questioning.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while, it was all they talked about,'' one official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said of the organized-crime unit's
inquiry. ``Then it was just gone.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo disclosed the investigation and exonerated Saenz on Feb.
5, shortly after he agreed to discuss the case with a reporter for
The New York Times. Madrazo and Gonzalez Ruiz both strongly denied
that the case had anything to do with his departure from the
organized-crime force, and both said they were fully confident of
Saenz's innocence.
</P>
<P>
   But when Madrazo briefed a group of senior American
law-enforcement officials on Feb. 25, he received a notably
skeptical response, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Justice Department official familiar with the
meeting, Madrazo was questioned by the deputy chief of the Drug
Enforcement Administration, Donnie Marshall, about steps not taken
in the inquiry. Another official said Reno asked how the
investigation could be closed when leads had gone unpursued,
prompting Madrazo to say it would remain open.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo, who denied that any real conflict had emerged between
the two governments over the issue, said he told the American
officials he would consider any new evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, American officials said they have received no
indication that the investigation is continuing. But they added
that there is little they can do other than collect information.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Reno and Marshall said they had no comment on the
case.

BARNES AND NOBLE POISED TO TURN TO `PLAN B' 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With its planned acquisition of the nation's largest
book wholesaler in jeopardy, Barnes and Noble is poised to carry
out what its top executive calls an alternative ``plan B'' if its
$600 million deal to buy Ingram Book Group collapses.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Riggio, the chief executive of Barnes &AMP; Noble, made the
comments following published reports that the Federal Trade
Commission had concluded that the planned union violated antitrust
law _ a conclusion that has left the book industry pondering
whether the company has been damaged in its pursuit of online
primacy.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, when Barnes &AMP; Noble announced its intention to
buy Ingram, top company executives said that acquiring Ingram's 11
distribution centers would give Barnes &AMP; Noble more cost-efficient
distribution and the ability to provide faster delivery, one of the
critical elements in the battle for online book customers who
expect delivery within days.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Riggio, saying that he was surprised by news reports
that the trade commission staff opposed the union, noted that the
company was prepared with an alternative plan to open warehouses in
the Reno, Nev., area and in Tennessee that would exclusively serve
its online venture, Barnesandnoble.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had what I would refer to as `plan B' from the first day
that we filed and certainly have been looking at this throughout
the process of the review by the FTC,'' Riggio said. ``And given
the fact that almost seven months have passed, you know we've
always known there could be some chance that it would be turned
down.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months, the company has been quietly pursuing a
second strategy, with Barnes &AMP; Noble executives scouting for real
estate for warehouse space in the Reno area, which has become a
growing hub of book distribution for other wholesalers and
Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts are already raising the possibility that
Barnes and Noble can proceed by expanding its own distribution
network without buying a wholesaler. But they said this strategy
could slow the company down in the competition with Amazon.com,
which now dominates the online market.
</P>
<P>
   Riggio said that the company could open the new warehouses
within the next 12 months, adding more than 750,000 square feet to
its existing New Jersey warehouse capacity of 1 million square
feet.
</P>
<P>
   But despite these detailed plans and even though the trade
commission rarely overturns the recommendations of its staff,
Riggio was not ready to give up on the original concept of a union
with Ingram. He said that executives and lawyers for both companies
intended to discuss their next move in a conference call Tuesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the Ingram Book Group also expressed surprise
about reports of an unfavorable FTC conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ingram has been in the midst of what is a confidential process
and is not in the habit of commenting on it while it's under way,''
said Keel Hunt, a spokesman for the Tennessee-based company. ``That
said, we remain confident that if this transaction is viewed
objectively, and within the context of today's changing book
marketplace, that the commission will clear the way for the
acquisition.''

   The chief executive of the newly public Barnesandnoble.com,
Jonathan Bulkeley, said that if the deal does collapse the online
bookstore will not be affected. He said that the bookstore will
continue to do business with Ingram and maintains business ties to
other wholesalers. He added that 60 percent of Barnesandnoble.com's
distribution is carried out through the company's own center in New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have speculated that Barnes &AMP; Noble tried to buy Ingram
in a chess move to prevent Amazon.com from buying the wholesaler.
They say that Barnes &AMP; Noble could build up its own distribution
network probably at a cheaper price than its announced $600 million
purchase of Ingram.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem is that building up a network can take more time
than buying one. And meanwhile, Amazon.com is moving rapidly to
expand its own distribution and warehouse space.

<P>
   ``Personally, I think things have been moving so quickly that
it's hard to know that Barnes &AMP; Noble's plan B isn't better than
their plan A,'' said Charlie Winton, the chief executive of the
California-based distributor, Publishers Group West, which is also
opening a new warehouse in Reno. At the time Barnes &AMP; Noble
announced its intention to buy Ingram, he said, ``it seemed like a
powerful move.'' But he added, ``Who's to say at this point what
the Ingram business is that they were buying, and whether they are
better off opening their own distribution centers.''
</P>
<P>
   Riggio said the company had decided over several months that it
needed warehouse space that was more specialized than Ingram's
centers. It needed warehouses specifically fitted for Internet
purchases, which require more time-consuming picking and packing
than the larger orders placed by bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   Riggio said he still considers Ingram ``a great company to own''
because of ``its return on investment, its delivery service
functions and whatever synergies can be extracted by reducing the
duplication of certain efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts said that the reports of the FTC's negative
view of the deal were not necessarily surprising given the
organized opposition to the union by the Association of American
Booksellers, which represents independent stores, and the New
York-based Authors Guild.
</P>
<P>
   ``The absence of this deal isn't any sort of critical body
blow'' to Barnes &AMP; Noble, said Mark Mandel, a senior retail analyst
with ABN AMRO in New York. ``I don't know specifically what their
plan is, but clearly they have to establish a deeper distribution
capacity in order to compete with Amazon.com.''
</P>
<P>
   With the FTC staff's recommendation, the agency's review will
continue until a closed vote by the commission this month. Over the
next few days, lawyers for the two companies will have the
opportunity to meet individually with the four FTC commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   The reasoning of the federal investigators will not be known
until a final commission vote.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, shares in Barnesandnoble.com stock fell by 3 3/16,
or 14 percent, to 20. Thestreet.com's index of Internet stocks fell
by 4 percent.

CLINTON MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY RENEWING CHINA'S TRADE TIES WITH U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the seventh time since he took office,
President Clinton will ask Congress on Thursday to renew China's
trading privileges with the United States. It has always been a
dicey proposition, though one that Clinton _ with aggressive
lobbying help from companies with interests in China _ has always
won.
</P>
<P>
   But this year the battle over what is now called ``normal trade
relations'' with China promises to be more confused, more emotional
and far trickier than at any time since the military crackdown in
Tiananmen Square, exactly 10 years ago. Just a few months ago
Clinton and the Chinese had hoped to be asking Congress for far
more _ for permanent trade privileges, as part of a deal that would
usher China into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides say that on Thursday the president will hold
open the possibility that the bigger and more permanent deal will
be struck soon _ presumably after the furor dies down here over
accusations of Chinese spying and in Beijing over the mistaken
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. But some of Clinton's
advisers say privately they fear the chances of getting a trade
deal signed with the Chinese and through an angry Congress are
increasingly remote.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are watching,'' one of his advisers said last week,
``is a seven-year initiative with China crumble in our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the White House called that initiative the development of a
``strategic partnership'' with China, a phrase that has now been
stricken from all official references to that country. So has the
term ``commercial diplomacy,'' once used to describe how increased
economic engagement with China would strengthen ties in other
arenas. Now the White House, and the business community, are
arguing the opposite, why national security issues should be
divorced from trade.
</P>
<P>
   The White House's seeming ambivalence about how to tackle this
vote _ which usually becomes a congressional referendum on the
state of Chinese-U.S. relations _ is mirrored by the ambivalence of
the Republicans. Roughly half the hopefuls for the Republican
presidential nomination _ including Pat Buchanan, Steve Forbes and
Gary Bauer _ argue that the spy case underscores why the United
States should suspend negotiations with China over WTO admission.
</P>
<P>
   The other half, including Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Sen.
John McCain, have carefully separated the issues, with McCain, the
chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, arguing that ``we should
make judgments on the basis of our trade interests. The scandal is
not that they spied on us, but that we let them.''
</P>
<P>
   For many business executives, this year's debate over how to
respond to the spying accusations has echoes of the debate that
played out in the first two years of the Clinton administration,
over tying China's human rights record to its trade privileges.
Clinton himself started out that way and reversed course,
separating human rights issues from arguments over the annual
renewal.
</P>
<P>
   Intel Corp. Andrew Grove said he saw the relationship in terms
of parallel universes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the political and geopolitical universe, where
nations have problems and collaborations,'' he said. ``There is the
trade universe and then there is a universe of technology issues.
And what we have to deal with whether we want to tie those three
together, so that if hits a brick wall they all stop making
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Grove's concern, one that he and other technology executives
plan to voice in Washington next week, is that Congress will link
the trade vote to new restrictions on technology transfers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's entirely possible that higher-end Pentium III's will not
be salable in China,'' said Grove, referring to Intel's
top-of-the-line microprocessors. ``Imagine that: A personal
computer you will be able to buy for $1,200 at CompUSA by the end
of the year could not be shipped to China.''
</P>
<P>
   Grove and other technology executives argue that such
restrictions would not deny technology to China; they would only
force China to make its own. ``And then you have to ask: Are we
better off in any of those universes _ the political one, or the
trade one, or the technological one _ if we force them to build up
their technological base on their own?''
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, though, such subtleties have not yet been debated.
After Tiananmen, Congress imposed a series of trade and technology
restrictions, many of which have since been lifted. There may be
the same reaction this time.
</P>
<P>
   But some on Capitol Hill say they believe that when passions
cool, there will once again be momentum for a trade deal that opens
China's markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end,'' said Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., who is pushing
for permanent trade privileges, ``people will come to realize that
all the concessions in this trade agreement are on China's side.''

A MARRIAGE OF OPPOSITES, A MERGER OF EQUALS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 6) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 Christopher Reardon's most recent article for Arts and Leisure was
about Les Ballets de Monte Carlo.  
 By CHRISTOPHER REARDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Elisa Monte is hardly the first dancemaker to marry
her muse. George Balanchine, in the final tally, exchanged vows
with four of his best ballerinas. But Ms. Monte, who left Martha
Graham's company in 1982 to run her own troupe, has taken an
unusual step by sharing artistic direction equally with her spouse,
the former Graham dancer David Brown.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, when the company long known as Elisa Monte Dance
opens a two-week season at the Joyce Theater, the marquee for the
first time will read Monte/Brown Dance. The dancers will perform
three new works by Brown along with two by Ms. Monte. The couple
shares credit for a sixth new piece, ``Run to the Rock,'' a
rhapsodic solo danced to Nina Simone's husky rendition of
``Sinnerman.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's ascendance has not come easily, though. In recent
interviews, both together and apart, he and Ms. Monte described it
as the most turbulent phase in their 22-year relationship. At
times, they wondered if their marriage, and troupe, would survive.
</P>
<P>
   Since they live and rehearse in the same space _ a NoHo loft
that is also home to their 15-year-old daughter, Elia _ the strain
was hard to escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were many moments when I thought, `This is too hard,'''
said Ms. Monte, 53, who once pulled a door off its hinges and threw
it at Brown. ``But after 20 years, I think any relationship has
gone through times when you ask, `Is this really where we should
be?'''
</P>
<P>
   They met in 1977, while dancing for Graham, and the chemistry
between them was palpable. Ms. Monte asked Brown, seven years her
junior, to be her partner in her first dance, the sultry
``Treading,'' which Alvin Ailey added to his company's repertory.
They soon moved in together and married a few years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're opposites,'' said Brown, noting contrasts that in some
cases seem trivial (their birthdays are exactly six months apart)
but in others bear directly on their choreography (she responds
intuitively to music, while he tends to analyze written scores).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm big and exuberant and out there,'' he said of their
personalities. ``But I conceal a lot. Elisa's more withdrawn _
she'll say five words to my 50 _but also more honest.''
</P>
<P>
   One trait they share is a penchant for dancing that is
emotionally expressive and points to universally experiences. Ms.
Brown calls it ``abstract realism.''
</P>
<P>
   As her leading dancer, Brown had always played a creative role.
But he longed to make dances he could call his own, something he
did not feel Ms. Monte fully supported. ``I wanted to go off and do
my own work at one point,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he did. Twice, in fact, he went to Tunisia to make a dance
for a project concerning the African diaspora. (Brown is Jamaican.)
His tenacity convinced Ms. Monte that he was serious about
choreographing. It also informed one of her new dances, a
full-company work whose rhythmic complexities and shifting patterns
reflect the tension between independence and belonging. The piece
is called ``Amor Fati,'' Latin for ``Love Your Fate.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown takes up the same theme in his elegiac new quintet,
``Maquette.'' But in rehearsal, he appeared more intent on refining
the formal geometries and lyrical inflections of ``Niagara'' and
``Petits Pois,'' both set to Shostakovich.
</P>
<P>
   ``David's development can be looked at as taking away from me,''
Ms. Monte said. ``But I'm still doing what I want to do, how I want
to do it. In fact, it's easier. I'm sharing responsibility, and our
relationship is healthier because of it.'' Like any partnership,
though, it took a leap of faith. ``It required getting rid of the
immediate protectivism and getting past that initial fear of `Is
this diminishing me?' It doesn't have to be that, and it's
certainly not that.''

FILMING THE DRAMA BETWEEN THE NOVELIST'S LINES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 6) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ When he re-read Graham Greene's ``End of the Affair''
some six years ago, the screenwriter and director Neil Jordan was
struck, as he had been years earlier, by its wrenching evocation of
the dark forces that drive human behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Movie rights to the story, about a tragically thwarted love
affair in London during World War II, had long been owned by
Columbia Pictures, which had made a film of ``The End of the
Affair'' in 1955, two years after the book was published. But the
movie, which starred Deborah Kerr and the American
musical-and-Western star Van Johnson, was widely considered a dud,
and it quickly faded into merciful obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   That was fine with Jordan, the idiosyncratic, exacting Irish
filmmaker known for works like ``Mona Lisa'' and ``The Crying
Game.'' He believed that the book, one of Greene's finest
depictions of the agonizing tugs and pulls between love and duty,
was ripe for a re-translation onto the screen. And so he wrote his
own screenplay, adding high drama where Greene tended to go off on
fascinating _ but perhaps not as cinematic _ inner tangents.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, said Jordan, that while Greene's novels seem
patently cinematic, because of the clarity of the prose and the
concreteness with which each scene is painted, they depend so
heavily on internalized drama that it's necessary to take
liberties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great opportunity to explore a love affair from
two different points of view, and a great book about jealousy,''
said Jordan. ``But there was a beautiful human drama in the book
that Greene didn't quite bring to the surface, because he was so
concerned with metaphysics, religion and philosophy. You can feel
him manipulating the characters toward emotions and issues he wants
to explore.''
</P>
<P>
   The film has recently finished its six-week shoot in various
spots around England, including London, where streets were turned
back into those of wartime and its aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which is tentatively scheduled for release at the end
of the year, stars Ralph Fiennes as Maurice Bendrix, the jealous
novelist who falls passionately in love with a married woman and
whose tortured narration describes the sad unraveling of the
affair. Julianne Moore plays Bendrix's lover, Sarah Miles, a woman
who makes a devil's bargain with God himself. And Stephen Rea, the
melancholy staple of Jordan films, plays Henry, Sarah's husband,
whose asexual dullness conceals a deep reservoir of emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Many admirers feel that Greene, the author of 24 novels that are
as much about love and death as they are about how Englishmen
behave at home and abroad, was a brilliant storyteller who has
never been well served by the movies. Most film adaptations of his
work, like ``The Heart of the Matter'' and ``The Quiet American,''
have been decidedly mediocre; the exception, ``The Third Man,'' was
based not on a novel but on Greene's original screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   The 1955 version of ``The End of the Affair'' sounds like one of
the worst of the bunch. According to Jordan, who seems to be one of
the few people who have seen it in recent years, the movie plodded
along, squelching the high sensuality of Greene's work and
emphasizing its concerns with morality, making it an overwrought
tale about guilt and Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   At a time of Hollywood prudishness, the film was written to
contain virtually no sex but a lot of tortured dialogue. ``You had
a lot of scenes of people standing outside churches saying, `It's
me you love,''' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Woolley, the film's producer and a longtime Jordan
collaborator, said that the new script reflected a sea change in
what Hollywood would and wouldn't accept. ``They couldn't be as
fair to the novel then,'' he said. ``We can be much more explicit
now. Greene was a controversial writer at the time, and now we
regard him as a classic novelist, so we can make a much truer
version of his book.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene himself never liked the 1955 adaptation. When he visited
the set at Shepperton studios during filming and observed an
intimate scene between Sarah and Bendrix, he cringed to watch his
words being brought to life before him.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in The Observer of London, Quentin Falk described
Greene's reaction: ``Greene once told me, with still slightly
shocked recall: `They were trying to do one of those shots where
you get the same scene from each person's point of view. When the
camera eventually moved to be on her in the same close embrace, he
put chewing gum in his mouth!'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's script takes a gamble, at least by the standards of
Greene purists, by changing the plot around so that the denouement
_ the death of a protagonist _ occurs at the end of the film rather
than in the middle, forcing a new twist in the action. But, Jordan
argues, the change was necessary because of the difficulty of
making a movie in which one of the main characters dies so early in
the story.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, the script is lean and crisp and very true to
Greene's own dialogue. ``It's very hard to consolidate a novel like
this into a script, and he's done a phenomenal job of adapting
it,'' said Ms. Moore, wearing a 40s-style scarlet dress and hat as
she sat on the set between scenes (the costumes for ``The End of
the Affair'' were designed by Sandy Powell, who won an Academy
Award for ``Shakespeare in Love.'')
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moore said that now that she has become a mother _ she has a
16-month-old son _ she can understand the sacrifice that Sarah
makes in the film, all for love. ``Her character speaks very
clearly,'' Ms. Moore said. ``She's made a couple of promises, and
she's a person of her word. When you love someone that much and you
make a promise based on their well-being, then you keep that
promise.''
</P>
<P>
   The plot of ``The End of the Affair'' turns on the tortured,
jealous, regretful nature of Bendrix, a character based on Greene
himself in what was perhaps the most autobiographical of his
novels. Like Bendrix, Greene fell hopelessly, jealously in love
with a married woman whose Catholicism was a driving force in her
life.
</P>
<P>
   It was an ill-fated relationship: the woman, Catherine Walston,
would not leave her husband, who knew of and tolerated the affair,
and while Greene converted to Catholicism to prove his love for
her, he quickly began to betray her at every turn. Jordan and
Fiennes pored through Greene's old letters, journals and other
documents to understand more about the author, and about the
fiction he created around his life (the novel was dedicated to Mrs.
Walston).
</P>
<P>
   As tortured as he was, Greene never lost his writerly distance
from his own life, and he gave Bendrix the same gift of detachment.
``Greene once said there was a splinter of ice in the heart of
every novelist,'' Jordan said. ``He had an extraordinary ability to
feel an emotion, and then examine his feelings about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fiennes said that while he had always been intrigued by Greene's
moral ambiguity, he had been particularly drawn to the film because
of its exploration of the choices and burdens of religious faith.
His mother, he said, was a disillusioned Catholic; he himself
rejected Catholicism at the age of 13. ``In my mother's family, the
debate about faith and belief was very central,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The film is also an effort to examine the same events from
different points of view, and sometimes shows the same scene twice,
through Bendrix's eyes and then Sarah's. One of the things he found
particularly interesting, Jordan said, is how little the characters
in the book truly understand their own emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to explore the way that sex and the idea of love seem
like such ultimate issues in people's lives,'' he said. ``But in
the novel, even people who say, `I'll love you forever' can't
escape the promises and pledges that they've made.''

CLINTON TO MEET WITH JOINT CHIEFS ABOUT USING GROUND TROOPS IN
KOSOVO
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time since NATO's air war began 70
days ago, President Clinton is meeting with his Joint Chiefs of
Staff on Thursday to discuss options for using ground troops if
NATO decides to invade Kosovo, NATO and administration officials
said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is holding the session as the administration and NATO
are facing increasing time pressure to deal with the issue of an
invasion force. In order to have troops numbering about 150,000 in
place in the Kosovo region by mid-August, decisions to deploy them
would have to be made by mid-June, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Even mid-June for a decision may be too late, a senior Pentagon
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision-making window also is narrowing as leaders focus on
the approaching diplomatic summit of the Group of 7 and Russia in
Cologne, Germany, where the Kosovo conflict is expected to dominate
the agenda between Clinton and the Russian president, Boris
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has repeatedly tried to avoid public discussion
of combat forces, fearful of public opinion polls that show there
is little appetite for such a venture and of a backlash over the
American casualties that would inevitably occur. Some NATO allies,
particularly Britain, have argued that leaving open the threat of
deploying ground troops could increase pressure on President
Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia to agree to a diplomatic
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The administration and NATO have already approved the
composition of a force of 48,000 NATO troops described as needed
for peacekeeping in Kosovo once a settlement is achieved.
</P>
<P>
   But with a successful diplomatic outcome still far from certain,
NATO officials said that the administration has to look at the
options for an invasion force to defeat the Yugoslav military and
clear Kosovo for the return of more than 800,000 ethnic Albanian
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The American commander of NATO, Gen. Wesley Clark, who has made
little secret of his belief in the need for an invasion force, was
told last week by the Pentagon not to come for Thursday's White
House meeting, a NATO official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want a vigorous presentation of what they know he
will present and what he thinks is necessary to win,'' the official
said of the administration's reluctance about an invasion force.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's encounter between Clinton, the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry Shelton, the vice-chairman, Gen. Joseph
Ralston, and the heads of the four services, would cover the gamut
of military options for Kosovo, with the invasion force the newest
element on the agenda, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the war began, Clinton has often met with Shelton and
Ralston but not with the full complement of his military advisers.
</P>
<P>
   The administration continues to concentrate its efforts on the
air strikes coupled with diplomacy and would like to have a
diplomatic solution in place by the time of the meetings in Cologne
between Clinton and Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Yugoslav leader, Slobodan Milosevic, proves to be
intractable during a meeting scheduled on Wednesday in Belgrade
with the special Russian envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin, and President
Maarti Ahtisaari of Finland, about a possible agreement to the end
of the conflict, the administration will, at the very least, have
to consider an invasion force.
</P>
<P>
   And if the June 18 summit fails to produce a diplomatic
solution, the administration should be ready with a decision on an
invasion force, a NATO diplomat said. A decision on an invasion
force ``did not drop from the sky'' and had to be prepared now, the
diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next few days, a week, there will be serious discussion
of ground troops for the first time,'' an administration official
said. ``People are coming to the point of very sobering talks about
ground troops. It's all coming to a point of convergence.''
</P>
<P>
   In this context, ground troops means a contingent of more than
150,000 troops, which would come mostly from the United States,
Britain, and possibly France, NATO officials said. NATO can mount
such a force with only some partners if the other members do not
veto.
</P>
<P>
   In Bonn last week, Secretary of Defense William Cohen discussed
the option of an invasion force with his colleagues from four NATO
countries. He did not advocate an invasion force and did not
mention the number of troops that the United States would be
willing to commit, a NATO official said. But he laid the ground
work for a possible invasion force, by asking Germany to refrain
from saying that it would block NATO from sending such a force, a
NATO diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the German chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder,
declared combat troops ``unthinkable'' and said his government
would block such a move. In the last week, German officials have
been less outspoken against combat troops but have been pushing a
diplomatic solution.
</P>
<P>
   At the Bonn meeting attended by Cohen, and in other discussions,
NATO officials said that Britain has offered 50,000 troops for an
invasion force.
</P>
<P>
   The British prime minister, Tony Blair, has been forthright in
his statements that an invasion force may be necessary. British
diplomats have told their American counterparts that in the end,
the British government believes combat troops will be needed if the
Yugoslav military is to be forced out of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said that Clark briefed the ministers of defense
of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy early last week on how an
invasion force would operate.
</P>
<P>
   The timetable for getting troops to Albania and Macedonia, the
most likely staging areas for an invasion into Kosovo, would be
dictated largely by the onset of the Kosovo winter in October. The
Serbian troops would have to be out of Kosovo by October for there
to be any reasonable chance for the refugees now squatting in tent
cities in Macedonia and Albania to return home.

PLAN TO SOLIDIFY RADIOACTIVE WASTE FAILS AFTER $489 MILLION IN
RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.C., Wash.)  (rm) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After spending 16 years and $489 million on a
crucial step in its plan to safely store millions of gallons of
highly radioactive waste, the Energy Department has abandoned the
procedure because it produces explosive gases.
</P>
<P>
   Department officials said Tuesday they will replace the
contractor, a former subsidiary of Westinghouse, and asked outside
scientists to help find another method.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ernest Moniz, the undersecretary of energy, said that
experiments in the early 1980's showed the process was producing
high levels of explosive benzene gas. But rather than trying to
develop a new procedure, ``some rather poor judgment was used''
and, instead, engineers tried to make the process safe.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released Tuesday by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., the
General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, said
part of the problem was ``design and construction being done
concurrently _ with an emphasis on pushing ahead in the belief that
the problems could be solved later.'' That a test in 1983 produced
more benzene than the instruments could measure ``seemed to have
been forgotten over time,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Dingell, in a statement, said ``mismanagement by the Department
of Energy and Westinghouse led to an extraordinary, and pathetic,
waste of taxpayer money. All we have to show for $500 million is a
20-year delay, and the opportunity to risk another $1 billion to
make a problematic process work.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan is intended to solidify wastes left over from nuclear
weapons production that will be dangerously radioactive for
thousands of years. About 34 million gallons of the wastes are
stored in 51 aging underground tanks at the Savannah River site,
near Aiken, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina plant is one of two main sites at which the
government is storing wastes from nuclear weapons. Because the
chemical mixture of the waste there was considered simpler than
that at the second plant, in Hanford, Wash., it was decided to deal
with the problem in South Carolina first.
</P>
<P>
   The first stage in the plan was to concentrate the wastes so the
volume would be manageable. For the second stage, mixing the
radioactive material into molten glass, the department has built a
$2 billion factory.
</P>
<P>
   The factory works, but the process that Westinghouse wanted to
use to concentrate the wastes created benzene, a chemical found in
gasoline that can burn or explode.
</P>
<P>
   With that approach abandoned, the department may be forced to
spend billions more and take many more years to develop an
alternate.
</P>
<P>
   The department decided in January 1998 not to proceed with the
step Westinghouse favored to concentrate the wastes and Moniz said
that the Energy Secretary, Bill Richardson, decided last week to
ask for bids from other companies to replace Westinghouse.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Westinghouse said that if the plan it favored
did not work, the government could spend $1 billion to build a
processing plant to handle the waste in smaller batches, to control
benzene emissions. The Energy Department hopes to choose an
alternative by fall.
</P>
<P>
   But the costs may run higher. The General Accounting Office, in
a report released Tuesday, said that an alternative might take
eight years to develop and could cost $2.3 billion to $3.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Moniz, in a telephone interview, acknowledged that ``some
significant amount of funds could have been saved by pulling the
plug somewhat earlier.'' But he added that several billion dollars
would be saved by perfecting a way to concentrate the wastes, and
thereby reducing the volume of material to be sent to the glass
factory.
</P>
<P>
   Westinghouse Government Services, the Westinghouse subsidiary in
charge of concentrating the wastes was sold in March to Morrison
Knudsen and BNFL (formerly British Nuclear Fuels Limited). It will
continue to run other operations at Savannah River. Officials for
the contractor and at the Energy Department would not estimate the
value of the contract that the company will lose.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department has even more wastes in underground tanks
at its Hanford nuclear reservation, near Richland, Wash., and these
are leaking into the Columbia River. It is working with BNFL to
devise a system for solidifying the wastes there, but the Energy
Department had tried to solve the problems at Savannah River first
because they were considered chemically simpler. Savannah River was
built by DuPont and operated by that company for 30 years beginning
in the early '50s; Hanford was run by a variety of companies with
far less chemistry experience.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists at Savannah River discovered, to their dismay,
that copper and palladium in the tanks were acting as catalysts,
and allowing faster production of benzene.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was to add a chemical called tetraphenylborate to the
tanks, to make cesium and strontium, two of the most intensely
radioactive waste products in the liquids, fall to the bottom. The
liquids would then be reduced in volume in an evaporator, and the
resulting solids, which were not highly radioactive, would be mixed
with cement. The solids would go to the glass factory.
</P>
<P>
   The chemical problems at Hanford are different, but experts
there are worried by the problems at Savannah River. Jerry Pollet,
executive director of Heart of America Northwest, an environmental
group, said that ``from a management point of view, it raises a
huge concern here.'' The department signed a contract under which
it promises to provide the wastes to a glass factory to be built by
BNFL, and if it fails to deliver, he said, it would pay penalties.

   LITTLETON, Colo. _ Columbine High School students were allowed
back inside the bullet-scarred building Tuesday to retrieve their
backpacks and other personal items for the first time since the
shooting here on April 20.
</P>
<P>
   The students, some in tears and many accompanied by parents and
teachers, collected art projects, gym clothes, organizers and other
items left behind that sunny Tuesday morning six weeks ago when two
of their fellow students, Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17,
opened fire inside the school. They killed 12 students, a teacher
and themselves in the worst school shooting in the nation's
history.
</P>
<P>
   For some students on Tuesday, returning to the partially
boarded-up school, where bullet holes were visible in the walls and
most doorknobs had been removed by investigators, brought a closing
to a painful period. For others, it dredged up feelings of fear and
loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt nervous,'' said Michelle Cowles, 16, as she shook and
tried to hold back tears. ``I didn't want to come back here
today.'' Michelle, like many of the other students, was leaving the
school with a white garbage bag full of supplies from her locker.
``It felt good to get in there and get out again. I want to start
my life again.''
</P>
<P>
   And like many others, Michelle was not only accompanied by her
father, but was keeping close to him, holding his hand and
embracing him as they left the school. Grief counselors were also
at the school.
</P>
<P>
   Many students described an eerie scene inside Columbine, where
time seemed to have stood still in some classrooms, many of which
had been marked ``cleared'' or ``no evidence'' by the
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was weird being back in there,'' said Amanda Wiegard, a
16-year-old who will be a junior in the fall. ``Like, in the math
room all the windows were shot out, but the desks were right where
we left them.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the shootings, many students were in their fifth
period classrooms, while others were at lunch. On Tuesday, students
met with their fifth period teachers and were escorted back to
those classrooms in groups of 15 to 25. Officials had already
emptied the lockers, after spending weeks searching for bombs and
other evidence, and numbered the contents for students to pick up
in the auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   For some, returning to those classrooms was unsettling, as they
counted students forever missing from their numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in fifth period English class with Steve Curnow,'' said
Katie Jorgenson, 14, who carried a heavy bag of gym clothes, winter
coats and school notebooks over her shoulder. ``I just felt numb in
there today. I didn't want to go back when it's not fixed and it's
smelly and there's broken glass. They told us the glass was from
the SWAT teams, but I think they just said that to make us feel
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Katie's mother, Julie Jorgenson, felt differently about
Tuesday's visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was great,'' she said. ``We need to get over
these hurdles and get back to normal. No one should have to go
through what these kids did.''
</P>
<P>
   County mental health officials and school administrators said
walking back into Columbine was a first step.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a lot of apprehension on the faces of the students as
they entered the school today, but as they left I saw a sense of
relief,'' said Joanne Doherty, the deputy director for the
Jefferson County Center for Mental Health. ``This is yet another
step in the road for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Many students came Tuesday hoping for a final glimpse of what
they remembered seeing and hearing in those terrifying moments on
April 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw down the hall where the science classroom was, and we
saw where carpet was torn up, maybe from a spilled soda or blood
evidence, they said,'' said Erica McClaugherty, 14, who will be a
sophomore in the fall. ``I was kind of creeped out. It's scary that
such a safe place to me can be so shattered.''
</P>
<P>
   Erica said she was in the cafeteria taking pictures of friends
when the shooting began and only heard the shots. ``I want to see
those pictures so bad, and I don't know if the film or the camera
is OK,'' she said. The sprinklers went off during the shooting, and
items left on the floors were water-damaged.
</P>
<P>
   If Erica's pictures turn out, they may also be the final images
of the school library, the site of most of the shootings, and where
the gunmen killed themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The parts of the school that were damaged will be rebuilt by the
fall, but officials said they did not have designs completed for
the reconstruction. They said they expected to begin demolition
work in the cafeteria and in the library, which is still considered
a crime scene, within weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no structural damage, but we will be taking out
walls, windows and doors,'' said George Latuda, construction
manager for the school. Latuda said that the changes in the
cafeteria would be small but that there would be major changes in
the library.
</P>
<P>
   The school's nearly 2,000 students and faculty will be allowed
to visit the school again on Wednesday.

A SALUTE TO A POET WHO WASN'T JUST A POET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Never mind the war in the Balkans and the crisis in the
Kremlin. Forget about those election-year campaign posters. The
face gazing out from ubiquitous billboards and massive wall
posters, from vodka labels and matchbook covers, is not that of
some contemporary politician, but of Alexander Pushkin, Russia's
most celebrated poet.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring economic woes _ if just for a day _ Moscow's cash-poor
government has shelled out $4 million to celebrate Pushkin's gala
bicentennial birthday on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   A poet in Russia is more than just a poet, and Pushkin is the
single greatest literary figure in a culture renowned for its
writers; a hero of his time whose lofty status has been recognized
by the czars, the Communists, and the leaders of post-Soviet
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Like William Shakespeare and English, Pushkin is the father of
Russian literature, a writer of ingenious verse who paved the way
for the Russian novelists whose names are more familiar to American
readers _ Leo Tolstoy, Ivan Turgenev, and Feodor Dostoyevsky.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Shakespeare, Pushkin did not need a hit movie to get his
career back on track, not in a land where the exotic details of his
life _ his carousing youth in St. Petersburg, his clashes with the
czar's authority and periods of exile, his death in 1837 in a duel
with his wife's French suitor _ are common knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   While many Americans struggle to read the Bard's English without
a glossary, many Russians easily recite from memory the works of
Pushkin. Pushkin is popular in Russia today not just because of his
dazzling technical innovations in an array of genres, from odes and
epistles to fairy tales and satiric prose, but because many
Russians believe he is still their best national spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He speaks a simple language we can understand,'' said Pyotr
Paliyevsky, a professor at Moscow's Institute of World Literature.
``Pushkin says many different, contradictory things, but they are
all right and we can understand them.''
</P>
<P>
   Scholars say that Pushkin in the early 19th century was able to
articulate the main conflicts of Russian society to this day:
Russia's relationship with the West and the tension between
religious and secular life, between the powerless and the powerful,
between individuals and the state. The 19th century novelist
Nikolai Gogol, himself a keen observer of the Russian Zeitgeist,
once hailed Pushkin as the ``Russian man of 200 years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about the mystery of the Russian soul,'' said
Andrei Chernov, a Moscow poet and Pushkin specialist. ``Pushkin
holds the secret to that mystery. He is the one who wrote the code
of our soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Or as President Boris N. Yeltsin put it, in an awkward
formulation that earned jeers for clashing with the poet's rule of
pristine syntax, ``Pushkin is our everything.''
</P>
<P>
   As Sunday's 200th birthday bash approaches, Russian cultural
life has been dominated by events dedicated to Pushkin: theater
festivals, academic conferences, poetry readings, stamp-collecting
conventions, jewelers' competitions, all of it culminating this
week in a gala of parties, parades, and balls.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers and magazines have run front-page stories about the
exact location of Pushkin's birth in Moscow in 1799, and the
details surrounding his death after his duel with the French
nobleman d'Antes in 1837 in St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   One radio station plays ``interviews'' with characters from
Pushkin short stories, fairy tales, and plays. Russian Public
Television shows people on the street reciting from Pushkin's most
famous work, his novel-in-verse ``Eugene Onegin.''
</P>
<P>
   The station also has a TV quiz show ``Oh, That Pushkin,'' where
contestants send in answers to questions found on the wrappers of
Pushkin candy bars.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the prose of Gogol, Tolstoy, and Dostoyevsky, Pushkin's
best poetic work is not easy to translate (perhaps fitting for a
man who denigrated translators as ``the postal horses of
enlightenment.'') Pushkin is better known in the West as the author
whose ``Boris Godunov'' became a famous opera, and whose ``Mozart
and Salieri'' formed the nucleus of the Hollywood film ``Amadeus.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pushkin remains accessible to Russians, something that
threatens to turn him into the country's first victim of corporate
exploitation. Coca-Cola is running an ad that uses verses from one
of Pushkin's famous romantic lyrics, ``I remember the moment.''
British Airways quotes the poet's comments on shopping in London.
Moscow casinos are playing up Pushkin's short story on gambling,
``The Queen of Spades.''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians have rushed to get in on the act. Former prime
minister and current Balkans envoy Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, not
known as a literary critic, wrote a preface to the latest edition
of Pushkin's complete works.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's populist mayor, Yury Luzhkov, has hung patriotic
Pushkin slogans all over town and has made sure that every
storefront displays the poet's portrait. The trouble when
politicians try to embrace Pushkin is that Pushkin contradicts
himself. Was he the fiery patriot who exhorted, ``Not for anything
would I like to change fatherlands, or have another history than
the one God gave us.''
</P>
<P>
   Or was Pushkin's real attitude more ambivalent?
</P>
<P>
   ``I, of course, regard my country with the utmost contempt, from
top to bottom, but I don't like it when a foreigner shares this
feeling with me,'' Pushkin wrote, in words mirroring the attitude
of many Russians today.
</P>
<P>
   The inability to attach an ideology to Pushkin is a problem the
Soviet regime ran into in the 1930s, when it tried to turn the poet
into a ``tool for further cultural growth and development.''
Pushkin, with his frequent digressions into fantasy, farce, and
parody, refuses to be cast solely in such a utilitarian light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Try as they might, the Communists couldn't make Pushkin a
Soviet poet,'' said Nikolai Alexandrov, who runs a show called the
Pushkin Project on Ekho Moskvy radio. ``No matter how much the
authorities try to co-opt Pushkin now, as the symbol of democracy,
or nationalism, or orthodoxy, they cannot. Pushkin is still alive
and he's still a good writer. You can't pigeonhole him, because he
speaks for all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Pushkin, like any literary figure in the 1990s, risks being made
obsolete by growing indifference to poetry in the face of pop
culture, video games, and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A recent poll by the Public Opinion Foundation suggested that
fewer Russians were reading Pushkin _ only 50 percent of 1,500
adults said they had picked up Pushkin since finishing school,
according to the foundation, and only 28 percent had turned to the
poet in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``But whenever a new Pushkin volume is released, it sells out
immediately,'' Alexandrov countered.
</P>
<P>
   Some scholars fear that Pushkinmania is detracting from the
poet's value.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Pushkinist, I am disgusted by this anniversary,'' Chernov
said. He said the resources devoted to the holiday could have been
better spent upgrading fire safety at the 150-year wood hut where
Pushkin's original manuscripts are kept.
</P>
<P>
   Others are more charitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no such thing as too many holidays,'' writer Lev
Rubenshtein commented in a cover story in last week's issue of the
news magazine Itogi. ``So let's sit down at the table. Pour a
drink. Raise a toast. To what? Who cares? To everything. To our
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Pushkin could not have said it better.

   ``Exegi Monumentum'' is one of the most famous works by Russian
poet Alexander Pushkin. This translation is from Ernest J.
Simmons's 1937 biography, ``Pushkin.''
</P>
<P>
   I've raised my monument, unwrought by human skill;
</P>
<P>
   The people's path to it will not be overgrown,
</P>
<P>
   And its rebellious head will tower higher still
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   I shall not die _ my spirit in the sacred lyre,
</P>
<P>
   My ashes will survive and still escape the flame _
</P>
<P>
   I shall be great in this sub-lunar world entire,
</P>
<P>
   As long as poets live by fame.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the whole of Russia word of me will pierce;
</P>
<P>
   They will pronounce my name in every living tongue,

<P>
   Proud grandson of the Slav, the Finn, the Tungus fierce,
</P>
<P>
   The Kalmyk, friend of steppes unsung.
</P>
<P>
   Among the people I shall long be held a sage,
</P>
<P>
   Since I awakened with my lyre some tender feeling,
</P>
<P>
   Because I honored freedom in my cruel age
</P>
<P>
   And summoned favor for the kneeling.
</P>
<P>
   So to the will of God, O Muse, show reverence,
</P>
<P>
   Not fearing an offense or asking for the crown,
</P>
<P>
   Accepting praise or blame with full indifference,
</P>
<P>
   And do not argue with the clown.

   Prince Charles has accused supporters of genetically modified
food of using ``emotional blackmail'' to cover up its dangers by
arguing its production is necessary to feed the world's population.
He warned that approval of such crops, labeled ``Frankenstein

   Twenty-four men went on trial in Paris on charges of having a
role in the wave of pro-Islamist bombings that terrorized France in

   Indonesia: Suharto Son Quizzed &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The oldest son of former President Suharto, Sigit Harjodjudanto,
was questioned at the attorney general's office about the family's
accumulation of wealth. The most prominent of the six Suharto
children, Siti Hardiyanti Rukmana, who was minister of Social
Welfare in her father's last cabinet, was questioned on Monday.
Some local commentators have dismissed the questioning as a
pre-election ploy by the ruling party to distance itself from the
Suharto legacy.

<P>
   The head of a U.N. mission to East Timor, Ian Martin, took up
his post and said an end to violence is a prerequisite for the
holding of a referendum on independence, scheduled for August. At
the same time, Indonesia's leading presidential candidate, Megawati
Sukarnoputri, made a campaign stop in the disputed territory and
indicated that she opposed independence.

<P>
   The gently smiling face of former President Suharto, along with
the motto ``Father of Development,'' will disappear from
Indonesia's highest-denomination banknote, the 50,000 rupiah. New
banknotes replace Suharto's image with that of Soepratman, the man
who wrote Indonesia's national anthem. The 50,000-rupiah note _
worth about $20 before the dramatic currency devaluations that
began in 1997 _ is now worth $6.20.

Alviri, replaces Gholamhossein Karabaschi, who is serving a
two-year prison sentence on charges of corruption. Karabaschi had
been made a target of Khatami's opponents, but Alviri's election
has been seen as a sign of Khatami's strength.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Merrill Lynch, which grew to be the nation's top
retail brokerage house through an army of 14,000 stock brokers
mixing advice with salesmanship, bent to the pressures of online
competition Tuesday, announcing that it would add a low-cost
service for people who want to trade on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Like leading firms in many industries, Merrill has been
struggling to find a way to compete with cheaper online upstarts.
From bookstores to travel agencies, companies must decide how much
to risk their existing large and profitable businesses in order to
do battle with small, money-losing but rapidly growing Internet
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Merrill held the line, arguing that customers would
be willing to pay its higher fees in return for superior service
and in-depth analysis. But ultimately it decided that Internet
trading was neither a fad nor a small segment of the market.
Indeed, now one in every seven stock trades in the United States is
performed over the Internet, according to Credit Suisse First
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in September, Merrill, which now typically charges $80
to $100 for an average trade, will let customers trade online for
$29.95, matching Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., the largest brokerage firm
on the Internet. But those customers will not get access to
research or guidance from a broker. Alternately, customers can pay
an annual fee of at least $1,500 for unlimited free trading and
advice, either online or through a broker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could see just by observing the growth of Schwab's asset
base that there was a segment of the market that wants to use
technology and only technology,'' said David Komansky, the chairman
of Merrill. ``And it became clear to us we had to disaggregate our
services and price competitively.''
</P>
<P>
   While a few of the other traditional full-service brokerage
firms have introduced online trading in one form or another,
analysts say that most of them will have to go much further to
match Merrill, along with Schwab and the online brokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This puts a lot of pressure on other full-service firms to
respond in kind,'' said Bill Burnham, an electronic-commerce
analyst at Credit Suisse. ``Merrill is two years late to the game
but you have to hand it to them, they didn't get half pregnant.
They looked at Schwab and said if you can't beat them, join them.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill has gone beyond what the other full-service brokers have
done and invited its clients to have both full-service accounts and
discount Internet trading accounts at the same time, with trades
from all of them reported on one statement. There are two other
full-service firms with low-cost Internet units, Donaldson Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, but they have separated
their Internet units from their full-service operations.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill considered a separate Internet unit as well, but decided
it needed to reach out to its existing customers because an
increasing number of them had already opened a separate account to
try online trading on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it will be the rule that people use multiple
forms of accounts with us,'' said Komansky.
</P>
<P>
   A few other full-service firms, like Prudential Securities,
offer Internet trading, but only as part of the more expensive
flat-fee accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest losers from all of this may not be the brokerage
firms but the brokers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about E-trade saying, `Boot your broker,''' said
Christos Cotsakos, the chairman of E(STAR)Trade group, a big online
broker. ``This is Merrill booting their own brokers.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill argues that while some brokers may lose business in the
short run, the move is necessary to attract a new generation of
clients for the firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run this makes their life easier, but I'm certain
as we speak many of them have apprehensions,'' Komansky said. The
brokers, he said, ``will still do very well so long as they are
willing to provide value added for their client.''

LIBERTY MEDIA AGREES TO ACQUIRE ASSOCIATED GROUP 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Liberty Media Group, the television programming operation
controlled by John C. Malone, expanded into the wireless
communications business on Tuesday by agreeing to acquire
Associated Group Inc. in a deal worth perhaps $2.8 billion in
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Associated, based in Pittsburgh, is the largest investor in
Teligent Inc., which provides telephone and data communications
services to companies using advanced wireless technology.
Associated owns about 41 percent of Teligent, which is run by Alex
J. Mandl, a former president and chief operating officer of the
AT&AMP;T Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Associated also owns Trueposition Inc., a small company that is
developing technology to allow wireless telephone companies to
locate callers, part of a Mexican cellular carrier and a handful of
radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Liberty used to be part of Tele-Communications Inc., one of the
nation's biggest cable-television companies. Since AT&AMP;T completed
its acquisition of TCI earlier this year, Liberty has traded as an
AT&AMP;T tracking stock. But AT&AMP;T has no stake in Liberty, which
remains under the control of Malone, TCI's former chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Malone is known for his financial wizardry, and the Associated
deal is typically Malonian in its financial complexity, not least
because Associated already owned big parts of both Liberty and
AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Berkman family, which essentially controls
Associated, is trying to use the deal to minimize the substantial
tax bill the company could face were it to simply sell its assets
piecemeal.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, Associated sold a cable-television system in
the Ohio Valley region of Pennsylvania to TCI for about $6.5
million in TCI stock. That stake is now worth about $2 billion in
Liberty and AT&AMP;T stock. TCI's shareholders received both Liberty
and AT&AMP;T shares in the AT&AMP;T-TCI merger.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the phenomenal rise in the value of Associated's
stake in TCI, a simple sale of those shares would generate capital
gains taxes of as much as $800 million.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, who is now one of the biggest holders of AT&AMP;T stock and
sits on AT&AMP;T's board, stepped up to help Associated with its
problem and won the cooperation of AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Malone could use AT&AMP;T's help because he did not appear to
particularly want to invest in AT&AMP;T. The entire idea behind the
Liberty tracking stock is to allow investors to invest in a company
distinct from the core AT&AMP;T. But were Liberty to acquire Associated
outright, that would entail issuing additional Liberty shares to
buy a company that included about 19.7 million shares of AT&AMP;T,
worth about $1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   So AT&AMP;T agreed to put up exactly as many shares as Associated
already owned _ 19,719,274 _ while Liberty contributed about 25.9
million shares of its own stock. For AT&AMP;T, the deal was a wash
because it intends to retire the 19.7 million shares it will get
from Liberty; the total number of AT&AMP;T's outstanding shares will
stay the same.
</P>
<P>
   But even Liberty's 25.9 million share contribution was not a
straight stock-for-assets swap. In addition to its AT&AMP;T shares,
Associated already owned about 14.4 million shares of Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   So, based on Liberty's closing price Friday of $66.4375, the
value of stock that Associated's shareholders are set to receive in
excess of what their company already owned in AT&AMP;T and Liberty is
only about $770 million. Liberty has also agreed to assume up to
$187 million in Associated debt, so the Teligent stake,
Trueposition and Associated's other investments garnered only about
$957 million.
</P>
<P>
   That is a bargain for Liberty and Malone. Based on Teligent's
closing price on Friday of $49.125, Associated's 41 percent stake
in Teligent alone was worth $1.05 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But Malone got the bargain because he helped the Berkmans
achieve their main goal of reducing the potential $800 million tax
bill while getting a good price for their assets. That process was
made relatively painless for Associated because AT&AMP;T and Liberty
may retire the Associated-owned shares, to which large capital
gains apply, without paying any capital gains taxes. If an
unrelated company, say MCI Worldcom, were to acquire Associated and
then sell the AT&AMP;T and Liberty shares, MCI Worldcom would have to
pay the taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The implied value of the avoided taxes was seen in the rise of
Teligent's shares, which rose $5.4375, to $54.5625, in Nasdaq
trading on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having Liberty as an important investor brings a partner to
the table who will add to the idea flow, add to the
opportunities,'' Mandl said Tuesday. ``It will give us a chance to
move Teligent even faster and further than we have before.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives close to the deal said that Malone could give
Teligent more financial flexibility that it had enjoyed with
Associated. The Berkmans, led by Myles P. Berkman, Associated's
chairman, had appeared wary of diluting their stake in Teligent
through acquisitions. Malone, by contrast, had never been shy in
the merger arena.
</P>
<P>
   Associated was advised in the transaction by Salomon Smith
Barney. Liberty did not appear to use an outside finanical adviser.

CONRAIL TAKEOVER OFF TO A SMOOTH START 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The CSX and Norfolk Southern railroads took over the
Conrail system Tuesday in one of the most complex handoffs in
railroad history and for the first day, at least, trains throughout
the Northeast ran close to schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The switch-over began at 4:30 p.m. on Monday, when the computer
systems of Conrail began to shut down. CSX computers had taken
control of the CSX portion by 8 a.m. on Tuesday, according to
Robert Haulter, the vice president of integration planning at CSX
Transportation Inc., the railroad unit of the CSX Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The Norfolk Southern Corp. had some minor computer problems
initially but by noon on Tuesday, it had taken control of its share
of Conrail, according to Frank Brown, a spokesman for the railroad,
which is based in Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Norfolk operated 50 trains Tuesday and expects to be running a
full schedule of up to 225 trains by late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The two railroads, which agreed to buy Conrail jointly for $10.3
billion in April 1997, have been planning the takeover for months.
Conrail was created by Congress in 1976 out of the bankrupt Penn
Central Railroad and five other struggling lines in the Northeast.
Norfolk Southern has acquired 58 percent of Conrail, and CSX 42
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Jolene M. Molitoris, the administrator of the Federal Railroad
Administration, which oversees the nation's railroads, visited the
staffs of both railroads on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have not been any glitches,'' she said in a telephone
interview from Jacksonville, Fla., where the CSX railroad
subsidiary has its headquarters. ``Today everything has been
smooth.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eastern railroads have sought to avoid the disruptions in
service that occurred throughout the Southwest and climaxed in 1997
when the Union Pacific, the nation's largest railroad, took over
the Southern Pacific Rail Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Major shippers awaited Tuesday's switchover nervously because
Conrail has been the rail backbone of the Northeast and helps run
commuter lines in major cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm comforted so far,'' said Edward H. Rastatter, the director
of policy for the National Industrial Transportation League, a
trade group that represents many of the nation's largest rail
shippers. He said that he had not heard of any complaints from
major shippers.
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited transition was particularly tricky since it
involved handing over the dispatching of commuter service in some
metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   CSX, which took over the dispatching of numerous commuter trains
in New Jersey, Boston and Chicago, has put senior people in major
dispatching centers in case there are snags. CSX kept 180 trains
running while the transition was under way, executives said.
</P>
<P>
   Haulter said, however, that while Tuesday was a major milestone,
many more changes will be phased in over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gone very well,'' he said. ``But its just another
milestone. We're keeping our eyes firmly focused on the tasks
ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The railroads are seeking to lure traffic from trucks to the
rails in the congested Northeast by offering lower rates.

IN LETTER TO GERMANY, MILOSEVIC ACCEPTS VAGUE PRINCIPLES OF PEACE
ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KOSOVO-POLICY) 
(rm) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Germany on Tuesday received a letter from the Yugoslav
government in which President Slobodan Milosevic said he was ready
to withdraw forces from Kosovo and accept a ``United Nations
presence'' in the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   But Milosevic also demanded an immediate end to NATO's
70-day-old bombardment if a settlement is to be reached and made
clear that significant differences with the West remain.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, formally accepting broad principles for a peace
accord set on May 6 by the Group of Seven industrialized countries
and Russia, arrived as the Finnish president, Martti Ahtissari,
prepared to travel to Belgrade on Wednesday for the first meeting
between a Western leader and Milosevic since the NATO bombing
began.
</P>
<P>
   The planned visit, and the decision by Ahtissari to talk to a
man indicted last week on war crimes charges, suggested that
diplomacy has advanced enough to necessitate a direct exchange,
however unpalatable such a meeting may be.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials said Ahtissari's visit reflects a conviction
among Western governments that Milosevic is beginning to cede under
the pressure of bombing and that time is running out for a
diplomatic settlement that would avert a possible ground invasion
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is deeply reluctant to contemplate the use of
ground forces, but military planners believe preparations must be
made in the next few weeks if the threat of an invasion is to be
credible.
</P>
<P>
   James Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said that Ahtissari
would take with him a detailed settlement plan. In effect, said a
senior Western official, ``the plan shows how we believe the broad
principles now agreed to by Yugoslavia would work on an operational
level.''
</P>
<P>
   In the letter received Tuesday by Germany, Milosevic committed
Yugoslavia to the vague terms laid out May 6, including the
withdrawal from Kosovo of ``military, police and paramilitary
forces'' and acceptance of the deployment there of ``effective
international civil and security presences.''
</P>
<P>
   But the letter made no commitment to withdrawing all Serbian
forces from the province, a central allied demand which, in
deference to Russia, was not spelled out in the May 6 statement.
</P>
<P>
   The letter also indicated nothing more than an acceptance of ``a
United Nations presence, mandate and other elements to be decided
by a U.N. Security Council Resolution'' _ an undertaking that
appears to fall far short of Washington's demand for a force in
Kosovo that would have NATO at its core.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic was also quick to accept a ``United Nations presence''
in Croatia and Bosnia at difficult moments in the wars there,
presences he later exploited to consolidate the Serbian position by
playing on the ambiguities of the U.N. mandate and the weakness of
the forces deployed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central unresolved issue remains what comes out of Kosovo
and what goes in,'' said Michael Steiner, chief diplomatic adviser
to Gerhard Schroeder, the German chancellor. ``We need all the
Serbian troops out, other than a possible symbolic presence, and a
convincing military deployment that only NATO can provide.''
</P>
<P>
   Western officials said that Ahtissari would spell this out to
Milosevic and make clear that he must accept NATO's terms rather
than the May 6 statement.
</P>
<P>
   Because up to now talks with Milosevic have been conducted by a
Russian, Viktor Chernomyrdin, NATO is concerned that the Yugoslav
leader may have received a diluted version of the alliance's
demands, officials said. Ahtissari's presence was therefore
critical at this stage.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's conditions include the withdrawal of all Serbian forces,
Belgrade's acceptance of an international force in Kosovo with NATO
at its core, and the return of close to one million ethnic
Albanians who have been driven from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not settle for less,'' Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright told a news conference on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``It's important for there to be an explanation by
Milosevic as to what it is he means.''
</P>
<P>
   She spoke after a meeting with the Italian foreign minister,
Lamberto Dini, who said that Milosevic had to accept the conditions
set on May 6 as well as NATO's demands and had to begin to withdraw
forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is not accepted and is not verifiable, then I do not
think it will be possible for the alliance to come to an agreement
on the suspension of bombing,'' Dini said.
</P>
<P>
   This statement, from a country that has been among the more
eager to end the bombing, suggested that the Clinton administration
has convinced its allies that only what would amount to a clear
admission of defeat by Milosevic would suffice to stop the bombing
and open the way to a settlement.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The rejection by Serbia of a NATO deployment in Kosovo
precipitated the start of the bombing on March 24. The bombing, in
turn, proved a catalyst to an already prepared and partially
executed Serbian campaign to evict the ethnic Albanian population
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott held talks in Bonn on
Tuesday with Chernomyrdin, Russia's envoy, and Ahtisaari, who is
representing the European Union. The discussions, also attended by
Schroeder, focused on how to narrow differences with Yugoslavia,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin is to accompany Ahtisaari to Belgrade on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After the talks Tuesday, Schroeder told a news conference, ``We
are on the way to a political solution of the problem and
substantial progress has been made.''
</P>
<P>
   The German government, a coalition of Social Democrats and
environmentalist Greens, has been increasingly eager to suggest
that progress is being made because pressure is mounting in both
parties for a halt to the bombing. The government is also deeply
opposed to a NATO ground invasion, which would become a more likely
option if the current diplomacy fails.
</P>
<P>
   Ahtissari said Tuesday in an interview with Finnish radio that
he was not going to Belgrade to negotiate with Milosevic. ``This is
no regular negotiating situation,'' he said. His statement
reflected NATO's official position that its demands are
nonnegotiable.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, however, it is clear that several difficult issues
will be reviewed with Milosevic. The first is what signal he would
have to give to demonstrate that his commitment to a settlement is
genuine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's broken promise after promise,'' the British Defense
Secretary, George Robertson, said Tuesday of Milosevic. ``We must
not and we cannot trust his word. We can only judge him on what he
does.''
</P>
<P>
   In its letter to the German government, Yugoslavia said that,
``In order to achieve a successful solution, it is necessary
immediately to end the NATO aerial bombardment and to concentrate
on a political agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   But NATO governments _ particularly Britain and the United
States _ would clearly want some strong tangible indication that
Serbian troops had started to withdraw en masse from Kosovo before
the bombing was stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Another difficult issue is what Serbian forces, if any, would be
allowed to remain in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Milosevic was likely to maneuver to increase the
number of Russians in any peacekeeping force, try to concentrate
this Russian presence in the northern part of Kosovo to which Serbs
are most attached, and attempt to keep the British and American
contingents to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   But Steiner said that any deployment that suggested a division
of Kosovo into two zones _ one mainly Russia and one controlled by
NATO countries _ ``cannot be acceptable as an aim, because it might
imply an imminent division of the province.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadly, Western officials said the aim was to move toward
agreement on a settlement by the time of the summit meeting of
Group of Seven countries and Russia in Cologne, Germany, in two
weeks. If no agreement could be reached before then, the pressure
to look seriously at a ground invasion and prepare for it might
become overwhelming, they said.

 &HT;    Rocker relieved to receive recognition
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ John Rocker has done well so far as the Braves'
closer, and he can hold up his Rolaids Relief Man National League
pitcher of the month award to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   He capped off the month Monday with his ninth save in 10
chances, bringing his season total to 10. He was 1-1 with a 0.60
ERA in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice little milestone, I guess. Next stop is 20,''
Rocker said of hitting double digits in saves for the first time in
his career. He had only three saves in his career before this year:
two in Atlanta, one in Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's save came against Colorado, the team that cost him a
blown save in his first save opportunity as the Braves' closer in
Denver on April 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was glad to redeem myself against them,'' Rocker said. ``If
a team beats you, you can get it in your head, `That team owns me.'
It's good to prove to yourself you can get them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker hasn't allowed a run in his last 11 appearances, dating
to May 7 when he ran into trouble against the Padres. That was his
only blemish in an otherwise dominant month.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go out and throw strikes I can fare well against
anybody,'' Rocker said. ``Lately I've been making some good pitches
and getting away with mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   For someone who was a starter until last season, Rocker is
taking to this closer business well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really saw myself as a reliever,'' he said, and there
was a good reason _ it took him 30-45 minutes to warm up.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker has found ways around that, using a four- or five-run
lead or deficit in the later innings as his cue to start stretching
his legs and his arm. He now needs only five minutes to get his arm
nearly ready. That little sprint to the mound? It's about more than
psyching himself up to pitch and being a quirky left-hander.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to run six or eight sprints before I started,'' Rocker
said. ``I'm 80 percent loose in the pen. That sprint warms me up a
little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Driving them in
</P>
<P>
   When Ryan Klesko drove in a run in the sixth inning Monday, it
raised his average to .200 with runners in scoring position. That
makes him the weak link of the big hitters in the Braves lineup in
that category, behind Brian Jordan (.418), Bret Boone (.357),
Andruw Jones (.327), Chipper Jones (.277) and Javy Lopez (.275).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a lot better than the 1-for-15 stretch,'' Klesko
said, referring to the mini-slump he endured in April after
returning from a sore hamstring. ``I'm not going to worry about it
because I've only got 120 some at-bats (126). I definitely wasn't
happy with it, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Klesko is hitting better overall. His batting average climbed
from .260 to .286 in the last seven games in May. During that span
he went 9-for-22 and hit safely in six games.
</P>
<P>
   More on Chen
</P>
<P>
   As rookie Bruce Chen headed off to AAA Richmond, Braves pitching
coach Leo Mazzone had this to say about his potential: ``It's just
a matter of getting more innings. He's handled himself real well.
He should be a solid big leaguer someday.
</P>
<P>
   Chen lost his shot at the fifth starter's spot in spring
training and failed to regain it from Odalis Perez in his two
starts while John Smoltz was on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's quality in spurts,'' Mazzone said. ``It can be his
fastball, his breaking ball or his change-up.Etc.
</P>
<P>
   When the amateur draft begins today, the Braves won't make their
first pick until the second round, 81st overall. Atlanta lost its
picks at 30th (first round) and 36th (sandwich pick) overall as
compensation for signing free agent Jordan this offseason. ...
Pitcher Damian Moss has been reinstated from the disabled list and
optioned to Class A Macon, where he is scheduled to start today.
Moss is returning from elbow transplant surgery last June 24. The
native Australian is 28-29 with a 3.93 ERA in four years in the
minors.

AS GOLD PRICE PLUNGES, BARRICK THRIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By TIMOTHY PRITCHARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The price of gold has fallen to levels unseen in more
than 20 years. But that does not seem to faze Peter Munk, chairman
of the Barrick Gold Corp., one of the world's biggest and most
profitable mining companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a gold bug,'' Munk said. ``I didn't form Barrick
because I love gold. To me it was a fabulous business
opportunity.'' Even in the current market, he said, the company
produces gold for less than half the price it gets, and ``to me,
that's like paradise.''
</P>
<P>
   Munk's appraisal of the gold business has not shifted, even
though the price has fallen from more than $400 an ounce three
years ago to $267 late Tuesday. The most recent reason for the
decline is the announcement by Britain last month that it would
sell half its gold reserves, aggravating oversupply fears.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, higher prices would make Barrick even more
profitable. But it is now ``the most profitable gold company in the
world,'' Munk said. So his concerns are not those of the world's
gold traders and speculators.
</P>
<P>
   Munk, 71, has been involved in other businesses _ stereo
manufacturing, hotels in the South Seas, oil and gas _ with mixed
results. But he has done exceptionally well with Barrick, which he
helped establish in 1983. Today it mines gold in Ontario and Quebec
provinces as well as in Nevada, Peru and Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the company earned a record $301 million on revenue
of $1.3 billion, even though the average spot price for an ounce of
gold was $294 in 1998, down from $332 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Barrick fared well for three reasons. It mined 5 percent more
gold, lowered its operating costs by 12 percent to $160 an ounce,
and sold its output for an average price of $400 an ounce by
hedging _ selling gold it had not yet produced.
</P>
<P>
   Not one ounce of gold Barrick has mined has ever been sold for
the market price. Working with investment bankers, it sells
contracts for future delivery and invests the proceeds from those
transactions in high-quality securities. After commissions are
paid, Barrick records the gains from its investments as part of the
selling price for gold.
</P>
<P>
   So while the price of bullion has been falling hard, Barrick
stock has held up quite well. On Tuesday, Barrick shares traded on
the New York Stock Exchange fell 31.25 cents to $16.9375, well
within their 52-week range of $12.875 to $23.625.
</P>
<P>
   Several precious-metals analysts expect Barrick's profit to keep
rising because the company is less reliant on high-cost mines and
is expanding low-cost operations. In a recent report, HSBC
Securities in Toronto said it expected Barrick's profit to rise to
$334 million, even though its average selling price for an ounce of
gold is projected to fall roughly 4 percent, to $385.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent and rare interview in Toronto, Munk described
Britain's proposed sale over two years of 415 metric tons of gold,
or 913,000 pounds, as a relatively small quantity that had provoked
a knee-jerk reaction. ``There is nothing that this market can come
up with in terms of bad news that has not been totally digested by
the main holders,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike longtime gold bugs who fret about the vulnerability that
has settled around gold, making it no different from other
commodities, Munk said he thought the price of bullion had been
amazingly strong. Had he been asked 10 years ago what sales from
reserves by governments would do to the price, ``I would have said
it would have been between $40 and $50'' an ounce.
</P>
<P>
   But this degree of price resilience in the face of bad news, he
maintained, ``really proves that gold has a fundamental balance of
value as a commodity that is supported by healthy demand that is
created by the world's population getting wealthier.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there are reasons why the world commodity price of
gold is languishing. Other experts point out that gold no longer
plays a key role in world financial markets or as a hedge in
investment portfolios. Moreover, some of the biggest owners of gold
are selling. Central banks in six countries _ Canada, Australia,
Belgium, the Netherlands, Argentina and the Czech Republic _ have
already sold bullion from their reserves. Joining Britain will be
Switzerland, selling more than 1,000 tons. The International
Monetary Fund may also become a seller.
</P>
<P>
   The new European Central Bank has determined that its member
countries will commit gold for 15 percent of the reserves backing
the euro currency. But according to the Gold Survey for 1999,
published by Gold Fields Mineral Services Ltd. of London, three
countries have considerably more gold _ Germany, with 32 percent of
its reserves in bullion, France with 40 percent and Italy with 45
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that chunks of these holdings, totaling 10,000
metric tons, will spill into a market with total annual demand just
over 4,000 tons worries speculators. The United States has more
than 8,000 metric tons, according to the Gold Survey.
</P>
<P>
   Other forces at work in the financial markets are hurting gold.
</P>
<P>
   One has been the lending of gold by central bankers to hedge
funds, which have sold into the market with the hope of repaying
the banks later with cheaper bars. Interest on this lending is a
source of revenue for the central banks. The other has been
distress selling within battered Asian economies, which led to a
large increase in what is known in the industry as scrap supplies.
Last year, scrap rose 70 percent to almost 1,000 tons, Gold Fields
said.
</P>
<P>
   Munk expressed belief that the gold market would absorb the
central bank sales without much disruption as long as the bankers
make their intentions clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you have transparency, the market is large enough,'' he
said. ``The gold market is as liquid as for any currency.''
</P>
<P>
   Absorbing central bank sales may take time. But the annual
demand for gold has been slightly above 4,000 metric tons for the
last few years, while new supplies from mines have totaled about
2,500 metric tons. Low prices have taken some high-cost mines out
of production.
</P>
<P>
   Munk acknowledged that few rich people now hoard gold bars to
protect themselves against economic uncertainty _ they prefer U.S.
government bonds. But, he said, the impact has been offset by new
wealth that economic growth is creating not just in North America
and Europe but also in such countries as India, China and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The explosion of the consumer pool, the trillions of dollars
of wealth created by the stock market _ all that just increases a
constantly growing fundamental demand,'' he said. ``And it has
nothing to do with people who 15 years ago bought gold because they
believed in the doomsday of the financial world, like my
grandfather did.''

ADVERTISING: CHEVROLET STEERS THE IMPALA DOWN MEMORY LANE
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may not be for your father's Impala, but the advertising
promoting the latest model of that Chevrolet might take him back a
few years.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Chevy has revived its popular 1950s song ``See
the U.S.A. in your Chevrolet'' in a new campaign for the 2000 model
Impala.
</P>
<P>
   For some potential car buyers, the ads may hark back to another
era of automobiles. But the updated marketing message is clearly
aimed at today's consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attempt was not to be nostalgic but to simply take a great
piece of equity we had and _ if you're going to promote the pure
pleasure of driving _ what better way than to show the inside of
the vehicle and have a song that's all about the joy of driving?''
asked Bill Ludwig, vice chairman and chief creative officer of
Campbell-Ewald Advertising in Warren, Mich., which created the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The national TV campaign began running during the Memorial Day
weekend when two 30-second spots were introduced on the
Indianapolis 500 broadcast by ABC. Print ads are set to begin
appearing this month in weekly news magazines. Chevrolet, the
largest division at the General Motors Corp., plans to use regional
direct-marketing to augment the promotion later this year.
</P>
<P>
   One spot focuses on a woman gazing happily at the world, while a
contemporary version of the trademark song plays in the background.
A narrator asks, ``When was the last time you drove, just for the
fun of it? Why doesn't somebody bring that back?'' Viewers then see
shots of the new Impala on the road, and learn that the woman is a
passenger in the car.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign's tag line is ``Let's go for a drive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought, `No one says that anymore,''' said Ludwig of
Campbell-Ewald, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies. ``They
say, `Let's go to the store, let's go pick up the laundry and let's
go to work.' But no one says, `Hey, let's go for a drive.'''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is meant to emphasize the pleasure of riding in an
Impala, which carries a sticker price of around $19,000 to $23,000.
``It's very different than the zippy little runabout you might
experience in a smaller Japanese car or Volkswagen,'' Ludwig said.
``We were trying to get at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet began shipping the 2000 Impala to its 4,300 dealers on
April 8. The company said consumer research had determined that
customers ``want a car that satisfies the head, yet appeals to the
heart,'' said Jim Jandasek, director of passenger car advertising
and sales promotion for Chevrolet; the campaign was created with
that in mind.
</P>
<P>
   The updated Chevrolet theme song is likely to get some attention
simply because of its nostalgic appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the noise level of automobile advertising is so
difficult to break through, it seems to me that if a company had
something that worked once upon a time _ and if it can be made
relevant to today's target market _ there is no reason why they
shouldn't go with it,'' said Clive Chajet, the president of Chajet
Consultancy in New York, which advises corporations on
brand-building strategies.
</P>
<P>
   He did, though, warn of a potential pitfall of using a familiar
tag line or tune. ``The risk is that if it's not updated, the image
gets frozen in time,'' Chajet said, ``and it becomes, to use an
auto term, your grandfather's Oldsmobile'' _ or Impala. &QL;

FTC ENDING INQUIRY INTO CISCO SYSTEMS' PARTNERSHIP TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission said on Tuesday that it was ending
its nine-month investigation into partnership discussions that
Cisco Systems Inc., the No. 1 maker of data communications
equipment, held in recent years with two rivals, Lucent
Technologies Inc. and the Nortel Networks Corp. of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry's end means that for the time being, Cisco will
escape the sort of regulatory and legal pressure that the
government has brought to bear on two other titans of cyberspace,
the Intel Corp. and the Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows that the FTC concluded in this routine inquiry that
the practices that they had asked about were not really an issue,''
Dan Scheinman, Cisco's general counsel and vice president for legal
and governmental affairs, said Tuesday. ``And ultimately it shows
that Cisco is a company which has been very cautious, very
conservative about how it approaches these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Streitfeld, a spokeswoman for the commission, said the
investigation had ended but declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the FTC began its investigation by asking Cisco
for documents relating to partnership discussions the company had
held with Lucent and Nortel in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Executives who have seen the commission's original inquiry
letter said the investigation was prompted at least partly by news
reports last summer in which Cisco executives indicated the company
would be willing to agree not to compete in certain areas as part
of a deal with a potential partner.
</P>
<P>
   It became clear a few years ago that Cisco, the biggest maker of
Internet switches, was on a collision course with Lucent and
Nortel, North America's biggest makers of traditional telephone
equipment. Cisco is trying to make its gear capable of transmitting
phone calls while Lucent and Nortel want to become forces in the
data world.
</P>
<P>
   An article in The New York Times last July reported that John T.
Chambers, Cisco's chief executive, had decided essentially to go it
alone after trying and failing to form alliances with Lucent or
Nortel. The article also reported that Cisco was willing to forgo
competing in the core telecommunications markets for big phone
switches and corporate phone systems in return for any potential
partner agreeing to refrain from moving into Cisco's main product
area: high-speed Internet switches.
</P>
<P>
   But Lucent and Nortel refused that deal because the data market
was growing much faster than the market for traditional phone gear.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco provided two boxes of documents to the FTC, which was
concerned that the company had improperly attempted to divide the
communications market. After nine months, the commission apparently
concluded that Cisco did not behave improperly.
</P>
<P>
   Three months before the inquiry began, Nortel agreed to acquire
Bay Networks Inc., another big data communications company, for
$9.1 billion in stock. In January, Lucent agreed to acquire Ascend
Communications Inc., one of Cisco's main foes, for $20 billion.

CRITICS UNHAPPY THAT WTO DOESN'T ALWAYS PROTECT CIVIL, POLITICAL
RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Bill Bryant knew he would face some critics, but he
hadn't expected this. Invited to a forum at Seattle University last
week to speak in favor of the World Trade Organization, he found
himself the only one of five panelists clearly defending it, and
with the audience clearly against him.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, of Bryant Christie Inc., trade consultants, spoke on
behalf of the Washington Council on International Trade. The four
other panelists ranged from progressive to Marxist to deep green.
The forum was occasioned by the WTO's plan to hold a meeting of
trade ministers in Seattle Nov. 30 to Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant started with a technical description of how the WTO
resolves trade disputes. The audience wasn't interested; it was
focused on the fundamental questions. The criticism that resonated
most with the audience was the argument by Sally Soriano of the
Washington Fair Trade campaign, who denounced the WTO for
subjecting national laws to ``an anti-democratic panel of three
trade bureaucrats, operating in secret.''
</P>
<P>
   The WTO, she said, is ``a supranational legal system for
corporations, outside our constitution and courts.''
</P>
<P>
   An example, she said, was the dispute with Europe over
hormone-fed beef. Europe's democratic governments banned it, and
our beef industry, which uses hormones routinely, appealed to the
WTO. The three trade bureaucrats agree with the American beef
producers that the ban was an impermissible trade barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant defended the ruling. He said the Europeans had offered no
peer-reviewed science to implicate hormone-fed beef. The WTO
nations had promised each other to base their health restrictions
on science _ not necessarily majority science, but some science.
Bryant said, ``The EU could not base their regulations on
theoretical uncertainties.''
</P>
<P>
   A woman in the audience said: ``It was the people of Europe who
wanted their meat without any hormones in it. The people, sir, do
not have to base their desires on science.''
</P>
<P>
   But those democratic governments, Bryant replied, had promised
not to ignore science. Because Japan had promised that, it is now
on the verge of letting in apples from Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, the WTO's solution was not to trick Europeans
about American beef, but to ``label it as hormone-treated and let
the consumer decide. If they don't want it, let them not buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   A man in the audience said, ``People may decide they don't want
these products, and decide that collectively.'' If people decide it
individually, he said, they'll be manipulated by the corporate
media.
</P>
<P>
   I spoke up. If it's decided collectively, I said, will it be the
people speaking _ or the meat producers? It seemed the audience was
taking an exceptionally idealistic view of politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go with 700 years of democracy,'' Soriano said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has democracy, but only for some kinds of
decisions. If the Legislature in Olympia, Wash., voted to ban the
import of California wines, its law would be thrown out in court as
a blockage on interstate commerce. If it targeted some ingredient
in California wines as a hazard to health, and there was no science
to back it up, the law would likewise be ejected.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind the WTO is that such rules should exist among
nations. The WTO is often described as unconcerned with human
rights, but what its sponsors seek to protect is a subset of them:
the rights to buy and sell, to move one's goods and money across
borders and to be treated the same in a foreign country as the
business owners in that country. The WTO does limit democracy, as
does the First Amendment's protection of free speech and public
assembly.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice if countries all got together and agreed to
protect civil and political rights too. But they are not about to
do it; China, for one, would not be clamoring to sit down with 136
nations and talk about that. Political rights are domestic
concerns. The trade rights of foreigners are international
concerns, which is why there are WTO agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The specifics of those agreements is another issue _ and an
important one. ``We have an obligation to look at the system we're
creating,'' Bryant said. He agreed with critics that the WTO
dispute panels should not operate in secret. But some kind of rules
are needed, he said, if the world is not to lurch back into the
international chaos of the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   It was a powerful argument to him, but it didn't move the
audience. The group simply had another agenda. It is tempting to
ignore such critics, but smart that the Washington Council on
International Trade did not. The WTO discussions ultimately depend
on public support. The critics know that. The defenders should not
forget it.

THE SON WHO CREATED A HIT, `THE SOPRANOS'  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 6) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., N.J., R.I., Calif.)   (af)  
 By ALEX WITCHEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Chase, the creator of the HBO phenomenon ``The Sopranos,''
picked me up at noon. We were driving to Elizabeth, N.J., for lunch
at Manolo's, a restaurant he used as a location in the series _ one
that the mobster Tony Soprano torches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you really want to go to New Jersey?'' Chase asked
uneasily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, yes, I guess so,'' I said, a bit thrown. It had taken
weeks of phone calls to arrange this meeting, since Chase is more
than a little press-shy. ``I thought you wanted to go to New
Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to go,'' he insisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I thought you did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we don't have to,'' I said, trying desperately to think
of an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   He looked surprised. ``Oh, I don't care if we go.''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment I realized there would be no need to speak to
Nancy Marchand, who plays Livia Soprano, mob mother from hell. I
had just seen the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   Chase has created a cast of characters for his smash hit show
who are completely idiosyncratic and unforgettable. But it is Livia
_ a mother so angry at her son for moving her to a nursing home
that she helps put a hit out on him _ who is a little more
unforgettable than the rest. She is, of course, inspired in part by
Chase's own mother, Norma, who died five years ago at the age of
84.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was, uh, a complete original,'' Chase said, seated at a
corner table at Manolo's. He laughed uneasily, looking down at the
tablecloth. ``She had this incredible thing where she was very
easily offended, yet there was never a person on earth who censored
herself less. The way she acted was very sad. As she got older, she
started insulting more and more people, taking umbrage at things
they said and cutting herself off from the world. At a time when
she was getting older and people die or get sick anyway, she was
shrinking her circle by her own doing. It was very odd.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase said his parents had ``married pretty late, in their early
30s.'' His father, Henry, was born in Providence, R.I., his mother
in Newark, though both sets of parents came from Italy. Chase is an
only child and neither of his parents was Roman Catholic: his
father was Baptist; his mother, the 10th of 11 children, was reared
by a ``socialist atheist'' father who loved opera and named some of
his daughters after his favorites, including Norma and her sister
Livia.
</P>
<P>
   Chase was born in Mount Vernon, N.Y., but he won't say when. He
worries about revealing his age in youth-obsessed Hollywood, though
he offers ``50-ish'' as an estimate. He will also not give his
daughter's name or where she will attend college next year.
</P>
<P>
   He says it was his paternal grandmother who changed the family
name from DeCesare to Chase, but he won't say why. ``It was a
situation of l'amour fou'' is as far as he'll go, worried that
relatives will get angry if he divulges more.
</P>
<P>
   His mother was a worrier, too, he said. ``She worried about
cancer, car accidents, criminals breaking into the house. And my
father did get cancer. So did all her sisters.''
</P>
<P>
   What did Norma Chase make of her only child, a graduate of New
York University who earned a master's in film from Stanford
University and won Emmy Awards for his writing and directing of the
hit series ``I'll Fly Away'' and ``Northern Exposure''?
</P>
<P>
   He grimaced toward the tablecloth and closed his eyes, something
he did often. He seemed to keep hoping that when he finally opened
them, I would have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``I was so far out of her world. My
first directing job was an episode of `Alfred Hitchcock Presents,'
and I called to tell her and she said, `Really? Did they accept
it?''' For as many times as he has obviously told this story, he
still gasps with the disbelief of a hurt child.
</P>
<P>
   ```I don't cater to anybody,' she used to say. But there was a
kind of self-awareness of what she was doing. Sometimes I would
think: `She's doing performance art. It's a character she's made
up.' She was aware sometimes that she was being outrageous and
provocative.''
</P>
<P>
   When Chase was 5, the family moved from Mount Vernon to Clifton,
N.J., where Chase got As in everything except deportment, in which
he got Fs. ``I was out of my chair, talking a lot,'' he said. ``I
was always jiggling.'' Even now, sitting at the table, his hand
drums its edge, then fools incessantly with a straw wrapper.
</P>
<P>
   When he was in seventh grade, the family moved to North
Caldwell, N.J. His father owned a hardware store in Verona, and
Chase worked there on Saturdays when he was growing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated doing it, naturally,'' he said. He made another
grimace. ``My father had quit his job as an engineer in the early
50s and opened this Main Street hardware store right when places
like E.J. Korvette were just beginning. It never really took off.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His mother always worked, Chase said. For the most part, she
spent her career with the telephone company, proofreading
directories. He half smiled. ``She had the ability to be in both
places at the same time,'' he said. ``She would say `I hate it' and
later say `I didn't say I hate it; I don't know where you got that
from.''' Which is very much like Livia Soprano, who Chase says
wields ``the tyranny of the weak.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They orchestrate a lot of disturbance and require a lot of
coddling and special attention just to get them to stop,'' he said.
``All anyone wants to do is give them what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is all bad, of course. What is his fondest memory of his
mother? ``I have lots of them,'' he said. ``Once she got me some
Ray Charles records for Christmas, which was not her kind of music
at all. I knew she'd gotten them and where she had hidden them and
one night I was drinking at my house with friends. I got them out
and played them. I felt so warm and appreciative. And she didn't
yell.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase says that his family was not involved in the Mafia, though
he adds, ``I was crazy about the Mafia since I was a kid.''
Watching ``The Million Dollar Movie'' helped. Even now, he can _
and does _ recite most of ``Public Enemy'' complete with a
description of camera angles. ``It blew my mind. It hooked me. I
don't know why, but it did.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems completely out of character that Chase has lived in Los
Angeles for the last 28 years. He has no tan, no real color in his
face at all. He is balding and his hair is gray. And rather than
preening about his new-found success, he doubts his good fortune,
scared somehow that it will be taken away. He is sure he is about
to contract ``a horrible illness.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it time to go back into therapy? He shrugged. The character
of Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco) reflects Chase's own
experience with a female therapist, though he says he saw ``three
or four men before that and they all did me some good.''
</P>
<P>
   One heavy-breathing speculation about ``The Sopranos'' is that
Tony (James Gandolfini), who is treated by Dr. Melfi, will have an
affair with her. Though Chase is careful not to divulge too much of
what will happen next season, his response to this is definite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ludicrous,'' he fumed. ``The hiding and shame is not what the
show's about. And the therapy would be ruined.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos'' goes back into production in July, and 13 new
episodes go on the air in January. The show is shot on location in
New Jersey, and at the Silvercup Studios in Astoria, Queens. It is
staff written, meaning Chase and three or four other writers work
together on ``beating out stories.'' Chase directs some episodes;
he also casts, edits and scores them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second year was never planned out,'' he said. When HBO
rescued the series, it had been rejected by the networks and Chase
couldn't see past the first season. ``What concerns me most now is
the noise from the outside world,'' he said. ``Can we keep this up?
Last year my feeling was only `we have nothing to lose.'''
</P>
<P>
   As for how many more seasons fans can hope for, Chase is
noncommittal. ``Given the life that Tony's in, it can't go on
forever,'' he said. ``Something has to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, he says he loves writing for this cast. ``As a
writer I usually start off in a defended position. For example, I
put three dots at the end of a sentence so it will trail off and
then the actor reading it ends the sentence. I used to think actors
were only there to ruin everything. They terrified me. I had a
sense with actors that they have all the fun, that they're less
responsible than the rest of us. It made me jealous. I came to it
late, but I see now that they're the best part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for directing, Chase said: ``It terrifies me. That first time
I directed, the Alfred Hitchcock show, I was so scared that the
night before I had thoughts of going to the Greyhound station and
leaving L.A. It felt like the time I was 11 and sprained my ankle
on a camping trip and went to visit my grandmother in Mount Vernon.
And my aunt had just had a baby and for some reason I wanted to
carry him. My ankle gave out and I dropped the baby. I ran out of
the house screaming. Directing felt like that. I felt lame with the
whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been anxious, fearful, competitive, envious and
angry,'' he went on matter-of-factly, talking about his drive to
succeed. ``When I'm on the set, though, I don't freak out. I say to
myself, `You know what, this looks like life, but it's not.
Whatever happens here isn't going to kill you.''' The grimace
finally slid into a smile. ``That's about the best I can do.''

RUSSIA ATTACKS U.N. SPECIAL COMMISSION FOR ENDANGERING IRAQIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Keeping pressure on an agency that Russia has
criticized for months, Moscow's representative here on Tuesday
accused the U.N. Special Commission responsible for disarming Iraq
of endangering Iraqis by leaving behind dangerous chemicals in its
Baghdad laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations were made as Russia requested a special meeting
of the Security Council, contending that there was a danger from
the chemicals. Richard Butler, the chairman of the embattled
inspection agency, assured Security Council members at the closed
meeting that the minute quantities of toxic chemicals being stored
in a laboratory in the Canal Hotel pose no danger to Iraqi
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   But Sergey Lavrov, Russia's representative, said afterward that
Butler would present a written report on the matter to the council.
</P>
<P>
   Several diplomats described the Russian accusations about the
laboratory as part of a broader struggle over the fate of the
Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, and what policy the United
Nations should pursue toward Iraq and its intransigent leader,
Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, China and France want the commission replaced and
economic sanctions against Iraq lifted.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain, by contrast, argue that the
commission, or an equally tough successor, must return to Iraq to
conduct inspections. And they say that sanctions imposed on Iraq by
the United Nations after the Persian Gulf war should not be lifted
until Iraq has fulfilled its commitments to the council to give up
nuclear, biological, chemical and other weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said that Butler told council members that the
inspectors' laboratory was equipped with sensitive machines to
analyze chemical compounds, as well as a room for packaging
biological agents to send them abroad for analysis.
</P>
<P>
   He confirmed that minuscule samples of dangerous chemicals used
to calibrate the machines _ including sarin, VX and tabun _ were
stored in the laboratory, which was sealed when the inspectors left
in December. In addition, diplomats said, the lab held about 750
milliliters of mustard agent, or the equivalent of a wine bottle,
which the commission had retrieved from Iraqi shells and other
munitions.
</P>
<P>
   The equipment and chemical samples were left behind when Iraq's
lack of cooperation with the commission led to American and British
bombing raids, which, in turn, led Iraq to end all cooperation with
the inspection teams.
</P>
<P>
   With the onset of summer and prospective power shortages, Butler
and senior officials had privately discussed the fate of the
laboratory with senior aides to Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
had asked their help in returning to the facility to retrieve the
samples and equipment and to close it down.

<P>
   AGUA PRIETA, Mexico _ When Martina Toscano Quiroz gave three of
her seven children up for adoption, her main goal, she said, was to
give them a chance for a better life.
</P>
<P>
   She is a single mother who earns less than $40 a week as a
cleaning woman in this dusty town on the Arizona-Mexico border. Her
home is a fly-infested shack with dirt floors and walls patched
together from scraps of wood.
</P>
<P>
   But, she acknowledged, her decisions were not entirely noble.
The lawyer who took her children to live with middle class families
in New York made promises so enormous, she said, that it was as if
he had offered her the stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he would build me two rooms with new tin for the
roof and strong brick walls,'' she said. ``And he told me he would
build me a bathroom with a toilet and a faucet.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Toscano, 30, never got her new house. She said the lawyer,
Mario Manuel Reyes Burgueno, took her daughters _ ages 8, 4 and 2 _
and then told her he could only give her a few hundred pesos for
food.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Reyes and two women on New York's Long Island, Arlene
Lieberman and Arlene Reingold, were arrested and charged with
running a cross-border baby-smuggling ring. The government says
they sold Ms. Toscano's children and at least 14 others to couples
in New York for as much as $22,000 each. Mrs. Liebermand and Mrs.
Reingold have declined to comment, while lawyers and friends of
Reyes have suggested that he was trying to help poor women and
their children.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the arrests, some of the adoptive parents said
they were the unwitting victims of a scheme that lured them into
expensive and illegal agreements and that took advantage of their
desperation to have children.
</P>
<P>
   But in this isolated patch of the U.S.-Mexican border, worlds
away from the comfortable homes of Long Island, the view of these
adoption agreements is even more complicated and tragic. Social
workers here said they counsel dozens of mothers like Ms. Toscano,
who are in such dire economic and social distress that they broker
their children for money or shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Several lawyers around the area, social workers said, have made
offers to buy children from poor mothers. But, the social workers
said, the lawyers usually renege on their part of the deals once
the children have been delivered to families in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had attorneys come here and offer me $100 for every
child I give to them for adoptions,'' said Eunicia Soto, who runs
an independent orphanage called Rancho Feliz at the eastern edge of
Agua Prieta. ``I tell them my children are not tomatoes for sale,
and that I never want to see them on my property again.''
</P>
<P>
   But such defiance can only go so far, and government officials
said that there is so much smuggling of drugs and humans across
this border _ a wide-open space divided, mostly, by barbed-wire
fencing _ that they cannot stop the trade. Smuggling has long been
a pillar of the economy and culture of Agua Prieta, with a
population of 130,000, and Douglas, its much-smaller sister city in
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, border patrol agents discovered a high-tech
tunnel, 30 feet beneath the desert floor, that had electric
lighting, concrete reinforcement and hydraulic lifts and had been
used to transport tons of cocaine into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And in recent years, as the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service has intensified its patrols along the border in El Paso to
the east and in San Diego in the west, a steady stream of illegal
immigrants has been funneled into the United States through
Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that as many as 1,000 illegal immigrants are
apprehended around Douglas each day, more than at any other INS
station along the 1,900-mile border between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real illegal universe,'' said Keoki Skinner, a
former journalist who runs juice bars on both sides of the border.
``There's so much illegal activity that goes on here that a lot of
people seemed numb to it. But the idea that babies are part of the
illegal traffic has really shocked a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like, things have gotten really bad if women are offering
to sell their babies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Martina Toscano, life was beyond bad. Short and pudgy and
with a worn, tan face that makes her look much older than her age,
Ms. Toscano said she moved to Agua Prieta 15 years ago from a small
village some 100 miles away. There was no work in her village, she
said, so she and her brother moved to the border to work in the
factories known as maquiladoras, which are owned by companies in
the United States. Within two months of moving here, she said, she
was pregnant with her first child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted a husband and a family,'' she said. ``I met a man who
offered to marry me and take care of me, so I gave myself to him.''
</P>
<P>
   But after the baby was born, the child's father abandoned Ms.
Toscano, and her mother moved to town to help her take care of the
child. But two years later came another man with promises, and
another baby was born. Then another man and another.
</P>
<P>
   After her sixth child was born, Ms. Toscano said, she met a
woman who offered to help place some of the children for adoption
in the United States. Ms. Toscano said she refused. But on the next
day, a tall, broad man knocked on her door.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time she had met Mario Reyes, she said. His
words, she said, hit her like stones.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `Look at how you live,''' she recalled. ``He told
me that my children could have better lives in the United States.
He promised that he would find them nice families who would love
them and send them to school.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she yelled at Reyes, telling him that he had no right
to judge the way she lived; that she did the best she could to
provide for her children and that they were comfortable in their
lopsided shack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he told me that if I gave him my children, he would help
me to live better,'' she said. ``He told me he would build me two
rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Reyes took two of Ms. Toscano's children: 8-year-old Flor
Azucena and 4-year-old Zoitza. He promised that the two girls would
be placed together in the same home, she said, and that their
adoptive parents would send photographs and updates on how the
girls were adjusting.
</P>
<P>
   But the girls were separated almost immediately, she said. Flor
Azucena went to the home of John and Rosalie Liberto in Suffolk
County, on Long Island. Zoitza's whereabouts remain unknown.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, she said, Reyes sent Ms. Toscano's 2-year-old
daughter, Gabriela, to live with the Libertos.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Liberto said in an interview that she and her husband paid
Reyes, Ms. Lieberman and Ms. Reingold more than $50,000 for
Gabriela and Flor Azucena, whom they called Nicole.
</P>
<P>
   ``With that money I could have built a mansion and 10
bathrooms,'' Ms. Toscano scowled. ``But I am still here, living in
filth.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Flor Azucena's American parents agreed to send her
back to Agua Prieta because she missed her mother so badly.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Liberto cried when she was asked why she agreed to let Flor
Azucena go. The decision, she said, arose from memories of growing
up poor and being sent every year to a summer camp in Pennsylvania.
It was the most beautiful place she had ever seen, Mrs. Liberto
said. But after a few days, she recalled, she was crying and
pleading to go home. ``A family bond is something you cannot
break,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had to send her to her mother,'' she said of Flor
Azucena. ``After she left, you would have thought there was a death
in the family. It was one of the only times I ever saw my husband
cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Flor Azucena, sitting on the dank double bed she shares with two
of her siblings in Agua Prieta, described her Long Island parents
as kind and loving. But, she said, ``I wanted to be with my
mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Showing pictures to a visitor, she recalled her time in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is my bedroom,'' she said, pointing to a photograph of
her sitting on a bed with a fluffy, flowered comforter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is me at my aunt's baby shower,'' she said, looking at a
picture of herself wearing a silvery velvet dress, with a shiny
headband in her hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my best friend,'' she said, showing a photo of herself
standing in a tight embrace with a freckle-faced red-headed girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my mom and dad,'' she said, stopping the show for a
moment to gaze at a picture of the Libertos.
</P>
<P>
   Soon to turn 11, Flor Azucena looks almost nothing like the
soft, confident girl in the photos. Her complexion is uneven, her
hair is tangled and as she speaks, she stares at the ground.
</P>
<P>
   She does not go to school here, she said, because of fights she
has had with other children. So while her mother is at work, she
spends her days watching programs on an old television set and
playing on the field of dust outside her house with her three
siblings: 12-year-old Aurelia, who also does not go to school,
4-year-old Edgar and 1-year-old Ameirani. A 15-year-old brother
lives with Ms. Toscano's mother elsewhere in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The family's plight is not uncommon, said Ms. Soto, of Rancho
Feliz. She organizes child-care workshops for single women in town
who do not earn enough money to support their children. Some of the
women, she said, turn to prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   In the most desperate cases, she said, mothers give up their
children for money or other things. One of her clients, she said,
had given away her baby so that she could get electricity installed
in her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of things are not common, but they do happen,''
Ms. Soto said. ``When I work with these mothers, my main message to
them is that they do not have to give their children away in order
to survive. They can make it, if they try. And I tell them that I
will help them.''
</P>
<P>
   That message kept Guadalupe Serrano's family together. Ms.
Serrano, 34, a mother of four, said she was a recovering drug
addict who used to support her habit with prostitution. Two years
ago, she said, she was approached by a lawyer who offered her
$10,000 for her toddler. Ms. Serrano refused to name the lawyer,
but she said it was not Reyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me that she would have a good life and that people in
the United States wanted children so much that they are willing to
pay a lot of money,'' Ms. Serrano recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ms. Serrano works at Rancho Feliz and raises her children
in a cottage there. Speaking about her daughter, Olivia, who is now
4, she said, ``I would have given her away.'' But Ms. Soto would
not let her: ``She made me feel ashamed for thinking about it,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Toscano, however, has no regrets about sending her children
to the United States. Although she would like to know more about
Zoitza, she regularly gets pictures from the Libertos of her
daughter, Gabriela.
</P>
<P>
   ``The life they have there is better than what they could have
here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Flor Azucena, staring at the ground, nodded in agreement.

<P>
   The absurdist view of history, the version that probably makes
the most sense in the age of Monicagate and the Washington follies,
suggests that it's people's little quirks and kinks that make big
things happen. Modern wars and coups are really the products of
mood swings and temper tantrums.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos,'' the groundbreaking HBO series that begins
reruns of its first 13 episodes on Wednesday at 9 p.m., subscribes
to this absurd view. Ruffled pride, paranoia and childish score
settling, rather than any grand plan, determine its characters'
fates.
</P>
<P>
   Take Livia Soprano, an ominous matriarch who subtly coerces
Junior, her mobster brother-in-law, to take out a contract on the
life of his rival, her son Tony. Why would a mother do such a
thing? Out of paranoia and spite, it turns out.
</P>
<P>
   On learning that Tony has been seeing a psychiatrist, she is
seized with the certainty that he spends his therapy sessions
denouncing her. As for Junior: When his girlfriend boasts in a nail
salon of Junior's prowess at oral sex, the news filters back to
Tony, who ribs his uncle about bedroom etiquette that Tony and his
macho cronies scorn as unmanly. Junior's humiliation deepens the
potentially murderous breach between uncle and nephew.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of 13 hours, these accumulated conflicts have
the force of Greek tragedy. Or is it a Chekhov comedy replayed in
the profanity-littered argot of New Jersey hoodlums? ``The
Sopranos'' is often funny, but the laughter it elicits doesn't come
from one-liners but from a deeper recognition of the screaming
little baby inside every grown-up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos,'' more than any American television in memory,
looks, feels and sounds like real life. Watch any episode and
you're likely to come away with the queasy feeling of having
consumed a greasy slice of late-90s America with its surreal
mixture of prosperity and brutishness.
</P>
<P>
   Tony, a northern New Jersey mob boss in his early 40s, isn't an
exotic evil king holed up in a fortified stone castle. He is a
middle-class family man who, except for his occupation, is pretty
much like the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos'' sustains its hyper-realism with an eye and ear
so perfectly attuned to geographic details and cultural and social
nuances that it just may be the greatest work of American popular
culture of the last quarter century.
</P>
<P>
   It was 25 years ago that the second of Francis Ford Coppola's
``Godfather'' movies was released. Together with its 1972
forerunner, it brought a new and deeper strain of tragic realism
into American culture. ``The Sopranos'' carries ``The Godfather's''
epic themes into the present, turning tragedy into comedy and vice
versa.
</P>
<P>
   This show's greatness lies in its creation of at least a dozen
indelible characters whom we come to know as intimately as our best
friends. At the center looms James Gandolfini's Tony, a huggable
hairy-shouldered grizzly bear of a man who cherishes his family,
watches the History Channel and blows off steam by pumping iron in
the basement of his fancy New Jersey home.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the blue one day, Tony begins suffering devastating panic
attacks. When it's discovered there's nothing physically wrong with
him, he begins seeing Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco), a local
psychiatrist recommended by the doctor who lives next door.
</P>
<P>
   There are essentially two Tonys. One is a mobster involved in
theft, loan-sharking, drugs and corrupt unions. This Tony takes
brutal pleasure in beating up and killing people who cross him. The
other Tony is a straitlaced family man who frets that his two
teen-age children have discovered he isn't really in ``waste
management,'' as he claims.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Tony who flares up when his daughter mentions sex at
the dinner table and announces that in his house it is still 1954.
Yet this devoted family man is also part owner of a topless bar and
has a girlfriend who is a Russian prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal Tony and the righteous Tony become grotesquely
connected after a soccer coach in his daughter's high school
impregnates one of her friends. The moralistic Tony goes ballistic.
The criminal Tony considers enlisting his cronies to carry out a
savage act of vigilante justice.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Marchand's Livia is as duplicitous and complicated as her
son. This 70-year-old termagant, who may or may not be suffering
from early-stage Alzheimer's, turns on Tony after he moves her out
of her house (for her own protection) to a luxurious retirement
complex.
</P>
<P>
   Livia, whose bitterness goes bone-deep, sees her son's
generosity as an unforgivable betrayal. Tony, she announces, has
dumped her into a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   Like Gandolfini and Ms. Marchand, Edie Falco (as Tony's loyal,
sharp-tongued wife, Carmela), Ms. Bracco and Michael Imperioli (as
Christopher Moltisanti, Tony's dumb, hotheaded nephew, who itches
to be a ``made'' member of the Mafia) have the roles of a lifetime
in the series.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, ``The Sopranos,'' rather than the wobbly,
histrionic ``Godfather, Part 3,'' is the real sequel to Coppola's
early-70s masterpieces, which made the modern Mafia a dark metaphor
for the immigrant experience and upward mobility in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos'' pays overt homage to the ``Godfather'' movies
with dramatic techniques like crosscutting between scenes of
extreme violence and domestic warmth, and interspersing the
narrative with semihallucinatory flashbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The thugs, especially Christopher, are so entranced with the
mystique of the ``Godfather'' movies that they quote (and sometimes
misquote) its dialogue. Christopher desperately aspires to the
imperial glamour of Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, and one episode
finds him working on an inept screenplay about mob life and
fantasizing a Hollywood career as a writer and actor.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as it owes to ``The Godfather,'' ``The Sopranos''
also refutes the towering solemnity of the Coppola films. Tony and
his pals have none of the royal demeanor of ``The Godfather's''
kingpins. Most are crude, bigoted, semiliterate boors who seem out
of place in the contemporary world.
</P>
<P>
   The underworld in ``The Sopranos'' is strictly small potatoes,
and it's fading. Tony, who's smarter than his colleagues,
recognizes that this seamy little world with its grim code of
loyalty is obsolescent. The Corleones in ``The Godfather'' were
made of sterner stuff. Even in their worst moments, they wouldn't
dream of taking their anxieties to a shrink.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the finest scenes in ``The Sopranos'' take place in Dr.
Melfi's office. Ms. Bracco's coolheaded psychiatrist drops all the
right buzzwords, prodding her client toward insights into his
childhood and his relationship with his parents, and dispensing
Prozac and Lithium when needed.
</P>
<P>
   Her give-and-take with Tony may be the most realistic depiction
of psychotherapy ever depicted in a mainstream movie or television
show. Tony even develops a classic case of transference (drawn out
in eerie, erotic dream sequences) in which he briefly imagines he's
in love with Dr. Melfi.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Sopranos'' ultimately demystifies psychotherapy as
much as it demystifies the world of ``The Godfather.''
Psychotherapy proves useful for Tony, but it hasn't the slightest
impact on his criminal character.
</P>
<P>
   In forcing us to empathize with a thug whom we watch committing
heinous acts, ``The Sopranos'' evokes a profound moral ambiguity.
One of the series' most haunting moments finds Tony's teen-age
daughter, Meadow, crouched on the stairs furtively watching her
parents remove guns and cash from a hiding place in preparation for
an imminent raid by federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   How does a nice middle-class teen-ager deal with the fact that
her adored father is a thief and a killer? In the series' most
poignant moment, she bluntly inquires, ``Dad, are you in the
Mafia?'' during a car trip to Maine, where she and Tony are
visiting colleges. Tony fudges a response that she takes as
confirmation, and shortly afterward slips off to murder an FBI
informant he happens to see at a gas station.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos'' walks a fine line. As much as it banalizes its
mobsters, it refuses to trivialize their viciousness. Tony's
brutality is all the more disturbing because it erupts from within
a social framework of apparent normalcy. That framework includes a
devout young priest, who like Dr. Melfi, smoothly sidesteps the
deeper moral issues of Tony's life.
</P>
<P>
   The closest he comes to admitting evil is during a therapy
session in which he offers the lame excuse that what he does is no
worse than a businessman illegally dumping toxic waste. Isn't that
how we all get by without tearing ourselves to pieces? All values
are relative, aren't they? And besides the other guy is worse. As
Tony Soprano would put it in his best macho swagger, ``You do what
you gotta do.''

 NEW YORK: their client.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since much of the trading at online brokerages represents an
increase in activity, traditional firms are not seeing declines in
their business. But their growth is far slower than that of firms
like Schwab and E(STAR)Trade.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Solotar, a brokerage stock analyst at Donaldson Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette, said, ``Online trading raises a new threat, but the
retail brokerage business is still extraordinarily profitable.''
Even so, she said Merrill was risking some medium-term profits to
increase its growth rate. As customers move from full commission to
the discount program, she predicted that Merrill's profits could be
cut by as much as 10 percent in two years.
</P>
<P>
   And she expressed skepticism that people would choose Merrill
simply as a discount broker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most likely, the Merrill Lynch client will continue to use the
services of a financial consultant, but they may also decide to do
some trading online,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the full-service brokers, including Merrill, are hoping
that Internet trading will shift clients from per-trade commissions
to flat annual fees. They have been offering these so-called wrap
accounts for more than a decade, but the appeal has been limited.
For example, only 2 percent of Merrill's customers use its previous
flat-fee account.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy to see this as the beginning of the death knell
of transaction pricing,'' Komansky said. ``It will eliminate the
last vestiges of the perception that there exists a conflict
between the client and the broker. Under the new structure, the
broker will get compensated the same for saying, `No, don't do
that,' as for executing a trade.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Solotar, the analyst, said she did not have high hopes
for the flat-fee account, because ``the fee-based accounts are very
profitable for Merrill, but unless you are a very active trader
they don't make much sense for the client.''
</P>
<P>
   Though analysts said Merrill's entry might also cause trouble
for discount brokerages, David Pottruck, co-chief executive of
Schwab, said he was not worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that Merrill Lynch dropping their prices to match
Schwab is an endorsement of our value in the marketplace,''
Pottruck said. ``We've been competing successfully with
lower-priced discount brokers for years. Now we are competing with
a very large new discount broker that has the same price we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwab has been moving to differentiate itself from cheaper
competitors, like E(STAR)Trade, by offering more advice. Currently
its telephone service representatives will recommend which mutual
funds clients should buy. Within a year, Pottruck said, it will
make buy and sell picks for individual stocks as well.
</P>
<P>
   Cotsakos of E(STAR)Trade was similarly dismissive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are late to the party, and there is nothing new here,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   What was new with E(STAR)Trade Tuesday was a $1.8 billion
acquisition of Telebanc Financial Corp., which offers banking over
the telephone and the Internet. Cotsakos said the company hopes to
combine Telebank's deposit products with its own brokerage service
to create a one-stop online financial marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   The price is astoundingly high by traditional measures.
E(STAR)Trade is paying some $25,000 for each of Telebank's 70,000
customers. That's more than the average customer has on deposit.
</P>
<P>
   Cotsakos said that since E(STAR)Trade's stock is even more
highly valued than Telebank's stock, the deal will nonetheless
increase the company's earnings per share. Moreover, he said that
the principal purpose of the acquisition was to gain access to
products that E(STAR)Trade can sell to its existing customers.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham agreed that the deal is sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't justify this on the ground of the accounts
E(STAR)Trade acquired,'' he said. ``What they got was a nine-month
head start in brining banking products to the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Brokerage executives, however, expressed skepticism that banking
products would produce much value for E(STAR)Trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The classic banking business that serves the mass market is
not a very good business,'' said Pottruck of Schwab. ``The margins
are small and it earns a low PE ratio.''

NEW MEASUREMENT SUGGESTS UNIVERSE IS YOUNGER THAN BELIEVED 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Using an array of radio telescopes stretching more
than 5,000 miles from Hawaii to the Virgin Islands, astronomers
have made what they say is the most accurate measurement ever of
the distance to a galaxy far beyond the Milky Way _ 23.5 million
light-years from here to a prominent galaxy in the constellation
Ursa Major, the Great Bear.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists said the measurement, announced here on Tuesday at a
meeting of the American Astronomical Society, raised serious
questions about the precision of recent estimates of the expansion
rate and age of the universe, including those reported last week by
astronomers using data from the Hubble Space Telescope.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings appeared to expose a possible shortcoming in
the basic galactic distances used in previous calculations of the
rate at which space and time are expanding from the explosive
moment of cosmic creation in the theoretical Big Bang. If the
galaxy measurement is correct, the universe is about 15 percent
smaller _ hence 15 percent younger _ than calculated on the basis
of the Hubble telescope data. That previous estimate put the age of
the universe at between 12 billion and 14 billion years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're questioning whether their ruler is really a foot long''
and not 10 or 11 inches, said Dr. James Moran, a member of the
radio astronomy team from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for
Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   If cosmic distances have been measured inaccurately and the
universe is indeed younger than previously estimated, it would
cause consternation among cosmologists. Any age much less than 12
billion years would again raise the troubling paradox of a universe
seeming to be younger than its oldest stars.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Herrnstein of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory
in Socorro, N.M., who conducted most of the research, observed the
motion of gas orbiting the center of the galaxy NGC 4258, also
known as Messier 106. After first clocking the orbital velocity of
the gas and then measuring shifts in the positions of bright
water-vapor clouds in the gas, he applied high-school trigonometry
to calculate the distance to the galaxy _ and establish what may be
a more accurate scale for estimating cosmic distances.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most precise distance measured to a remote
galaxy,'' he said at a press conference on Tuesday. The discrepancy
between his results and previous distance scales, he added, ``is
statistically significant and it's very intriguing.''
</P>
<P>
   After hearing the report, Dr. Wendy L. Freedman of the Carnegie
Observatories in Pasadena, Calif., who led the Hubble telescope
team measuring the cosmic expansion rate, said the new technique
was ``a big step forward in distance measurements.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Freedman acknowledged, as she had in reporting her team's
results last week, that the largest uncertainty in her calculations
stemmed from extrapolating galactic distances based on distances to
the nearby Large Magellanic Cloud, which have been measured at
170,000 light-years away. This measurement was based primarily on
observations of Cepheid stars, objects of known intrinsic
luminosity that have acted as cosmic mileposts this century.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Freedman was not changing her expansion-rate estimates.
``I would be happier seeing half a dozen such galaxy measurements
before we say anything,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Herrnstein's team said they might be able to make
similar measurements to two more galaxies in another year or two.
But finding candidate galaxies with favorable dynamic conditions
has not been easy. Of 700 galaxies studied, no more than 22 exhibit
the observable conditions required.
</P>
<P>
   For the measurements, astronomers used the Very Long Baseline
Array, a system of 10 identical dish-shaped 82-foot-diameter
antennas observing simultaneously and combining their data to give
them the viewing power equivalent to a 5,000-mile-wide telescope.
The array can thus produce detailed images of objects emitting
radiation in radio wavelengths. The central complex in the network
is on a broad desert plain outside Socorro.
</P>
<P>
   What made the NGC 4258 galaxy a good place to measure was the
presence in its inner gaseous disk of masers, which Moran called
``nature's gift to radio astronomy.'' Masers are bright beacons of
radio emissions, amplified as they pass through clouds of water
vapor. Astronomers tracked shifts of these masers as they moved
with the rotating disk of gas surrounding the powerful
gravitational mass, or black hole, at the center of the galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers likened such fine-scale tracking to measuring an
angle one ten-thousandth the width of a human hair _ held at arm's
length. The large array of radio telescopes, Moran said, ``is the
only instrument in the world that could do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous measurements of distances to NGC 4258, using the
standard Cepheid technique, yielded results of 27 million to 29
million light-years. The radio telescope team said its estimate of
23.5 million light-years was accurate to within 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, scientists said, the new findings showed that
the expansion rate and age of the universe are still open issues in
cosmology.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Merrill Lynch, which grew to be the nation's top
retail brokerage house through an army of 14,000 stock brokers
mixing advice with salesmanship, bent to the pressures of online
competition Tuesday, announcing that it would add a low-cost
service for people who want to trade on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Like leading firms in many industries, Merrill has been
struggling to find a way to compete with cheaper online upstarts.
From bookstores to travel agencies, companies must decide how much
to risk their existing large and profitable businesses in order to
do battle with small, money-losing but rapidly growing Internet
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Merrill held the line, arguing that customers would
be willing to pay its higher fees in return for superior service
and in-depth analysis. But ultimately it decided that Internet
trading was neither a fad nor a small segment of the market.
Indeed, now one in every seven stock trades in the United States is
performed over the Internet, according to Credit Suisse First
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in September, Merrill, which now typically charges $80
to $100 for an average trade, will let customers trade online for
$29.95, matching Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., the largest brokerage firm
on the Internet. But those customers will not get access to
research or guidance from a broker. Alternately, customers can pay
an annual fee of at least $1,500 for unlimited free trading and
advice, either online or through a broker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could see just by observing the growth of Schwab's asset
base that there was a segment of the market that wants to use
technology and only technology,'' said David Komansky, the chairman
of Merrill. ``And it became clear to us we had to disaggregate our
services and price competitively.''
</P>
<P>
   While a few of the other traditional full-service brokerage
firms have introduced online trading in one form or another,
analysts say that most of them will have to go much further to
match Merrill, along with Schwab and the online brokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This puts a lot of pressure on other full-service firms to
respond in kind,'' said Bill Burnham, an electronic-commerce
analyst at Credit Suisse. ``Merrill is two years late to the game
but you have to hand it to them, they didn't get half pregnant.
They looked at Schwab and said if you can't beat them, join them.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill has gone beyond what the other full-service brokers have
done and invited its clients to have both full-service accounts and
discount Internet trading accounts at the same time, with trades
from all of them reported on one statement. There are two other
full-service firms with low-cost Internet units, Donaldson Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, but they have separated
their Internet units from their full-service operations.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill considered a separate Internet unit as well, but decided
it needed to reach out to its existing customers because an
increasing number of them had already opened a separate account to
try online trading on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it will be the rule that people use multiple
forms of accounts with us,'' said Komansky.
</P>
<P>
   A few other full-service firms, like Prudential Securities,
offer Internet trading, but only as part of the more expensive
flat-fee accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest losers from all of this may not be the brokerage
firms but the brokers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about E-trade saying, `Boot your broker,''' said
Christos Cotsakos, the chairman of E(STAR)Trade group, a big online
broker. ``This is Merrill booting their own brokers.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill argues that while some brokers may lose business in the
short run, the move is necessary to attract a new generation of
clients for the firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run this makes their life easier, but I'm certain
as we speak many of them have apprehensions,'' Komansky said. The
brokers, he said, ``will still do very well so long as they are
willing to provide value added for their client.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Since much of the trading at online brokerages represents an
increase in activity, traditional firms are not seeing declines in
their business. But their growth is far slower than that of firms
like Schwab and E(STAR)Trade.
</P>

   And she expressed skepticism that people would choose Merrill

</P>

   ``Most likely, the Merrill Lynch client will continue to use the

to flat annual fees. They have been offering these so-called wrap
accounts for more than a decade, but the appeal has been limited.
For example, only 2 percent of Merrill's customers use its previous
flat-fee account.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very happy to see this as the beginning of the death knell
of transaction pricing,'' Komansky said. ``It will eliminate the
last vestiges of the perception that there exists a conflict
between the client and the broker. Under the new structure, the
broker will get compensated the same for saying, `No, don't do
that,' as for executing a trade.''
</P>

   But Ms. Solotar, the analyst, said she did not have high hopes
for the flat-fee account, because ``the fee-based accounts are very
profitable for Merrill, but unless you are a very active trader
they don't make much sense for the client.''
</P>
<P>
   Though analysts said Merrill's entry might also cause trouble
for discount brokerages, David Pottruck, co-chief executive of
Schwab, said he was not worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that Merrill Lynch dropping their prices to match
Schwab is an endorsement of our value in the marketplace,''
Pottruck said. ``We've been competing successfully with
lower-priced discount brokers for years. Now we are competing with
a very large new discount broker that has the same price we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwab has been moving to differentiate itself from cheaper
competitors, like E(STAR)Trade, by offering more advice. Currently
its telephone service representatives will recommend which mutual
funds clients should buy. Within a year, Pottruck said, it will
make buy and sell picks for individual stocks as well.
</P>
<P>
   Cotsakos of E(STAR)Trade was similarly dismissive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are late to the party, and there is nothing new here,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   What was new with E(STAR)Trade Tuesday was a $1.8 billion
acquisition of Telebanc Financial Corp., which offers banking over
the telephone and the Internet. Cotsakos said the company hopes to
combine Telebank's deposit products with its own brokerage service
to create a one-stop online financial marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   The price is astoundingly high by traditional measures.
E(STAR)Trade is paying some $25,000 for each of Telebank's 70,000
customers. That's more than the average customer has on deposit.
</P>
<P>
   Cotsakos said that since E(STAR)Trade's stock is even more
highly valued than Telebank's stock, the deal will nonetheless
increase the company's earnings per share. Moreover, he said that
the principal purpose of the acquisition was to gain access to
products that E(STAR)Trade can sell to its existing customers.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham agreed that the deal is sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't justify this on the ground of the accounts
E(STAR)Trade acquired,'' he said. ``What they got was a nine-month
head start in brining banking products to the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Brokerage executives, however, expressed skepticism that banking
products would produce much value for E(STAR)Trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The classic banking business that serves the mass market is
not a very good business,'' said Pottruck of Schwab. ``The margins
are small and it earns a low PE ratio.''

AMERICA ONLINE TO BUY INTERNET MUSIC COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By AMY HARMON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pledging to make tuning in easier as it stakes a claim in a
growing market, America Online said on Tuesday that it would buy
two Internet music companies, Spinner Networks Inc. and Nullsoft
Inc., for a total of $400 million in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisitions by America Online, the largest Internet service
provider, underscore the growing popularity of playing and
listening to music over the Internet. Once limited to dedicated
music fans who were also technology buffs, it is expected to
increase significantly as the faster Internet connections that
enhance audio quality become more widely available over the next
few years.
</P>
<P>
   Spinner says its Internet radio site, Spinner.com, attracts 1.5
million listeners a month and broadcasts more than two million
songs a day from a library of 175,000 selections. Nullsoft makes
Winamp, the dominant software used to listen to music in MP3 format
over the Internet, and Shoutcast, which allows users to broadcast
MP3-encoded audio over the Web. About 5 million people have
downloaded Winamp, which is free, and Shoutcast serves as the
underpinning for several thousand homemade Internet radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Robert W. Pittman, president of America Online, said the company
would make both products easier to use. ``Today, if you want to use
Spinner or Winamp or Shoutcast, you have to do work,'' he said.
``For them to get this much traction gives us great confidence that
we can take the underlying products and give them a mass-market
reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Pittman said the new services would generate revenue through
advertising and through deals with vendors that sell goods and
services on America Online and would now be able to incorporate
music and audio into their electronic business more easily. He
added that the new audio capacities would be promoted with AOL
Plus, the broadband service that it is scheduled to begin selling
to some customers this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The company has said that it plans to create custom audio
services for its different online holdings, which include the Web
sites AOL.com and Netcenter, the online service Compuserve and the
online chat software ICQ. Plans for programming, which would also
be available on a new generation of consumer devices that America
Online plans to make, include sports events, Internet radio and
recorded music.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of Spinner is something of a departure for America
Online, which has recently steered away from creating its own
online programming. But analysts say the deals represent an
important recognition by the company, which has been criticized as
slow to address the anticipated demand for higher-speed access and
the services like audio and video that come with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making inroads into audio programming mind share right now is
of particular importance,'' said Mark Mooradian, an analyst at
Jupiter Communications. ``The technology is there. The trick is
tapping into the existing audience and building as quickly as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   America Online is far from alone in the effort to profit from
online audio. Competitors include Broadcast.com, an aggregator of
Internet audio, which the Internet portal Yahoo has announced plans
to buy, and the audio streaming software maker Realnetworks. In
addition, Microsoft and AT&AMP;T each distribute software that plays
MP3 music.
</P>
<P>
   But a recent survey of America Online subscribers _ the service
says it now has 17 million _ found that although a majority engaged
in no other activity while they were on line, about 15 percent said
they had the stereo turned on. ``If they're doing something else,
they're listening to music,'' Pittman said. ``We figured we'd let
them push a button and pick what they want to listen to.''

DRUG USED BY ATHLETES DOES NOT BUILD MUSCLE, STUDY FINDS
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a surprising new study, the drug Mark McGwire said he used on
his way to breaking baseball's home-run record, did not build
muscle but did increase the risk of heart disease, pancreatic
cancer and breast enlargement.
</P>
<P>
   The study of the drug, androstenedione, is the first of many
called for by the White House, by organized baseball and by the
medical profession because the use of the drug increased rapidly
after last year's acknowledgment by McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   The study also appears to have produced the first scientific
evidence on the safety and effectiveness of the drug, though it was
developed in East Germany in a government-sponsored athletic
program nearly 30 years ago, the researchers said. The research was
financed by Experimental and Applied Sciences of Golden, Colo.,
which distributes a product containing androstenedione.
</P>
<P>
   An editorial that accompanied the article, which was published
on Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association,
suggested that the federal government move quickly to consider
removing the drug from the market. Currently, it is sold legally
and without a prescription _ though it closely resembles anabolic
steroids, for which a prescription is required.
</P>
<P>
   There is thought to be little chance that the drug would be
taken off the market without further corroborative research, though
studies are being urgently pushed ahead at Harvard University and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Androstenedione, a synthetic form of a compound that naturally
occurs in the body but is converted to the male hormone
testosterone _ the body's major muscle builder _ caused none of the
expected increases in blood levels of testosterone and no enhanced
physical strength, the researchers said. Instead, they found that
it raised levels of the female hormone estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Elevated levels of estrogen in men, in heavy doses, has been
linked to increased risk of pancreatic cancer and breast
enlargement. The researchers could not explain why androstenedione
produced this effect. They also noted a significant lowering of
high-density lipoprotein, the good type of cholesterol that carries
plaque away from blood vessels and helps reduce cardiovascular
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Douglas S. King of Iowa State University, who led the study,
said in an interview, ``I find it quite shocking to see not the
thinnest of evidence backing the claims being made in this new
multimillion-dollar business.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry sources estimate that sales of the many companies now
making and distributing androstenedione will exceed a total of $100
million this year, up from annual sales of about $5 million, before
McGwire began driving baseballs into history.
</P>
<P>
   King and his colleagues enrolled 30 young men, ages 19 to 29, in
a random controlled trial for eight weeks. Twenty of the men were
put on an eight-week, resistance weight-training program; 10 of
them received 300 milligrams of the drug a day and 10 received a
placebo. Manufacturers generally recommend a dose of only 100
miligrams a day. The researchers found no difference in added
strength or added muscle mass between those in the group who took
the placebo and those who took androstenedione, nor did
testosterone levels differ.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the third group of 10 were each given one pill,
containing 100 milligrams of the drug, one day a week and and
checked for increases in blood-level testosterone every 30 minutes
for the next six hours; the next week each was randomly selected to
receive either another dose or a placebo, and their blood levels
were checked in the same way. That tested the claim of some
manufacturers that a 100 milligram dose increases testosterone
levels by 300 percent almost immediately, an effect they say lasts
three hours. The researchers found no testosterone increases in
this group.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gary I. Wadler, a clinical medicine professor at the New
York University School of Medicine, said the study ``was very
important in beginning the fill the gaps. Research must be done now
with much higher doses than those recommended _ we know much higher
doses are being used widely.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles E. Yesalis of Pennsylvania State University, an
authority on steroid abuse, who wrote the editorial accompanying
the Iowa article, said some advertisements for the product are
suggesting daily doses as high as 500 milligrams to 1200
milligrams.
</P>
<P>
   Wadler said the Iowa study reinforces the need for more research
on a new androstenedione products combining androstenedione and
other ingredients that are being rushed to market. ``Almost no
scientific research has been done on these products,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Only modest use was made of the drug, introduced in the United
States three years ago, before McGwire's statement that he used
androstenedione, which he has said he still uses. Major League
Baseball has not banned it, though other sports associations have.
Anyone can buy it as a result of drug deregulation laws enacted in
Congress in 1994, and no action has been taken against it until
now.
</P>
<P>
   The industry argues that in the form in which it is sold, it is
not harmful. Medical authorities have strongly disagreed, saying
that once in the body it converts to a hormonelike steroid, like
estrogen, which in too great a supply can be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Many health experts have expressed concern, Yesalis said, that
``its use by sports heroes would encourage youngsters to use this
steroid hormone.'' Indeed, the White House's Office of National
Drug Control Policy said use among young people has increased
fivefold since McGwire's disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Experimental and Applied Sciences distributes Andro-6, which
contains androstenedione and one of the study's co-authors is the
company's manager of research and development, Dr. Matthew V.
Vukovich.
</P>
<P>
   In answer to questions about the study and whether EAS would
continue to market Andro-6, the company issued a statement saying:
``EAS finds the research from Iowa State University to be very
interesting and suggests it be taken into account by anyone
considering taking androstenedione. Because it is difficult to draw
conclusions from any one study, EAS is committed to continued
support of additional research on androstenedion.''

NEW DIET DRUG SELLS WELL, BUT IT DIDN'T SET A RECORD

<TEXT>
<P>
   After one month on the market, the diet drug Xenical, made by
Hoffmann-La Roche, will not go down as the most successful new
pharmaceutical in history, but analysts remain confident that it
will become a best seller.
</P>
<P>
   Xenical, which the Food and Drug Administration approved in late
April, accounted for 96,485 prescriptions during its first four
weeks on the market. By contrast, Viagra, Pfizer's impotency pill,
and Celebrex, Monsanto's arthritis drug, had prescriptions in their
first months of 367,857 and 150,113, respectively, according to IMS
Health, an industry consultant. The introductions of Viagra and
Celebrex were two of the most successful in pharmaceutical history.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Xenical did not topple Viagra, analysts insist that
its first weeks of sales are stellar, allowing it to build momentum
as more doctors become comfortable with how it works.
</P>
<P>
   After Xenical was introduced, the drug received much fanfare as
a fad drug. Analysts now expect sales to increase as Hoffmann-La
Roche combats the fad image by telling doctors about the drug's
therapeutic advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that momentum for Xenical not peak too early,''
said Viren Mehta, a partner at Mehta Partners, a biopharmaceutical
research firm. ``You want to have an educated group of physicians
about the drug. Hoffmann-La Roche has studies under way that point
out the science of the drug.''
</P>
<P>
   From its first week on the market, Xenical has sparked
controversy. A new kind of drug, it blocks the body's absorption of
dietary fat. Despite its new mechanism, Xenical brought
recollections of fen-phen, a weight-loss drug cocktail that was
removed from the market in 1997 over concerns that it caused heart
valve damage.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to that worry, critics noted that many patients who used
Xenical lost modest amounts of weight _ typically 5 percent to 10
percent of their body weight _ and risked some messy side effects,
including fecal incontinence, if they did not reduce their fat
intake.
</P>
<P>
   Xenical's case was further hurt by an immediate Internet market,
similar to the universal cyberspace availability of Viagra and
Propecia, Merck's hair loss pill. To overcome this shady beginning,
Hoffmann-La Roche has not offered Xenical samples to doctors.
</P>
<P>
   While some doctors remain critical of Xenical _ dismissing it
because it produces a loss of modest amounts of weight _ others are
becoming avid fans. Hoffmann-La Roche has 2,000 sales
representatives peddling the drug, and their message is apparently
taking hold in some hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at Xenical in treating obesity, it is important to
note that it does something that other diet drugs don't do,'' said
Dr. Louis Aronne, director of the Comprehensive Weight Control
Program at New York Hospital. ``You can use it to treat obese
people and not worry about it causing cardiovascular side effects.
A lot of obese patients have cardiovascular risks.''
</P>
<P>
   To promote Xenical's benefits further, Hoffmann-La Roche expects
to begin advertising it directly to consumers sometime in the third
quarter of 1999. The ads are expected to loft sales of Xenical,
which most analysts expect to hit $750 million to $1 billion at
their peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sales will be erratic,'' said Neil Sweig, an analyst with
Southeast Research Partners. ``But that's the market. People who
take this type of drug are never satisfied. They want the easy way
out to lose weight. In this market, there is not any loyalty
here.''

BUCHANAN SAYS GOP FOES ARE CLINTON-GORE CLONES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican presidential candidate Patrick J.
Buchanan on Tuesday declared the four leading GOP presidential
contenders virtual clones of President Clinton and Vice President
Al Gore because they support the president's policy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, brushing aside the Republican Party's ``11th
Commandment'' never to speak ill of fellow GOP candidates, said
Texas Governor George W. Bush, Elizabeth Dole, Senator John McCain
of Arizona, and Steve Forbes are ``virtual Xerox copies of
Clinton-Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   He cast himself as the antiwar candidate, saying the others have
backed various aspects of the NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia
while he sees no US national interests in Kosovo that warrant the
risk to our pilots and soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan threw his most pointed barbs at Bush, who held his own
news conference Tuesday in Texas to tout the accomplishments of the
state's just-finished legislative session.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that the long parliament known as the Texas Legislature
has adjourned and Governor Bush has emerged from his tutorials,
perhaps a great debate over America's destiny and role in the world
can now get underway,'' Buchanan said at the National Press Club
luncheon, drawing much laughter from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   The day seemed to mark a new phase in the presidential race,
with several candidates staking out the political turf they hope to
occupy throughout the summer, fall and winter.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who says he is still ``exploring'' a White House bid,
plans to visit the first-caucus state of Iowa and first-primary
state of New Hampshire starting next week. ``I understand polls and
expectations are out of sight,'' Bush said Tuesday. ``As my
daughter said, `Hey, Dad, you're not nearly as cool as they think
you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes is preparing to spend millions of dollars of his own
money on a new round of radio and television commercials that will
mark the first major advertising effort of the 2000 race.
</P>
<P>
   Former vice president Dan Quayle, meanwhile, said recently that
establishment Republicans are making a mistake with a ``rush to
judgment'' in support of Bush. Dole, meanwhile, is continuing to
cast herself as a moderate candidate, appearing on the Rosie
O'Donnell television show Tuesday in an effort to build on the
publicity she has received for supporting several gun control
measures.
</P>
<P>
   While Buchanan trails badly in the polls, as he did in 1992 and
1996, he has a track record of changing the race at crucial stages.
In his speech Tuesday, Buchanan described himself as the
``defending champion of the New Hampshire primary'' and predicted
this is the campaign he will break through for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   The speech was striking for its emphasis on Kosovo, with far
less discussion of the US economy. Unlike in 1996, when Buchanan
and his ``brigades'' made an issue of the languid economy in New
Hampshire, the country is continuing to prosper. The Granite State,
for example, had a 2.4 percent unemployment rate in April. With
such a hot economy, it is harder for Buchanan to argue that the
free-trade agreements he criticized in 1996 have wreaked the havoc
he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   While Buchanan still is critical of the trade deals with Mexico
and the World Trade Organization, the commentator is putting more
attention on Kosovo. Buchanan's strategy is to tie four of his top
competitors to the Clinton-Gore administration, while portraying
himself as the conservative alternative in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``All are good and able individuals, but all four endorsed the
president's decision to launch this war on Serbia,'' Buchanan said
about Bush, Dole, McCain, and Forbes. ``Mr. Bush, Mrs. Dole, and
Senator McCain endorse sending a United States Army to fight its
way into the Balkans to occupy Kosovo,'' while Forbes has called
for the arming of the Kosovo Liberation Army, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan said there is ``not now and there has never been any
vital American interest in whose flag flies over Pristina to
justify the loss of a single platoon of United States Marines.''
Buchanan instead suggested that Clinton seek an armistice with
Serbia to end the war.
</P>
<P>
   As for McCain's call for ground troops, Buchanan said, ``You do
not send 200,000 soldiers to rectify the blunders of those who
launched it.'' McCain two weeks ago said Buchanan was ``an eloquent
and a forceful advocate for an utterly wrongheaded view of the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   In another attack on the four Republican rivals, Buchanan said,
``If one of these wins the nomination, we risk a replay of 1992 and
1996, where both major parties will agree on most issues and a
pillow fight will ensue over some dinky tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan did not criticize candidates he said agree with him
about Kosovo and other key issues, including Quayle and Senator Bob
Smith of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes adviser Greg Mueller, who worked for Buchanan in 1996,
said Buchanan and most other candidates are trying to be the
alternative to Bush. Mueller, not surprisingly, offers an analysis
favorable to Forbes, suggesting Buchanan's time is past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what is forming is a Bush-Forbes race,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Forbes began his unusually early advertising blitz
Tuesday. Unlike his 1996 ads attacking GOP rivals, this round
emphasizes family values. A television spot called ``Time'' shows
how Forbes has changed his economic-focused message from the last
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a long run on prosperity, families are doing better,
unemployment is low, but something is still missing, and that is
time spent with families,'' Forbes says in the ad. The publisher
says he wants Americans to ``have time with their families. To once
again, truly enjoy life.''

WIESEL TOURS REFUGEE CAMPS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CEGRANE, Macedonia _ Elie Wiesel, the Holocaust survivor and
Nobel winner, began a three-day tour of refugee camps on Tuesday at
the request of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said the visit was designed to focus
attention on the moral argument that they say underpins NATO's
bombing campaign against Yugoslavia. Wiesel has spoken of the
Biblical injunction ``to not stand idly by.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiesel's visit to Macedonia, and later to Albania, stood in
contrast to the routine of congressmen, European diplomats and
celebrities briefly touring refugee camps for a momentary taste of
suffering. Spending three hours in the blistering sun engaging
refugees in simple but telling conversations, Wiesel, a professor
and moral philosopher, made an impassioned call for action.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not allow winter to set in here,'' he said as he
surveyed the sprawling camp that holds 40,000 refugees. ``We must
end this.'' But Wiesel found himself, like the administration,
citing a moral imperative to resist President Slobodan Milosevic,
while shying away from asking to intensify the war with a ground
invasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a military expert,'' he said. ``I can't make
statements about air power versus ground troops.''
</P>
<P>
   The visit received only spotty coverage from American news
organizations. Of the four major networks, only CNN did a piece on
Wiesel's visit. American officials said fading interest in the
Kosovo story is complicating their efforts to build a strong public
consensus on military action.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Reeker, a spokesman for the U.S. Embassy here, said
``People have lost focus on why we are doing what we are doing. You
need a person like Wiesel to keep your moral philosophy on track.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Macedonia Wiesel blazed a trail like few other visiting
dignitaries. While other delegations have traveled in long convoys
of armored Chevrolet Suburbans, Wiesel traveled in an ordinary
white van. His entourage, excluding aides sent by the
administration, consisted of a single friend. And instead of
engaging refugees in innocuous conversation, Wiesel, 70, asked
piercing questions, while refusing to compare what was happening in
Kosovo with the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in drawing analogies,'' he said. ``There were
no camps to receive us.''
</P>
<P>
   But he painstakingly elicited testimony from refugees about
atrocities they witnessed. He urged teachers to encourage their
students to write their tales, predicting that a great book
chronicling the exodus would be written one day by someone now
living in the camp.
</P>
<P>
   He asked one parent what he did to lull his traumatized young
children to sleep at night. ``Do you tell them stories? Do you sing
them lullabies?'' The man said he recited ``stories about home.''

<P>
   Wiesel, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986, stopped Barije
Redinica, 16, as she walked by in the camp. ``Tell me, what do you
think of when you wake up in the morning?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``That I will go home,'' Ms. Redinica said.
</P>
<P>
   After another refugee, Besim Piraj, described watching Serb
soldiers kill some of his acquaintances from his village in Kosovo,
Wiesel asked, ``What do you think of human beings who do that?''
Piraj said he believed no one ``who had a spirit'' could do such a
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Wiesel later said that he believed those who commit atrocities
are not sadists, but men who so completely rationalize their
actions that they believe they are doing the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   While avoiding specifics, he called for action in Kosovo. He
said that he saw life as a series of pivotal moments, and that the
refugee crisis is one of those moments.
</P>
<P>
   For Americans, he said, Kosovo is a ``moral war'' that
challenges its moral character.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging over Wiesel's visit was the phrase ``never again'' and
the nagging question of whether anything had changed 50 years after
the Holocaust. Wiesel insisted it had, saying Washington's response
in Kosovo was far better than the ambivalence it showed during the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   But he said Washington's action in Kosovo should have come far
earlier. If the West had moved against Milosevic a decade ago, he
said, the tragedy in Kosovo would have been prevented.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have foreseen Kosovo,'' he said. ``Why didn't we?''

MERRILL LYNCH BULLISH ON NET; ETRADE BUYS BANK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just as one of the financial world's old-line stalwarts took a
bold step into the future, a next-generation investment firm made
one leap further.
</P>
<P>
   The nascent battle for control over the money world's new
frontier, the Internet, heated up Tuesday, as Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.,
the nation's largest stock brokerage, said it would offer on-line
trading, and ETrade Group Inc., an Internet brokerage, announced it
was expanding into Web-based banking.
</P>
<P>
   Both moves reflect warp-speed changes in the financial services
world. Traditional money management companies are racing to decide
how they will adapt to the rise of electronic commerce, while hot
new firms, some simply virtual shops in cyberspace, are working to
build Web-based financial empires.
</P>
<P>
   Both moves are likely to spark similar changes at other
brokerages and banks, both mainstream and new-fangled. And both
moves underscore the drive among banks, brokerages, mutual fund
firms, and insurers to become all things to all customers by
offering ``one-stop'' financial shopping with a variety of products
and services.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a paradigm shift with the individual
investor,'' said Harvard Business School professor Samuel Hayes,
referring to the rise of an investing culture in which individuals
want to trade stocks and conduct other financial business on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``As consumers change, both banks and brokerages are having to
change their spots,'' Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   New York-based Merrill Lynch, the epitome of traditional,
old-world stockbroking, will offer its clients full on-line trading
beginning in December. The giant, which had dismissed Web traders
barely a year ago as a reckless aberration, now acknowledges it
cannot afford to ignore the fact that one in four retail stock
trades is now made on line.
</P>
<P>
   Matching the low costs pioneered by Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., the
nation's largest discount brokerage, Merrill will let its 5 million
customers buy or sell securities over the Internet for $29.95 a
trade. Alternatively, clients can pay a flat annual fee of $1,500
for unlimited trading. Merrill said it would also create an account
that would permit checking, savings, and investment activities
through the Internet, all with one monthly statement.
</P>
<P>
   The move portends a different world for Merrill's 16,000
wing-tipped, suspendered stockbrokers, who routinely earn
triple-digit commissions for each trade they execute. Now the
company's brokers will become more like modern financial advisers,
who are compensated on the basis of a client's investment returns,
and not on trading commissions. Merrill Lynch fell 8 3/4 to close
at 75 1/4 Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers wonder whether Merrill isn't moving too late.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Farkas, head of global financial services at consulting
firm Bain &AMP; Co., called the brokerage's announcement ``defensive, a
`me, too' move'' that follows, rather than preempts, the growth of
rival Web-based brokerages, which have captured a significant
amount of the on-line trading market in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be caught short as mainline money management houses turn
to the Internet, ETrade, the nation's second largest on-line
brokerage, will pay $1.8 billion in stock for TeleBanc Financial
Corp. of Arlington, Va., a Web-only bank with 11,000 accounts and
$2.6 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   ETrade's idea is to sell loans, credit cards, checking accounts,
and other traditional banking services over the Web, all through a
cash management account insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. Palo Alto, Calif.-based ETrade paid a 40 percent premium to
TeleBanc's closing price on Friday, a measure of how much the
successful on-line brokerage wants to be the nation's first virtual
financial services shop.
</P>
<P>
   While some traditional banks, like BankBoston Corp., have forged
ahead with successful on-line banking services, Internet-only banks
are a novel and unproven concept. There are barely a half-dozen
such banks that are FDIC-insured. The idea behind Web-only banks,
which compete by offering checking accounts earning more interest
than those at traditional banks, is that costs are lower because
they have bare-bones staffing levels and no branches or ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   ``ETrade's deal is the first shot in the battle to control
on-line banking,'' said e-commerce analyst Bill Burnham of Credit
Suisse First Boston. ``This will put the fear of God in traditional
banks, which are seeing barbarians at the gate.'' CSFB estimates
the number of on-line banking accounts rising to 9 million by 2000,
up from 5.5 million in 1998, and 2 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   While ETrade's acquisition of Telebanc is the first leap by an
on-line brokerage into Web-based banking, it is also a strange echo
of the past.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, ETrade is doing what Merrill Lynch did in the
1970s, when it revolutionized personal finance by introducing its
Cash Management Account, which allows clients to write checks,
charge purchases, manage investments, and conduct business via one
account.
</P>
<P>
   Other investment firms, notably Boston-based Fidelity
Investments, the nation's biggest mutual fund firm, have similar
products. But unlike ETrade and TeleBanc, most one-stop financial
providers still have a physical place of business to which a
customer can turn.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is impressed by ETrade's move, which is designed to
keep the firm in business as the pace of growth in on-line trading
slows. Boston-based Forrester Research Inc. said Tuesday that the
on-line brokerage was ``entering a no-man's land,'' in which
customers willing to bank on line still want a traditional
bricks-and-mortar bank behind their Web-based accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most consumers want a physical presence for making deposits
and getting cash,'' Forrester analyst James P. Punishill wrote in a
recent note. ETrade slipped 5 3/16 Tuesday to close at 39 5/16,
while shares in Telebanc rose 8 to close at 74 1/2, both on Nasdaq.

LOUISIANA: A TRADITION OF BASHING TRADITION  
 FLORIDA: TERM-LIMITS CROONERS ARE CHANGING TUNES  
 UTAH: GOP FROZEN AS HATCH WEIGHS RUN 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in 1996, Louisiana Republicans ignored the national party's
tradition of letting Iowa hold the first presidential caucuses and
scheduled Louisiana's caucuses first instead. The intent was to
grab some national attention for the Louisiana GOP, which like many
Republican Parties in the South was on the move. But the attention
gained was not what the party had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the cutting in front cause interstate party strife,
but the caucuses were a bust. Most major candidates ignored them,
lest they be punished later by Iowa voters, and the 20,000 voters
who took part ended up standing in line for hours because there
were only 42 caucus sites.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Louisiana GOP is talking about voting first again come
Election 2000, perhaps as early as Jan. 29, even if such an advance
date again causes party strife and leads many candidates to shy
away. (There is some thought about holding a primary rather than
caucuses, and thus taking on New Hampshire, which traditionally
holds the first presidential primary.)
</P>
<P>
   But whatever and wherever the possible interstate strife,
Louisiana party leaders hope in the early voting of Election 2000
to head off the bothersome delays that plagued the early voting of
Election 1996. How?
</P>
<P>
   The party's state Executive Committee has recommended that next
year's first-in-the-nation balloting be via the Internet, which in
itself would be a first in the nation. Party officials have
contacted computer and Internet specialists about ways to proceed,
including what steps to take to prevent voting fraud and how to
provide Internet access to party members who do not own computers.
</P>
<P>
   One possible access answer: Party members who own computers
could volunteer as ``block hosts'' and allow their homes or offices
to be designated official voting sites.
</P>
<P>
   Will it work?
</P>
<P>
   Like a number of top party members, State Rep. Charles D.
Lancaster Jr. of Metairie wants to give Internet voting a try.
``This is the best idea that I've seen in a couple of years,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of other party members have serious doubts.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. John L. Dardenne Jr. of Baton Rouge calls the
proposal ``www.bad-idea.com.''
</P>
<P>
   A final vote on the proposal will be taken by the party's State
Central Committee on June 12.
</P>
<P>
   TERM-LIMITS CROONERS ARE CHANGING TUNES
</P>
<P>
   Tillie Fowler was a champion of term limits when she served on
the City Council of Jacksonville, Fla., in the 1980s, proclaiming
often that no one should serve in the same public office longer
than eight years. Good as her word, when her eight years on the
council were up, in 1992, she ran for the House of Representatives,
proclaiming that she would serve there only four terms. ``Eight is
Enough'' was her campaign mantra.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   After seven years of representing Florida's 4th Congressional
District, Ms. Fowler, a popular conservative Republican, is having
some second thoughts _ to the delight of Republican leaders, the
despair of Democratic leaders and the disgust of leaders of the
term-limits lobby.
</P>
<P>
   She is not alone in this. Half a dozen or so other members of
Congress who made similar promises are also wavering. And in any
event, she says she will not make a final decision until the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   But in the for-what-it's-worth department, the other day she
filed a finance report with the Federal Election Commission, as
required by law, that showed she had taken in almost $500,000 in
campaign contributions from people who would like her to seek a
fifth term. She said she had not solicited a cent of the money and
therefore, she insisted, her political future was a ``nonissue'' at
this point.
</P>
<P>
   All of which led Paul Jacobs, the executive director of U.S.
Term Limits, an advocacy group, to comment:
</P>
<P>
   ``It leaves one wondering if anyone in Washington could even
define honesty, much less live by it.''
</P>
<P>
   UTAH GOP FROZEN AS HATCH WEIGHS RUN
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, asked fellow
Republican leaders in the state not to endorse any Republican
presidential hopeful until he had decided whether to become one of
those hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he says he has not made up his mind. But under quiet
pressure from those fellow Republicans, many of them supporters of
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, he says he is about to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's a long shot,'' Hatch told The Deseret News of Salt
Lake City last week. ``So if I do, it won't be an ego thing. I'd be
running because I'm worried about the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The talk in some Republican circles in Utah is that what Hatch
may have in mind is a favorite son candidacy, which might increase
his influence at the Republican National Convention, might spark
speculation about his vice-presidential potential and, at a
minimum, might give him a nice political boost going into a Senate
re-election campaign next year.
</P>
<P>
   His view of Bush?
</P>
<P>
   Hatch says he will probably support him if does not run himself.

NORTHWEST'S PROBLEMS WITH DWINDLING SALMON HEAD NORTH TO B.C. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, B.C. _ Threats to salmon runs along the coast of
British Columbia, particularly in fast-growing areas, have become
so severe they mirror those of the Pacific Northwest, a symposium
on Pacific fish habitat heard Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   While millions of sockeye salmon still swim far up the Fraser
River, other runs are rapidly declining as Canada's last frontier
is paved, subdivided, logged and farmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sense of urgency is greater in the Pacific Northwest than
it is here... But it is coming here,'' said John Fraser, a former
Canadian cabinet minister who is chairman of the newly created
Pacific Fisheries Resource Conservation Council. ``We've got to be
part of your solution,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The habitat conference in Vancouver, B.C., came as United States
and Canadian negotiators have privately reported progress in
breaking the five-year impasse over renewal of a fisheries treaty
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   The impasse has produced rare confrontations, notably the 1997
blockade of the Alaska ferry Malaspina by British Columbia
fishermen angry over Alaskans catching salmon bound for Canadian
rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Even if an accord is reached, however, Canada will need help in
solving a multiplicity of problems, many of its own making.
Fisheries enforcement is underfunded. Inadequate research has left
large gaps in knowledge of the condition of salmon runs,
particularly on British Columbia's central coast.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Puget Sound area, where governments at all levels are
working together to address the recent endangered species listing
of chinook salmon, Canada's national government and the government
of British Columbia have engaged in a prolonged, vicious feud.
</P>
<P>
   B.C. Premier Glen Clark has accused the federal government of
making ``treasonous'' concessions to the United States. Canadian
fisheries minister David Anderson has cut the provincial government
out of any role in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please, Canada and British Columbia, get together! It is our
last chance to protect habitat,'' said Vicky Husband, a leader of
the Sierra Club of British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   One major problem is shared by the two countries. The rapid
urbanization of Puget Sound, lower Vancouver Island and the lower
Fraser River valley has wiped out salmon streams on both sides of
the border.
</P>
<P>
   Two million people now live in the lower Fraser Valley.
``Twenty-eight percent of all salmon streams have simply
disappeared,'' said Otto Langer, chief habitat expert for Fisheries
and Oceans Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of alarm bells should be going off,'' Langer said. ``The
future seems to be one of urban sprawl all the way from Olympia to
Hope.'' (Hope is a town at the mouth of the Fraser River Canyon,
about 100 miles east of Vancouver.)
</P>
<P>
   Problems outlined with British Columbia's salmon runs include:
</P>
<P>
   _Vanishing coho: Recently caught by the millions, coho salmon
now are imperiled in all major British Columbia river systems. The
near-extinction of coho in the Fraser and Thompson rivers led to
severe fishing restrictions last year.
</P>
<P>
   _Signs of Sockeye decline: Sockeye will be abundant this summer
in the Chilko and Horsefly rivers, tributaries of the Fraser.
Elsewhere the picture is not so clear.
</P>
<P>
   A once-enormous sockeye run in Rivers Inlet along the coast has
vanished. The inlet has been heavily logged, but there have also
been indications of high mortality at sea.
</P>
<P>
   _Subdivisions along streams: The lower Fraser valley may have as
many as 4 million people by 2020. As it grows, guidelines for
protecting streams are widely ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``The development footprint in the lower Fraser valley has left
a devastating impact on most streams, many of which historically
supported, and some of which still support, viable salmon
populations,'' said a report from Fisheries and Oceans Canada.
</P>
<P>
   _The suffering Skeena: The Skeena River, in northern British
Columbia, has been the second most productive salmon stream on
Canada's west coast. But it is suffering. In trying to rebuild the
river, fisheries officials would like to see 1 million salmon
escape up the Skeena to spawn this year.
</P>
<P>
   But only about 600,000 fish will even approach the river, and
some will be caught in Alaskan waters north of Prince Rupert. The
Alaska catch is a major point of tension between the United States
and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Just north of the Skeena, Southeast Alaska's salmon fishery is
booming. Southeast Alaska-based fishing boats will take an
estimated 3 million sockeye this year. ``We're sitting pretty,''
according to a slide shown Tuesday by Alaska's Department of Fish
and Game.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Valentine, British Columbia's deputy fisheries minister,
took a pointed shot at Alaska. He blamed ``distant interception''
for problems in watersheds ranging from the Skeena south to the
Columbia River in Washington and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Canada has taken decisive measures, particularly in the last
year. It has imposed extensive restrictions on fisheries. Unlike
agencies in the United States, however, Fisheries and Oceans Canada
lacks the money even to monitor fish runs in remote places. A
U.S.-financed aid package is one of the rumored provisions of a
fish deal.
</P>
<P>
   Some 13,000 people have left British Columbia's fisheries
industry in the past half-decade. The mood at the conference
Tuesday was to endure additional cuts if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we swallow the bitter pill now and make the sacrifices
necessary to assure the long-term recovery of salmon?'' asked Arnie
Narcisse, co-chair of the BC Aboriginal Fisheries Commission.
</P>
<P>
   It is a bitter pill in a place once used to resources that never
ran out. Iona Campagnolo, another former Canadian Cabinet minister
who led Tuesday's symposium, closed by observing: ``The rules under
which we've operated were written for few people exploiting an
abundant planet. Now we have many people and a seemingly tiny
planet.''

WNBA STAYING OUT OF NEW ENGLAND FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Professional women's basketball will not be returning to New
England _ not in the near future, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The Women's National Basketball Association Tuesday said that
neither Boston nor Hartford is among the cities being considered
for expansion when the league grows from 12 to 16 teams in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   WNBA teams are owned by and operated in conjunction with the 29
NBA franchises. The Celtics did not apply for a WNBA franchise, and
Hartford is out of the running because it has no NBA team.
</P>
<P>
   Celtics spokesman Jeff Twiss said the club opted not to seek a
women's team in order to focus on getting the men's team back on
track.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had thought about it, but we are concentrating our focus on
getting the men's basketball team back to the championships,'' he
said. ``So before we add the WNBA, let's focus on getting down to
the playoff hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartford, on the other hand, does want a team but is being
denied. The city was home to the New England Blizzard, a top
attendance draw in the rival ABL, which folded last December.
Officials there have been courting the WNBA ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed that the Celtics didn't even apply, and they
could play some of the games here, '' Connecticut Lt. Gov. Jodi
Rell said Tuesday. ``But I'm most disappointed that the WNBA
doesn't change its policy.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not bound to happen, WNBA president Val Ackerman said in
a telephone news conference last week. ``We're mindful of the
interest we've seen for women's pro basketball in non-NBA cities,
particularly in some of the college hotbeds,'' she said. ``At this
point for us the model we have now is too compelling.''

TWIGGY AND NOEL COWARD TAKE ONE MORE TURN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 6) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 Matthew Gurewitsch writes about the arts for The Wall Street
Journal and other publications.  
 By MATTHEW GUREWITSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   His name notwithstanding, he missed being born on Christmas by
more than a week. His name notwithstanding, he was a brave man,
brave enough to fire off epigrams for the West End in London in the
wake of Oscar Wilde.
</P>
<P>
   The world has not forgotten Noel Coward (eventually Sir Noel),
playwright of ``Hay Fever'' and ``Private Lives,''
composer-lyricist of ``Mad About the Boy'' and ``Mad Dogs and
Englishmen,'' unmatched interpreter of his own mischief.
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan Morley, the London theater critic for The Spectator and
Playbill, summed up Coward's genius in the title of his biography,
the first: ``A Talent to Amuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Coward died in 1973. Were he alive, he would be celebrating his
100th birthday on Dec. 16. One of many observances on either shore
of the Atlantic this centennial year, Morley's Off Broadway
valentine, ``If Love Were All,'' opens on Thursday at the Lucille
Lortel Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The show strings a score of Coward tunes on a thread of Coward's
reminiscences about his muse and co-star, Gertrude Lawrence.
Included are scenes from the plays he wrote with her in mind,
notably ``Private Lives,'' with which the squabbling lovebirds
Amanda and Elyot kept London and Depression-era New York in
stitches.
</P>
<P>
   By this time in their early 30s, Noel and Gertie had been fast
friends for more than half their lives. They met in Euston Station,
London, child actors en route to an engagement in Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
   ``She confided to me that her name was Gertrude Lawrence,''
Coward later wrote, ``but that I should call her Gertie because
everybody did. She then gave me an orange, told me a few mildly
dirty stories, and I loved her from that moment onwards.''
</P>
<P>
   Gertie died in 1952, at 54. ``I wish so deeply, so very
deeply,'' Coward told the newspapers, ``that I could see her just
once more, playing in a play of mine.'' Though the point is made
lightly, ``If Love Were All'' unfolds in Coward's mind as he writes
that tenderly self-centered tribute.
</P>
<P>
   What inspired the show and its particular form, Morley said
after an early preview, was the answer the dying Coward gave when
Morley asked him if he still thought about Gertie. ``Every night
when I go to sleep and every morning when I wake up,'' replied
Coward, ``I see her in that white Molyneux dress on the `Private
Lives' terrace, and she never goes away.''

<P>
   In various forms and under various titles, from cabaret act to
West End attraction, Morley's two-character tribute has been around
for some 15 years. By his estimate, it has played in more than 30
locales, from London and the Far East to the Bay Street Theater in
Sag Harbor. Later this year, Alan Ayckbourn will direct it as
``Noel and Gertie'' in London.
</P>
<P>
   But what sets the New York edition apart, Morley said, is the
cast: Twiggy, the former model Lesley Hornby from London who
starred in ``The Boy Friend,'' the film spoof of the '20s, and on
Broadway with Tommy Tune in ``My One and Only,'' also set in the
'20s; and Harry Groener, whose notable credits as a song and dance
man include the Broadway musical ``Crazy for You.'' With those two
on board, the show has acquired, for the first time, tap numbers in
authentic period style.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had very good players,'' Morley said, ``but none with
that real show-biz quality. It's been 10 years since Twiggy first
wanted to do the piece. Last summer, at Sag Harbor, it finally
happened. Like Gertie, she's a great star before she's a great
actor or singer or dancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Impersonation, though, is not the goal. ``If you go down that
route, you're asking for trouble,'' said Groener, who has purposely
kept his study of recorded Noeliana to a minimum. ``Too many people
knew Coward and have seen him before.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those who did is Twiggy, who at 49 regards doing a
musical as the best way to stay slim. She and Coward met three
times, first at Firefly, his house in Jamaica, in her stick-figure
supermodel days.
</P>
<P>
   Several hours before a recent preview, she tucked into a
triple-decker turkey sandwich (no fries) and reminisced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very nervous,'' she said, sounding like Eliza Doolittle
before she met Henry Higgins. ``He was so famous, and famous for
his wicked tongue. But he was so lovely. We got on a treat.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, when Coward was back in England, depressed and
suffering from emphysema, the actor Robert Stephens made it his
mission to cheer up his friend with a daily surprise. One day, he
called Twiggy and asked her to do the next day's honors. By now,
her friend Ken Russell had cast her as the lead in his movie ``The
Boy Friend,'' undeterred by the fact that she had never acted, sung
or danced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned as I went along,'' said Twiggy, in perfect tune with
the spirit of Gertie. Gertie had no formal training for her
profession, either, and spoke of her gifts with shrewd humility.
``I am not what you'd call wonderfully talented,'' she said, ``but
I am light on my feet and I do make the best of things.'' As Agnes
de Mille put it with tart Yankee candor, ``She can't sing, but who
cares?''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not Twiggy reminded Coward of his old platonic flame,
she seems to have charmed him. ``When he found out I was just
learning my dances to `The Boy Friend,' he said, `Show me!'''
Twiggy recalled. ``Then he got up and danced with me. Just then
there came a loud knock on the door and in walked Merle Oberon,
looking absolutely gorgeous. I couldn't believe it. And she joined
us for tea.''
</P>
<P>
   Twiggy's final encounter with Coward took place in a London
hospital. He told her she should play Elvira, and she thought,
``Who's Elvira?'' A scene from ``Blithe Spirit'' in the current
show gives the answer: the inconvenient ghost of the first wife of
the play's harried, remarried protagonist.
</P>
<P>
   A few years back, when Twiggy was thinking seriously about
playing Gertie, a snapshot from Firefly turned up, which she took
as a favorable sign. Through Leigh Lawson, her husband and the
director of ``If Love Were All,'' she can point to another link:
``When Leigh's mum was 23, she was the first front-of-house manager
at the brand-new Phoenix Theater, which opened with `Private
Lives.' She watched every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Icon of the '60s that she was, Twiggy finds it not strange at
all to be turning back the clock to her parents' generation. ``I
think of the '20s and '30s as my period,'' she offered between
healthy bites of sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the music, the clothes, the style. The '20s must have
been a wonderful time if you had money. They would have been a
nightmare if you were poor.''
</P>
<P>
   She paused a moment. ``I would probably have been a maid,'' she
added, with timing worthy of Amanda.

 _ SF CHRON  
 Eye Surgeon Is in a Business With High Visibility  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Dr. Gary Kawesch has an eye for business as well as medicine.
<P>
   The 35-year-old ophthalmologist does as many as a dozen
vision-correction surgeries an hour at his Laser Eye Center of
Silicon Valley. At $2,200 per cornea, he grosses close to $10
million a year and nets ``in the low seven figures.''
</P>
<P>
   That's more than many neighboring high-tech companies make. Of
course, it helps that Kawesch specializes in the fastest-growing
field of elective surgery in America. And unlike most doctors, he
doesn't have to haggle with managed care providers because most
patients pay out of their own pockets.
</P>
<P>
   However, Kawesch also has focused on marketing and management as
well as medicine to build his practice.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Kawesch strategically located his surgical center
near a freeway on-ramp in San Jose, to make it easier for customers
from Santa Cruz and San Francisco to reach him.
</P>
<P>
   He also provides provides free limo pickup and dropoff service
to clients. ``I recognize people are paying out of pocket for a
luxury item and their time is valuable,'' said Kawesch.
</P>
<P>
   And he joined an entrepreneurs group to gain management
expertise and mentoring.
</P>
<P>
   While most doctors devote little money or attention to
marketing, those who specialize in elective procedures often spend
tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. But
few have a marketing budget as big as Kawesch.
</P>
<P>
   He spends about $750,000 a year on advertising, including
30-second TV spots, a 30-minute infomercial, radio and Internet
ads. A year and a half ago, Kawesch even took out a billboard on
Highway 101.
</P>
<P>
   His company has 28 employees, including 10 in marketing and
``patient education.''
</P>
<P>
   His Web site ( &LR; www.2020eyesite.com &LR; ) includes testimonials from
satisfied customers, articles he's authored, seminars he's holding
and multimedia interviews with Kawesch.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Kawesch's clients include TV Judge Joe Brown, Eddie Murphy's
wife and athletes from the A's, 49ers, Raiders, Sharks and
Cleveland Indians. He has done 13,000 procedures since 1992, and
said he owns about a third of the laser vision correction market in
Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Some physicians and prospective patients may balk at Kawesch's
promotional style in a medical world where quiet referrals are the
norm.
</P>
<P>
   Kawesch's services ``are perhaps over-marketed,'' according to
Ken Coleman, president of iCEO, a Woodside company specializing in
providing interim chief executives.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when Coleman decided to have vision-correction surgery,
he went to Kawesch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy going to the volume leader,'' Coleman said. ``It's
been shown that the (doctor) who does the most of a certain
procedure is often the best person to go to.'' Coleman is pleased
with the results. His vision went from 20-200 to better than 20-20.
</P>
<P>
   Kawesch may be the most visible eye surgeon in the Valley, but
he is hardly alone. Edward Manche, director of cornea and
refractive surgery at Stanford University's School of Medicine,
does about as many procedures per month as Kawesch and even charges
$300 more per eye.
</P>
<P>
   But the two 35-year-old doctors couldn't be more different in
style. While Manche drives a 1989 Honda, Kawesch tools around in a
1994 yellow Lamborghini.
</P>
<P>
   Both physicians specialize in the popular laser surgery
treatment called LASIK, short for Laser-Assisted In-Situ
Keratomileusis.
</P>
<P>
   In this quick and generally painless procedure, a machine called
a microkeratome first slices and lifts up a thin flap of tissue
from the surface of the cornea. A laser is then used to reshape the
exposed corneal surface and the flap is then replaced.
</P>
<P>
   The typical computer-controlled procedure takes only seconds,
involves no stitches and little discomfort and patients can see the
results almost instantaneously. It is estimated that more than
800,000 such procedures will be conducted in the United States this
year, about double last year's total.
</P>
<P>
   Although most patients rave about LASIK, industry studies show 3
to 4 percent notice some nighttime side effects such as haloes or
star-bursts around lights.
</P>
<P>
   The worse a person's eyesight, the greater the likelihood of
needing to go back for a little resculpting of the cornea _ what
Kawesch calls ``a touch-up.'' If a patient can't see the big E on
the eye chart at half the normal distance without corrective
lenses, Kawesch said the chances of needing a second procedure is
about 20 percent. The additional cost is $100 per eye.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure is expensive in part because of the high cost of
the equipment. The laser machines, which come from VISX of Santa
Clara and Japan's Nidek, cost about $500,000 each, and Kawesch has
to pay VISX a royalty of $260 per eye each time he uses the VISX
machine. ``It's like buying a Mercedes and having to pay the
company every time you turn on the ignition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kawesch uses the Nidek machine on about 80 percent of his
patients, not because of the savings in royalty payments, but
because he claims it treats a broader area of the cornea and thus
lessens the potential night-time halo effect. However, he said VISX
machines are the only ones that work on farsightedness and also are
better for treating some astigmatisms.
</P>
<P>
   Kawesch went to the University of California at Los Angeles
medical school after graduating from Yale and was drawn to laser
surgery. ``I like high-tech and I like to see results fast,'' he
explained. In addition, unlike most other types of surgery, ``there
are not a lot of emergencies and the lifestyle is good.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the same year he finished his residency in
ophthalmology, Kawesch purchased the eye surgery practice in San
Jose from a doctor who ran into licensing problems over allegations
of performing unnecessary operations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the potential risk of guilt by association, Kawesch
decided buying the practice made sense. ``I saw it as a diamond in
the rough,'' Kawesch recalled. ``The area is wealthy and people are
enamored of technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than locate in a conventional, high-priced medical
building, Kawesch leased a former bank branch close to a Highway
280 on-ramp and converted it into a surgery center.
</P>
<P>
   Since he had no formal business training, Kawesch joined the
Young Entrepreneurs' Organization to get some management tips. He
was paired with a mentor from the World Presidents Organization,
Tom Herman, who heads the Alamo Group, an East Bay financial
services company, and is a former CEO of Delta California
Industries and Grand Auto.
</P>
<P>
   ``I immediately liked Gary's interest in patient care,'' said
Herman, who has helped Kawesch analyze his business and evaluate
new surgery center locations.
</P>
<P>
   By keeping a database of more than 30,000 callers and
pinpointing where inquiries were coming from over the past two
years, Kawesch was able to identify the East Bay as a market where
he could expand without cutting into his existing business.
</P>
<P>
   He recently leased another abandoned bank branch with ``nice
curb appeal and parking,'' this time in Pleasanton. He plans to
hire another surgeon for this second surgery center to spread the
load and a slice of the profits.

 WIRES  
 `Physician Extenders' Can Help  &HT;     By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Doctors who get paid by health maintenance organizations can't
increase their revenues as easily as those who do elective
procedures paid for by patients.
<P>
   But they can still take steps to control costs and attract new
clients, business consultants say. Some doctors are using
``physician extenders'' the same way lawyers use paralegals.
</P>
<P>
   Lois Bernstein, vice president of marketing for Health Care
System, a large Tacoma, Wash., physician group and hospital system,
said doctors increasingly are using nurse practitioners and
physician assistants to take patient histories and blood pressure,
deal with some patients' chronic problems and handle chores that
save doctors' time for more critical jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Successful medical groups also increasingly have Web sites to
provide clients important health information and links to other
resources online, which also cuts demands on the doctors, according
to Bernstein. She said that primary care physicians also are using
phone centers like McKesson HBOC's Access Call Center Group in
Phoenix to respond to patients during non-office hours.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors can also do a better job negotiating with managed care
outfits, according to John Sterling, vice president of Smock
Management Consultants in Lake Forest, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physicians don't usually do this very well,'' he said. Those
who are sophisticated, run good-sized practices or have savvy
contract administrators or consultants can often negotiate better
deals with insurers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, doctors might win additional payments if they keep
patients healthier and admit a lower than normal proportion of
clients to hospitals. Another tactic is to provide services that
are not covered by health insurers, suggests Jeffrey Denning of
Practice Performance Group in Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he notes that a number of obstetricians and
gynecologists have gone into the lucrative tummy tuck and
liposuction business, and dermatologists are treating so-called
spider veins that are not covered by most insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors who are limited by strict Medicare reimbursement fees on
heart surgery or cataract operations, might look at serving
well-off foreigners who frequently seek medical attention in the
United States and pay full fare, Denning said. Obviously it helps
if you speak a foreign language or have cross-cultural connections.

BABY SMUGGLING SUSPECT CALLED COMPASSIONATE, NOT GREEDY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz.)  (sidebar with MEXICO-BABY-SMUGGLING) 
(bl) 
 By GINGER THOMPSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOUGLAS, Ariz. _ Mario Manuel Reyes Burgueno, a lawyer charged
with smuggling Mexican babies into the United States, is well known
throughout this community on the Arizona-Mexico border as a devout
Catholic and a staunch opponent of abortion. And his lawyers say
his efforts to get Mexican children adopted in the United States
were motivated by religious conviction and humanitarian compassion
and not by greed.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes, a 40-year-old father of four, was arrested last week on
charges that he helped arrange the illegal adoption of Mexican
children by parents in the United States and collected large cash
payments. In a bail hearing for Reyes on Tuesday in U.S. District
Court in Tucson, his attorney, Ivan Abrams, said that Reyes was
attempting to help ``unwanted children of prostitutes in large
measure and very poor people who couldn't afford to bring another
child into this world.''
</P>
<P>
   Abrams added, ``His intentions were good.''
</P>
<P>
   No bail was set for Reyes. However a hearing was set for June 8
at U.S. District Court in Brooklyn. Abrams said his client is broke
and that his parents may have to put up their house to help him pay
bail, if one is set.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Abrams explained that his client ``loathes
abortion'' and that he even wrote his law school dissertation on
strategies for preventing illegal abortions in Mexico by
establishing more adoption agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not trying to hurt anyone,'' Abrams said.
</P>
<P>
   People here, in Reyes' hometown want to believe that is true.
Father Luis Chavez, Reyes' priest said that after rumors began to
swirl last fall that police were investigating Reyes, the lawyer
assured him that he had done nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   When church members asked about Reyes' predicament, the priest
said, he became defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think God is going to treat him badly,'' Chavez said
he told members of the church. ``He took children who were going to
be aborted, or who were going to probably live in misery and gave
them a chance to have good homes.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the other side of the border in Agua Prieta, the stories
about Reyes are not as generous.
</P>
<P>
   Eunicia Soto, who runs an independent orphanage in Agua Prieta,
said she would occasionally run into Reyes at the local courthouse
and he would ask her if she had any children available for
adoption.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I told him no,'' she recalled, ``He would tell me, `Your
problem is that you hold on too tight to your children.'''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to allegations that Reyes was paid about $20,000 for
each of the adoptions he arranged, she asked, ``If he is such a
humanitarian who wanted to help poor children, then why did he
charge so much money?''

COWBOYS RELEASE RECEIVER DAVIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ As expected, the Dallas Cowboys released wide
receiver Billy Davis Tuesday to free up room under the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who cleared out his locker weeks ago, became expendable
when the Cowboys signed free-agent receiver Raghib Ismail and
re-signed Ernie Mills. Davis' release saves the Cowboys $800,000,
leaving the club little more than $1 million under the $57.28
million cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy made some great plays for us, I'm sorry to lose him,''
owner Jerry Jones said. ``We had expectations of him being our
second receiver. When that didn't work out it was just too much for
us with him playing exclusively on special teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was the first day teams could release roster players or
sign unrestricted free agents since April 12.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are left with six receivers: three front-line
players in Michael Irvin, Mills and Ismail; little-used backup Jeff
Ogden; and two unsigned rookies, fourth-round draft pick Wane
McGarity of Texas and sixth-round selection Martay Jenkins of
Nebraska-Omaha.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is coming off his most productive season in his four-year
NFL career. He finished second on the team with 39 receptions for
691 yards and three touchdowns. His 17.7-yards-per-catch average
ranked him fourth in the NFC and 11th in the NFL. He had just three
receptions before last season.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' agent, Jordan Woy, could not be reached to comment on the
receiver's prospects for the upcoming season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good player; he'll help a team,'' Jones said. NO
DECISION ON SANDERS
</P>
<P>
   It remains possible that the Cowboys could release All-Pro
cornerback Deion Sanders if Jerry Jones thinks Sanders' surgically
repaired big toe would prevent him from contributing this season.
Releasing Sanders would free up $6.5 million on the salary cap.
However, the Cowboys are more likely to wait in order to evaluate
Sanders' progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is just no change. He's on the roster,'' Jones said. ``I
have no comment right now on what we're doing one way or the other.
I know what I'd like to do.'' nn

 _ SF CHRON  Online Retail Strategies
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I have a kitchenware company and would like to expand the
business by selling online. I am interested in learning about the
best strategies and also how to keep from losing retail customers
if I price online items for less than I sell them for in the store.
</P>
<P>
   A: There are lots of recipes for selling stuff online and whole
books on the subject like ``Selling Online for Dummies'' (IDG
Books, by Leslie Heeter Lundquist).
</P>
<P>
   We took your question to Scott Galloway, chief executive of
Prophet Brand Strategy, which helps companies like Adidas and Wells
Fargo with their marketing strategies, including e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   In moving from physical store to electronic delivery _ what
Galloway calls ``going analog to digital,'' it is easy to get
overcome by fear, he says.
</P>
<P>
   The first step is to clearly define what you hope to gain from
an Internet site. For example, is it to increase your value to
customers? To win more sales? To provide more customer service and
lower phone service costs? To test new products or brands?
</P>
<P>
   When you try a new sales channel, stay focused on just one or
two things, Galloway says.
</P>
<P>
   Since consumers commonly use multiple sales channels, from
stores and catalogs to phone and online sites, effective retailers
use a combination of approaches. For example, Galloway says
Williams-Sonoma collects e-mail addresses in its stores for its
bridal registry and then pitches products to this targeted audience
through other sales channels.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid cannibalizing your current customers, Galloway
recommends offering products for the same price online, even though
sales costs may be lower than in your store. David Aaker, a
marketing professor at the University of California at Berkeley
Haas School of Business, agrees that a standard ``pricing
umbrella'' is usually the best strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do want to compete on price, consider establishing new
brands,'' says Aaker, who recently joined Prophet Brand Strategy as
vice chairman. Just as Gap has different brands for different price
points, from Banana Republic to Gap to Old Navy, you might be able
to sell different merchandise or sub-brands online.
</P>
<P>
   Aaker offers four tips to building a brand on the Internet:
</P>
<P>
   _View the Internet as a home for the loyalist. Use it as a way
to keep your most passionate customers happy and stimulated.
</P>
<P>
   _Create links with your other communication programs, such as
advertising and promotions.
</P>
<P>
   _Have strong branded features such as information on or links to
related products or services, such as recipes or nonstick products.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of GROW02 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  _Make the ``look and feel'' of your Web site consistent with the
personality of your stores.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; Virtual Headquarters
</P>
<P>
   Q: Colleagues in Michigan, Missouri and California are planning
to create a consulting group organized as a limited liability
company. We will provide data analysis services to health &UR;  &LR; care
organizations located virtually anywhere. All work can be handled
via e-mail and other electronic means, so there is no required
physical place &UR;  &LR; of business. What issues determine which state the
LLC should be registered in? Will we need to register as a
``foreign company'' in other states?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; A: As you no doubt already know, one of the major benefits of
limited liability companies is that they are taxed like
partnerships. There is no double taxation at the corporate and
personal levels since income flows directly to the owners, who pay
taxes according to the state laws where they reside.
</P>
<P>
   However, you should check out the LLC laws and costs of
incorporation in each of the three states where the owners live,
according to Kevin Leek, a lawyer and author of ``Kiplinger's Small
Business Attorney.''
</P>
<P>
   He also notes that each state has its own rules on what
constitutes doing business in that state and whether sales or other
taxes apply.
</P>
<P>
   For physical goods, the rules are simpler; for electronic
delivery of services of the type you are providing, the rules are
less clear. It may depend on whether you are actually spending time
in other states.
</P>
<P>
   As for having to file as a ``foreign'' company in every state
where you provide service, Leek suggests that most states have
exemptions for onetime events, and for companies that don't have an
actual office or employee in that state. However, if you are
supposed to register and do not, some states can bring certain
penalties. And if you get sued in a state where you have not
properly registered, the owners could lose the benefit of limited
liability since the LLC might not be recognized.
</P>
<P>
   You might want to check up on LLC laws and requirements in the
states where you plan to operate. Places to start are legal Web
sites like Block Financial's  &LR; www.blocksoft.com/legal &LR; , West
Group's &LR;  www.westlaw.com  &LR; and CCH Inc.'s &UR;  &LR; www.cch.com &LR; . &UR;  &LR; You
probably will want to consult an attorney, too.

 AOL Trying to Catch Internet Music Wave  &HT;     By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
America Online Inc. yesterday said it is paying about $400 million
in stock to buy two key Internet music companies and consolidate
their operations in San Francisco.
<P>
   AOL, moving to jump into the rapidly developing field of online
music, will buy privately held Spinner Networks Inc., a 3-year-old
San Francisco company that ``broadcasts'' about 2 million popular
songs each day through the Internet. Spinner Networks reaches about
1.5 million listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the world's largest consumer online company will buy
privately held Nullsoft Inc., a small Sedona, Ariz., firm that
makes WinAmp, the most popular software program used to play
downloadable songs encoded in the MP3 compression format.
</P>
<P>
   Nullsoft's staff will move to Spinner's headquarters on Alabama
Street and become part of what local audio-related companies are
trying to dub the ``Audio Alley.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're excited about the Nullsoft guys joining forces with us
in San Francisco,'' said Dave Samuel, Spinner CEO and founder.
</P>
<P>
   The WinAmp program, which has about 5 million users, is one of
the key products that in the past year fueled the grassroots
popularity of MP3-encoded music played on desktop computers and
distributed via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The MP3 groundswell showed how music can be transmitted in
digital form directly to consumers on the Internet, which has
caused the recording industry to start gearing up for a major shift
in how it distributes music in the future.
</P>
<P>
   America Online is hoping to catch the wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Combining these leading Internet music brands with the
audience reach of our brands will lift music online to the next
level of popularity,'' AOL President Bob Pittman said in a news
release. ``We plan to build downloadable music, Internet radio and
overall music features into each of our brands.''

VINIK IS AGAIN SELLING STAKES IN TECHNOLOGY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (mk) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jeffrey Vinik made a famous market call in November 1995 while
still the manager of Fidelity Magellan, the world's biggest mutual
fund: He bailed out of $10 billion worth of technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, he put much of that money into cash and bonds,
and Magellan's value barely budged over the next six months while
the broad market soared. Vinik left Fidelity, an FMR Corp. unit,
soon after, set up a hedge fund for rich investors and has since
turned in a striking performance, tripling his investors' money in
less than three years.
</P>
<P>
   Now Vinik has reduced his technology holdings once again,
according to federal securities filings.
</P>
<P>
   In the first three months of this year, his firm, Vinik Asset
Management in Boston, sold stakes in chip makers and other
computer-equipment manufacturers, among other technology
businesses. The fund, which manages about $2.5 billion, eliminated
its entire $95 million stake in Intel Corp., $88 million worth of
stock in Flextronics International Ltd., $105 million of
Electronics for Imaging Inc., $96 million in Compaq Computer, $101
million in the American depository receipts of Nokia, the Finnish
cellular phone maker, and most of its $132 million stake in Maxtor,
which makes disk-drive storage products.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Vinik's hedge fund sold more than $3 billion of U.S.
stocks in the quarter, a fact reported Tuesday by Bloomberg News.
The firm listed $817.2 million in domestic stocks as of March 31,
down from $3.9 billion at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But while Vinik's moves are closely watched by some investors
because of his reputation as a stock picker, the latest report may
not reflect a negative turn in his market sentiment. One investor
knowledgeable about Vinik's portfolio said it would be a mistake to
conclude that he has turned bearish on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   The sales could have been offset by a reduction in short
positions, or bets against stocks _ positions that he is not
required to report. He could also have bought stock-index futures,
options, derivatives or foreign stocks _ none of which has to be
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Vinik Asset Management declined to comment on the
stock sales or on the fund's allocations.
</P>
<P>
   And much could have changed. The securities filings list his
domestic stock holdings as of two months ago, and Vinik has been a
frenetic trader who moves in and out of positions quickly.
</P>
<P>
   At Magellan, he loaded up on high-technology stocks, with this
concentration reaching its peak in April 1995. Then, that November,
he cut technology stocks to 24.5 percent of the fund, a sharp
decline from 43.2 percent a month earlier. That amounted to
billions of dollars of stock sales in just weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He has continued his hyperactive style of trading. At the end of
last year, he owned $64 million worth of Rational Software Corp.,
then sold the entire stake by the end of March. So far this
quarter, he has bought about $170 million of the stock.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``his portfolio was very slanted to technology, and now
he's lightened up that portion of it,'' said Fred Hult, a research
analyst at the Carson Group of New York, which tracks institutional
holdings of stock for investment banks and corporate clients.
``Definitely, technology was at the top of the list'' of stocks
that Vinik sold in the first quarter, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Vinik's hedge fund eked out a 1 percent return for investors in
the first quarter of this year, a disappointing performance after
two outstanding years. His investors reaped a 45 percent gain in
1998 and 77 percent in 1997.

IRVIN HASN'T SOUGHT TRADE FROM COWBOYS, AGENT SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ The agent for Michael Irvin said yesterday the
Dallas Cowboys' all-time leading receiver is concerned about his
contract status, but he has made no contact with any NFL teams
regarding a possible trade.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Endicott, Irvin's agent, said he is miffed that the
Cowboys have yet to offer a contract extension and that his client
was used as possible trade bait prior to the NFL draft in April.
Endicott said Irvin would endorse a trade if the Cowboys are not
planning to offer the 12-year veteran an extension that would keep
him with the team for the remainder of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin, who did not attend Tuesday's voluntary workout at Valley
Ranch and was unavailable to comment, is entering the final year of
his current deal. The Cowboys have already extended the contracts
of Troy Aikman and Emmitt Smith to guarantee they will end their
careers as Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   The contract situation ``would concern any player,'' Endicott
said. ``Michael is not demanding a trade or anything else. Michael
knows they talked to some teams about trading him over the winter;
that's still stuck there. He said if that's what they want to do,
that's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said he would not comment on whether
he plans to offer Irvin a contract extension. But he added he's not
concerned about Irvin not being at the workout Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the 11 years I have been involved here, the
way he competes on the field, it's not a big issue,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Endicott also said Irvin is not irked about being de-emphasized
in the new offense coach Chan Gailey installed last season. Irvin,
33, led the team with 74 receptions last year, but caught only one
touchdown pass. His 1,057 yards receiving was his second-lowest
total of the past eight seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've sat down and talked about his future, where we think he
is. I think we are all on the same page,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   The re-signing of Ernie Mills, who was on pace to set career
marks in catches and yards before an injury cut his season short,
and the recent free-agent signing of Raghib Ismail, should help
Irvin find more space to maneuver in Gailey's favored multiple
receiver sets.
</P>
<P>
   The offense ``gives the opportunity to those who get open,''
Gailey said. ``We don't force the ball, we let reads dictate where
we throw the football.'' nn

 E-Trade Acquires Telebanc for $1.8 Billion   &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Online broker E-Trade, in a bid to expand its menu of financial
products, agreed yesterday to buy Telebanc, the nation's largest
Internet-based bank, for $1.8 billion in stock.
<P>
   The move will let Palo Alto's E-Trade, the No. 2 electronic
broker, offer federally insured savings and checking accounts and
let customers pay bills online. It represents a giant step in the
company's campaign to postion itself as a full-line financial
services company based on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're pushing the envelope in building a broader online
financial services strategy,'' said U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray
analyst Stephen Franco.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade announced the Telebanc takeover the same day securities
industry powerhouse Merrill Lynch unveiled plans for a low-cost
online brokerage service, something it once said it would never do.
The two moves highlighted the growing power of the Internet as a
medium for consumers to manage their finances.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of E-Trade fell $5.19 to $39.31 on a day the stocks of
electronic brokerages plummeted across the board. Telebanc's stock
surged $8 to $74.50.
</P>
<P>
   Telebanc, headquartered in Arlington, Va., is chartered as a
savings and loan, but has no traditional branches. It had $1.3
billion in deposits and 60,000 customer accounts nationwide at the
end of March, making it by far the largest Internet-only bank.
</P>
<P>
   Still, its online business is dwarfed by those of many
traditional banks, including industry leader Wells Fargo, which has
more than 840,000 Internet customers.
</P>
<P>
   Telebanc provides an array of deposit products, including
checking and money market accounts, and certificates of deposit.
E-Trade offers checking linked to a customer's brokerage account,
but money in such accounts is not federally insured.
</P>
<P>
   Because it doesn't have to pay for a branch network, Telebanc's
costs are lower than those of traditional banks, allowing it to
offer such bargains as free checking and bill payment.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; One thing it doesn't have though is automated teller machines.
The company reimburses certain customers for the fees other banks
charge for using their ATMs, up to $1.50 four times a month.
E-Trade said it will continue the rebates for the immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   The bank also doesn't make loans. E-Trade currently offer loans,
such as mortgages and credit cards, through third-party vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike online trading, brokerages, &LR; which has exploded in
popularity, Internet banking has grown much more slowly. Analysts
say that's because consumers don't have a compelling reason to bank
online comparable to the huge commissions savings available from
Internet stock trading.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic bankers believe that's about to change. They say the
Internet will become consumers' preferred place to receive and pay
bills, making trips to the mailbox unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next year or two, online banking will explode like
online brokerage,'' said Telebanc Executive Vice President Larry
Greenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Telebanc will continue to operate as a separate unit of E-Trade.
The companies said they expect to keep all of the bank's 130
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Telebanc had revenue of $107.7 million and a profit of $1
million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade's purchase price values the company at about $13.8
million per employee, astronomical compared to takeovers in other
industries, but below the amount-per-employee in some other
recently announced Internet takeovers.

 U.S. to Drop Its Antitrust Probe of Cisco  &HT;     By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
The Federal Trade Commission today is expected to exonerate Cisco
Systems Inc. after an eight-month investigation concluded that the
networking giant did not attempt to carve up the lucrative
data-transfer market in separate talks with Lucent Technologies
Inc. and Nortel Networks.
<P>
   ``The commission was satisfied that there was nothing
inappropriate in our discussions and that telecommunications is one
of the most competitive markets that exists,'' Cisco general
counsel Dan Scheinman said in a phone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Scheinman said nothing in the commission's probe, which wrapped
up last Friday, warranted further examination into possible
antitrust violations.
</P>
<P>
   An FTC spokeswoman confirmed that the investigation is closed.
She declined further comment.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco is the second Silicon Valley company cleared of federal
scrutiny this year. In March, the FTC settled antitrust charges
with Intel Corp. Ironically, Cisco's news came on the same day that
the Department of Justice resumed its heated antitrust case against
Microsoft Corp. in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Industry insiders said the FTC appeared to be satisfied with
Cisco's explanation that talks with telecommunications heavyweights
Nortel and Lucent were principally to explore approaches to new
markets _ not plans to divide markets.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry may have been further dampened by Lucent's
acquisition of Cisco rival Ascend in January for $20 billion, as
well as Nortel's $9.1 billion buyout of another Cisco competitor,
Bay Networks Inc., last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one took this investigation seriously,'' said analyst Paul
Johnson of BancBoston Robertson Stephens in New York. ``Anyone
close to Lucent and Cisco knows these are fierce competitors with
very little overlap in terms of product. There was no collusion
there.''
</P>
<P>
   In October, the FTC asked Cisco for information about concurrent
talks it had with Lucent and Nortel in 1997 and 1998 about
potential partnerships in the fast-changing communications market,
which is shifting toward an emphasis on data rather than voice
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The probe was sparked by a story in the New York Times last
summer, which noted how the evolution in technology was forcing a
convergence _ rather than competition _ between makers of
data-networking equipment, like Cisco, and established,
telephone-based companies like Northern Telecom and Lucent. The
article speculated about a wide-ranging partnership or a titanic
merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to do a blockbuster merger with somebody
else,'' Cisco CEO John Chambers told the Times. ``Zero chance. It
would be a disaster for the shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambers did acknowledge that Cisco approached North America's
largest makers of traditional telecommunications equipment in early
1997 about possible business partnerships. But talks with both
companies were scotched because each insisted on making products
that compete with Cisco technology.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust experts said it is legal for competitors to discuss
cooperative alliances if they lead to the development of
less-expensive and better products in complementary areas.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the specter of an FTC investigation, Cisco has
maintained its acquiring ways. This year it has purchased four
companies, including several voice technology firms that compete
directly with Lucent and Nortel.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose-based Cisco is expected to disclose another strategic
partnership later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The networking company's stock slid $1.94, to $107.06 per share,
in trading yesterday.

REPORT RAISES DOUBTS ABOUT MUSCLE ENHANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is merely preliminary evidence, not a medical bulletin.
</P>
<P>
   But an Iowa State study of the nutritional supplement
androstenedione _ which became alternately famous and notorious
last year when Mark McGwire paused from his record 70-home run
exploits to reveal that he uses it _ is cautionary, if not
conclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Published in the prestigious Journal of the American Medical
Association, the study indicates that, after being administered in
three daily doses of 100 milligrams each, andro did not enhance
muscle strength but it caused a significant lowering of ``good''
cholesterol and increased blood estrogen levels, which could lead
to enlarged breasts, heart disease, and pancreatic cancer.
</P>
<P>
   However, the dosage involved _ far less than the 500-1,200
milligrams recommended in advertisements for andro _ and the size
of the sampling _ 30 men, ages 19-26 _ are not sufficient to
extrapolate definitive determinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a first step, and an appropriate first step,'' said Dr.
Joel Finkelstein, senior author of a far more wide-ranging
Massachusetts General Hospital andro study that was commissioned by
Major League Baseball. ``It's a nice study that demonstrates that
at this dose of androstenedione, they were unable to show any
effect on muscle strength or testosterone.''
</P>
<P>
   The MGH study is not ready for release, and Finkelstein was
unable to project a target date. Nor would he divulge the
particulars of the study, underwritten so that Major League
Baseball can decide whether to follow the lead of the International
Olympic Committee, professional tennis, the National Football
League, and the NCAA by banning the steroid-like substance, which
is legal and sold without prescription.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty of the Iowa State subjects underwent eight weeks of
resistance bodybuilding training, and 10 of them were given andro.
The study found that there was no difference in muscle strength
between those who took andro and those who were given a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine, according to Finkelstein, as far as it goes. ``A
study of wider doses is needed,'' he said. ``It's possible that
higher levels of androstenedione will raise the testosterone
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Rich Levin said Major League Baseball is reserving
comment until the MGH report is released. Champion Nutrition of
Concord, Calif., for which McGwire endorses andro, did not return
telephone calls from the Globe. And Experimental and Applied
Sciences Inc. of Golden, Colo., a distributor that supplies the
androstenedione derivative Andro 6 and funded the Iowa State study,
preached a wait-and-see attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``EAS finds the research from Iowa State University to be very
interesting and suggests that it be taken into account by anyone
considering taking androstenedione,'' said a company statement.
</P>
<P>
   At Fenway Park before Tueday night's Tigers-Red Sox game, a
thoroughly unscientific survey of the constituency to whom
androstenedione research would be most pertinent _ the ballplayers
_ indicated a distinct lack of concern about the study, perhaps
because of a widespread lack of use of the product.
</P>
<P>
   Red Sox catcher Jason Varitek and Tigers outfielder Gregg
Jefferies said they know of no teammates who take andro, and most
of the players canvassed professed no inclination to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I'd want is something to increase strength and
durability,'' said Varitek, ``and I get that in the weight room.''

IN LETTER TO GERMANY, MILOSEVIC ACCEPTS VAGUE PRINCIPLES OF PEACE
ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs 6th graf to add details of Clinton meeting with joint
chiefs)  (See also KOSOVO-POLICY) 
(rm) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Germany on Tuesday received a letter from the Yugoslav
government in which President Slobodan Milosevic said he was ready
to withdraw forces from Kosovo and accept a ``United Nations
presence'' in the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   But Milosevic also demanded an immediate end to NATO's
70-day-old bombardment if a settlement is to be reached and made
clear that significant differences with the West remain.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, formally accepting broad principles for a peace
accord set on May 6 by the Group of Seven industrialized countries
and Russia, arrived as the Finnish president, Martti Ahtissari,
prepared to travel to Belgrade on Wednesday for the first meeting
between a Western leader and Milosevic since the NATO bombing
began.
</P>
<P>
   The planned visit, and the decision by Ahtissari to talk to a
man indicted last week on war crimes charges, suggested that
diplomacy has advanced enough to necessitate a direct exchange,
however unpalatable such a meeting may be.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials said Ahtissari's visit reflects a conviction
among Western governments that Milosevic is beginning to cede under
the pressure of bombing and that time is running out for a
diplomatic settlement that would avert a possible ground invasion
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is deeply reluctant to contemplate the use of
ground forces, but military planners believe preparations must be
made in the next few weeks if the threat of an invasion is to be
credible. The president is to meet with his Joint Chiefs of Staff
on Thursday to discuss options for using ground troops in the event
NATO decides to invade Kosovo. But the U.S. commander of NATO, Gen.
Wesley Clark, who has said a ground invasion is necessary, has been
asked not to attend.
</P>
<P>
   James Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said that Ahtissari
would take with him a detailed settlement plan. In effect, said a
senior Western official, ``the plan shows how we believe the broad
principles now agreed to by Yugoslavia would work on an operational
level.''
</P>
<P>
   In the letter received Tuesday by Germany, Milosevic committed
Yugoslavia to the vague terms laid out May 6, including the
withdrawal from Kosovo of ``military, police and paramilitary
forces'' and acceptance of the deployment there of ``effective
international civil and security presences.''
</P>
<P>
   But the letter made no commitment to withdrawing all Serbian
forces from the province, a central allied demand which, in
deference to Russia, was not spelled out in the May 6 statement.
</P>
<P>
   The letter also indicated nothing more than an acceptance of ``a
United Nations presence, mandate and other elements to be decided
by a U.N. Security Council Resolution'' _ an undertaking that
appears to fall far short of Washington's demand for a force in
Kosovo that would have NATO at its core.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic was also quick to accept a ``United Nations presence''
in Croatia and Bosnia at difficult moments in the wars there,
presences he later exploited to consolidate the Serbian position by
playing on the ambiguities of the U.N. mandate and the weakness of
the forces deployed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central unresolved issue remains what comes out of Kosovo
and what goes in,'' said Michael Steiner, chief diplomatic adviser
to Gerhard Schroeder, the German chancellor. ``We need all the
Serbian troops out, other than a possible symbolic presence, and a
convincing military deployment that only NATO can provide.''
</P>
<P>
   Western officials said that Ahtissari would spell this out to
Milosevic and make clear that he must accept NATO's terms rather
than the May 6 statement.
</P>
<P>
   Because up to now talks with Milosevic have been conducted by a
Russian, Viktor Chernomyrdin, NATO is concerned that the Yugoslav
leader may have received a diluted version of the alliance's
demands, officials said. Ahtissari's presence was therefore
critical at this stage.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's conditions include the withdrawal of all Serbian forces,
Belgrade's acceptance of an international force in Kosovo with NATO
at its core, and the return of close to one million ethnic
Albanians who have been driven from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not settle for less,'' Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright told a news conference on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``It's important for there to be an explanation by
Milosevic as to what it is he means.''
</P>
<P>
   She spoke after a meeting with the Italian foreign minister,
Lamberto Dini, who said that Milosevic had to accept the conditions
set on May 6 as well as NATO's demands and had to begin to withdraw
forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is not accepted and is not verifiable, then I do not
think it will be possible for the alliance to come to an agreement
on the suspension of bombing,'' Dini said.
</P>
<P>
   This statement, from a country that has been among the more
eager to end the bombing, suggested that the Clinton administration
has convinced its allies that only what would amount to a clear
admission of defeat by Milosevic would suffice to stop the bombing
and open the way to a settlement.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The rejection by Serbia of a NATO deployment in Kosovo
precipitated the start of the bombing on March 24. The bombing, in
turn, proved a catalyst to an already prepared and partially
executed Serbian campaign to evict the ethnic Albanian population
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott held talks in Bonn on
Tuesday with Chernomyrdin, Russia's envoy, and Ahtisaari, who is
representing the European Union. The discussions, also attended by
Schroeder, focused on how to narrow differences with Yugoslavia,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin is to accompany Ahtisaari to Belgrade on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After the talks Tuesday, Schroeder told a news conference, ``We
are on the way to a political solution of the problem and
substantial progress has been made.''
</P>
<P>
   The German government, a coalition of Social Democrats and
environmentalist Greens, has been increasingly eager to suggest
that progress is being made because pressure is mounting in both
parties for a halt to the bombing. The government is also deeply
opposed to a NATO ground invasion, which would become a more likely
option if the current diplomacy fails.
</P>
<P>
   Ahtissari said Tuesday in an interview with Finnish radio that
he was not going to Belgrade to negotiate with Milosevic. ``This is
no regular negotiating situation,'' he said. His statement
reflected NATO's official position that its demands are
nonnegotiable.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, however, it is clear that several difficult issues
will be reviewed with Milosevic. The first is what signal he would
have to give to demonstrate that his commitment to a settlement is
genuine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's broken promise after promise,'' the British Defense
Secretary, George Robertson, said Tuesday of Milosevic. ``We must
not and we cannot trust his word. We can only judge him on what he
does.''
</P>
<P>
   In its letter to the German government, Yugoslavia said that,
``In order to achieve a successful solution, it is necessary
immediately to end the NATO aerial bombardment and to concentrate
on a political agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   But NATO governments _ particularly Britain and the United
States _ would clearly want some strong tangible indication that
Serbian troops had started to withdraw en masse from Kosovo before
the bombing was stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Another difficult issue is what Serbian forces, if any, would be
allowed to remain in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Milosevic was likely to maneuver to increase the
number of Russians in any peacekeeping force, try to concentrate
this Russian presence in the northern part of Kosovo to which Serbs
are most attached, and attempt to keep the British and American
contingents to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   But Steiner said that any deployment that suggested a division
of Kosovo into two zones _ one mainly Russia and one controlled by
NATO countries _ ``cannot be acceptable as an aim, because it might
imply an imminent division of the province.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadly, Western officials said the aim was to move toward
agreement on a settlement by the time of the summit meeting of
Group of Seven countries and Russia in Cologne, Germany, in two
weeks. If no agreement could be reached before then, the pressure
to look seriously at a ground invasion and prepare for it might
become overwhelming, they said.

WAGNER'S ANTICHRIST CRASHES A PAGAN PARTY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 6) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Richard Taruskin is the author of ``Stravinsky and the Russian
Traditions.''  
 By RICHARD TARUSKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ They probably didn't plan it that way, but
San Francisco's leading classical-music organizations will come
into an interesting collision this week. At the War Memorial Opera
House, the San Francisco Opera will stir up pagan ecstasy with
several complete cycles of Richard Wagner's ``Ring of the
Nibelung,'' beginning on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, beginning on Thursday across the street at Davies
Symphony Hall, and in a couple of other spots around town
(including a Roman Catholic church), Michael Tilson Thomas and the
San Francisco Symphony will celebrate the life and times of Igor
Stravinsky, who loved to bill himself as Wagner's Antichrist, and
for whom the ``Ring,'' with its ``miasmic vapors'' and its
labyrinth of leitmotifs, amounted to nothing more than ``a sort of
vast musical city directory.''
</P>
<P>
   That last bit was a typical anti-Wagnerian wisecrack of a kind
everybody makes, Wagnerians included. (Stravinsky attributed it to
Debussy.) Everybody feels oppressed during a Wagner performance.
That is part of its appeal. Having endured martyrdom, we are
cleansed _ or we are just irritated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, music strove to delight people,'' groused another
Russian, Tchaikovsky, after sitting through a ``Ring.'' ``Now they
are tormented and exhausted.'' But even the irritated _ no,
especially the irritated _ know that the experience they have
suffered was art-transcending and religious (or at least
religiose), and therefore threatening to all who would prefer to
take their religion, or their art, straight.
</P>
<P>
   A third Russian, Leo Tolstoy, was probably the all-time champion
Wagner hater. Late in life, after he had given up literature in
favor of full-time Christian moralizing, Tolstoy produced a tract
called ``What Is Art?'' in which good art was distinguished from
bad solely on the basis of ``message.'' The prime exhibit of
``counterfeit art'' was, of course, the ``Ring.''
</P>
<P>
   It is subjected to more than a dozen pages of hilarious abuse,
including a plot summary even funnier than Anna Russell's but
almost unbearable to read because of the blood-red hatred that
drips from every word.
</P>
<P>
   A sample: ``Having finished this conversation, Siegfried seizes
one of the pieces of what is meant to represent the broken sword,
saws it up, puts it on what is meant to represent the forge, melts
it, and then forges it and sings: `Heiho! heiho! heiho! Ho! ho!
Aha! oho! aha! Heiaho! heiaho! heiaho! Ho! ho! Hahei! hoho! hahei!'
and Act I finishes.''
</P>
<P>
   Another sample, still about ``Siegfried,'' a little less funny
because the deadpan wavers, but more pointed: ``The dragon is
represented by two men: it is dressed in a green scale skin and
waves a tail at one end while at the other it opens a kind of
crocodile's jaw that is fastened on and from which flames appear.
This dragon (who is meant to be dreadful and may seem so to
5-year-old children) utters some words in a terribly bass voice.
This is all so stupid, so like what is done in a booth at a fair,
that it is surprising that people over 7 years of age can witness
it seriously; yet thousands of quasi-cultured people sit and
attentively hear and see it, and are delighted.''
</P>
<P>
   And finally, the coup de grace, a description not of a
performance but of a rehearsal. After recounting a tirade
administered to the cast by the exasperated conductor, Tolstoy
muses: ``I have seen one workman abuse another for not supporting
the weight piled upon him when goods were being unloaded, or at
haystacking, the village Elder scold a peasant for not making the
rick right, and the man submitted in silence. And however
unpleasant it was to witness the scene, the unpleasantness was
lessened by the consciousness that the business in hand was
necessary and important, and the fault for which the Elder scolded
the laborer was one which might spoil a necessary undertaking. But
what was being done here? For what, and for whom?''
</P>
<P>
   Tolstoy's was the anti-Wagnerianism of the truly religious,
expressed at a time when Wagner was taken seriously as a religious
thinker. It was a protest against the overvaluing of art. At the
end of a century during which the overvaluing of art has come close
to destroying it, one looks back and shudders.
</P>
<P>
   Stravinsky's was the anti-Wagnerianism of the purely esthetic,
expressed at a time when artists were in revolt against
adulteration of their product, especially if adulteration came by
way of social or humane concerns. The main thing Stravinsky held
against Wagner was the Synthesis of the Arts, his term for what
Wagnerians (even when speaking other languages than German) call
the Gesamtkunstwerk, or total work of art. It mixed music with such
message-mongering media as the visual and (especially) the
literary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not merely condemn it for its lack of tradition, its
nouveau riche smugness,'' Stravinsky told a Harvard audience in
1939. ``What makes its case much worse is the fact that the
application of its theories has inflicted a terrible blow upon
music itself.'' The Wagnerian system, ``far from having raised the
level of musical culture, has never ceased to undermine it and
finally to debase it.'' And the reason for the debasement was the
fruitless denial of music's essential nature as ``a purely sensual
delight.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Wagner, Stravinsky offered Chabrier, Gounod, Delibes,
Bizet, exactly the counterbid Tchaikovsky had endorsed 60 years
before, updated by a fresh pair of names: Andre Messager, a
composer of operettas, and Henri Sauguet, the youngest composer in
Sergei Diaghilev's stable. (Stravinsky probably didn't know that
Messager had been famous in his youth as a Wagner conductor.)
</P>
<P>
   But don't expect any Messager or Sauguet festivals in San
Francisco, or anywhere else, anytime soon. Wagner, on one side of
the balance, easily outweighs everybody Stravinsky placed on the
other side. But then so does Stravinsky himself. Was the composer
of ``The Rite of Spring'' really a Gounod fan?

BURN KEEPING OPTIONS OPEN IN GOAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BLANE BACHELOR 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While growing up in Denver, Matt Jordan had an opportunity not
available to most young goalkeepers. Beginning at age 17, Jordan
trained with the Colorado Foxes of the American Professional Soccer
League.
</P>
<P>
   Part of that training was learning from Mark Dodd, who was
quickly rising to the ranks of top American-born keepers.
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, Jordan and Dodd have joined forces to help the
Burn become one of the top teams in Major League Soccer this
season. Tendinitis in his left knee has sidelined Dodd, leaving the
23-year-old Jordan to fill the starting role Dodd had the past
three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd has missed 11 of the Burn's 12 games, but Jordan _ who
played only 45 minutes last season _ has posted a league-best 52
saves. Now that Dodd is almost recovered, Burn coach Dave Dir must
decide which of his goalkeepers will get the playing time.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Dir minds. A former goalkeeper, he recognizes that a
roster with a promising rookie and a proven veteran battling for
goalkeeping minutes is a luxury that allows him experience in the
net as well as optimism for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good problem to have, if they don't let the pressure
from the outside \Raffect\S their egos,'' Dir said. ``To be a good
goalkeeper you have to have a little bit of ego but enough to be
humble when you need to. I think they both have that quality.''
</P>
<P>
   After months of rehabilitation, Dodd said his knee is about 85
percent recovered. But his immediate emphasis isn't to regain the
starting spot; it's to fully regain his strength.
</P>
<P>
   That works well for Dir, whose plan is to let Jordan start for
now because the Burn is 6-4 with him in net, and undefeated in
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, at this point the motivation is not to get this guy's
job or anything like that,'' Dodd said. ``The motivation is to get
yourself 100 percent healthy and then look at the situation. I
think it all sorts itself out as the season goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Competition will likely heat up; nearly two-thirds of the
regular season remains. The Burn has three more games against
defending MLS champion and league-leading Chicago, and four against
two-time MLS champion D.C. United.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd offers experience, especially in pressure situations. He
has been a finalist for MLS goalkeeper of the year all three
seasons, earning the honor in 1996. Last year, his save on a
penalty kick by Kansas City's Preki ultimately clinched a playoff
spot for the Burn.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan has not been tested with such pressure this season, but
his success to this point is undeniable. Jordan is among the MLS
leaders in several goalkeeping statistics, including second in
shutouts (four) and goals-against average (0.64).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's incredibly quick, I think the quickest in the league,''
Dir said of Jordan. ``I always felt that Mark played with his
brain. He can read the game with his experience. Matt does a lot
with his physical attributes, and he's still learning to read the
game from that standpoint. But it's obvious that he's not let many
goals in this season. It will be scary to see what he does when he
gets that down.''
</P>
<P>
   Dir said he will decide who to play and when based largely on
which goalkeeper's skills will help the team most in certain
situations. Pressure situations such as shootouts and
playoff-deciding games might tip the scales in favor of Dodd's
knowledge over Jordan's athletic ability. That seemed to be
</P>
<P>
   Dir's thought when he gave Dodd his first appearance this season
in the final minutes of a 1-1 tie against San Jose on May 22,
before the game went into a shootout.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the rookie can learn from the veteran and whether Dodd
can get a push from the up-and-coming Jordan could help determine
the Burn's success this season. And both said that takes priority
over who's getting the next start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a long season, and there are so many hills and
valleys and injuries and situations where players think about
whether they're starting or not,'' Dodd said. ``And what Dave
wants, and what every team wants, is to have a team that's
interchangeable. That's what you need ultimately to become a
champion.'' nn

 BERKELEY, Calif.: Gounod fan?  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Probably not, really. But between the world wars, and especially
during the anxious days of German rearmament when Stravinsky (then
a French citizen) delivered his Harvard lectures, it seemed to him,
as it did to many, terribly important to tout everything French
over everything ``Boche.''
</P>
<P>
   From having been a surrogate Kaiser, the aggressively Germanic
Wagner was already becoming a surrogate Hitler. And so he has
remained for the many who can never rid their minds of all the
horrific subtexts that have accrued to Wagner's works since they
left his hands: not his fault, perhaps, but definitely our problem.
</P>
<P>
   Stravinsky's anti-Wagner problem was different. (In
anti-Semitism he could easily vie for honors with his bete noire,
although nothing prevented either of them from having Jewish
friends or attracting Jewish advocates like Maestro Thomas.) Like
any composer's anti-Wagnerianism, Stravinsky's was not only
political but also personal, and it crystallized a little _ albeit
very little _ before World War I.
</P>
<P>
   In his earliest days, as the son of an opera singer, Stravinsky
actually wallowed in the very miasma he later deplored. New Year's
(and new century's) greetings that an admiring critic sent
Stravinsky pere on Dec. 28, 1900, ended with felicitations ``to
your lovely son, the Wagnerite musician,'' then an 18-year-old who
had composed nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Stravinsky's period of study with Rimsky-Korsakov, contrary to
legend, did nothing to lessen his Wagner worship. In the winter and
spring of 1908, the last year of Rimsky's life, teacher and pupil
attended a ``Ring'' cycle together. Rimsky's Boswell, a banker
named Vasily Yastrebtsev, bumped into Stravinsky during the first
intermission at ``Siegfried.''
</P>
<P>
   In his diary he noted that ``Igor Fyodorovich and I shared our
delight in the first act of that opera, a work of genius.'' You
know, ``Ho! ho! Hahei! hoho! hahei!''
</P>
<P>
   Virgil Thomson once tried to write off Stravinsky's ``Russian''
ballets as just the ``Wagnerian theater symphony'' updated, and as
usual he was mean but right. The leitmotif-laden ``Firebird'' was
as much a musical city directory as any Wagnerian spectacle, and
``The Rite'' was as much a pagan ecstasy. ``Petrouchka,'' as an
embodiment of Russian Symbolism, was especially Wagnerian in its
heritage, and it was lauded by its co-creator Alexandre Benois as
the ultimate Gesamtkunstwerk, a total artwork that actually managed
to beat the wizard of Bayreuth at his own game.
</P>
<P>
   What finally turned Stravinsky against Wagner was another
collision between them, eerily akin to the one about to take place
in San Francisco. First, in May 1913, there was the riotous
premiere of ``The Rite of Spring'' at the Theatre des
Champs-Elysees in Paris. Despite the myth that you will read in any
music history textbook, Stravinsky experienced it as a depressing
fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   The ballet was redeemed the next spring, when Pierre Monteux
gave it a pair of concert performances that Stravinsky remembered
for the rest of his life as the triumph of his career.
</P>
<P>
   But a scant five weeks later, on June 3, 1914, ``Parsifal'' had
its Paris premiere in the same theater as ``The Rite'' the year
before. It ran alongside the whole Diaghilev season of 1914 (which
included the premiere of Stravinsky's ``Nightingale'') and put it
in the shade. Reviewers who had just hailed ``The Rite'' in concert
now called it ephemeral, a trifle, next to Wagner's eternal genius.
All the Russians, but particularly Stravinsky, were mortified. He
swore revenge.
</P>
<P>
   The main chance came two decades later, when he published his
autobiography, ``Chronicles of My Life.'' One of the few richly
detailed passages in that notoriously tight-lipped little book was
a description of a (possibly apocryphal) visit to Bayreuth in the
summer of 1912 to hear ``Parsifal.'' It joined Tolstoy's
description of ``Siegfried'' in the annals of immortal
Wagner-spite.
</P>
<P>
   A sample: ``The very atmosphere of the theater, its design and
its setting, seemed lugubrious. It was like a crematorium, and a
very old-fashioned one at that, and one expected to see the
gentleman in black who had been entrusted with the task of singing
the praises of the departed. The order to devote oneself to
contemplation was given by a blast of trumpets. I sat humble and
motionless, but at the end of a quarter of an hour I could bear no
more. My limbs were numb, and I had to change my position. Crack!
Now I had done it! My chair had made a noise which drew down on me
the furious scowls of a hundred pairs of eyes. Once more I withdrew
into myself, but I could think of only one thing, and that was the
end of the act, which would put an end to my martyrdom.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Tolstoy, Stravinsky reached for a chilling peroration. To
mix art and religion ``is to give proof of a complete lack of
discernment, and certainly of bad taste,'' he railed. ``But is it
at all surprising that such confusion should arise at a time like
the present, when the openly irreligious masses in their
degradation of spiritual values and debasement of human thought
necessarily lead us to utter brutalization?'' William Bennett, Gary
Bauer, eat your hearts out. Stravinsky said it all before, better
than you.
</P>
<P>
   Reconcilaition with Wagner came after World War II, when it
suddenly became important to Stravinsky to forge retrospective
links with Wagner's self-styled heirs. He was responding to the
panic he felt on returning to Europe and seeing that young
composers, belatedly discovering the 12-tone music of Schoenberg
and the New Vienna School, now thought his music passe. Not only
did he take up 12-tone composition himself, Stravinsky also
accepted, hook, line and sinker, the historiographical myths that
supported the Schoenbergian claim to musical supremacy.

 BERKELEY, Calif.: musical supremacy.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Typical of the newly suppliant Stravinsky were self-pitying
pronouncements like this one, made shortly after his 80th birthday:
``I relate only from an angle to the German stem 
(Bach-Haydn-Mozart-Beethoven-Schubert-Brahms-Wagner-Mahler-Schoenber
g).'' But look again at that list of composers. It is out of order.
And Wagner is the telling anachronism. Only 16 years younger than
Schubert, he was old enough to be Brahms's father.
</P>
<P>
   Stravinsky's asserted mainstream was a fiction, constructed by
historians (Schoenberg and Webern moonlighting among them) who
replayed in forward motion a lineage that had been traced backward
to justify atonal and 12-tone music as the inevitable outcome of
the ``crisis of tonality'' Wagner had supposedly set in motion.
Putting Brahms ahead of Wagner got rid of a pesky bump in the road
of progress.
</P>
<P>
   According to Carl Dahlhaus, the most influential German music
historian of recent times, ``the assertion that Schoenberg's
atonality represents a consequence of the chromaticism of `Tristan'
has long been a commonplace (and remains difficult to challenge).''
But it is not difficult at all to challenge _ indeed, to refute.
Wagner used the chromaticism of ``Tristan und Isolde'' to delay to
the point of torture the harmonic resolution that would symbolize
the slaking of sexual desire.
</P>
<P>
   That harmonic tension not only conveyed the dramatic situation
with a force no other art could equal but was the mainspring that
controlled the syntax of what we now call ``tonal'' music.
</P>
<P>
   Did the delays caused by Wagner's chromaticism attenuate that
harmonic tension? Don't be silly. They only magnified it, vastly
so. Wagner's chromaticism gave tonality a new source of strength
and expressivity. The consequences Schoenberg drew from Wagner's
musical style were entirely idiosyncratic and ahistorical,
inevitable only in eyes blinded by ``dialectic.'' To say the very
least, they had nothing to do with Wagner's creative aims, least of
all in ``Tristan.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Wagnerian ``crisis of tonality'' was not Wagnerian at
all. It was read back into Wagner by Schoenberg's apologists,
eventually including the intimidated Stravinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Well, all that is behind us now. Perhaps everything is behind us
now. How else explain the ease with which, at century's end, we
swallow down smorgasbords, like simultaneous Wagner and Stravinsky
festivals, on which our ancestors would have gagged?
</P>
<P>
   That eclecticism of taste _ the universal tolerance that finds
nothing incompatible with anything _ is now touted as a bounty of
post-modernism. The rejection of ``meta-narratives,''
post-modernists call it, meaning the rejection of universal truth
claims. But do we therefore reject all truth claims? Could our
failure to take sides, or even to see that sides might be taken, be
masking an apathy that knoweth not its name?
</P>
<P>
   Karol Berger, a Stanford musicologist, seems to hint as much
when he reminds us of the comfy middle-class assumptions on which
the latest cultural revolution rests. ``The vision of a plurality
of equally valid co-existing life forms may be compelling,'' he
writes, ``only to those whose outlook is underpinned by one more
meta-narrative, that of a continuous and rapid global growth of
prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   And he suggests, wickedly, that ``the post-modern vision remains
plausible only so long as we imagine that the only dilemmas we
shall ever face are on the order of `Shall I get a cappuccino or a
caffe latte, buy a Volvo or a BMW?''' Ouch. Those are Bay Area
questions, all right.
</P>
<P>
   Here's another: Has Berger identified the only terms on which
one can now debate Stravinsky contra Wagner _ as rival emblems of
conspicuous culture-consumption? When a San Francisco critic can
tout the ``Ring'' as ``Star Wars'' for the wealthy (while conceding
that Wagner's music is, after all, ``considerably richer, bolder
and more nuanced'' than John Williams's), Tolstoy's frightening old
question _ What is being done here, and for whom? _ comes roaring
back to life.

 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With his support among women lagging, Vice
President Al Gore on Tuesday sought the help of Hillary Rodham
Clinton to spark excitement for his presidential candidacy _ even
at the risk that her star power would upstage him.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally at a downtown hotel, Mrs. Clinton attracted a crowd
of about 300 women, and Gore basked in the reflected glory, trying
to show little concern that she too might run for office and divert
attention and money from his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has fought harder on behalf of America's families and
children,'' Mrs. Clinton declared as she endorsed Gore for
president, her large diamond necklace and earrings flashing under
the lights. ``And no one will fight harder and be more effective at
keeping those priorities on our nation's agenda into the next
century.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said that Gore would ``not let the clock be turned
back'' on abortion rights, not mentioning that while he was in the
House of Representatives he voted against abortion rights numerous
times.
</P>
<P>
   The rally, at the Mayflower Hotel, was unusual for several
reasons, not the least of which was that Gore felt the need to
invigorate what should be a reliable constituency in an election
still 18 months away.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we talk about women's issues, we are talking about the
issues that touch all of our families and all our lives,'' Gore
said to the women, many of them longtime Gore supporters. ``Women
deserve a president who `gets' that and who will fight for the
equality women deserve and craft the policies of support their
families need.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has not even officially announced his candidacy, although
his aides said Tuesday that he would do so June 16. That is far
earlier than had once seemed necessary for the incumbent vice
president and shows how intense the competition is.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's event was notable too because it united three figures
_ Mrs. Clinton, Gore and his wife, Tipper _ who by their assemblage
brought to mind the absent fourth.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who was down the street at the White House,
was mentioned only in passing. Still, he loomed in a contradictory
way.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, the Gore campaign wanted to signal that Gore
was the opposite of Clinton _ a devoted husband whose private life
would not lead to the kind of political upheaval brought on by
Clinton's extramarital affair. As Gore said of his wife, ``She has
taught me the meaning of a strong, loving partnership that lasts
for life.'' Mrs. Clinton called Gore a ``remarkable husband and
father.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, as he boasted of his advocacy of numerous
issues important to women, the vice president was really boasting
of the Clinton presidency _ in passing the Family Medical Leave
Act, in rebuffing any erosion of abortion rights, and in
restricting children's access to guns.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing was clear: The Gore campaign needs to attract
women.
</P>
<P>
   As Mrs. Gore told the crowd point blank: ``One of the main goals
of the campaign will be to energize women to support Al. We need
your help to share with the country his vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Opinion surveys have consistently shown Gore lagging behind two
Republican presidential prospects, Texas Gov. George W. Bush and
Elizabeth Dole, both in general and among women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that he is not doing well with anybody, and
therefore he's not doing well with women,'' one Democratic
consultant said. ``Part of the overall problem is that people _
women, men, old, young _ don't know much about Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Mandel, director of the Eagleton Institute for Politics and
a specialist in women's voting patterns, said that Gore had a
built-in advantage because women tended to vote Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no strong evidence from voting behavior in the past
two decades that women will cross over in large numbers and vote
for Republican women,'' Ms. Mandel said, with an eye on Mrs. Dole's
pitch to women. ``It's Gore's to lose, as far as women are
concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   The rally gave Gore a chance to recite his support for issues on
which women have tended to focus, even though those issues affect
the population at large.
</P>
<P>
   Like Mrs. Clinton, he did not use the word ``abortion,'' but he
said, ``I will always, always defend a woman's right to choose.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Every time Congress has tried to play politics with
that fundamental, personal right, imposing gag rules and attaching
anti-choice language to any bill they can think of, we have stood
up to them and stopped them. If they try it again, we'll stop them
again. And if they try it after the year 2000, with your help, I'll
stop them. That hard-won right will be safe with me as your
president.''
</P>
<P>
   While representing a relatively conservative Tennessee
congressional district in the House in the 1970s and '80s, Gore
voted in favor of numerous anti-abortion bills. The National Right
to Life Committee gave him a favorable rating of 84 percent between
1977 and 1984; the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action
League rated him as voting with the anti-abortion side 80 percent
of the time. As a senator, he voted more in favor of abortion
rights.
</P>
<P>
   He has not been outspoken about his position on a proposed ban
on certain late-term abortions, but his aides said Tuesday that he
would allow such a procedure if it were necessary to protect the
health of the woman, which is the same view held by Clinton.

DOW RECOVERS, NASDAQ FALLS AMID INTEREST-RATE WORRIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks sold off early Tuesday on concerns that the
Federal Reserve might raise interest rates later this month. But
late in the day, the Dow Jones industrial average recovered, while
the NASDAQ composite index declined.
</P>
<P>
   The interest rate worries were sparked by results from a monthly
survey of the nation's purchasing managers. The survey showed that
growth and inflationary pressures in the manufacturing sector were
both stronger than expected in May.
</P>
<P>
   The report caused a selloff in the bond market, where interest
rates rose to their highest levels in more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks also slumped after the report was released. But the Dow
Jones industrial average, which at one point during the morning was
down 150 points, rallied later on, largely on the strength of
cyclical stocks like Alcoa, Caterpillar and International Paper,
issues that depend most heavily on a strong economy to generate
profits. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 10,596.26, up
36.52 points.
</P>
<P>
   The NASDAQ, however, fell 58.49 points, or 2.37 percent, to
2,470.52. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, dragged down by
technology giants like Intel and Microsoft, fell 7.58 points, or
six-tenths of a percent, to 1,294.26.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purchasing managers' numbers were not comfortable,'' said
Bryan Piskorowski, a market analyst at Prudential Securities. ``For
the time being, this is a market that is fixated on numbers, not
earnings.'' He added, referring to the employment report, due out
Friday, ``The wage component of that report will be closely
scrutinized by the Fed, and by the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Comments by William McDonough, president of the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York, reinforced the impression that policy-makers seem
increasingly concerned that inflationary pressures are building in
the economy. On Tuesday, McDonough said the Fed was wary about
April's sharp increase in consumer prices _ the largest monthly
increase in more than nine years. He warned markets not to assume
the big jump was merely a one-time event.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in interest rates is causing equity strategists and
money managers to reposition their portfolios. It was disclosed
Tuesday that Jeff Vinik, the former lead portfolio of Fidelity's
Magellan fund who now heads his own asset management firm, cut his
equity exposure by about $3 billion during the first quarter,
selling out positions in Intel, Microsoft and Compaq Computer,
among others.
</P>
<P>
   And last week Christine Callies, chief investment strategist at
Credit Suisse First Boston, announced the first shift in her model
portfolio in more than two years by paring her position in stocks.
``We cut our equity exposure because the market is becoming
increasingly sensitive to the back-up in interest rates,'' she said
Tuesday. ``Over the next year, we expect the total return on stocks
will lag that of bonds by about seven percentage points.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Callies lowered her equity exposure by 5 percent, to 55
percent. Thirty percent of her portfolio is in bonds and 15 percent
is in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Financial service stocks, which are acutely sensitive to rising
interest rates, were hammered Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Citigroup, a Dow component, fell 1 3/4, to 42 15/16. Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter slumped 4 3/4, to 91 3/4. Lehman Brothers
dropped 3, to 51 3/8. Charles Schwab declined 6, to 99 1/2. And
Merrill Lynch, which on Tuesday disclosed an expanded Internet
trading service, fell 8 3/4, to 75 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Computer and other technology stocks also suffered.
Hewlett-Packard and IBM were two of the biggest losers among Dow
stocks. Hewlett-Packard fell 4 3/16, to 90 1/8, and IBM dropped 4,
to 112. Intel, which said Tuesday that it had agreed to buy
Dialogic Corp. for about $780 million in cash, fell 3 3/8, to 50
11/16. Microsoft fell 2 3/16, to 78 1/2. America Online shed 6 1/8,
to 113 1/8.

COMMENTARY: TIPPER'S TIGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Back in 1995, my mother felt that Al Gore needed a
little boost.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote him a letter telling him what a great job he had done
hosting the pope's visit to Baltimore. She also told him that, no
matter what anyone else said, she thought he was really sexy.
</P>
<P>
   She addressed the letter to The Honorable Albert Gore Jr., Home
of the Vice President, Observatory Circle, 37th Street and
Massachusetts Avenue Northwest, Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
   It came back a few days later, stamped ``Addressee Unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   I knew then that Al Gore was in trouble. If he made such a faint
impression on the government he was reinventing, would he seem any
more vivid to the rest of the country?
</P>
<P>
   Too bad he didn't get that maternal pat on the back. Because now
he is clearly in a shame spiral about his lack of sizzle.
</P>
<P>
   How else to explain Tipper Gore's lusty cheerleading Tuesday on
the ``Today'' show?
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it was her role to loosen up her ironing board of a
husband, Mrs. Gore told NBC's Claire Shipman: ``If you're talking
about the fact that the man is somewhat reserved, yeah, he is. . .
. That's the way he was when he was 17 when I met him. That was
something I liked in him _ handsome, sexy, a little reserved. Watch
out, America.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shipman also reported that Mrs. Gore made a racy joke to
journalists about ``her husband's bedtime attire, or lack
thereof.''
</P>
<P>
   The dread lovey-dovey.
</P>
<P>
   When a politician lacks that essential spark, his wife often
jumps in and vouches for his sex appeal.
</P>
<P>
   I remember when Kitty Dukakis tried to do this for her ironing
board of a husband, Michael. The passionate Kitty did her best to
make the passionless Michael seem sentient, but it didn't work.
</P>
<P>
   Rosalynn attempted to spice up Jimmy (the Cardigan) Carter by
confiding during a Barbara Walters interview that she and her
husband liked to sleep in the same bed.
</P>
<P>
   Political wives sharing erotic moments is just plain yucky. This
is worse than T.M.I. It's M.T.M.I., Much Too Much Information.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, it backfires. When a wife has to hawk her husband's
sexiness with a megaphone, it just makes him seem even less sexy.
</P>
<P>
   You never heard Jackie or Hillary promoting their husbands'
sexuality. With Jack and Bill, of course, the problem was libidinal
overdrive.
</P>
<P>
   The Gores are always broadcasting what a frisky couple they are,
with tales of romantic insouciance on planes and in limos. He even
said they were the inspiration for the preppy Romeo and Juliet in
``Love Story.''
</P>
<P>
   They want to project this image not only to jazz up Al but also
to contrast their own stable marriage with the Clintons' difficult
one.
</P>
<P>
   But after the sexual Armageddon of the last year, it is passing
strange to see Gore's biggest supporters trying to transform him
into a stud.
</P>
<P>
   It is also weird that the same Democrats who argued during
impeachment that a politician's sex life was nobody's business are
now promoting Gore's sex life as a selling point.
</P>
<P>
   At the Mayflower Hotel on Tuesday morning, Hillary and Tipper
headlined a ``Women for Gore'' pep rally, but it didn't seem all
that peppy with only half the meeting room filled.
</P>
<P>
   Gore strategists had assumed that the candidate's Good Husband
credentials would impress women voters post-Monica. And on family
leave, abortion rights, women's health, the environment and gun
control, Gore's record is extremely women-friendly. But his
advisers are alarmed that he has lost a lot of the women's support
that helped elect and re-elect Bill Clinton and sustain him through
the Monica morass.
</P>
<P>
   For women, Al and Bill are the Good Boy-Bad Boy archetypes. Al
does the dishes and changes the diapers and wears the white chef's
hat at backyard barbecues. Bill is the seductive contractor who
runs off with the client's wife.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction of women to the president and vice president may
seem mystifying: sticking with Bill through so many egregious
episodes, and now turning on Al despite his sterling behavior. But
women are always ambivalent about male archetypes. And the Gore
campaign's attempt to sexualize the candidate will not help.
</P>
<P>
   If Al really is a tiger, then Tipper is really lucky. But I wish
she would keep it to herself.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   When we last spotted her on a fairway at a U.S. Women's Open,
Nancy Lopez waved a white flag of surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez laughed as her golf towel flapped in the breeze while one
of her irons served as an ad-lib flagpole. The move was a
tongue-in-cheek tribute to the difficulty of Blackwolf Run Golf
Course, where Lopez shot 18-over par for 36 holes, missing the cut
at the 1998 event.
</P>
<P>
   Meant to be a moment of levity, Lopez's action may some day
provide a fitting epitaph for a Hall of Fame career. Although she
has 48 victories in LPGA tour events, Lopez is best known for the
one that has gotten away: the Women's Open. The tour's
most-recognized working mother has nine top-10 finishes in 19
appearances, including four seconds, but has never captured the
most prestigious title in women's golf.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, 42, resumes pursuit of her personal Holy Grail Thursday
at Old Waverly Golf Club in West Point, Miss. She will arrive with
a pair of creaking, arthritic knees and the knowledge that she
already is older than the oldest champion in Open history (Fay
Crocker, 40, in 1955).
</P>
<P>
   Lopez also knows something else. This figures to be her best
chance before retirement to cheat Father Time and pick up an Open
title because of her familiarity with the course.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez lives in Albany, Ga., a short plane ride away, and has
been a frequent visitor to Old Waverly in recent years. When the
course opened in 1988, she joined designer Jerry Pate, Ben Crenshaw
and the late Heather Farr in a four-player match to christen the
facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to Old Waverly has got me more excited than I've been
about the Open in years,'' said Lopez, whose most recent runner-up
finish came in 1997, when she lost by a stroke to Alison Nicholas.
``Last year, I knew in my heart that (Blackwolf Run) was not a
course I was going to win on because it was not one of my
favorites. This course should be more friendly to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played there many times. I know it a lot better than I've
known past U.S. Open courses. I consider that a big plus in my
favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Might that be enough to allow the most celebrated runner-up in
Women's Open history to finally find the winner's circle? Or is
Lopez destined to follow the same career path as Sam Snead, who
owns the PGA Tour record for tournament victories (81) but never
captured a U.S. Open title?
</P>
<P>
   Karrie Webb, the LPGA tour's leading money winner, said Lopez
still has the physical tools to win an Open despite a record that
shows just one tournament triumph since 1993. But Webb wondered
Lopez's mental approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to win a golf tournament, especially when you tell
yourself, `I've got to win this week,' '' Webb said. ``That's a lot
of pressure to put on yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Lopez will be ladling on the self-induced pressure this
week. In her heart, she knows this may be her last, best chance to
fill the one remaining void in an otherwise glittering career.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I never win an Open, I would have to say something would be
missing in my career,'' Lopez said. ``But it's not in God's plans
if it doesn't happen, and I just have to accept that.''
</P>
<P>
   MEMORIAL, GOLF MUSEUM TO PAY TRIBUTE TO HOGAN
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Hogan, widow of Fort Worth golf legend Ben Hogan, will
log significant frequent flyer miles this week while accepting
honors in the name of her late husband.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan, who died in 1997, will be honored Wednesday at the
Memorial Tournament in Dublin, Ohio. Valerie Hogan is scheduled to
attend while tournament officials unveil a plaque in tribute to
Hogan in Memorial Park at Muirfield Village Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Hogan also is scheduled to attend Tuesday's unveiling of
the Ben Hogan Room at the U.S. Golf Association Museum in Far
Hills, N.J. Also known as Golf House, the museum will be home to a
1,000-square-foot display of more than 300 personal items donated
by the Hogan family.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those items, for the past four decades, had been on
display at Colonial Country Club in Fort Worth, Texas. But it was
Hogan's wish for the items to be placed in a museum setting upon
his death, hence the move to Golf House.
</P>
<P>
   More than 20 members from two Fort Worth country clubs, Colonial
and Shady Oaks, have made plans to join Valerie Hogan for Tuesday's
unveiling at Golf House. Included is Marty Leonard, daughter of
Colonial founder Marvin Leonard. The room opens to the public for
the first time June 9. JACK APPEARS BACK
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicklaus considers this week's Memorial Tournament the acid
test in determining whether his artificial left hip will permit him
to play the quality of golf that will make him want to compete in
future major championships.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus, 59, has expressed plans to compete in the 1999 U.S.
Open. But that is contingent upon a satisfactory effort at the
Memorial, which will mark Nicklaus' first appearance at a PGA Tour
event this season. At least one fellow competitor expects big
things from the Golden Bear based on his performance at the Bell
Atlantic Classic, where Nicklaus finished 18th in a Senior Tour
event on May 23.
</P>
<P>
   It marked Nicklaus' first tournament since finishing 13th at the
U.S. Senior Open in July 1998. John Grace, a Fort Worth resident
and Senior Tour competitor, played in both events and said it was
easy to notice the difference in Nicklaus' swing and comfort level
on the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like night and day,'' Grace said. ``He looks so much
better now. Last summer, you could tell he was struggling just to
walk. But when I watched him (last month), Jack's swing looked
fantastic to me.'' PAK'S ADJUSTMENT PERIOD
</P>
<P>
   Se Ri Pak, defending champ at the U.S. Women's Open and 1998
LPGA rookie of the year, finds her game in comparative free fall
heading into Thursday's title defense.
</P>
<P>
   Pak, who claimed two major championships among her four
victories last season, has averaged just $5,424 per start this year
(11 tournaments, $59,669). She does not rank among the LPGA's top
10 in any statistical category.
</P>
<P>
   During the off-season, Pak broke ties with her business manager
and her swing coach, the renowned David Leadbetter. Pak, 21, said
she has found it more difficult to focus on the course this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that easy after last year,'' Pak said. ``I need to
find a better balance with my game and my private life. I need to
focus better on the course. I'm thinking about too many other
things.''

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ One of Yugoslavia's top generals has been
killed by NATO bombing, the first high-ranking casualty of the air
campaign, news reports here said.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Ljubisa Velickovic, the deputy chief of staff and
former air force chief, was killed on Monday night near Belgrade. A
local radio station, Radio Pancevo, which in the past has proved
reliable, reported the death on Tuesday, citing military sources.
The official state news has yet to mention the general's death.
</P>
<P>
   Velickovic was killed while visiting ``first defense lines''
near Belgrade, Radio Pancevo said, most likely an anti-aircraft
unit for which he was responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Velickovic, a pilot by training, was one of the most popular and
respected generals in Yugoslavia, the radio station said. His
funeral will be on Thursday, it said.

   AGUA PRIETA, Mexico _ When Martina Toscano Quiroz gave three of
her seven children up for adoption, her main goal, she said, was to
give them a chance for a better life.
</P>
<P>
   She is a single mother who earns less than $40 a week as a
cleaning woman in this dusty town on the Arizona-Mexico border. Her
home is a fly-infested shack with dirt floors and walls patched
together from scraps of wood.
</P>
<P>
   But, she acknowledged, her decisions were not entirely noble.
The lawyer who took her children to live with middle class families
in New York made promises so enormous, she said, that it was as if
he had offered her the stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he would build me two rooms with new tin for the
roof and strong brick walls,'' she said. ``And he told me he would
build me a bathroom with a toilet and a faucet.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Toscano, 30, never got her new house. She said the lawyer,
Mario Manuel Reyes Burgueno, took her daughters _ ages 8, 4 and 2 _
and then told her he could only give her a few hundred pesos for
food.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Reyes and two women on New York's Long Island, Arlene
Lieberman and Arlene Reingold, were arrested and charged with
running a cross-border baby-smuggling ring. The government says
they sold Ms. Toscano's children and at least 14 others to couples
in New York for as much as $22,000 each. Mrs. Liebermand and Mrs.
Reingold have declined to comment, while lawyers and friends of
Reyes have suggested that he was trying to help poor women and
their children.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the arrests, some of the adoptive parents said
they were the unwitting victims of a scheme that lured them into
expensive and illegal agreements and that took advantage of their
desperation to have children.
</P>
<P>
   But in this isolated patch of the U.S.-Mexican border, worlds
away from the comfortable homes of Long Island, the view of these
adoption agreements is even more complicated and tragic. Social
workers here said they counsel dozens of mothers like Ms. Toscano,
who are in such dire economic and social distress that they broker
their children for money or shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Several lawyers around the area, social workers said, have made
offers to buy children from poor mothers. But, the social workers
said, the lawyers usually renege on their part of the deals once
the children have been delivered to families in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had attorneys come here and offer me $100 for every
child I give to them for adoptions,'' said Eunicia Soto, who runs
an independent orphanage called Rancho Feliz at the eastern edge of
Agua Prieta. ``I tell them my children are not tomatoes for sale,
and that I never want to see them on my property again.''
</P>
<P>
   But such defiance can only go so far, and government officials
said that there is so much smuggling of drugs and humans across
this border _ a wide-open space divided, mostly, by barbed-wire
fencing _ that they cannot stop the trade. Smuggling has long been
a pillar of the economy and culture of Agua Prieta, with a
population of 130,000, and Douglas, its much-smaller sister city in
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, border patrol agents discovered a high-tech
tunnel, 30 feet beneath the desert floor, that had electric
lighting, concrete reinforcement and hydraulic lifts and had been
used to transport tons of cocaine into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And in recent years, as the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service has intensified its patrols along the border in El Paso to
the east and in San Diego in the west, a steady stream of illegal
immigrants has been funneled into the United States through
Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that as many as 1,000 illegal immigrants are
apprehended around Douglas each day, more than at any other INS
station along the 1,900-mile border between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real illegal universe,'' said Keoki Skinner, a
former journalist who runs juice bars on both sides of the border.
``There's so much illegal activity that goes on here that a lot of
people seemed numb to it. But the idea that babies are part of the
illegal traffic has really shocked a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like, things have gotten really bad if women are offering
to sell their babies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Martina Toscano, life was beyond bad. Short and pudgy and
with a worn, tan face that makes her look much older than her age,
Ms. Toscano said she moved to Agua Prieta 15 years ago from a small
village some 100 miles away. There was no work in her village, she
said, so she and her brother moved to the border to work in the
factories known as maquiladoras, which are owned by companies in
the United States. Within two months of moving here, she said, she
was pregnant with her first child.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted a husband and a family,'' she said. ``I met a man who
offered to marry me and take care of me, so I gave myself to him.''
</P>
<P>
   But after the baby was born, the child's father abandoned Ms.
Toscano, and her mother moved to town to help her take care of the
child. But two years later came another man with promises, and
another baby was born. Then another man and another.
</P>
<P>
   After her sixth child was born, Ms. Toscano said, she met a
woman who offered to help place some of the children for adoption
in the United States. Ms. Toscano said she refused. But on the next
day, a tall, broad man knocked on her door.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time she had met Mario Reyes, she said. His
words, she said, hit her like stones.

 AGUA PRIETA, Mexico: like stones.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``He told me, `Look at how you live,''' she recalled. ``He told
me that my children could have better lives in the United States.
He promised that he would find them nice families who would love
them and send them to school.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she yelled at Reyes, telling him that he had no right
to judge the way she lived; that she did the best she could to
provide for her children and that they were comfortable in their
lopsided shack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then he told me that if I gave him my children, he would help
me to live better,'' she said. ``He told me he would build me two
rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Reyes took two of Ms. Toscano's children: 8-year-old Flor
Azucena and 4-year-old Zoitza. He promised that the two girls would
be placed together in the same home, she said, and that their
adoptive parents would send photographs and updates on how the
girls were adjusting.
</P>
<P>
   But the girls were separated almost immediately, she said. Flor
Azucena went to the home of John and Rosalie Liberto in Suffolk
County, on Long Island. Zoitza's whereabouts remain unknown.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, she said, Reyes sent Ms. Toscano's 2-year-old
daughter, Gabriela, to live with the Libertos.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Liberto said in an interview that she and her husband paid
Reyes, Ms. Lieberman and Ms. Reingold more than $50,000 for
Gabriela and Flor Azucena, whom they called Nicole.
</P>
<P>
   ``With that money I could have built a mansion and 10
bathrooms,'' Ms. Toscano scowled. ``But I am still here, living in
filth.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Flor Azucena's American parents agreed to send her
back to Agua Prieta because she missed her mother so badly.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Liberto cried when she was asked why she agreed to let Flor
Azucena go. The decision, she said, arose from memories of growing
up poor and being sent every year to a summer camp in Pennsylvania.
It was the most beautiful place she had ever seen, Mrs. Liberto
said. But after a few days, she recalled, she was crying and
pleading to go home. ``A family bond is something you cannot
break,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had to send her to her mother,'' she said of Flor
Azucena. ``After she left, you would have thought there was a death
in the family. It was one of the only times I ever saw my husband
cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Flor Azucena, sitting on the dank double bed she shares with two
of her siblings in Agua Prieta, described her Long Island parents
as kind and loving. But, she said, ``I wanted to be with my
mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Showing pictures to a visitor, she recalled her time in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is my bedroom,'' she said, pointing to a photograph of
her sitting on a bed with a fluffy, flowered comforter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is me at my aunt's baby shower,'' she said, looking at a
picture of herself wearing a silvery velvet dress, with a shiny
headband in her hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my best friend,'' she said, showing a photo of herself
standing in a tight embrace with a freckle-faced red-headed girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my mom and dad,'' she said, stopping the show for a
moment to gaze at a picture of the Libertos.
</P>
<P>
   Soon to turn 11, Flor Azucena looks almost nothing like the
soft, confident girl in the photos. Her complexion is uneven, her
hair is tangled and as she speaks, she stares at the ground.
</P>
<P>
   She does not go to school here, she said, because of fights she
has had with other children. So while her mother is at work, she
spends her days watching programs on an old television set and
playing on the field of dust outside her house with her three
siblings: 12-year-old Aurelia, who also does not go to school,
4-year-old Edgar and 1-year-old Ameirani. A 15-year-old brother
lives with Ms. Toscano's mother elsewhere in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The family's plight is not uncommon, said Ms. Soto, of Rancho
Feliz. She organizes child-care workshops for single women in town
who do not earn enough money to support their children. Some of the
women, she said, turn to prostitution.
</P>
<P>
   In the most desperate cases, she said, mothers give up their
children for money or other things. One of her clients, she said,
had given away her baby so that she could get electricity installed
in her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of things are not common, but they do happen,''
Ms. Soto said. ``When I work with these mothers, my main message to
them is that they do not have to give their children away in order
to survive. They can make it, if they try. And I tell them that I
will help them.''
</P>
<P>
   That message kept Guadalupe Serrano's family together. Ms.
Serrano, 34, a mother of four, said she was a recovering drug
addict who used to support her habit with prostitution. Two years
ago, she said, she was approached by a lawyer who offered her
$10,000 for her toddler. Ms. Serrano refused to name the lawyer,
but she said it was not Reyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me that she would have a good life and that people in
the United States wanted children so much that they are willing to
pay a lot of money,'' Ms. Serrano recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Ms. Serrano works at Rancho Feliz and raises her children
in a cottage there. Speaking about her daughter, Olivia, who is now
4, she said, ``I would have given her away.'' But Ms. Soto would
not let her: ``She made me feel ashamed for thinking about it,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Toscano, however, has no regrets about sending her children
to the United States. Although she would like to know more about
Zoitza, she regularly gets pictures from the Libertos of her
daughter, Gabriela.
</P>
<P>
   ``The life they have there is better than what they could have
here,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Flor Azucena, staring at the ground, nodded in agreement.

TRIMMER HOWARD LEADS TCU INTO NCAA OUTDOOR TRACK MEET
</HEADLINE>
 CHAMPIONSHIPS-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDY FRIEDLANDER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bryan Howard realized how fast he could be when he felt his
slowest.
</P>
<P>
   TCU's top sprinter didn't feel quite so fleet at the Western
Athletic Conference track meet on May 22, when he struggled with
asthma. Yet he still finished with his fastest time of the year in
the 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
   His time of 20.14 seconds gave him a No. 4 national ranking in
the event heading into the NCAA Outdoor Track and Field
Championships, which begin Wednesday at Bronco Stadium in Boise,
Idaho. The senior from Moreno Valley, Calif., also clocked a 10.13
in the 100 meters, which matched his previous best in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Even more encouraging was his ability to run stride-for-stride
with defending NCAA 100 meters champion Leonard Myles-Mills of
Brigham Young, who beat Howard by .03 seconds in the 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
   ``My asthma was flaring up and I didn't have my inhaler with
me,'' Howard said. ``Plus I started cramping up in the 100.
Considering all of that, to run that fast felt good. I felt I could
have run faster. And Leonard, well, I figured if I can run with
him, I can run with anyone. Well, I ran with him and I could have
beaten him.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard didn't think anything of the sort a year ago when he
plodded through a season overweight and out of shape after
transferring from Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 NCAA indoor champion in the 55 meters, Howard left
Auburn in the messy wake of coach Harvey Glance's resignation and
was out of training for months before reporting to TCU in January
of 1998 weighing 196 pounds, nearly 25 more than his current
weight. He sat out the indoor season _ ``I didn't want to embarrass
myself,'' he said _ and felt he had hit bottom in a difficult
outdoor season.
</P>
<P>
   But Howard amazed himself by earning a spot in the national top
10 with a 10.19 100 meters and running a powerful leadoff leg on
the Horned Frogs' NCAA champion 4x100 team, which ran a collegiate
record 38.04.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, I was shocked,'' Howard said. ``I don't know how I
managed to run 10.19. Last year, I never felt right, but I came
back as a contender. After last season, I knew something good was
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Now in top shape at 173 pounds, the 5-foot-11 Howard said he
will challenge Myles-Mills, second-seeded Coby Miller of Auburn and
No. 1 John Capel of Florida, who ran 19.99 three weeks ago, for the
national championship. To that end, he declined an invitation to
run in the 100 meters despite his No. 8 national ranking in order
to concentrate on the 200 meters and the 4x100 relay.
</P>
<P>
   TCU coach Monte Stratton said the lighter workload will give
Howard an advantage over the other top contenders, all of whom will
double in the 100 and 200 meters. Myles-Mills and Capel will also
run on relay teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The double is not impossible, but it's very difficult,''
Stratton said. ``To win it, you'd have to run six rounds of sprints
against the highest-level competition, as well as two rounds of the
relay. This way, he'll be fresher and his strength will be more of
a factor in the 200.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard will need that strength to give TCU the lead in the relay
against the likes of Florida, Southern Cal and Brigham Young. That
will be essential in the final because the Frogs will be running
without their regular No. 3 man, Lindel Frater, who is out with a
hamstring injury.
</P>
<P>
   With Johnny Collins, normally a 400-meter specialist, replacing
Frater on a squad that also included Jarmiene Holloway and `Flash'
Williams, the Frogs ran a best time of 38.84, not quite up to the
national-best 38.64 they posted with Frater, but still good enough
to make TCU the team to beat, especially if Williams is back to 100
percent after missing a month with a hamstring injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``If `Flash' is full speed, we're ready for anyone,'' Stratton
said, ``and he's been running full out in practice. We won't be the
prohibitive favorite like we would if we had our A team. Without
them, we're just one of the boys. But we have as good a chance as
any of the boys. We'll be right there with all of them.'' nn

AFTER THREE-MONTH RECESS, MICROSOFT TRIAL RESUMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a three-month recess and unsuccessful efforts
to reach a settlement, the rebuttal phase of the Microsoft
antitrust trial opened on Tuesday with a concerted attack on the
previous testimony of the company's chief economic witness.
</P>
<P>
   In the attack, Franklin M. Fisher, a professor of economics at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who is testifying on
behalf of the government for the second time, called the economic
analysis of Richard L. Schmalensee, his former student and a fellow
economist at MIT, ``peculiar,'' ``ridiculous,'' ``credulous'' and
naive.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher is the first of six witnesses, three for each side, who
are to take the stand in this, the final stage of testimony that is
intended to allow the government and the Microsoft Corp. to rebut
charges made during the earlier stage of the trial. Schmalensee, a
dean at MIT's Sloan School of Management, will return to the stand
later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from federal district Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson, lawyers for both sides have agreed to complete all of the
rebuttal testimony by July 4. Government officials say that in this
time, they hope to fill some holes in their case _ while doing
nothing to damage the commanding advantage they believe they
already hold, based on Micrsoft's lackluster performance in court
during the earlier portion of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft intends to challenge the credibility of the other
side's case, a strategy that proved effective for David Boies, the
government's lead trial lawyer, in his earlier questioning of
Microsoft witnesses. But by its choice of witnesses and topics of
emphasis, Microsoft also appears to be trying to mitigate damages,
to soften the possible remedies, should it be found to have
violated antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   Both Fisher and Schmalensee testified at length earlier in the
trial on the question of whether Microsoft holds a legal monopoly
in personal-computer operating systems _ a critical question that
will determine what kind of remedies can be applied if the
government prevails.
</P>
<P>
   In his testimony early this year, Schmalensee tried to make the
case that Microsoft was not a monopoly, largely by suggesting that
the few, marginal competitors Microsoft now faces, or others, could
conceivably become serious challengers in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher tried on Monday to puncture that argument, saying, ``Just
because there are unknown future threats does not mean Microsoft
doesn't have a monopoly today.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies led Fisher through a carefully choreographed series of
questions during the direct examination _ a new practice for this
trial. Earlier, witnesses submitted their direct testimony in
writing.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher called several of Schmalensee's analyses ``reasonably
confused,'' adding at one point, in a discussion of market
dominance, ``I don't think Dean Schmalensee understood this
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Boies led Fisher through a critical dissection
of several charts and graphics that Schmalensee had offered as
evidence. Fisher argued that in several of them, his colleague had
made incorrect assumptions and offered improper numbers, leading to
erroneous conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Schmalensee had tried to make the case that
Microsoft was charging too little for Windows _ something a
monopolist was unlikely to do. He had then offered a complex
economic formula for a realistic price.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday afternoon, Fisher said, ``he made a big
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Schmalensee's formula put the average price of a personal
computer at $2,000 or $2,500, when, in fact, the average price is
now about $950, Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   The witness also criticized Schmalensee's analysis of the market
share for Microsoft's Internet Explorer browser, which showed
Netscape as a strong competitor. By Fisher's analysis, Internet
Explorer now has about 62 percent of the corporate market compared
with 38 percent for Netscape, a unit of America Online.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Fisher said, it did not really matter whether
Microsoft had 40 percent of the browser market, or 60 percent or 80
percent.
</P>
<P>
   A central tenet of the government's case is that Microsoft
fought to crush Netscape because Microsoft feared that Netscape's
browser could one day be used as an alternative to the Windows
operating system. If that happened, Microsoft would lose its
crucial advantage, the fact that software developers write programs
for Windows first.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal was not necessarily to drive Netscape to zero,''
Fisher said. It was, he said, to make sure that Netscape did not
maintain a market share that would ever allow sofware developers to
write for Netscape alone. So by that measure, Fisher said,
``Microsoft has already won.''

 &HT;    Amnesty International issues a scathing report on Texas'
clemency system
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Amnesty International, an anti-death penalty
group that monitors abuses of justice around the world, says in a
new report that Texas' secretive clemency process for condemned
criminals violates minimum safeguards for human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The organization usually reserves such criticism for overseas
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a jurisdiction that executes more people than any other in
the Western World, Texas has turned the final safeguard of
executive clemency into nothing more than an empty gesture,''
according to a report the group released Tuesday. Texas is one of
38 U.S. states with the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles _ which recommends to the
governor whether to commute sentences to life in prison or grant
temporary reprieves _ has been widely criticized in recent months
for not thoroughly reviewing cases, not holding meetings and not
conducting its business in public. The board has granted clemency
only once in 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   Such a system, the Amnesty International report said, ``violates
minimum human rights safeguards by failing to provide any genuine
opportunity for death row inmates to seek and obtain the reduction
of their sentences.''
</P>
<P>
   Victor Rodriguez, chairman of the 18-member parole board ,
dismissed the criticism as unfounded and unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amnesty International is against the death penalty, so their
conclusions are not surprising in the least,'' he said. ``The
standard in this country that guides us for fairness and equity is
constitutionality. Texas has a fair and constitutional system, and
the courts repeatedly have said that.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the report Tuesday, Gov. George W. Bush, who
appoints the parole board members, said the clemency system has
withstood court challenge. ``The courts have looked at it. It's
fine,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said he believes the report is timed to coincide with
an orchestrated protest over the scheduled June 17 execution of
Joseph Stanley Faulder, twice convicted of murdering an East Texas
woman during a robbery.
</P>
<P>
   The Amnesty International report noted that the U.S. Supreme
Court affirmed the need for a meaningful clemency process when it
re-approved capital punishment in 1976. The organization contends
Texas' system falls far short of what the high court had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Far from serving as the fail-safe mechanism envisaged by the
U.S. Supreme Court, the Texas (Board of Pardons and Paroles) had
become something akin to a hostile and secretive agency interested
only in preserving the illusion of meaningful clemency review,''
the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report cites several cases, including Houston pickax killer
Karla Faye Tucker. She was unanimously rejected for clemency even
though supporters insisted she was a born-again Christian who no
longer posed a threat to society. Although the Texas Court of
Criminal Appeals rejected her court challenge, a dissenting opinion
from Judge Morris Overstreet described the clemency process as
``totally inadequate'' and ``a legal fiction at best,'' because the
overwhelming majority of petitions are denied.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate court challenge, Danny Lee Barber and Faulder took
the board to an Austin federal court last December where testimony
revealed that only a handful of 4,000 letters in support of
Faulder's clemency were forwarded to board members; some board
members had little or no memory of the case they had decided amid a
flurry of publicity; and board members do not meet to decide cases.
They review the files privately and vote by telephone and fax
machine. Although U.S. District Judge Sam Sparks upheld the
constitutionality of Texas' clemency system, he sharply criticized
it. ``A flip of the coin would be more merciful than these votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said the criticisms are misplaced. He said the board
recently has changed its rules to give members more time to review
filings and to allow convicts face-to-face meetings with board
members. Mark Warren, a coordinator in Amnesty International's
Canadian section who helped compile the report, said he hopes the
report's conclusions do not go unheeded. At present, he said,
Texas' clemency process offers little public assurance that someone
will be executed who should not be.
</P>
<P>
   ``That safety net is in tatters now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Ward writes for the Austin American-Statesman, Austin,
Texas.

GORE MAKES BID FOR VOTE OF WOMEN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hoping to bolster his standing with female voters
that have been vital to past Democratic victories, Al Gore vowed
Tuesday to protect abortion rights and to pursue health care,
education and gun-control initiatives that are popular with women.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president made his pitch at a ``Women for Gore'' event
where his White House bid was endorsed by first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton and a host of prominent female politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will formally announce his presidential bid June 16 in his
hometown of Carthage, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   The women's event was intended to energize a constituency that
was crucial to Bill Clinton's two White House victories but has
been less enthusiastic about his vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Early surveys show a softness in support for Gore among women
and a willingness to consider top Republican contenders for the
White House, Texas Gov. George W. Bush and former Red Cross chief
Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   ``In comparison to Clinton, Gore has less of that empathetic
quality, the ``he understands my problems''' said Andrew Kohut, who
directs polling for the Pew Research Center. A recent Pew survey
had Gore trailing Bush and Dole among women, although not as badly
as among men.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and his supporters have clearly felt pressured to emphasize
the vice president's commitment to women's issues and his intention
to continue popular initiatives begun during the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president recited a laundry list of measures targeted
at female voters, such as making preschool available to all
children, increasing breast cancer research funding and cracking
down on guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get guns away from our children and criminals,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said many of his proposals were tailored to modern
families, such as extending the Family Medical Leave Act to give
parents time so they can meet with their children's teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of sentimentalizing families that no longer exist,
let's give families the help they need,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also pounded on an issue that has been critical to Democrats'
success with many women, particularly young professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Although he never actually used the word ``abortion,'' Gore made
it clear that he supported the right of women to choose to end
their pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will always, always defend a woman's right to choose,'' said
Gore to loud applause. He emphasized that he intended to block
Republican efforts to chip away at abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time Congress has tried to play politics with that
fundamental personal right in imposing gag rules and attaching anti
-choice language to any bill they can think of, we have stopped
them,'' he said. ``If they try it after the year 2000, with your
help I'll stop them. That hard won right will be safe with me as
your president.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's unequivocal support for abortion rights clearly
differentiates him from his Republican opponents, including Bush,
who successfully prodded the Legislature this session to pass a law
requiring parents to be notified before their minor daughters could
get an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also cited the influence of his mother, Pauline, who he
said was one of the first women to graduate from Vanderbilt law
school. And he lauded the work on mental health spearheaded by his
wife, Tipper, who earlier had lavished praise on her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want America to know the Al Gore I love,'' she said. Tipper
Gore also noted the political axiom that clearly she hopes holds
true in November of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we all know from past elections, when women vote, Democrats
win,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, who is extremely popular with professional
women, also lauded Gore for pushing issues that affect women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore has been out in front for women, for families and
children throughout his life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats, however, have fretted that Hillary Clinton's
ability to help Gore will be hampered by her own political
ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore will have the backing of other political women,
including a number of prominent members of Congress and state
legislatures. The campaign said Gore had received 4,500 pledges of
support from women in every state .
</P>
<P>
   One of those backers is Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, who
complimented Gore's commitment to education.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston congresswoman told the crowd that Gore ``will not
have to stutter over whether teachers get increased pay or improve
the quality of teaching. He will stand front and center and say
teachers are the backbone of America.''
</P>
<P>
   But even in the largely supportive Democratic audience there
were voices of ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm waiting for him to win me over,'' said 25-year old Bronwen
Clark, who works for a Democratic consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Her colleague Tonya Koslo, 30, added, ``He's going to have to
prove himself a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore also had a defender in Abby Rozen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like the only person who likes him in my office. He has a
lot of integrity,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rozen, 25, said she recognizes that Gore has not been a good
campaigner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a tin ear,'' she said. ``He can sing loudly, but not on
key.''
</P>

NO DEFENDANTS TAKE STAND AS DEFENSE RESTS IN LOUIMA CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a month of often graphic accounts and a
dramatic midtrial guilty plea by one defendant, testimony in the
Abner Louima police brutality case sputtered to an end Tuesday when
the only officer who had said he would take the witness stand
changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Sgt. Michael Bellomo, who is charged with trying
to cover up part of the assault on Louima by other officers, means
that none of the defendants have testified in their own defense.
</P>
<P>
   Bellomo had been the only one of the defendants whose lawyer had
said at the trial's start that he planned to take the stand, but
the sergeant told reporters Tuesday that he decided over the long
holiday weekend not to testify after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I re-evaluated it,'' Bellomo, 37, said outside the courtroom
in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn. He said that all the evidence
that the jury needed about his role in the case had already entered
the record through other witnesses, so that his testimony was no
longer required.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors from the U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn say that
Bellomo tried to cover up the beating of Louima in a police car by
four officers after Louima was arrested following a melee outside a
Brooklyn nightclub. One of those officers, Justin Volpe, pleaded
guilty last week to participating in the beating in the police car
and with ramming a stick in Louima's rectum in a restroom at the
70th Precinct station house in Brooklyn. Bellomo is not charged
with participating in any of the assaults or with trying to cover
up the restroom attack.
</P>
<P>
   The sergeant's lawyer, John Patten, told reporters that ``if
you're in trouble'' in a trial, ``you have nothing to lose'' by
taking the witness stand, but that considering the evidence
presented in the trial, ``we felt we were in a good position.''
</P>
<P>
   So Tuesday, instead of hearing Bellomo personally deny the
cover-up charge and watch him try to hold his own under
cross-examination, jurors and spectators heard only two brief
witnesses whom the sergeant's lawyer had called to testify about
specific points in his case.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the three officers still on trial had rested their
defenses earlier Tuesday or last week after calling few or no
witnesses, so once Bellomo's two witnesses had concluded, Judge
Eugene Nickerson told the jurors that they would hear closing
arguments Wednesday and begin deliberating Thursday after he
instructs them on the laws governing the case.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors will not have to deliberate on the most notorious
defendant in the case _ the one prosecutors painted as Louima's
chief torturer in the police station restroom _ because that
defendant, Volpe, interrupted the trial on May 25 to plead guilty
to various accusations, including the attack in the restroom.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that the assault occurred after Louima was
arrested in a street melee and that Volpe mistakenly believed that
it was Louima who had punched him during the brawl.
</P>
<P>
   They said that the restroom attack tore Louima's rectum and
bladder, requiring two months of hospitalization and three
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe, who was dismissed from the police force, could be
sentenced to up to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say that the three men still on trial with Bellomo _
Officers Charles Schwarz, Thomas Bruder and Thomas Wiese _ also
took part in the assault in the police car, and that Schwarz held
Louima down while Volpe assaulted him in the restroom.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors have charged that Bellomo also tried to cover up
an assault by Volpe on another man, Patrick Antoine, after the
street brawl.
</P>
<P>
   Because Louima and Antoine, both Haitian immigrants, are black,
and the officers are white, the case has had bitter racial
overtones.

<P>
   PRINCETON, N.J. _ As a high school student 50 years ago, Stanley
Katz thought Princeton University was paradise, a place inhabited
by pipe-smoking scholars with patches on their elbows and
mustaches. ``I said, `Katz, that's you.'''
</P>
<P>
   But as he learned more about Princeton, it dawned on him ``that
this was the last place in the Ivy League _ except maybe Dartmouth
_ that was for me,'' he said. ``It became clear to me that if not
anti-Semitic, it wasn't congenial to Jews.'' He went to Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Today Katz is a Princeton professor and president-elect of its
Center for Jewish Life, and the university is a far more welcoming
place. The president, the provost and the dean of the college are
Jewish. So are many of the faculty members. Katz's center is a
lively place, with a large kosher kitchen and a stream of events,
from casino nights and swing dances to Talmud classes and Friday
night services.
</P>
<P>
   So how can it be, Katz and other Jews on campus are asking, that
Princeton's Jewish enrollment has fallen by nearly half since the
early 1980s _ to about 10 percent, or about 450 undergraduates,
from a high of 18 percent? Why do other Ivy League campuses _
Harvard, Yale, Columbia, Penn _ manage to keep Jewish populations
of at least a quarter and in some cases more than a third? (The
figures, drawn from surveys by the University of California at Los
Angeles that ask first-year college students their religious
preferences, are considered rough estimates.)
</P>
<P>
   The decline in Jewish enrollment at Princeton is not new: the
surveys suggest that it reached the present level in the early
'90s. And the figures closely track a nationwide pattern; the
percentage of college students who identify themselves as Jews has
declined steadily over the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   But in April, a series of front-page articles in The Daily
Princetonian, the student newspaper, called attention to the
decline and touched off a campuswide debate.
</P>
<P>
   It is a touchy subject, and not just because Princeton thought
it had long since put to rest its ancient reputation for
anti-Semitism. Many Jews and non-Jews on campus point out that even
at 10 percent, Princeton's Jewish enrollment far exceeds the Jewish
makeup of the general population, which is roughly two percent.
(Minority enrollment _ black, Hispanic and Asian-American students
_ is now 27 percent, not markedly different from the general
population.)
</P>
<P>
   And some Jewish students and professors say they fear the
discussion could make matters worse, by discouraging Jewish high
school students from applying to Princeton. ``This series of
articles likely hurt the likelihood of Princeton gaining more
Jewish students,'' a sophomore, Rebecca Opdyke, wrote in a letter
to the student newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Other Jewish students protested that the articles did not
capture the rich lives they lead at Princeton, not only in terms of
religion, but also socially and educationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Princeton is labeled as a school Jews don't go to, but
that's not true,'' said Todd S. Rich, a junior economics major from
East Brunswick who is president of the Center for Jewish Life.
``We're thriving.''
</P>
<P>
   The center has even set up a task force to consider what it
might do ``to counter this negative image,'' said Princeton's
rabbi, James S. Diamond. ``The reality is that the quality of
Jewish life here is probably as good as anywhere in the country,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Princeton, the history of anti-Semitism is tangled with the
college's exclusive private eating clubs, whose anti-Semitism was
visible as recently as 1958, when they denied bids to nearly two
dozen students, many of them Jewish. Today, not only are Jews
welcomed at the clubs _ at roughly half now, members simply sign up
for the club of their choice _ but some Jewish students even cite
the clubs as one of Princeton's attractions.
</P>
<P>
   The comfortable intertwining was visible one recent Friday
evening when some students attended Shabbat services in tuxedos and
ball gowns; they were going directly from the Jewish center to the
eating clubs, which celebrate the last day of classes with
black-tie dinners.
</P>
<P>
   The changes in the clubs are not the only sign of Princeton's
openness to Jews. William G. Bowen, Princeton's president from 1972
to 1988, signaled his interest in drawing more Jewish students in
several ways. He visited Jewish day schools. He invited the
chancellor of the Jewish Theological Seminary to deliver the annual
year-end baccalaureate address. He created a kosher dining hall on
campus. And he initiated plans for the Center for Jewish Life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it was very important that Princeton be much more
inclusive in all of dimensions than it had been, and I and others
made an effort to make the place be more welcoming to Jews and
others,'' Bowen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think about it in terms of numbers,'' he added. ``I
thought about it as a group of students who were outstanding and
who weren't coming to the university in the numbers they should
have, based on what they had to offer. Or if they came, they
weren't getting involved in the life of the university.''
</P>
<P>
   Some faculty members say that after Bowen's departure, there was
a relaxation of efforts to reach out to high school students _
including Jews _ who might otherwise see Princeton as an
upper-crust enclave where they would not fit in. ``The point about
perceptions and images is that you have to work hard to maintain
them,'' a history professor said. ``In the '70s and '80s they were
beginning to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is advocating affirmative action for Jews. Fred A.
Hargadon, Princeton's dean of admissions, says his office does not
consider religion at all and does not view the religious
composition of other colleges as a useful measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``No two colleges do it the same way,'' he said, ``and we don't
all admit the same 1,000 kids.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He says his office visits Jewish schools like any other high
school. This month, for example, he visited the Hebrew Academy of
the Five Towns and Rockaway High School in Cedarhurst on Long
Island, a meeting that drew nearly 600 students and parents.
Princeton took one of the academy's three applicants this year and
put another on its waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Vitow, the high school's principal, said the five-hour
visit was evidence of Princeton's interest in his students.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a senior admissions person to do this sent a very clear
message that he's very favorably disposed to our kids,'' Dr. Vitow
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Albert Goetz, a college adviser at another Jewish day
school, the Ramaz School on Manhattan's East Side, says Princeton
seems less interested in his top students than 10 or 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Princeton is a Garden of Eden for our kids,'' he said. ``It's
close to New York. It's beautiful. And you can be Jewish there. We
just can't get access.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Princeton's Jewish faculty members say the discussion
about Jewish students has put Harold Shapiro, the university's
president, in a difficult position because he feels that as a Jew
he cannot recruit Jewish students as actively as Bowen did.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro said he saw no bias against Jewish students in
Princeton's admissions procedures. But he added, ``If there's
something we're doing that consciously or unconsciously
discriminates against any religion, then we should stop it, but no
one has presented me with any evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   He goes further, expressing dismay that anyone should think
about students based on their religion. ``As you know, I'm Jewish,
and not only am I Jewish, but I'm very active in the Jewish
community,'' he said. ``I know how dangerous it is to be
categorized this way.''
</P>
<P>
   One answer to those concerned about the number of Jewish
students may be an expansion of the student body. A faculty and
administration committee that studied Princeton's admissions
process last year concluded that the college was turning away many
desirable applicants because of its size. (Princeton takes about
1,150 freshmen, compared to about 1,600 at Harvard and 1,350 at
Yale.)
</P>
<P>
   The committee recommended that the college expand its entering
class by 125 to 150 students. President Shapiro and Dean Hargadon
both back such expansion and the trustees are studying the
proposal.

THE SABRES CROSS OVER THE BORDER TO FINALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ When travelers cross the border between Canada and the
United States, the customs and immigration officers usually pose
the same set of questions, including: How long have you been in the
other country? Did you acquire any goods? Do you have anything to
declare?
</P>
<P>
   Imagine what it must have been for the traveling Buffalo Sabres,
who early Tuesday morning crossed the bridge over the Niagara River
at the end of their two-hour bus trip from Toronto. A few hours
earlier, they had defeated the Maple Leafs, 4-2, to clinch the
Eastern Conference finals by 4 games to 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres had been in Canada only two days, long enough to
qualify for their first trip to the finals in 24 years. What goods
did they acquire? Only the Prince of Wales trophy, which the
captain Michael Peca refused to touch when it was presented. As for
declarations, they do declare that they want to win one more trophy
before calling it a summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the big one they want to carry around,'' said Buffalo
coach Lindy Ruff. ``They are focused on the big, silver trophy.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be the Stanley Cup, won the previous two seasons by
the Detroit Red Wings, who were eliminated this spring in the
second round. The Sabres played for it only once, in 1975, but lost
in the finals to the Philadelphia Flyers. Although they will
probably be underdogs to either the Colorado Avalanche or the
Dallas Stars _ who played each other in Game 6 on Tuesday night _
the two Western Conference teams have worn each other down in a
stirring series and Buffalo will be healthy and rested.
</P>
<P>
   An Avalanche victory in Game 6 would mean the finals between
Colorado and Buffalo would begin on Saturday night in Denver. A
Stars victory would force Game 7 on Friday night in Dallas, meaning
the championship round would begin on Tuesday night in the home
rink of the Western Conference winner. No matter whom they face,
the Sabres will be in good shape.
</P>
<P>
   Dominik Hasek, Buffalo's star goalie from the Czech Republic,
seems to be over the groin injury that kept him out of the first
two games of the Toronto series. Peca, their leader from North
York, Ontario, centers a powerful two-way line with Vaclav Varada
and Dixon Ward on the wings. This threesome can score and check the
best opposing attackers. The Sabres' top defensive pairing combines
Aleksei Zhitnik, from Ukraine, and Richard Smehlik, from the Czech
Republic, who are approaching the prime years of their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Their leading scorer during the season was Miroslav Satan, who
led the team in regular-season goals with 40 but missed most of the
tournament with a bruised foot. He returned three games ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres are a young team, with only five regular players over
age 30. In the past two seasons, they have endured turmoil and
churn, changing uniform designs, arenas, a half-dozen key players,
a coach, a general manager and franchise ownership. Because they
play in a mid-sized, Eastern city that is overshadowed by news
media centers like Toronto and New York, the Sabres have snuck up
on casual sports fans, even though Hasek has won the Hart trophy
for the past two seasons as the most valuable player in the sport,
even though the Sabres reached the third round last season before
losing to the Washington Capitals.
</P>
<P>
   Maple Leafs coach Pat Quinn noted that perception of the Sabres
changed slower than the reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, all the credit went to Dom and he is terrific,''
Quinn said of Hasek. ``But they allowed their team to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   The scoring is balanced, making it hard for opponents to focus
on any one player or line. The leading point-producer in the
playoffs is defenseman Jason Woolley, with 13 points, 3 of them
goals. The leading goal-scorer is Curtis Brown, a center, with 7.
Three players have 12 points and two have 10.
</P>
<P>
   In only 6 playoff games, Satan has 3 goals and 4 assists. As a
group, they should make a good opponent and could produce a good
series. The National Hockey League certainly needs one. The last
four finals have ended in four-game sweeps, with the Western
Conference team winning the past three. &QL;

MORALES CASE DRAWS INTEREST OF FEDERAL GRAND JURY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A federal grand jury in Austin has subpoenaed
records from Attorney General John Cornyn dealing with his
investigation of Dan Morales' hiring of Houston lawyer Marc Murr in
the state's tobacco lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn has accused Morales, the former attorney general, and
Murr of falsifying signatures and backdating contracts to try to
fraudulently secure $260 million in legal fees for Murr, a longtime
Morales friend.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn, who succeeded Morales on Jan. 1, has repeatedly said
that the FBI was looking into Murr's role in the tobacco case. But
the subpoena is the first independent confirmation that the federal
investigation has reached a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn said the subpoena is ``hard evidence'' that grand jurors
are going to try to determine ``if allegations of civil fraud rise
to the level of criminal fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Chronicle obtained a copy of the subpoena from the
attorney general under an open records request.
</P>
<P>
   It was unknown if any other subpoenas had been issued.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators have consistently declined to acknowledge
an investigation, and neither Morales nor Murr returned phone
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Morales has previously denied Cornyn's allegations. He also has
insisted that Murr played a crucial role in the landmark tobacco
case, often as a behind-the-scenes adviser.
</P>
<P>
   But other lawyers have said that Murr did little work on the
case, and his name didn't publicly surface until about the time the
lawsuit was settled in January 1998. The settlement netted Texas
$17.3 billion from tobacco companies, payable over the next 25
years.
</P>
<P>
   Murr withdrew a claim for about $260 million in legal fees on
May 6, one day after Cornyn alleged, in a filing in federal court,
that Murr's contracts had been doctored.
</P>
<P>
   But Murr still stands to receive $1 million from the case. That
amount, which is to be paid by cigarette makers, was awarded in
December by a national arbitration panel, which set legal fees in
the tobacco litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The same national arbitrators awarded $3.3 billion to a team of
five other outside lawyers hired by Morales for the case.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn's subpoena, which is dated May 20, calls for him to
produce ``any and all documents relating to internal investigations
conducted by the attorney general's office involving Marc Murr.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These documents should include, but not be limited to,
affidavits, statements, correspondence, computer records, phone
records and visitor logs,'' the subpoena states.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn was directed to provide the documents by June 15. The
attorney general said he didn't believe he was required to
personally testify before grand jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn, whose jurisdiction is primarily civil, said his
investigation of the Murr case ``for all intents and purposes'' has
been completed.
</P>
<P>
   He said most of his investigation was focused on Murr, not
Morales. Cornyn, a Republican, has said previously that he never
could determine that Morales, a Democrat, would have personally
benefited from Murr's legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn has alleged that two purported contracts between Morales
and Murr were fakes, created months after they were dated.
</P>
<P>
   One, dated Oct. 17, 1996, provided Murr a 3 percent contingency.
The second, dated Jan. 31, 1997, which purportedly replaced the
1996 agreement, provided a ``reasonable fee.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn said that the Jan. 31, 1997, document had been produced
by doctoring a different contract that Morales actually had signed
that day with Murr and Dallas attorney Will Pryor, a former top
assistant to Morales.
</P>
<P>
   That contract provided that Murr and Pryor would share a 6
percent contingency for representing the state in the tobacco suit.
But Pryor said he soon quit the case because it became obvious he
wouldn't have much work to do. He said he also was concerned that
his close association with Morales could raise questions.
</P>
<P>
   Pryor said he didn't know how much work Murr did on the tobacco
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Morales told the Texas Lawyer newspaper that he simply modified
the Murr-Pryor contract to include only Murr and to change some
other terms of the agreement. Morales' comments were made in April,
before Cornyn made his allegations, the newspaper said in an
article published May 17.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn said his findings were strengthened by Morales' office's
response to an open records' request that Cornyn, then a candidate
for attorney general, submitted in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Cornyn asked for a list of all outside lawyer
contracts approved by Morales. He received two responses from
Morales' office, one dated Jan. 8, 1998, and the other, Jan. 23,
1998. Each covered the same period from 1994 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn said he assumed then that Morales' office had
accidentally sent him duplicate lists.
</P>
<P>
   Recent inspection by Cornyn's office, however, showed that the
Jan. 8 list, which was sent before the tobacco settlement was
announced, didn't include any contracts with Murr. But the Jan. 23
list, sent after the tobacco agreement was negotiated and Murr had
filed a claim for legal fees, included a contract with the Houston
lawyer, the purported Jan. 31, 1997, agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Both lists included the well-known 1996 contingency agreement
with the five other outside lawyers hired by Morales.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Potter, who was Morales' top state lawyer on the tobacco
suit, told Cornyn's office during the investigation that Murr
admitted to him only a few weeks before the case was settled that
he didn't have a contract to represent the state against cigarette
makers.
</P>
<P>
   A tobacco company lawyer said in a sworn affidavit last year
that Morales told him that Murr _ who is neither black nor Hispanic
_ was hired to add ``diversity'' to the Texas trial team and
perform public relations chores.
</P>
<P>
   Phone records and sign-in sheets obtained by the Chronicle
earlier this year indicate that Murr infrequently visited the
attorney general's office and was only occasionally called by
Morales on state phones until shortly before the settlement was
reached.

BILL PASSED TO EXTEND CURRENT TICKET-SCALPING LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Failing to reach an agreement on a new law to
stiffen penalties for ticket scalping, the Legislature on Tuesday
completed passage of a bill that would extend the current law for
another year.
</P>
<P>
   The current law expired at 12:01 on Tuesday morning, and the
State Senate passed a bill on Tuesday that would reinstate it. The
Assembly passed an identical bill last week before adjourning for
the Memorial Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Critics who have long pushed for tougher restrictions were
deeply disappointed by the failure to reach an agreement on a new
law.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a year when the Legislature can't seem to get anything
done, they punted on this issue,'' said Blair Horner, legislative
director for the New York Public Interest Research Group, who has
lobbied against extending the current law. ``They have taken the
path of least resistance and extended a seriously flawed law.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill now goes to Gov. George E. Pataki, whose aides have
said he will sign it into law. Had the Legislature failed to pass
an extension of the current law, it would have been replaced with
an old set of ticket-scalping restrictions widely viewed as
difficult to enforce and thus ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed on Tuesday reinstates a seven-year-old law that
limits markups on the face value of any ticket to a maximum of $5
or 10 percent, whichever is greater.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators' disagreement on a new ticket-scalping law has
largely centered on the question of whether brokers should be
allowed to set their own prices for the resale of tickets to
Broadway shows, concerts, sporting contests and other special
events.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in the State Senate have been pushing to largely
deregulate the resale of tickets, saying that approach would
encourage more brokers to enter the business and thereby drive
ticket prices down through free-market competition. But the
Democrats who control the Assembly have opposed the Senate's
approach, asserting that it would cause ticket prices to increase
rapidly and would allow large ticket brokers to take control of the
market at the expense of consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The stalemate has in part been generated by the powerful
constituencies that have been lobbying both sides on this issue.
The Democrats have come under intense pressure from consumer
advocates and members of the state's entertainment industry who are
concerned that the free-market approach would disrupt the industry
significantly and shortchange customers.

RAPHAEL RECANATI, 75, PHILANTHROPIST AND BUSINESSMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Raphael Recanati, an Israeli-American shipping and
banking figure better known in New York for his philanthropic
largesse _ particularly as a mainstay of Beth Israel Medical Center
_ died May 28 in the medical center. He was 75 and lived on
Manhattan's Upper East Side and in Herzliyah, Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was congestive heart failure, Beth Israel said.
</P>
<P>
   Recanati was a pillar of Israel's private economy, with
interests in the high-tech, shipping, commerce and banking fields.
He was a key figure in attracting foreign investment to its
high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
   He fostered the growth of Israel from its very beginning by
using his knowledge of shipping to supply it with munitions, food
or whatever else foreign shippers would not deliver at the time. At
his death he was chairman of the IDB Group, an offspring of the
Israel Discount Bank, which his family founded in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   In this country, his main business engine was the Overseas
Shipholding Group of New York, owner-operators of a fleet of
oceangoing bulk vessels. He was its founding chairman and, at his
death, chairman of its finance and development committee.
</P>
<P>
   He contributed to educational, cultural and especially medical
institutions both in Israel and the United States. In New York, the
main recipient of his largesse was Beth Israel, whose educational
and research missions he bolstered in many ways.
</P>
<P>
   The medical center saw his hand in the advances it could make in
such fields of specialized medicine as cardiology, liver research,
neurology, pulmonary medicine, dermatology, orthopedic surgery,
pediatrics and infectious diseases. He supported its Heart
Institute, the Recanati Cardiology Research Fund and the
Recanati/Horowitz Cardiology Diagnostic Research Fund.
</P>
<P>
   He helped other institutions as well. Mount Sinai School of
Medicine has a Recanati/Miller Transplantation Institute. Harvard
University Medical School gained an endowed chair with a Recanati
Professorship in Immunology.
</P>
<P>
   He was honored as a Guardian of Yeshiva University, which now
has Recanati Israel Student Exchange Fellowships and a Recanati
course in Cabala at Yeshiva and its affiliated Rabbi Isaac Elchanan
Seminary. Those counting on his regular support also included the
UJA-Federation Annual Campaigns, the Beilinson Medical Center in
Israel, and the Recanati School of Business at Tel Aviv University.
He was a trustee of the Weizman Institute of Science, Tel Aviv
University, and the American support groups of Tel Aviv and Ben
Gurion Universities.
</P>
<P>
   Raphael Recanati's family was from Salonika, Greece, where he
was born. They went to Palestine in 1935. After finishing high
school, Raphael Recanati joined the Palmach, a Jewish unit fighting
for the creation of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   He learned about shipping on a secret mission to Egypt's Jewish
community, and when Israel declared its independence in 1948 he
founded the Israel-America Shipping Line. The company was active
also in New York and evolved into the present Overseas Shipholding
Group.
</P>
<P>
   Recanati also formed an American branch of the family bank,
Israel Discount Bank of New York, which he built into the most
profitable Israeli overseas bank. He was a co-founder in 1970 of
the investment arm of IDB Group and, through subsidiaries,
established Discount Investment Corporation and PEC Israel Economic
Corporation New York.
</P>
<P>
   His business savvy spawned hundreds of enterprises in Israel. It
also produced a scandal over allegations of securities fraud and
manipulation of bank stock prices. A Jerusalem court sentenced
Recanati to eight months in prison in the mid-1980s, but the case
was thrown out on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Recanati is survived by his wife of 53 years, Dina Hettena
Recanati; two sons, Oudi, of Israel, the chairman of IDB Holdings,
and Michael, of Manhattan; and three grandchildren.

A FEDERAL COURT DENIES VOUCHERS TO FAMILIES AT PAROCHIAL SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By JULIE FLAHERTY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the first school voucher case to be decided at so
high a level, a federal appeals court has found that Maine families
are not entitled to public subsidies to send their children to
parochial schools.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, by a three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals on Thursday, was the latest in a string of cases that
are propelling the issue toward the Supreme Court. Also last week,
Ohio's Supreme Court overturned the Cleveland program that offers
vouchers for low-income students at both public and parochial
schools, although the ruling dealt primarily with a technical issue
of state budget rules. Wisconsin's Supreme Court has upheld
vouchers for religious schools in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   The Maine ruling comes a month after the state's Supreme Court
denied a constitutional appeal on an almost identical case, in
which a group of Maine families claimed the voucher program
discriminated against them for sending their children to sectarian
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Because many Maine towns do not have their own public high
schools, the state has long provided reimbursements for students
who must attend private schools or schools in other districts. In
this case, three families from Minot, a small town in southwestern
Maine, sued the state to allow them to use the money for tuition at
a Roman Catholic school. Last year a federal District Court judge
ruled against them, and on Thursday the appellate panel here upheld
the ruling, citing separation of the church and state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Writ simple, the state cannot be in the business of directly
supporting religious schools,'' Chief Judge Juan Torruella wrote in
the opinion. Calling direct payments by the state to sectarian
schools ``a quantum leap'' in legal judgment, he wrote, ``Creating
such a breach in the wall separating the state from secular
establishments is a task best left for the Supreme Court to
undertake.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to the ruling broke along familiar lines. Americans
United for Separation of Church and State, a nonprofit group that
joined the suit in Maine's defense, called it ``a monumental ruling
in the battle over taxpayer support of religious schools.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the other side, the Institute for Justice, which
represented the families in last month's state case, said the
ruling was ``merely redundant.'' And Jay Sekulow, chief counsel for
the American Center for Law and Justice, which represented the
families, said he was disappointed but not surprised by the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Court of Appeals has done is basically treat
religious people as if they're subversive to the American Public,''
he said. ``It is penalizing religious people and religious
values.''  &QL;

FEDERAL CYBERCRIME UNIT HUNTS FOR HACKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By MATT RICHTEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raids by FBI agents last week against several suspected computer
hackers are part of a new government cybercrime unit's crackdown
against illegal tampering with computer networks and Web sites, a
federal prosecutor said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The raids prompted a counteroffensive in which disparate hacker
groups took responsibility for bringing down additional corporate
and government sites, including the FBI's public information site.
</P>
<P>
   The events escalated a longstanding game of tit-for-tat between
adolescent pranksters using personal computers and a newly
galvanized federal police force stung by recent attacks on some of
the government's high-level Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Paul E. Coggins, the U.S. attorney in Dallas who is overseeing
the effort, said on Tuesday that federal prosecutors had issued 16
warrants in 12 jurisdictions after a yearlong investigation, but
had not yet charged anyone with a crime.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is part of the government's new, Dallas-based
cybercrime task force, which includes the FBI, the Secret Service,
the U.S. Attorney's Office and the Defense Department, Coggins
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the most far-reaching investigation of its
kind,'' he said. ``It's an investigation with national and
international implications.''
</P>
<P>
   But Coggins declined to elaborate or to say whether the targets
of the investigation were considered to be part of a conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Don K. Clark, a special FBI agent in Houston, said the
activities under investigation included stealing and misusing
credit card numbers and computer passwords.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those who were raided by the bureau's agents last
Wednesday said one connection between some of the targets was that
they knew one another from various discussion groups in an Internet
chat forum called Internet Relay Chat. The participants said that
the talk sometimes revolved around hacking techniques but that they
were not involved in any general hacking conspiracy with other
members of the discussion groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never defaced any Web pages or taken out any major
sites,'' said Paul Maidman, 18, of Waldwick, N.J., one of those who
were raided.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to proprietary computer systems, Maidman said: ``I got
into other servers. I'd look around, read some e-mail, and that
would be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Maidman said he was awakened last Wednesday morning by five or
six armed FBI agents surrounding a living room couch where he
slept. He said the agents confiscated a computer, some diskettes,
CD-ROM's and other computer paraphernalia.
</P>
<P>
   Two Internet service providers have also received requests for
documentation in connection with the case. The requests, parts of
which have been posted on the Internet, seek information about
dozens of hackers, hacker groups and software used by hackers.
</P>
<P>
   John Vranesevich, who operates the Anti-Online Web site, which
chronicles hacker activity, said the information requested from
Internet service providers involved software tools, computer files
and aliases pertaining to hacker activities.
</P>
<P>
   Vranesevich said several of the aliases actually represented
software programs called ``bots,'' which are posted in chat rooms
as automated monitors but may have been mistaken by FBI agents for
human participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that has to do with hackers they're going after,'' he
said. ``I'm not going to call this a witch hunt, but it's an
uninformed investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, hacker groups continued their attacks on corporate
and government computers, in some cases making sites inaccessible
and, in others, taking over sites with their own messages, some of
them profane. The FBI site, taken down last week, remained
inaccessible on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   One hacker group, which calls itself F0rpaxe, says it is based
in Portugal and takes responsibility for ``massive attacks'' on
various Web sites, sent a statement to Anti-Online saying, ``If the
FBI doesn't stop we won't, and we can start destroying.''

FBI RAIDS SHAKE UP TEEN HACKERS IN HOUSTON AREA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ARMANDO VILLAFRANCA 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Shortly before 2 p.m. Thursday, FBI agents shut off
electrical power to a home they were about to raid near
Channelview, Texas. More than a dozen armed agents wearing
FBI-emblazoned, bullet-proof vests then burst through the door.
</P>
<P>
   Their target: A 17-year-old computer programmer who lives with
his parents. The teen sat on a couch for an hour before agents
began questioning him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to wait till my mom could come home,'' said the teen,
who goes by the nickname LoopHole on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He agreed to speak on the condition that his identity not be
revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Wednesday, FBI agents in Houston raided the homes of
four suspected computer hackers, including the 18-year-old founder
of Global Hell, a hacker group that succeeded in getting into the
White House Web site May 10.
</P>
<P>
   No one was arrested in the raids, but agents seized computers
and other equipment. The FBI has declined to comment on the ongoing
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The raid was part of an 11-city crackdown on computer hackers
suspected of a variety of misdeeds, ranging from defacing
government Web sites with boastful taunts to teleconference fraud
involving $250,000 in losses.
</P>
<P>
   Another Houston teen whose home was raided last week goes by the
Internet nickname of MostHated. The high school dropout, who
founded Global Hell last summer, also spoke on the condition that
his identity remain anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   He said agents who raided his home Wednesday morning questioned
him about fellow Global Hell members and Web site hacking. He said
the group once numbered as many as 20, including a handful of
international members, primarily in Europe. Most members, he said,
were kids trying to make a name for themselves through Web hacking.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be four left now,'' he said. ``As far as I know,
Global Hell is no more now.''
</P>
<P>
   MostHated said FBI investigators were most interested in
information about teleconference fraud. The fraud cases involve
hackers who steal personal identification numbers and credit card
numbers to make teleconference calls. He said the teleconference
calls could include up to 30 participants talking long distance for
several hours.
</P>
<P>
   The other Houston teens whose homes were raided included a
16-year-old boy who goes by the nickname SpaceGoat and a
16-year-old girl who was a friend of the alleged hackers, but was
not one herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was just around the wrong people, I guess,'' MostHated
said.
</P>
<P>
   John Vranesevich, founder of AntiOnline, a clearinghouse for
computer security issues, said most of the FBI targets are
teen-agers who spend hours on their computers trying to get into
Web sites just to boast that they did.
</P>
<P>
   Vranesevich compared them to kids armed with cans of spray paint
looking for the biggest building they can tag with graffiti.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, he said, hackers are unaware of the damage they
do to companies that lose money in stolen services or spend large
sums to hire security consultants or install new system software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these people are doing serious things, but most of
them are just kids who are finding themselves far over their heads
in trouble,'' Vranesevich said. ``The best thing that could happen
to them is being raided by the FBI.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When the FBI comes to their homes with their guns drawn, that
becomes a big shock of reality to them real fast. It becomes a
wake-up call,'' he said. ``When most of these young hacker kids get
that wake-up call, that's it. This has been a big wake-up call.''
</P>
<P>
   In his ``Hydro hoax programmers'' Web site, LoopHole writes,
``The F.B.I. raided me and SpaceGoat last Thursday, and we're still
waiting for results. But anyways, im 100% legit now and im only
going to program.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he said he was not surprised by the agents because
he had known about the raid at MostHated's home the day before and
that agents had asked about his involvement with Global Hell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power went off and I was like, `whoa,''' he said. ``I
didn't open the door for them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the agents believed he was a member of Global Hell
because whenever the group hacked a Web site they left ``shout
outs,'' or greetings, to friends, including him.
</P>
<P>
   He said agents seized a word processor and six computers,
including one his older sister had just bought.
</P>
<P>
   The incident, coupled with his mother's anger afterward, has
cured him of doing anything remotely illegal on the Internet, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm totally against all that crap,'' he said. ``I'm out of all
that forever now.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike fellow hackers who have vowed to launch an all-out attack
on the Web against the federal government, LoopHole and MostHated
said they understand why they were raided and do not fault the FBI.
They simply got caught, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Vranesevich described the teen-age hackers as rebellious
youngsters who are not out to undermine the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no intent to bypass any classified system, to get hold
of sensitive information. Their only mission is peer recognition,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is no longer as open as it once was, when hackers
had access to databases and information stored by companies on the
Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like back in the '80s and '90s when people did it
mainly for information and stuff like that,'' MostHated said. ``You
can't really get to that as easily as you could back in those
days.''
</P>
<P>
   MostHated, who is trying to start up his own computer security
consultant business, said the visit by the FBI has forced him to
step back and reevaluate his actions on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these people don't understand the knowledge that they
have, they can use that to get a real good job,'' he said. ``They
don't look at it that way. They look at it as trying to get a name
on the Internet. Now look at what it got them.''

RAMIREZ A SILENT STAR IN BAT-MYSTERY THEATER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)  (mk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Compact disk player in hand and headphones attached
to his ears, Manny Ramirez strolled through the visiting clubhouse
at Yankee Stadium Tuesday as if he were strolling through a mall on
his lunch hour. Ramirez watched some videotape of Roger Clemens,
spoke with a few teammates and turned down or ignored interview
requests about whether he had used a corked bat on Monday, as some
Yankees have charged.
</P>
<P>
   Two and a half hours before Tuesday night's game, Ramirez sifted
through a bulky blue bag and fiddled with a handful of bats. It
took Ramirez about three minutes before he took a black bat, placed
it against a pillar and then resumed his afternoon stroll. Ramirez
did not look even slightly irritated by the attention swirling
around him and his bats.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians were much more ornery. Manager Mike Hargrove called
the charges by some anonymous Yankees ``sad,'' Jim Thome said they
were ``ridiculous,'' while David Justice implored Ramirez not to
speak at all and Omar Vizquel said Ramirez is the least likely
player to use a corked bat because he routinely uses his teammates'
bats. The controversy gave an already high-profile series extra
drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it cheapens anything Manny does,'' Hargrove
said. ``I hoped this thing would be put to bed today because it's
not true. There's not a basis of fact in it. I think it's sad that
any team, not just the Yankees, would openly accuse a person
without more evidence than one game. That's what I find a little
interesting, and a little sad.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ramirez stretched over the plate to hit Orlando Hernandez's
low slider 412 feet over the center-field fence, the Yankees
suddenly became curious.
</P>
<P>
   They thought the ball sounded different off the bat and they
wondered why Ramirez used another bat in his next plate appearance.
But the Indians countered these assertions, saying that the
210-pound Ramirez, who used Sandy Alomar Jr.'s bat to hit the
homer, has a pure swing, has tremendous bat speed and can flick a
baseball 400 feet. Remember, they said, he is one of the top
hitters in the American League with a .350 average, 14 homers and
63 runs batted in, a major league best, entering Tuesday night's
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they're trying to play the head games because Manny
always plays good against them,'' Roberto Alomar said. ``Manny is
not a small kid. Manny is pretty big. He's over 200-something
pounds. People don't realize it. The guy has a lot of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Alomar was much more talkative about Ramirez's bat than Ramirez
was. When a reporter asked Ramirez if he had time for an interview,
Ramirez cordially said, ``Not right now.'' When the reporter asked
Ramirez if he would be available later, he said, ``No.'' So the
reporter subsequently asked Ramirez if he was upset that the
Yankees claimed he had corked his bat and he oddly uttered, ``No,
thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Because cork is lighter than the wood it replaces, a hitter
placing it inside his bat can swing it faster. The greater the bat
speed, the farther a ball will travel.
</P>
<P>
   Vizquel marveled at Ramirez's strength, saying that he broke his
bat and still hit a ball to the center-field warning track at
Jacobs Field last week. ``He's just unbelievable,'' Vizquel said.
``He's strong, and he does everything perfect at the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove added, ``If Manny was corking his bat, as strong as he
is, I'd hope he'd have more than 14 home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Joe Torre was unusually silent when asked about Ramirez
and reeled off a series of ``I don't knows'' to queries about
whether he believed Ramirez used or uses a corked bat. The Yankees
did not ask the umpires to check Ramirez's bat after the homer, but
by raising the issue, they have probably prevented Ramirez from
even considering using an illegal bat in this series and could be
trying to disrupt him.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove doubted that the Yankees would check one of Ramirez's
bats, but invited the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody is welcome to walk into our clubhouse at any time,
unannounced, today, tomorrow, next week, next month or next year
and check any bat that they want to in the house,'' said Hargrove,
who added: ``Manny doesn't cheat. Manny doesn't have to cheat.''
</P>
<P>
   Vizquel, whose locker was beside Ramirez's empty locker and was
flanked by the reporters Ramirez would not talk to, said Ramirez
was so unflappable that he could hit a ball while standing naked in
the jungle surrounded by lions. The shortstop surmised that the
attention about Ramirez's bat would not rattle him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manny can go deep with any bat any time,'' Vizquel said.
``He's so messed up that he can go 3 for 3 in one game and change
the bat and go deep. Sometimes he goes to the other team and uses
bats from his friends on the other team and he goes deep. So it
could have been one of the Yankee bats.''

 &HT;    Belmont Stakes: Antley's ride of his life
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ To this day, no one's sure who came up with the
nickname. It was likely one of the Livingstons, Terry or Jay, who
first saw Chris Antley repeatedly run past their Bender Mender auto
repair shop last fall and wondered, ``What is that fool doing? He
looks just like Forrest Gump.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was Bill Cox, who owns the Hazlewood Market next door
to the Bender Mender and came to expect Antley's arrival several
times daily, ``Always pouring sweat. I'd say, `OK, Forrest, what do
you need?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it was Connie Trakas, who works nights and weekends at
the market and regarded Antley as a human sundial. ``If you saw him
in the morning, he'd be jogging in place while he was here buying
his water,'' said Trakas. ``By nighttime, he'd stand still. You
could tell what time of day it was by how much energy he had. He'd
come by in the morning, later in the morning, afternoon, at night.
It was like, `Damn, Forrest Gump, do you ever sit down?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Whoever, whatever, the nickname fit. Like Forrest Gump, Chris
Antley ran and ran, then ran some more, a jockey desperate to lose
weight and regain his livelihood. For him, life had indeed become
like a box of chocolates. Not unpredictable. Fattening.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Antley is still a lot like Forrest. He keeps popping
up unexpectedly in the most historic photographs: In the winner's
circle last month at the Kentucky Derby. In the winner's photo two
weeks later at the Preakness. Saturday at the Belmont Stakes,
Antley will again be aboard Charismatic, who'll try to become the
12th Triple Crown winner in thoroughbred racing history, the first
since Affirmed in 1978 and perhaps the most unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want so badly to do it for America,'' said Antley. ``But
more than that, to do it for myself. It's been a long, hard
struggle to get back into racing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``All this winning and stuff is great,'' said Antley's father,
Les. ``But the most important thing to us is Chris is back and
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   For Chris, the long road back to racing began here. On these
neighborhood roads and streets on the southeast side of town (and
later on the treadmills and stair-steppers at a health club once
his knees pained him too much for the pavement), Antley literally
ran for his life.
</P>
<P>
   He became a familiar sight: Long-sleeved sweatshirt and pants, a
tan stocking cap pulled low on his forehead, a yellow Walkman
strapped to his right biceps, earphones piping in music to perspire
by.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Antley flew home unannounced from California last
September, he was unrecognizable, a bloated and broken man. When
Les first spied his oldest son on the couch, ``I didn't even
recognize him. He was as heavy as I'd ever seen him. His face was
fat. He didn't have a sparkle in his eye, didn't have much to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-3 Antley weighed 147 pounds, 33 pounds over his
riding weight. He had not ridden since August of '97. Once a golden
boy, Antley led all North American riders in wins with 469 in 1985.
In '87, he became the first to win nine races in one day. In '89,
he rode at least one winner for 64 straight days. Despite substance
abuse problems with drugs and alcohol (he tested positive for
cocaine in 1988), Antley won the 1991 Kentucky Derby aboard Strike
the Gold.
</P>
<P>
   But by '96, Antley was having trouble maintaining his weight. He
also suffered from depression. By last August, unable to lower his
weight to resume riding at Del Mar, Antley found himself in ``lost
bewilderment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew in the back of my mind I was in trouble, I was finished
and the game was over for me,'' he said. ``It had vanished into
thin air.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a couple of million dollars Antley said he's made
trading stocks on the Internet, he was down and out of racing.
``I'd never seen him so big,'' said his stepmother, Annie. ``But
what struck me was the way he acted. He was very depressed. He
didn't want to do anything or see anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   For three weeks, Antley simply lay around. He shied away from
family gatherings and kept mostly to himself. He tried to avoid
watching races on TV, after unintentionally seeing one ``and
actually getting nauseous and feeling I was going to throw up.''
</P>
<P>
   It was difficult to avoid racing altogether. He slept in the
downstairs bedroom that Les had redecorated a few years back,
including photos of some of his Chris' greatest victories.
Sometimes, Chris told Les, ``Dad, you're killing me with these
pictures. I'll wake up in the middle of the night and look at them
and lie there in a cold sweat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't treat him any different than our other kids,'' said
Les. ``We didn't feel sorry for him, or wait on him.'' Chris was
given daily chores: Cleaning the bathrooms. Taking care of the
kitchen. Vacuuming and dusting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need him back,'' said Annie, smiling. ``He was a real good
little housekeeper. He's a neat freak.'' Chris awoke at 4 or 5 each
morning, to study stocks on the Internet, watch CNN, fix coffee for
the family. Les and Annie told Chris he didn't need to return to
racing, that he should consider doing something else with his life.
</P>
<P>
   But one day, determined to return to racing and already on a
no-carbohydrate diet, Chris went out for a run. Slowly. He rarely
stopped. First in the neighborhood, then beyond. ``He'd get lost,''
said Les. ``Sometimes he ran so much he didn't know where he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Lesley(cq) Moss, Chris' sister, got used to walking into her
backyard and finding her oldest brother collapsed in her hammock,
taking a respite from a run. Sometimes, Lesley ran with him, or
rode a bike beside him as Chris pushed her sons, Leyton and Hayes,
in a two-seat stroller.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like every time I drove anywhere, there he was,''
said Trakas. One day, she spotted Antley running five miles away.
``He just played Forrest Gump that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Several times each day, Antley stopped by the market on his runs
for a bottle of spring water and, once a day, a quick snack.
``Probably once a day, he had a Snicker's. For energy,'' said
Trakas. ``Not the big one. A little one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd just run till he couldn't run any more,'' said Les. ``He
had a goal and he said he was going to make it or die trying. He
ran so much, he tore his knees up.''
</P>
<P>
   Les again urged Chris to try another profession. His son
responded by buying a membership for himself, and his sister, at
the Columbia Athletic Club on Forest Drive. They began going
together at 5:30, 6 in the morning to workout. ``I'd have to leave
but he'd stay,'' said Lesley. ``Some days, he'd stay five, six
hours. He'd tell me he ran 20 miles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He would run and run and run and run and run,'' said Coley
Brown, the club manager. Antley ran on treadmills, worked on
low-impact stair-steppers and elliptical trainers. People
approached F.D. Mudd, the club's fitness director, and ask, ``Is
there something wrong with this guy? I was here this morning and
just came back, and he's still running the same speed on the same
treadmill.''
</P>
<P>
   By late January, Antley had turned 33 and lowered his weight to
118. Annie knew he was ready to return to California, and riding.
``We knew he was doing good when he started wearing my clothes and
jeans,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Antley began getting some mounts. Among the trainers
who used him: D. Wayne Lukas. In April, he told Antley he had a
Derby mount for him in Charismatic, who in February ran as a
$62,500 claimer but on April 18 won the Lexington Stakes. Even
Antley sees the irony in horse and rider: ``He was washed out in
the game and became a claimer. I was washed up in the game and put
out to pasture.''
</P>
<P>
   Together, at 31-1 odds, they won a cavalry charge in the Derby.
Then Antley gave another fine ride to an even finer Charismatic in
the Preakness, the chestnut winning by 1-1/2 lengths. ``Now,'' says
Antley, ``if I can put the cherry on top and win the Triple Crown,
it can unite so many people who are not in the sport and they find
an enthusiasm or a goal in life, that anything can be achieved in
life if you put your heart into it.''
</P>
<P>
   As they were at the Derby and Preakness, Les and Annie will be
at the Belmont. ``If he wins,'' Les said, ``it would be great.''
But nothing can replace that moment a couple of hours after the
Preakness, when father and son were walking across the parking lot
to their ride. ``He looked me straight in the eyes,'' said Les,
whose eyes welled and voice broke. ``And he said, ``Thank you,
Dad.' That's all. But when you hear those words from your kid, you
can imagine what it means.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When did Broadway become the provinces?
</P>
<P>
   The suspicion has been hovering for several decades, now that
the once-sophisticated mecca of American theater is really just a
mall in Squaresville: a forum for automated theme park shows, with
doses of high culture provided by visitors from more adventurous
places.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, when the Tony Award nominations were announced
last month, they seemed to offer especially disheartening
confirmation of the idea, giving off what Lorenz Hart once
described as ``the faint aroma of performing seals.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that there won't be things to celebrate at the Gershwin
Theater Sunday night, when the awards are handed out. (The live
telecast will begin at 8 p.m. on PBS for one hour, followed by two
hours on CBS.)
</P>
<P>
   This was, after all, a season in which the straight drama,
unembellished by song and dance or eye-numbing special effects,
reasserted itself as a potent box-office contender on Broadway, at
least when propelled by the power of a known star.
</P>
<P>
   And within that context, majestic instances of a breed of purely
theatrical performance _ overblown but dazzling, and nothing that
could be contained by a film or television screen _ flourished,
testimony to stage acting as an art with its own transcendent
rules, from Brian Dennehy and Elizabeth Franz in ``Death of a
Salesman'' to Zoe Wanamaker in ``Electra'' and Kevin Spacey in
``The Iceman Cometh.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, cast your eyes over the list of nominations in nonmusical
categories, and it's like reading a series of thank-you notes from
the Colonies to their mother country, Great Britain, for graciously
exporting its talent. As for the roster of musicals, well, one can
only shudder at the lineup of misfired, pandering revivals and
bland, sanitized revues that suggest nightmares of elevator music
assuming physical forms.
</P>
<P>
   Three plays, all imports and all still running, towered over
Broadway this season as examples of how theater can move, stir and
unsettle in a way that no other art form can. It should be pointed
out that they were all written at least a half-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   There are two exquisitely reconceived revivals, which found an
enduring pulse in marmoreal classics: Arthur Miller's ``Death of a
Salesman,'' directed by Robert Falls, which came out of the Goodman
Theater in Chicago, and Eugene O'Neill's ``Iceman Cometh'' in a
production first seen, with a partly different cast, at the Almeida
Theater in London under Howard Davies's direction.
</P>
<P>
   The third was a more unlikely act of resurrection: the English
director Trevor Nunn's bruising, life-giving production of ``Not
About Nightingales,'' a drama written by the young Tennessee
Williams that remained unproduced for more than six decades and was
seen here, after previous stagings in London and Houston, as a
collaboration among two British companies, the Moving Theater and
the Royal National Theater, and the Alley Theater of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   There are dated elements in all of these works, particularly in
``Nightingales,'' which Williams had consigned to a desk drawer
years before ``The Glass Menagerie'' made his name. Yet all three
represent an intersection of stagecraft, heightened language and a
playwright's personal obsessions that can continue to inflame an
audience's imagination. People still sob at ``Salesman,'' gasp in
the last moments of ``Iceman'' and sweat sympathetically through
the torture sequences of ``Nightingales.''
</P>
<P>
   These productions, like that of Sophocles' ``Electra'' (also of
British provenance, natch), seen earlier this season, represent a
fluent, illuminating dialogue between past and present. It is an
essential dialogue, a vital part of our cultural conversation, not
unlike what is represented by the evergreen repertories of opera
houses around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been enriching contributions to that conversation
since the age of O'Neill, plays that were born and reflective of
their own times. That such works continue to be created in the
United States is not something you would know from the Tony
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   This is perhaps the firmest evidence that the awards are an
anachronism as long as they remain limited to the small town known
as Broadway, a place that is less likely to make news than to Xerox
it.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the new works that opened in Broadway houses this season
do bear an organic relation to the soil from which they sprang, but
the soil, for the most part, is British. (Of those currently
running, only ``Side Man,'' Warren Leight's sympathetic, twilight
evocation of jazz artists, is American-born.) Now it may seem in
itself provincial to suggest, in these days of ever-extending
global reach, that a good play be judged by other than universal
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is no denying that a lot of what seemed provocatively
hot on London stages felt tepid when it got to Manhattan. The
corrosive sex comedies, David Hare's ``Blue Room'' (whose success
was much boosted by the presence of a nude Nicole Kidman) and
Patrick Marber's ``Closer,'' were anticipated with eagerness and
then watched, at least by some, with a been-there, done-that ennui.
</P>
<P>
   Sex is an empty game in which no one is a winner? Haven't slews
of the hipper American movies been trafficking in that conceit, in
more varied and original ways, for the last decade? And since both
works were more intent on peddling their cynicism than creating
fully formed characters, there wasn't a lot to occupy a New York
theatergoer's attention once the point had registered.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The love of theater that pervaded ``Amy's View,'' Hare's
portrait of a London actress played by the sublime Judi Dench,
faced no similar cultural gap, but the work's attendant diatribe on
the decline of English values did, sticking out like a set of
irascible footnotes to viewers who had no personal stake in the
political argument.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, both ``Amy's View'' and ``The Blue Room'' were
unconditional financial hits, thanks to the presence of their
gifted and conspicuous leading ladies, but they have also left a
grumbling wake of dissatisfied patrons.
</P>
<P>
   Hare's ``Via Dolorosa,'' in which the playwright turned actor
for his one-man meditation on the Middle East, was far superior, as
eloquently oblique as ``Amy's View'' was overstated, but it has
failed to generate nearly as loud a buzz. Similarly, ``The Weir,''
a heart-clutching paean to the redemptive powers of storytelling by
the young Irish playwright Conor McPherson, was apparently too
literary for the Tony nominating committee, which shut it, like
Hare's ``Dolorosa,'' out altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lonesome West,'' Martin McDonagh's slapstick duet for
battling brothers in rural Ireland, came across as a cartoon
version of his triumphant ``Beauty Queen of Leenane,'' from the
previous season. Floundering at the box office, it is a cautionary
example of Broadway producers overcrowding the Anglo-Irish
bandwagon.
</P>
<P>
   It is telling that since Tony Kushner's ``Angels in America''
won the Pulitzer Prize for drama in 1993, the award has gone
exclusively to works that were then running or had run Off
Broadway. This year's winner, ``Wit,'' the stunning playwriting
debut of a Georgia kindergarten teacher named Margaret Edson, can
be found in a theater off not Times Square but Union Square, a
block or so away from where two previous Pulitzer winners, Edward
Albee's ``Three Tall Women'' and Paula Vogel's ``How I Learned to
Drive,'' began their lives in New York at the Vineyard Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wit,'' by the way, doesn't address the subject of sex, and
while it does include nudity, it does so with no erotic intent
whatsoever. Its focus instead is death, as it follows the
dehumanizing treatment for ovarian cancer of a professor of
metaphysical poetry, played in memory-searing style by Kathleen
Chalfant. Neither theme nor heroine would seem to be commercial,
yet there is something you feel among audiences for ``Wit'' that
you seldom sense on Broadway these days: an air of committed
emotional engagement.
</P>
<P>
   Just how and why ``Wit,'' directed by Derek Anson Jones, affects
those watching it obviously has something to do with the way it
holds a mirror to a familiar aspect of contemporary existence. But
it's what the mirror is made of that gives the play its exceptional
charge, and that has everything to do with the theater: its
combination of conscious artifice and visceral immediacy, used in
this instance to convey a culture's tragic limitations in dealing
with death.
</P>
<P>
   In another vein altogether, the brilliant American satirist
Christopher Durang achieved a similarly canny marriage of form and
content in ``Betty's Summer Vacation,'' directed by Nicholas Martin
at Playwrights Horizons. In portraying a world surreally shaped by
the punchy, restless rhythms of sitcoms and tabloid television,
this anarchic comedy of manners found a toxic theatrical energy in
the American lust for nonstop entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Betty's Summer Vacation'' also played deftly with the idea of
the terminally short attention span, a theme that pervaded the Off
Broadway season. In the blissful new production of Tracy Letts's
salty potboiler ``Killer Joe,'' a trailer park family gave equally
serious consideration to plotting murder and to television reruns.
Diana Son's ``Stop Kiss,'' at the Joseph Papp Public Theater, was
about a commitment-eluding young woman in Manhattan who makes a
whole defense system out of refusing to focus.
</P>
<P>
   The language of evasion among young adults who have lingered too
long in adolescence inspired some of the season's most artful
dialogue, in the welcome restaging of Kenneth Lonergan's ``This Is
Our Youth'' and in ``Snakebit,'' a remarkably assured first play by
the actor David Marshall Grant that explores the unspoken elements
of a three-sided friendship.
</P>
<P>
   It seems appropriate that the old master of linguistic
slipperiness, Harold Pinter, should have been well represented this
season, with both a vivid revival of his ``Hothouse'' by the
Atlantic Theater Company and the Roundabout's elegant production of
his more recent ``Ashes to Ashes.'' The articulate pause, which
Pinter has used to such famous effect, figured prominently in two
works of electric talent and almost antithetical sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   In the willfully and stylishly disaffected ``House,'' the young
writer-director Richard Maxwell presented monotonal characters who
seemed to forget what they were saying mid-sentence, while in the
emotion-packed performance piece ``2.5 Minute Ride,'' the
monologist Lisa Kron explored the legacy of the Holocaust in her
own family, with awed silences playing as evocative a role as her
glitteringly descriptive sentences.
</P>
<P>
   In the more advanced realms of theatrical experimentation,
language was exploded into shards, an exhilarating experience if
it's a troupe as polished as the Wooster Group that has its hands
on the detonator. In ``House/Lights,'' this SoHo-based company, led
by Elizabeth LeCompte, spun an opera libretto by Gertrude Stein
into a dazzling mixed-media collage of mutating images. It was a
production designed to disorient, showing how technology has
altered forever the way we see and hear the world.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The same perception crept into more conventional works of
theater, like Marber's ``Closer'' and Craig Lucas's ``Dying Gaul,''
which both made sly use of communication by computer and its
potential for scrambling identities. Lucas plied his customary
whimsy with a new fierceness in a play that bravely measured the
corrupting, as opposed to ennobling, power of grief, as embodied by
a writer whose lover has died of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dying Gaul'' is a raw and discomforting work, and it divided
critics. But it also represented a bold, hope-inspiring willingness
to plow new territory by an established American dramatist. Other
familiar writers assumed similarly venturesome styles with varying
success.
</P>
<P>
   A.R. Gurney left the green lawns of WASP land for postwar Japan
in ``Far East,'' an uneven play that nonetheless represented one of
its author's most ambitious and emotionally direct works to date.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Vogel, in a departure from the haunting, elegiac ``How I
Learned to Drive,'' shifted uneasily into Pop-flavored
cartoonishness with ``The Mineola Twins,'' a brassy satire most
notable for the spirited comic presence of Swoosie Kurtz in both of
the title roles.
</P>
<P>
   John Guare, as part of a season devoted to his work by the
Signature Theater, came up with a new play, ``Lake Hollywood,''
which, while still rough-edged, testified to this writer's singular
gift for transforming American celebrity culture into wistful
theatrical poetry.
</P>
<P>
   The prolific and popular Terrence McNally inspired headlines and
protests with ``Corpus Christi,'' a thin, preachy fable about a gay
Christ figure and his trendy disciples. The play was a snooze, but
it was gratifying to see a work of theater that didn't feature a
movie star get such extensive national news coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind, for the moment, the degrees of success and failure
represented here. Just consider the scope and the vitality of this
chorus of American voices, whose existence the Tony Award
nominations scarcely hint at. And that's not even considering the
work done in such fertile institutions outside New York as the
Goodman and Steppenwolf theaters in Chicago, the Seattle Repertory
Theater and the South Coast Repertory in Costa Mesa, Calif.,
although several of the plays described above began life in such
environs.
</P>
<P>
   But if Broadway is scarcely the place to read the vital signs of
the American play, it remains the primary showcase for the American
musical. This is not a happy fact in a season that had the Tony
nominators scrambling desperately to find entries for each
category.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard, in fact, to think of a more lifeless lineup of
representatives of what is, as the splendid Encores series of
American musicals in concert continues to remind us, a very lively
genre. Expectations were not high for ``Footloose,'' a stage
adaptation of the movie, or Frank Wildhorn's ``Civil War,'' a
singing history pageant. Yet both managed to sidestep even the
satisfactions of spectacular badness, being instead merely so bland
as to fade away before your eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Even under the direction of the mighty Harold Prince,
``Parade,'' seen at Lincoln Center, was little more than an
animated civics lesson, warranting the damning epithet ``worthy.''
The dance revue ``Fosse'' somehow bleached all wit and sensuality
from the work of Bob Fosse, the choreographer it celebrates, just
as the songfest ``Ain't Nothin' but the Blues'' tasted like soul
food from a can.
</P>
<P>
   Revivals ranged in tone from the synthetically cheerful
(``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown'') to the shrill (``Little
Me,'' despite the enlivening presence of Martin Short) to the
tasteless (``Annie Get Your Gun,'' which squandered the talents of
its wonderful star, Bernadette Peters).
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the most exciting American musical I saw all season
was ``Oklahoma!'' That, perversely enough, was in London, in a
springtime-fresh revival directed by Nunn at the Royal National
Theater. Because of problems with Actors Equity, the show probably
won't be coming to Broadway. What is coming from London is
``Saturday Night Fever,'' another adaptation of a hit film and,
when I saw it, utterly mechanical. It should fit right in.

RIOS UPSET AS AGASSI SETS BACK A QUALIFIER 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ There was a tale of two Marcelos at the French Open on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The minor Marcelo, a 140th-ranked qualifier, obediently allowed
Andre Agassi to trample him like a doormat.
</P>
<P>
   The major Marcelo, the ninth-seeded Chilean who was portrayed as
being on the cusp of his first Grand Slam title, was upended by a
30th-ranked Slovak.
</P>
<P>
   Dominik Hrabty eliminated one of the tournament's premier
players, defeating Marcelo Rios by 7-6 (7-4), 6-2, 6-7 (6-8), 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old Hrabty, who banished top-seeded Yevgeny
Kafelnikov from the second round in straight sets, is 4-1 against
top 10 foes this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing he does is hit hard, hard as he can,'' said
Rios, who has advanced beyond a Grand Slam quarterfinal only once
in 17 events, when he reached the Australian Open final in 1998.
Rios blamed a 3-6, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-3 winning ordeal against
Alberto Berasategui in the fourth round for the lack of physical
resolve he displayed on Tuesday. ``My legs were pretty tired.''
</P>
<P>
   The other Marcelo was suffering from an abdominal strain, but
Agassi is not inclined to be excessively benevolent. The
13th-seeded Las Vegan is not satisfied with reaching the semifinals
when a championship, especially the elusive French Open
championship, has begun to beckon. That's all the impetus he needed
to pulverize 140th-ranked Marcelo Filippini, 6-2, 6-2, 6-0, in 72
minutes on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old Agassi handcuffed the already injured Uruguayan
with a barrage of aggression launched from the very first game, in
which he broke his challenger, to the last game, in which he
finished things off with his favorite flourish, an ace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played really solid and I played against a guy who really
didn't have the goods today,'' Agassi said upon reaching his first
Grand slam semifinal since the 1996 U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   This match was anti-climactic following Agassi's impassioned
recovery from a 6-4, 4-1 deficit against the French Open's
defending champion, Carlos Moya. And the American called it a clear
case of his playing ``the yeoman'' against the journeyman.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi, after playing a Roland Garros runnerup on two occasions,
is fixated on finally winning here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to work; there's really not much room for
emotion,'' said Agassi, who wore an impassive face until he won,
when he pranced to midcourt and, after giving the 31-year-old loser
a conciliatory tap on the back, bowed and blew kisses in all four
directions at his riveted audience. &QL;

LIFTING UP AN AFRICAN HERO TO MYTHIC STATUS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 6) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Any American old enough to have been even vaguely aware of world
events in the late 1950s will remember the name Patrice Lumumba. He
was the young firebrand African politician who led the independence
movement in what was then the Belgian Congo and pushed hard for the
strength-in-numbers ideal of a pan-African unity.
</P>
<P>
   To many in the cold war West who heard his speeches on the radio
or saw him on a grainy television screen, he was a mesmerizing but
dangerous presence. He was feared as being a Communist, in sympathy
if not in fact. And with his pin-stripe business suits, black-rim
glasses and trim goatee, he projected a radical new image of black
Africa for the modern world: commanding, polished, forward-looking,
angry.
</P>
<P>
   His career was brief. He was assassinated less than a year after
becoming prime minister of the newly named Republic of Zaire in
1960. But by that time he was already a myth and, among Africans as
well as people of African descent worldwide, a symbol of one of the
high moments in 20th-century political history.
</P>
<P>
   Something of the excitement and tension of that era comes across
in ``A Congo Chronicle: Patrice Lumumba in Urban Art,'' which is on
view at the Museum for African Art in SoHo through Aug. 15. It is a
compact and moving show of paintings that explores complex ways in
which the image of a cultural hero is both recorded and reinvented
during his lifetime and after his death.
</P>
<P>
   Urban painting, as presented here, is a hybrid of several
elements. It has stylistic roots in Western media like photography,
book illustration and advertising. But its subject matter and
approach to history are African. Usually referred to as popular
art, the work was produced, often on commission, for an urban
African bourgeoisie, in this case in the Congolese city of
Lubumbashi, and for a foreign clientele.
</P>
<P>
   The show has been organized by Bogumil Jewsiewicki, a professor
of history at Laval University in Quebec, and drawn largely from
his personal collection. It opens with an introduction to urban art
as a genre, with beginnings in the colonial period of the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   The paintings are all smallish in size, scaled to cramped living
rooms, and done in oils and house paint on ``canvases'' made of
cotton flour sacks or recycled textiles. The artists who create
them are versatile, adjusting their repertory of images to what the
market demands: advertising, portraiture, depictions of ancestral
villages or good-luck icons of the mermaid spirit known as Mami
Wata.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes they repeat standardized images of well-known
historical episodes: scenes of the 18th-century Arab slave trade,
for example, or of Africans being flogged under Belgian rule.
Artists also serve as gazetteers, catching up-to-the-minute news on
the fly. And there is no question that the career of Patrice
Lumumba had the electric charge of history in the making.
</P>
<P>
   Its key events are distilled in a group of 50 vivid paintings
that form the core of the show, many of them executed by the
celebrated artist Tshibumba Kanda Matulu, others by his teacher,
Burozi, with whom he collaborated. (Tshibuma's fame outstripped
Burozi's, and, in line with common workshop practice, paintings
were usually signed with the more marketable name, no matter who
actually did the work.)
</P>
<P>
   A few of the images touch on Lumumba's early days. He was born
of poor village people and reared as a Christian. Largely
self-educated, he began working as a functionary in the colonial
government but quickly developed as a political thinker and
anticolonial dissident.
</P>
<P>
   At every step, he is depicted less as a personality than as an
emblem. In a 1950s campaign portrait, he wears both his signature
suit and the leopard-skin headdress of a tribal chief. In another
painting, he is shown as the shackle-breaking leader of a 1959
uprising, though he didn't actually take part in the event.
</P>
<P>
   In a third, at the public declaration of Congolese independence
on June 30, 1960, he speaks holding a globe of the world, while the
Belgian king, Baudouin, stands behind him, obsequious, hat in hand.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Lumumba that riveted international attention:
audacious, bigger than life, an embodied idea (as he himself came
to recognize) more than a person. He was a star, but a shooting
star, most brilliant in descent. Young and impulsive, he made
mistakes. Unseasoned as a politician, he faced ambitious rivals and
ethnic rancor at home. Meanwhile, the superpowers were already at
work sabotaging independence struggles across the continent.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1961, he was arrested, purportedly by agents of his
own government hauled off in a truck and killed. (Although it has
never been proved, the CIA is believed by many in Africa to have
been directly or indirectly involved in his death.) Lumumba was 36.
His body was never found.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Images of these last events mix harsh, detailed realism with the
ritualistic restraint of a passion play. Burozi depicts the arrest
as a drama of betrayal, with a resistant Lumumba staring fearfully
into the eyes of one of the soldiers who seized him. In Tshibumba's
much-reproduced ``Historic Death of Lumumba,'' however, the dead
leader lies on the ground, his face peaceful, a bleeding wound in
his side. A miniature Calvary with three crosses looms in the
distance.
</P>
<P>
   Christian references abound in the paintings. So do comparisons
of Lumumba with Moses, leading his people out of a Babylonian exile
in their own land. He is also compared with earlier African figures
like Chief Songya Lumpungu, who died fighting colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition's catalogue traces these references, and pays
particular attention to the ways in which African concepts of
kingship and ancestral memory are embedded in popular art, creating
stories that refine, renew and reshape themselves with retelling.
</P>
<P>
   The hagiographic process continued after Lumumba's death and
into the present. His immediate successor, the despotic Mobutu Sese
Seko, at first sought legitimacy by claiming the dead leader's
mantle, then tried to suppress all memory of him.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most recent paintings in the exhibition, done by the
artist Banza just last year, shows Lumumba's face hovering in the
sky, shedding his light on Congo's present ruler, Laurent-Desire
Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   Displayed in a Western museum, such paintings are interesting
for many reasons. They offer an instructive case study in the way
political history _ created from equal parts fact, expediency and
longing _ is preserved and shaped.
</P>
<P>
   A similar investigation could fruitfully be made of popular
images of Western political martyrs who came after Lumumba, the
Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Che Guevara among them.
</P>
<P>
   Vividly painted, these works also help broaden the definition of
African art for American viewers familiar only with ``timeless''
traditional sculpture. (In tandem with ``A Congo Chronicle,'' the
museum has mounted a splendid showcase of just such work titled
``Three African Traditions: The Art of the Dogon, Fang and
Songye.'')
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it is necessary to emphasize that these
paintings only hint at the variety of contemporary work being
produced on a continent that is itself a dizzying aggregate of
cultures, languages and ideologies.
</P>
<P>
   The show is perhaps most important, though, for restoring to
view a heady, optimistic era and an iconic figure now little
mentioned by the Western media and non-African historians, who tend
to focus on the stagnancy and violence that have devastated much of
Africa since Lumumba's death.
</P>
<P>
   Icons are complicated things: flawed, vulnerable, changeable in
meaning, gaining and losing power over time. But Patrice Lumumba's
aura seems to be intensifying rather than diminishing, in the Third
World and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In Africa, political leaders still evoke his name. His life
continues to be the subject of painting. One catches the echo of
his utopian spirit in the words of the Nigerian pop singer Majek
Fachek: ``Promised land is not Africa. Promised land is not
America. Promised land is a state of mind. I hope you are ready.''
</P>
<P>
   And increasingly one finds Lumumba's presence in America _ not
in academic studies or news reports but in a home-grown version of
urban popular art. Anyone walking through sidewalk markets or shops
in New York neighborhoods like Harlem and Bedford-Stuyvesant will
encounter Lumumba's grave, inquiring face, staring out from plaques
and posters, emblazoned on T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   For many, the specifics of his history may be hazy. But as an
emblem of liberation, he is clearer, brighter and more alive than
he ever was on those television screens 40 years ago.

 (ATTN: Ill.)  
 CHARLES McERLEAN, 87, UNITED AIRLINES EXECUTIVE  
 (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles F. McErlean, a former vice chairman of United Airlines
and president of UAL Inc., its parent, died May 21 at his home in
Oak Brook, Ill. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   McErlean was serving on the legal staff of the National Labor
Relations Board in 1945 when he was hired by United founder William
A. Patterson to help improve the airline's employee relations. He
went on to establish the airline's legal department and took on
increasing responsibility, rising to become United's No. 2
executive in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   He was known as an able administrator who led a reorganization
of United in 1975. But it was as a labor negotiator and spokesman
for United that he made his mark.
</P>
<P>
   When a strike by machinists threatened United in the early
1970s, McErlean acted quickly to negotiate a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of going nowhere after a few days,'' recalled
James J. Hartigan, who served as United's president and chief
executive in the 1980s, ``then he went down and got it solved.''
</P>
<P>
   McErlean was also United's principal defender after one of its
DC-8s collided with a Trans World Airlines Super Constellation over
Brooklyn in 1960, killing 128 passengers on the two airplanes and
six people on the ground. At the time, it was the worst aviation
accident in history.
</P>
<P>
   McErlean grew up on the South Side of Chicago and attended
Georgetown University, where he studied law. After practicing in
Chicago in the late 1930s, he joined the NLRB, working in Detroit,
Chicago and, finally, Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In 1937, McErlean married the former Theodora E. Emerson. She
died last year.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by their three children: Charles F. McErlean Jr.,
of Hoffman Estates, Ill., an assistant general counsel at UAL
Corp., United's current parent company; Robert E. McErlean of Green
Valley, Ariz., and Mollie McErlean of Oak Brook, Ill; five
grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.

BUSH VOWS TO SHOW NATION `HIS HEART AND MIND' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By THADDEUS HERRICK 
and CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush acknowledged Tuesday that he will be getting
a late start when he begins campaigning for president in key states
later this month but believes he has plenty of time to prove
himself to the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Bush gave his White House campaign a bit of a trial run one day
after the end of a legislative session that was a success for many
of his initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   At a San Antonio reception for presidential campaign
contributors, Bush sounded the themes of his unannounced campaign,
calling for an era of personal responsibility, compassion and
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The general themes were familiar to Texans who heard them in his
two successful gubernatorial campaigns. But it signaled to the rest
of the country that Bush's presidential run would focus on
broad-stroke ideas, not detailed policy proposals that marked the
Clinton-Gore campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Promising to set a tone rather than a specific agenda, the
governor pledged to show the nation his ``heart and mind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream for the state and nation is to usher in an era of
responsibility,'' Bush said, ``a time that each of us are
responsible for the actions that we take.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio speech came a little more than a week before the
governor leaves for Iowa and New Hampshire to measure his popular
support. It was the first time Bush has appeared at a fund-raiser
since forming a committee to explore a presidential campaign, a
decision he made in the interest of his legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But with a generally successful session of law-making behind
him, Bush turned his attention to presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait to get movin,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference in Austin, Bush said it was important for
him to stay in the capital, tending to the state's business during
the past five months that the Texas Legislature was in session.
</P>
<P>
   The result, he said, was a ``successful and substantive''
session that not only will prove to be good for Texas but also will
help him establish national credentials as a tax-cutter and
champion of education.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature, which adjourned Monday, approved $1.85 billion
in tax reductions for Texans over the next two years and major
changes in public education, including a $3,000-a-year teacher pay
raise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm late in particular states. I know I've got a lot of
work to do. I know expectations are high,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's OK. I'm a battler. I like to battle, and so I'm
looking forward to going.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush is scheduled to begin a campaign trip June 12 to Iowa and
New Hampshire, the two early voting states that set the
presidential race. It will be his first campaign swing out of state
since announcing his presidential exploratory committee earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even while staying at home, Bush has consistently led GOP
presidential preference polls and has collected far more campaign
money than any other Republican presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his campaign trip was designed to help him ``make sure
the sentiment (of support) that I'm told is out there is out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand these polls and expectations are out of sight,''
he added. ``As my daughter said, `Hey, Dad, you're not nearly as
cool as they think you are.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's San Antonio speech stressed families, education and tough
love for wayward kids. He called his job as a dad the most
important one he has, and said, ``I'm gonna tell people I love my
wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to disappoint his solidly Republican audience, each who had
contributed $1,000 to his presidential bid, Bush spoke of limited
government and military might. At the same time the governor warned
against abandoning the poor in times of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps wary of the rough and tumble nature of presidential
politics, Bush called for an end to ``campaigns of personal
destruction.'' He described himself as man of principle and an
optimist whose sees better nation and a better world.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to lead you need to be able to set clear goals, unite
the people and see a better world,'' said Bush. ``This is a nation
that can solve any problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor has been criticized by some of his opponents
and influential Iowans for not visiting Iowa and New Hampshire
earlier. All other presidential candidates have been campaigning
for months in those states, where voters have come to expect to
meet White House contenders face to face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fully committed to start traveling the country,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to look people in the eye and shake their hands and let
them know what's on my heart and hear what they have to say as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said other Americans will soon know more about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're eventually going to learn that I'm a
tax-cutter, that I care about education, that I feel passionately
about making sure we don't leave people behind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush received praise at his Capitol news conference from one of
the Legislature's leading Democrats, Rep. Rob Junell of San Angelo,
chairman of the budget-writing House Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a feeling in the next several months, the people of
America will find out what the people of Texas know about Governor
Bush,'' Junell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some leaders try to bully, or they grandstand. Governor Bush
works in a spirit of cooperation and respect for others.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Bush visited a group of kindergarten
teachers training to teach reading in a program that is part of
Bush's initiative to end social promotion in Texas schools.
</P>
<P>
   He used the opportunity to illustrate his commitment to literacy
and draw attention to the $3,000 raises for the state's teachers
recently passed by state lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank you for being teachers,'' Bush told the
educators. ``You're the front line.''
</P>
<P>
   Striding confidently into San Antonio's Region 20 Education
Service Center, Bush smiled and worked his way from table to table,
shaking hands with the teachers. Followed by a throng of reporters
and camera crews, the governor said he was sorry for being so
disruptive. Then he quipped, ``No, I'm not.''

 &HT;    School bus driver gets traffic ticket after fatal crash
 &HT;    By Teresa Lane
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ A school bus driver who ran a stop sign and
collided with a truck in January, killing a student and the truck's
driver, may have driven carelessly but did not commit a crime,
investigators decided Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Colletti, who was nearly killed in the crash and spent
weeks recovering in a Vero Beach hospital, will be charged this
week with careless driving, a traffic infraction that carries up to
a $500 fine, possible loss of driving privileges and community
service work.
</P>
<P>
   Although prosecutors considered more serious charges including
felony manslaughter, Florida Highway Patrol Capt. Deryl Loar said
Colletti had no intent to cause the crash and had no drugs or
alcohol in her system. She also had an exemplary driving record
during her three years working for the Indian River County School
District.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't meet the elements of any type of manslaughter,
negligence or vehicular homicide,'' Loar said. ``There were a lot
of emotions involved, but we have to realize it's just a tragic
accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the FHP's 150-page crash report won't be released until
this afternoon, Loar said the investigation revealed that Colletti
``slowed down a little'' and ``rolled through'' a stop sign before
slamming into a 13-ton citrus truck Jan. 25. In addition to the two
killed, several students were injured.
</P>
<P>
   When Colletti was interviewed, she said she didn't recall the
crash or why she may have run the stop sign, Loar said. Sixteen
students were on their way home from two elementary magnet schools
when the crash occurred in citrus groves at 45th Street and 66th
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Although careless driving is a traffic citation, Colletti will
have to appear in court because a death was involved, Loar said.
</P>
<P>
   Daughters of truck driver Sammie Hughes have filed a lawsuit
against the Indian River County School Board, claiming Colletti
``negligently operated or maintained'' the bus and caused it to
crash into Hughes' citrus truck. Loar said a check of the bus
indicates it was working properly at the time of the crash.

CAPTURING A CUBAN SOUND BEFORE IT COULD DIE OUT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 6) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PETER WATROUS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A sadness permeates Wim Wenders's new film, ``Buena Vista Social
Club.'' The documentary covers the lives and recent unexpected
success of a group of elderly Cuban musicians _ nearly forgotten in
their own country _ who banded together under the direction of the
American musician Ry Cooder and did the improbable: they recorded
an international hit album.
</P>
<P>
   When Cooder first encountered these musicians in Cuba in 1996,
they were disillusioned; some had abandoned music altogether (one
was shining shoes). A year later they had won a Grammy, and to date
they have sold 1.5 million copies of the album.
</P>
<P>
   It was while collaborating with Wenders on his 1997 film, ``The
End of Violence,'' that Cooder had slipped the ``Buena Vista''
album into a suitcase full of CDs that Wenders carries everywhere.
Wenders listened and was sold on the idea of capturing these
musicians on film.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary, which opened in New York on Friday, features
two concerts the group performed, one in Amsterdam, the other last
July at Carnegie Hall. The music, in its acoustic beauty and power,
jumps off the screen. Wenders also interviews the musicians in
Havana and roams the destroyed elegance of the city. The musicians
play some, together and alone, and talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I heard the music, I thought it was
incredible,'' Wenders said. ``I had never heard anything like it,
contagious. I would be hanging around with Ry, and the conversation
always returned to Havana. He'd start looking wistful, his eyes
would glaze over, and I knew he was in Havana in his mind. I paid
attention, and was introduced to some very young music made by some
very old people.''
</P>
<P>
   While in New York City for the Carnegie Hall concert, Wenders
followed the Cuban musicians around. He lets the audience in on the
awe the city invokes _ the way Cuba's isolation amplified the sense
of wonder the musicians felt. As they look through the windows of
the tourist shops along Broadway, they marvel at the plethora of
things to buy, consumerism gone wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really is good,'' the singer Pio Leyva, 82, says in the
film.
</P>
<P>
   Wenders filmed the concerts in a washed color that is near
black-and-white, tinted with pastels. But he filmed Cooder and his
son, Joachim, riding around Havana on a motorcycle, and the Havana
street scenes, the interviews and the recording session in a
hypersaturated color that captures the visual sensuality of the
place.
</P>
<P>
   The pianist Ruben Gonzalez, 80, wears a shirt that bristles with
oranges and yellows in an electric, geometric pattern.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, there's an attempt to make sense of what
attracts people to this music and to expand on the music, to put it
in its context. You see Leyva move, dancing just a bit to the
music. You see how the people gesture when they talk. You see the
grandeur of Havana, and the intricate intelligence and power of the
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Records are simply a storage format,'' Cooder said. ``You
can't really understand music without seeing the environment from
which it comes. All information is visual now anyway, and the film
helps you understand how people get their sound, the sound that's
them. Why they sound the way they sound, how they got to that
point. The film goes to the unconscious, for better or for worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Wenders studiously avoided the political throughout the
film, there is an ever-present sense of the continual dance that
goes on to avoid the obvious political questions and of the Cubans'
own awareness of the penalties for criticizing their government.
</P>
<P>
   Their stories, well documented and a good reason for the success
of the original album _ the musicians were marketed as old and
forgotten _ resound throughout the documentary. But to delve deeper
helps explains some of the evasions in the film.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The music, which predates the Cuban revolution, was ignored by
the state, which parcels out work to musicians. Ferrer was shining
shoes; Gonzalez did not have a piano and hadn't played since the
early 1980s. Ferrer gave up music, in part, when international
music agents coming to Cuba to look for him were told that he was
on tour or out of the city and were steered to younger musicians.
Other musicians stole his compositions, he says.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary also includes the recording of Ferrer's solo
album, ``Buena Vista Social Club Presents Ibrahim Ferrer.''
Believing that Ferrer deserved his own album, Cooder returned to
Havana last year to work on the project.
</P>
<P>
   Wenders and his camera were in the studio with him, and Ferrer
becomes the heart of the documentary, singing boleros with his
achingly beautiful voice or singing faster, more percussive tunes,
improvising above the swell of the drums.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these people were practically forgotten,'' the trumpeter
Manuel Mirabel says in the film. ``If `Buena Vista' hadn't emerged,
nobody would remember Ibrahim Ferrer, Ruben, Compay Segundo. To see
Compay at 90 standing there playing his tres'' _ a type of guitar _
``so well and Ruben playing his piano so well. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ferrer still finds no work in Cuba. ``I owe everything to
foreigners,'' he said recently in New York. ``I still can't sing in
Cuba. I have no work there, no bookings, nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   As such, the splendor of pre-Revolutionary Cuban music is in
danger of disappearing, something not lost on Cooder.
</P>
<P>
   When he headed to Havana to record ``Buena Vista Social Club,''
Cooder had hoped to use the tres guitarist Nino Rivera, but Rivera
had recently died. Cooder went to his house and talked to Rivera's
widow, who told him story after story and showed him her husband's
guitar.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all going to vanish,'' Cooder said. ``People are dying
every day. When, in the film, Ruben says, `See you another day,'
it's not clear that that's going to happen. All this is tenuous.
Part of the importance of this film is that in puts down stories
and narrative on film, and thankfully there's plenty of footage for
a documentary on Ruben Gonzalez, for instance, if Wim wants to do
one.''
</P>
<P>
   With moments of intense poetry, the narratives of the musicians
_ who have mostly seen their careers turn to dust, then revive _
carry enormous weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person who plays it has to have a sense of how to make the
imagination dance using an instrument of such limitations in its
physical design, you might say,'' says the timbales player Amadito
Valdez, describing his drums. ``It's a very docile instrument but
one which undoubtedly lends a lovely color to dance music.''
</P>
<P>
   Wenders was surprised by the verbal invention. ``I never knew
where the phrases ended; they spoke never-ending, incredible
sentences,'' he said. ``Even those who, like Cachaito and Eliades,
had a reputation of not opening their mouths,'' he added, referring
to the musicians Cachaito Lopez and Eliades Ochoa, ``they sat down
and I never had to ask a question. They just opened up.''
</P>
<P>
   So a sadness runs through the film, with time running out on the
musicians. Some, like Segundo, 91, have made peace with it and are
luxuriating in their newfound success; he has five children, he
says in the film, and, he jokes, is trying for a sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a miracle, a miracle, what's happened,'' Ferrer said. ``I
have seven children, 11 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.
I can support them all now. But what could have been, what could
have been. ...''

A HAND-ME-DOWN `RING' ATTRACTS A STAR DIRECTOR  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 6) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Matthew Gurewitsch's most recent article for Arts and Leisure was
on Shakespeare in current films.  
 By MATTHEW GUREWITSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once again, the Wagnerites are descending on San Francisco for
the four-day spiritual adventure that is the ``Ring of the
Nibelung,'' offered in four overlapping cycles, beginning on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The production, unveiled in 1985, last saw service in 1990. Of
the original principals, the Wotan of James Morris remains. Along
with the new cast of other gods, giants, dwarves and assorted
demigods _ among them, the redoubtable Jane Eaglen as Bruennhilde _
the current edition also introduces a new director, Andrei Serban.
</P>
<P>
   For an original director, in this case Nikolaus Lehnhoff, to
hand off a revival, even such an important one as this, is hardly
unprecedented. In general, though, the grunt work of remounting the
show falls to someone lower on the totem pole, not always with
happy results.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Andrew Porter, then the music critic of The New Yorker,
took the Metropolitan Opera to task for entrusting its first full
traversals of its latest ``Ring'' cycle (several seasons in the
making) to a lieutenant. Porter found little to admire in the
concept of Otto Schenk, whose name was on the show, but it was the
staff director Phebe Berkowitz, the subaltern, who bore the brunt
of his indignation.
</P>
<P>
   His report ran under the headline ``The Berkowitz Ring,'' a
whole world of disapproval folded into the syllables of her
surname.
</P>
<P>
   Given how large the ``Ring'' looms in a director's resume and
how great a reputation Serban enjoys in his own right, his
willingness to accept a hand-me-down seems surprising in the
extreme. Caught by telephone between rehearsals in San Francisco,
he could only agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I surprised myself by saying yes,'' Serban said. ``I've never
done anything like this before and will never again. But I thought,
how often in life is one offered a `Ring'?''
</P>
<P>
   It was mid-May, with opening night just three weeks off. Morris
had begun rehearsals only the day before. Ms. Eaglen would not
arrive for another week. Deborah Voigt, the Sieglinde, would cut it
even closer _ but then, she appears only in ``Die Walkuere,'' the
second day of the ``Ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Serban, who has never seen a complete ``Ring'' cycle in the
opera house, had been operating at full tilt for several weeks with
artists of the second cast (scheduled to sing in the third cycle):
Jeffrey Wells and Alan Held, sharing the role of Wotan, devious
chieftain of the gods; Frances Ginzer as his disobedient daughter
Bruennhilde.
</P>
<P>
   In a given day, Serban said, he might work on ``Das Rheingold''
in the morning, ``Die Walkuere'' in the afternoon and ``Siegfried''
in the evening: a sequence he likened to ``Hamlet,'' ``King Lear''
and ``A Midsummer Night's Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm as innocent in this as Siegfried was, but I hope I'll be a
little more victorious than he,'' Serban said. ``I spent six months
preparing to do this production, but it's in rehearsal that I
discover. Right now, I'm working like a doctor for a Broadway show.
Every day, the assistants _ a separate set for each opera, a whole
battalion _ show me the blocking as it used to be done. I watch and
immediately see possibilities. Then I start interfering. By the end
of rehearsal, the physical shape the scene takes is 95 to 100
percent different from what it used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   What of the visuals? In good post-modern fashion, John Conklin's
original designs incorporated multiple strands of reference. The
four parts of the cycle were tied to the four seasons, from a
``Rheingold'' primavera to an icebound ``Goetterdaemmerung.''
</P>
<P>
   The architecture took up monumental motifs of the 19th century.
Much of this, Serban disclosed, will disappear. Conklin, according
to the tape on his answering machine, was off on a new project in
Sydney, Australia. Responsibility for revised sets and costumes
lies with Robert Perziola, but as Serban made clear, funds for any
major overhaul are not there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reminiscences of the Conklin sets will remain, but the whole
will be much, much simpler,'' Serban promised. ``Sometimes, budget
permitting, I've tried to bring in a different look. We're trying
to purify what seemed to me overcharged and overcrowded.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the lead of Patrice Chereau and his centennial
``Ring'' for the festival at Bayreuth, which opened in 1876 with
the premiere of the master's maximum opus, Lehnhoff and Conklin
refracted the material through a sort of Marxist prism, emphasizing
the economic and political conflict. (The concept was not new.
George Bernard Shaw made the case for it before the turn of the
20th century.) Thus, as first conceived, the San Francisco ``Ring''
took its place proudly within a recognized intellectual tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Serban knows his theater history and does not mind acknowledging
his predecessors. ``Why hide an influence?'' he asked. ``Being
influenced, you bring in something of your own.'' On his watch,
however, the priorities are more intuitive than theoretical.
``Concept is not what I'm after, ever,'' he said. ``What I'm after
is a moment of living experience.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Serban speaks as a disciple of that guru and seeker of
theatrical essences Peter Brook, with whom he spent a formative
season in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   A subsequent experiment has particular application to Serban's
more recent excursions into opera. His celebrated ``Fragments of a
Trilogy'' presented scenes from Greek tragedy in forgotten (and, in
effect, invented) tongues _ incomprehensible except as the actors
charged their lines with sharp, specific emotion. And so they did,
keening, howling, stabbing with sarcasm, unstrung with woe. This
quasi-operatic use of the voice was married to a detailed language
of theatrical movement and gesture.
</P>
<P>
   In Serban's experience, singers are not always apt to use the
full arsenal of a nonsinging actor. ``They think music alone
expresses the drama, but that's not true,'' Serban said. ``It has
to happen through you. That's why the body is so important.''
</P>
<P>
   On their first day of rehearsal together, Serban reports, Morris
(who in a decade and a half has portrayed Wotan for directors of
every persuasion) found himself perplexed. ``During the long
monologue with Bruennhilde, for instance, he's used to sitting on
the throne for a long, long time, longer than I thought it should
be in a realistic telling.''
</P>
<P>
   Serban explained. ``I offered suggestions, and he said, `But
I've never done this.' I said, `Is that bad?' And he said he would
have to take it home and think about it. Tomorrow we may have a
completely different solution.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely, however, that Morris will wind up back on his
throne, internalizing all his inner turmoil. ``Physical action is a
continuation of the music,'' Serban said. ``It completes the
connection. If I can make a moment of union between music and
drama, and can make the singers really be completely alive on the
stage, with a new energy, a new dynamic quality: if I can do that,
I've already done my job. The symbolism will take care of itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially, Serban finds, in Wagner. ``In Verdi or Mozart, what
goes on in the orchestra is always so much better than what goes on
onstage,'' Serban said. ``It's hard to create an image on the stage
with the same power as the incredible music in the orchestra. But
in Wagner, a change of tempo or a crescendo will prompt me to show
something in the relationship between the characters. What's in the
orchestra is so absolutely logical. It's a musical narrative. It's
epic music. It tells you what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The creator draws the map, in other words. All the performers
need to do is take the journey. In this conviction, Serban stands
apart not only from Lehnhoff, whose staging of an opera is
commentary made visible, but also from Zen masters like Robert
Wilson, who create parallel events that converge with the score
only incidentally (or in the eye of the beholder).
</P>
<P>
   Thus, whether the outward differences between earlier editions
of the Lehnhoff ``Ring'' and its latest revival turn out to be as
conspicuous as they look to the director or so subtle as to go
unnoticed _ after all, no one has seen this show in nine years _
the results will have been achieved by a fundamentally different
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kinder, schafft Neues,'' Wagner urged his disciples late in
life: Children, create something new. What exactly he had in mind
has been much debated (though he certainly did (italics)not(end
italics) mean that they should leave his own works behind). The
injunction has become the motto of iconoclastic directors itching
to leave their mark on what may well be the most protean allegory
in the Western canon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never put my signature on this production,'' Serban
said with becoming modesty. In the brochures, his name appears
below those of the production's originators. Yet in spirit, he is
making a fresh start. And therein lies the promise of something
new. A Serban ``Ring,'' perhaps? No irony intended.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTROSE, N.Y. _ For the last six school years, Joanne Falinski
has collected $100,000 as an elementary school principal, but she
has not been allowed near a classroom. Instead, she has been doing
clerical work for the school district while it pursues a
disciplinary case against her that has no end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   The 325 children who were in her school when she was suspended
have all graduated. The superintendent who suspended her has
retired. The principal who replaced her has herself been replaced.
</P>
<P>
   The one constant has been the case against Falinski herself,
which is centered on a disciplinary procedure created by New York
State. The act, known as 3020a, was intended to get rid of
treacherous, crooked or incorrigibly inept teachers and principals
but has become notorious for the time and expense it takes to reach
a conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   In the Falinski case, the legal bills of the Hendrick Hudson
School District, which encompasses several rustic and suburban
Westchester communities outside Peekskill, are approaching $1
million. That does not include Falinski's annual salary and
benefits for doing a previously nonexistent job.
</P>
<P>
   In six years, there have been only 64 hearing days. The three
members of the hearing panel _ whose $50- to $200-a-day pay gives
them little incentive to hold hearings or show up _ say they find
it difficult to align their schedules and those of lawyers and
witnesses. When they are held, the hearings have a lackadaisical
quality, the participants say.
</P>
<P>
   During one recent hearing, a panel member, Eugene Polinsky,
showed up an hour and 15 minutes late, explaining that he had
mistakenly crossed the date off his calendar. An hour after he
showed up, everyone broke for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``State Education Department regulations say the hearings have
to be run in an expedient manner,'' mused Polinsky, a 78-year-old
playwright who is a school board member across the Hudson River in
Rockland County. ``The most expedient manner is when everybody can
make it. It's not when everybody must make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Falinski, who had been principal at the Furnace Woods Elementary
School for 10 years until her suspension, is accused of 55 charges
of misconduct and insubordination on grounds that she discouraged
five children from receiving special education: tutoring or
counseling services for learning disabled, emotionally volatile and
physically handicapped youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   Falinski's champions say they believe the charges against her
were trumped up by zealous opponents who disliked her
nontraditional ``whole language'' approach to reading. The idea is
that young readers can be cultivated by having them read and write
more instead of having them perform phonics drills.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a very good educator and effectively removed her from
her profession,'' said Janet Malang, who supports Falinski.
</P>
<P>
   Falinski's critics say it is she who is the zealot, refusing to
compromise her beliefs no matter what the wishes of parents and
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a parent, I felt she was rigid and inflexible and she was
uncaring,'' said Edward Klopper, who paradoxically tangled with
Falinski over her decision to refer one of his children to special
education. Klopper was later elected a school board member.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the original passions that led to the charges,
almost everyone seems to agree that a more effective way should
have been found to resolve the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legal mechanism is so absurd and so impossible that the
only way out is a settlement,'' Klopper said.
</P>
<P>
   No one, for now, seems able to find a way to pull the district
out of the quagmire. But some see hopeful glimmers in the election
of new school board members in May _ Klopper was unseated _ and in
new financial pressures resulting from a request for a 70 percent
property tax reduction by Con Edison, the district's biggest
taxpayer and operator of the Indian Point nuclear plant near here.
</P>
<P>
   Falinski, 46, whose quiet manner belies a granite will, says
that a sturdy Roman Catholic faith and strong work ethic have
helped her weather her ordeal. She said she even managed to find
interest in such chores as tabulating sick days of school personnel
in her clerical work at district headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
   Yet because the festering case has been widely talked about in
educational circles, she has been unable to find another school
that will employ her and has been frozen in limbo unless she
surrenders. ``The notion of a very speedy trial in this country,
that has not been possible for me,'' she said. ``The way the case
is going, I may be suspended longer than I was principal of the
school.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Falinski was raised in Utica, N.Y., received a doctorate from
Syracuse University and served as an assistant principal in
Larchmont before being appointed in 1983 as principal at Furnace
Woods, which has perennially led the district in reading, with 88
percent of students this year reading above grade level.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1993, Falinski received a sparkling evaluation from
the superintendent, Virginia C. Rederer, one that called her a
``strong, competent leader.'' Nine months later, Rederer telephoned
Falinski at home and ordered her not to show up at school the next
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters point out that Falinski was not accused of an offense
requiring her urgent removal, like hitting a child or drinking on
the job. The most heinous misconduct charge was that she told a
child's parents that unless the boy was taken off the drug Ritalin,
the school would not provide counseling. Ritalin is a central
nervous system stimulant often prescribed for hyperactivity.
</P>
<P>
   The district could have handled Falinski's case internally by
superseding her on special education decisions. Raymond G. Kuntz,
the district's lawyer, said the superintendent and the school board
chose suspension because they felt what she did was ``a pervasive,
all-encompassing effort to undermine special education and didn't
believe it could be corrected with a slap on the wrist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were children who were put through agony because they
didn't receive services to which they were entitled,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are people on both sides, though, who think Kuntz, a
silver-haired 62-year-old lawyer who looks as if he stepped out of
central casting, brought too many charges _ 125 at one point _ in
an effort to dishearten Falinski. That many charges required a
flood of documents and witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   These detractors note that it was Kuntz who helped initiate the
state's other famously interminable 3020a case, against the
principal of Eastchester High School for improper use of school
employees. The Eastchester case ended in 1991, eight years after it
began, with the principal's reinstatement.
</P>
<P>
   Kuntz, however, faults Falinski and her lawyer, Robert
Saperstein, for dragging out the case, though he also places the
larger blame on a sluggish 3020a system.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no incentive in the system for her to do otherwise,''
he said of Falinski's insistence on fighting. ``She's on full
salary, and she continues on full salary until the panel makes a
determination.''
</P>
<P>
   He blames teachers' union lobbyists for contriving laws that
make it difficult to remove teachers and administrators.
</P>
<P>
   James R. Sandner, general counsel of New York State United
Teachers, the statewide union, replied that lengthy cases occur
``when districts overlitigate their cases'' and when the chairman
of a panel does not take control of the process.
</P>
<P>
   The 3020a proceedings have slowed to a numbing pace both in the
ways they resemble and do not resemble civil and criminal trials.
The hearings are run with all the time-dragging procedures of a
courtroom, with lawyers objecting repeatedly and demanding that the
stenographer reread questions.
</P>
<P>
   Yet unlike actions in criminal and civil courts, these hearings
are not backed up by salaried judges who have powers to penalize
litigants for delays.
</P>
<P>
   Falinski is now testifying about children who have moved on to
high school and have outgrown their learning disabilities, yet she
is asked hair-splitting detail about conversations that took place
when the children were small.
</P>
<P>
   Kuntz complains that the hearings have gone on so long that the
school board members who employ him can no longer summon the
urgency that moved them to suspend Falinski. ``Time dims the
memory, I'm afraid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Partly as a result of such protracted cases, the Legislature
changed the 3020a process in 1994. Hearings started under the new
law must be held consecutively and presided over by a single
hearing officer whose per diem payments can reach $1,000. The
losing party can be forced to pay the victor's legal bills.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers say the changes have speeded hearings considerably, but
many cases still drag on for a year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, about 150 disciplinary cases are brought in a year.
Most districts avoid such proceedings by working out arrangements
with unsatisfactory employees, like early retirements or transfers.
But in Falinski, the Hendrick Hudson district came across someone
who was too young to retire and too headstrong to admit to
something she says she did not do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that by walking away, I'd be giving credence to
something that didn't happen,'' Falinski said.
</P>
<P>
   When she took her stand, she felt that testing her belief would
take a year or two and cost a few thousand dollars, not six years
and the $200,000 her legal bills have totaled so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look back at the time and the way everything has
turned out, there's just a feeling of sadness,'' she said. ``A lot
of money has been wasted on me.''

 &HT;    Firm agrees to lake-spraying plan that won't kill willows
 &HT;    By Sally D. Swartz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A battle between a worried fisherman and
a company hired to spray water weeds in Lake Okeechobee ended in a
truce Tuesday when the company promised to stop killing native
willow trees along with the weeds.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing guide Eddy Everett, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
biologists Jon Lane and Angie L. Charles and officials with the
spraying company traveled in air boats to look at damaged willows
along the east side of the lake near J &AMP; S Fish Camp in western
Martin County.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Beard and P.J. Myers of Applied Aquatics admit the firm's
sprayers hit the willows. But they insist they followed biologists'
orders to stop and said some of the willows could recover.
</P>
<P>
   Everett and the biologists maintain the company ignored orders
to stop spraying the willows.
</P>
<P>
   The lake's ongoing ``weed wars'' target water hyacinth and water
lettuce, which can grow into free-floating mats that clog locks and
canals and hinder boat navigation. The fast-growing weeds can
double the area they cover in two weeks, crowding out native plants
and marsh grasses.
</P>
<P>
   The South Florida Water Management District spent between
$670,000 to $915,000 a year during the last decade to keep the
weeds under control. This year, the corps, which controls the lake,
took over the weed-killing operation and hired the Bartow firm to
spray the weeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't justify spraying these little islands and killing
the willows,'' Everett said, ``when miles of hyacinths along the
edge of the lake haven't been sprayed. Places they should have been
spraying, they didn't spray _ and they're spraying places they're
not supposed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Everett, who has worked on the lake for 14 years, said high
water already had harmed the willows, and he fears the herbicide
spray finished them. The firm uses 2,4-D, an herbicide commonly
used to kill water weeds.
</P>
<P>
   The willows grow on tiny islands, surrounded by hyacinths. Myers
said the sprayers were aiming for the hyacinths when they hit the
willows, but defended the practice as part of ``keeping the
hyacinths under maintenance control.''
</P>
<P>
   The corps biologists said the firm's contract with the corps
specifies it should not kill native vegetation.
</P>
<P>
   ``After this,'' Myers said, ``we will treat the willows with the
respect we give bulrushes (a native marsh grass), even though I
think more than two-thirds of the willows will come back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't think it's a big deal, but we're concerned about
it,'' biologist Lane said later. ``He is under a new contract and
we are expressing what we want. I'm pretty sure he's going to do
what's right.''
</P>
<P>
   Lane said he and Charles will continue to monitor the willows to
see if they recover. The two are visiting fish camps and meeting
people around the lake, asking for help in keeping an eye on lake
conditions.

TEXAS LAWMAKERS START GETTING READY FOR 2001 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ On the morning after the Texas Legislature
finished its work, Lt. Gov. Rick Perry was talking Tuesday about
the ``homework'' he will assign state senators in preparation for
the 2001 session.
</P>
<P>
   Higher education will be one of several interim committee
assignments Perry said he will make over the next 60 days. Interim
committees research issues and make recommendations to the next
Legislature on how to solve or avert problems.
</P>
<P>
   The committee will likely be studying the structure, importance
and funding of higher education institutions in Texas, Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The higher education system in the state needs to be
appreciated better by the general public (and the public needs to
know) why having an efficient and well-funded higher education
system in the state is important,'' Perry added.
</P>
<P>
   A second area that he might assign senators to study is
technology and the Internet ``and how those developments are going
to impact the state of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry said he does not know how many interim committees he will
appoint, but he is certain he will not appoint as many as his
predecessor, Bob Bullock, did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bullock knew, I think, in 1995 that 1997 was going to be
his last session,'' Perry said. ``He probably put together more
interim studies to leave his imprint on the '99 session of the
Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullock appointed more than a dozen interim study committees
after the 1997 session, a workload that taxed Senate coffers to pay
for all the statewide traveling, hearings, reports and other
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they tried to do too much,'' Perry said. ``They
spent a lot of money. We had budget problems in the Senate when we
first got here with all the money they spent on interim studies.
We'll try to keep that under control.''
</P>
<P>
   Perry said he doesn't know how much money was spent on those
studies.
</P>
<P>
   The interim studies will be a real test of Perry's leadership
and his political vision, said Sen. Eliot Shapleigh, D-El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to anticipate, through interim charges, what he
perceives as the next issues'' for Texas to tackle, Shapleigh said.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said he will continue looking at border issues, a subject
of key importance to lawmakers who represent the 44 counties that
border Mexico, but he has not determined whether he will make it a
separate committee assignment.
</P>
<P>
   The House will be conducting interim studies as well, but John
Bender, spokesman for House Speaker Pete Laney, D-Hale Center, said
no studies have been ordered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have about 16 months before reports are due. It's good to
take some of that time to let things settle down,'' said Bender,
adding that one reason for the pause is to see what bills Gov.
George W. Bush signs and vetoes.
</P>
<P>
   Laney, in coming months, will be asking House members for their
suggestions on possible study topics.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is sure to be the issue of highway speed limits. A
bill to raise the limit to 80 mph on some rural interstates almost
won passage but died on Sunday. Rep. Pete Gallego, D-Alpine, who
sponsored the measure, said he would ask for such a study. &QL;

DISAPPOINTINGLY, TV'S PALETTE STILL DECIDEDLY WHITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The following program is brought to you in living color.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember when those words would precede a show on NBC?
Simultaneously, the peacock would morph into a riot of rainbow
plumage and then the ``Bonanza'' theme would kick in and Sunday
nights were off and running among the Ponderosa pines.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the Chinese cook, Hop Sing, was about the only
nod to multiculturalism ``Bonanza'' ever made. It was the '60s,
when TV's idea of diversity was Little Joe Cartwright's
black-and-white pinto.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, this is the '90s, almost the double-zeros, in fact,
when TV is much more reflective of our diverse American society.
And if you believe that, then you believe most black people are
felons and the rest are police lieutenants who don't have much to
say. Similarly, you think most Hispanics are felons, and the rest
are hot-blooded hunks on ``Suddenly Susan'' and ``Jesse.'' And when
it comes to people of Asian descent, well, at least you've got
Sammo Hung.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the idea of ``living color'' on network
television is as alive as the concept of letting audiences decide
whether something is funny without the aid of a laugh track. People
of color _ African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans,
Native Americans _ make up nearly 30 percent of the U.S.
population, according to those people-counting people at the Census
Bureau. For the sake of argument, let's round it up to a third,
shall we? One-third of the American population. Eighty million
individuals, give or take. Yet most TV series don't come close to
approximating this ratio. Heck, most would have to put in overtime
just to achieve tokenism. Such as a black lieutenant. Or a Hispanic
hunk. Or a silly buffoon who traces his roots to India or Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the networks are waiting for the next century before
they embrace this idea of diversity in casting. Still, you'd think
that before the big splash next year _ surely there'll a big
splash, no? _ they could have ended the 20th century with just a
tiny acknowledgment of cultural reality. But, with only a few
exceptions, the fall slate of programming unveiled last month by
the networks is so white bread that Wonder must have an exclusive
sponsorship deal. The publicity stills for the new fall shows look
as if they came from the White Supremacy Survival Camp and Photo
Studio.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the occasional ensemble drama, such as NBC's
police/firefighter/paramedic series, ``Third Watch,'' the networks
are not mirroring society, they're mirroring their executive
suites.
</P>
<P>
   I can imagine the typical pitch meeting between a show's creator
and a network programming honcho.
</P>
<P>
   HONCHO: ``So, what's your show about?''
</P>
<P>
   CREATOR: ``It's about several white people who live and work in
close proximity to each other in an urban setting and rarely come
in contact with people of color.''
</P>
<P>
   HONCHO: ``I like it. Sounds fresh. Hip. Edgy.''
</P>
<P>
   CREATOR: ``Thanks. I was tired of all those ensemble shows with
the black guy at the lunch counter or the Asian woman at the dry
cleaner. It just didn't ring true.''
</P>
<P>
   HONCHO: ``I hear ya. So derivative.''
</P>
<P>
   CREATOR: ``Exactly. We think our approach is more organic, and
it'll resonate with all viewers because it's not about race, it's
about the human condition. Everyone can relate to that.''
</P>
<P>
   HONCHO: ``So true. So true. What're you calling it?''
</P>
<P>
   CREATOR: ``Our working title is `The Whites.' ''
</P>
<P>
   HONCHO: ``Catchy. I like it. Think you could get Betty White to
play the wacky grandmother?''
</P>
<P>
   CREATOR: ``I wish. Unfortunately, CBS nabbed her for Sharon
Lawrence's series about a bunch of white people living together in
an urban setting.''
</P>
<P>
   HONCHO: ``Tough break. It's so hard to find the right talent
these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the network honchos are not oblivious of the ``color''
thing. Whenever critics ask them the racial-makeup question,
they're quick to say something like: ``We are very aware of our
responsibility to show racial and ethnic diversity in our programs.
Are we satisfied with our performance? No. But we're constantly
looking for improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Right. And I'm looking to improve my chances of signing with the
Red Sox as their next right fielder.
</P>
<P>
   Is it going to happen?
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, I'd say my chances with the Red Sox are a little
better than a black actor's chances with the networks. Certainly
better than an Asian American actor's. That's because the networks
may be ``aware'' of their shortcomings in achieving cultural
diversity on the TV screen, but they're more acutely aware of the
spending habits of American consumers. As it happens, many people
of color still tend to be clumped together at the bottom of our
wonderful little economic melting pot, so advertisers don't target
them unless they're cynically trying to peddle lottery tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, aside from a few shows on UPN with primarily black casts,
the networks aren't particularly interested in attracting minority
viewers because it's presumed by some wingnuts on Madison Avenue _
the people who really run the networks _ that these viewers aren't
likely to respond to an advertiser's come-ons as enthusiastically
as more affluent white viewers.
</P>
<P>
   But is that any reason to keep a show from reflecting the
increasing diversity of the American peoplescape? You wouldn't
think so, but the networks operate on the assumption that white
audiences aren't comfortable with diversity, even though the most
popular prime-time show in the country, ``ER,'' has one of the most
multi-ethnic casts on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, this small triumph is seen as a great achievement at the
networks because, just as one black actor in a sea of white faces
is seen as ``diversity,'' one multiracial cast in a sea of
all-white shows is seen as progress.

MRS. CLINTON IS INTERVIEWING HELP FOR POSSIBLE CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton on Tuesday began interviewing
New York political professionals who could serve in her potential
Senate campaign, and spent 90 minutes at the White House with the
consultant who ran Charles Schumer's successful race for a New York
Senate seat last year, according to her associates.
</P>
<P>
   Amid a growing sense among Mrs. Clinton's friends that her
candidacy is all but inevitable, the first lady reportedly also met
with Dick Riley, once a press spokesman for former New York Mayor
Edward Koch and the New York City Board of Education. Riley has
emerged as the likely press secretary for an exploratory committee
that would presage an actual candidacy, associates said.
</P>
<P>
   As has been standard for much of the last two weeks, which have
been fraught with speculation among Democrats and in the news media
about Mrs. Clinton's future, the first lady's associates cautioned
that she had still not made a final decision to run for the Senate
and that it was still possible she would choose not to.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the meetings at the White House on Tuesday seemed
significant because they came after a weekend vacation in which
Mrs. Clinton's aides said the first lady and her husband discussed
the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Before she left, her friends had said that if she decided over
the weekend not to run, she would announce her decision
immediately. Instead, she summoned New York Democrats to Washington
to discuss the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to interviewing Riley, the first lady met Tuesday
with Hank Morris, the consultant to Schumer, in the White House Map
Room. Morris and Schumer devised the aggressive campaign that
unseated former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first lady invited me down and I was pleased to talk with
her,'' Morris said after returning to his office in New York. ``She
is very smart. It was a hot day and we talked about Jones Beach. It
was fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris declined any other discussion about the meeting. Riley
did not return a phone call. The third person Mrs. Clinton met
with, Gabrielle Fialkoff, has been a chief fund-raiser for Peter
Vallone, the New York City Council speaker, and could presumably
serve the same function for Mrs. Clinton. Ms. Fialkoff could not be
reached for comment Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Morris is known for his command of the current state of New York
politics, and one person familiar with the meeting said that that
was the main subject during his conversation with Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Morris, a number of political consultants have been
mentioned as playing roles in this potentially high-profile Senate
race. They include Mandy Grunwald, who has worked for the campaigns
of Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Moynihan's announced retirement at
the end of next year has created the opening that is now the
subject of attention from both Mrs. Clinton and, on the Republican
side, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Riley is said to be the leading contender for press secretary
should the first lady decide to proceed. He is currently a visiting
scholar at the Taub Urban Research Center.
</P>
<P>
   The moves by the first lady came as she prepared to return, yet
again, to New York Wednesday, for a schedule that includes two
political appearances and a commencement speech at City University.
The costs of the trip would be shared by the White House and the
political committees that are benefiting from her visit.
</P>
<P>
   As of now, Mrs. Clinton is expected to announce the formation of
her exploratory committee in early July. One adviser said that
before she does that, she will inform both Nita Lowey, the
Westchester congresswoman who intends to run for the seat if Mrs.
Clinton does not, and President Clinton.

 &HT;    Smoltz back in winning form as Braves beat Rockies 7-2
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As much as he wants to protect his tender elbow, once
John Smoltz gets back out on the mound, the killer instinct tends
to take over.
</P>
<P>
   That the case again Tuesday night as Smoltz highlighted his
return from the 15-day disabled list with six scoreless innings _
plus a couple hits _ in a 7-2 win over the Colorado Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   It took Smoltz only a handful of pitches to register 95 mph on
the radar gun. He struck out Larry Walker swinging on a fastball in
the first inning and eased doubts that his elbow needed more than
15 days off.
</P>
<P>
   A Rockies offense that has averaged only two runs a game during
the first eight games on this road trip turned out to be no match
for Smoltz, who was hungry to get back to work after being the
National League's pitcher of the month in April.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz allowed one baserunner in five of his six innings, four
on hits, but faced only one real jam. In the third inning, he
stranded Jeff Reed at third base by retiring Darryl Hamilton on a
liner to short and Neifi Perez on a fly ball.
</P>
<P>
   So much for rustiness. Of the 79 pitches Smoltz threw, 58 were
strikes. He struck out five and walked none.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz also rolled up his sleeves and got dirty on offense,
igniting a three-run third inning with a leadoff double, then
making a narrow escape from a rundown on the third base line. Some
fancy footwork and a playground move to duck under a bare-handed
tag from third baseman Vinny Castilla sent Smoltz safely back to
third base after a grounder by Bret Boone.
</P>
<P>
   That left the bases loaded for Chipper Jones, who hit the first
pitch from Bobby Jones to left field to drive in Smoltz and Gerald
Williams for a 2-0 lead. Brian Hunter made it 3-0 when he took a
pitch in the foot from Jones with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Rockies manager Jim Leyland got ejected after the inning for
arguing with third base umpire Mike Winters that Castilla had
tagged Smoltz in the rundown.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz ended Jones' night in the fifth inning when he drove in
the Braves' fourth run on a hit-and-run with a single to center.
</P>
<P>
   Once Smoltz left, Colorado broke up the shutout with Jeff Reed's
two-run homer off reliever Russ Springer in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies were beset with errors, committing 4 miscues in the
game.

FROM LAWSUITS TO TEABAGS, OBJECTIONS TO COMMUTER TAX 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Looking to eliminate the New York City commuter
tax, elected officials from New Jersey and Connecticut unleashed an
assortment of lawsuits, legislation and tea bags on Tuesday in an
effort to demonstrate that the tax discriminates against
out-of-state commuters.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christine Todd Whitman traveled to a busy Hoboken train
station during the evening rush hour to announce that, as expected,
the state had filed a class-action lawsuit in New York State
Supreme Court challenging a new law that exempts only suburban New
Yorkers from the tax. The suit, filed by New Jersey's acting
attorney general, Paul Zoubek, charges that it is a violation of
the U.S. Constitution for New York to continue levying the 0.45
percent wage tax on the 240,000 New Jersey commuters and thousands
of workers who live in Connecticut, Pennsylvania and other states.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, two New Jersey congressmen, Bob Franks and Rodney
Frelinghuysen, introduced legislation that would ban any state from
taxing out-of-state commuters at a higher rate than its own
residents.
</P>
<P>
   And in Jersey City, six elected officials gathered outside a
PATH commuter train station and held the most peculiar protest,
emptying a few small bags of orange pekoe tea into the Hudson River
in symbolic re-enactment of the Boston Tea Party tax protest of
1773. That city's mayor, Brett Schundler, who organized the
protest, said he planned to file a class-action lawsuit in federal
court and would use a nonprofit citizen advocacy group, Empower the
People, to pay for newspaper ads urging commuters to join the court
battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This law creates a protectionist barrier, a tariff, against
out-of-state residents,'' Schundler said. ``And just as the
colonists dumped tea into Boston Harbor to protest taxation without
representation, we did it today to show we won't stand for this
kind of unfair treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Commuters and elected officials in New Jersey and Connecticut
have been vigorously opposing the tax since Republicans in the New
York Legislature and Gov. George E. Pataki first suggested
exempting suburban New Yorkers from the tax last month. The change
in the tax code, which was intended to help a Republican State
Senate candidate in Rockland County, will cost New York City at
least $210 million a year in lost revenue from suburban New York
State commuters. New Jersey commuters account for another $110
million, according to Whitman, and commuters from Connecticut and
elsewhere pay another $40 million in city taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Also on Tuesday, Connecticut's attorney general, Richard
Blumenthal, filed a lawsuit against the tax. Blumenthal told The
Associated Press that ``Our action today will clean up New York's
constitutional mess.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York City mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, who was outraged
that his Republican counterparts in Albany had enacted the law over
his objections, said Tuesday that he had been expecting the
lawsuits. The mayor has also vowed to fight the law in court,
although he wants to see only the exemption repealed, and all
commuters liable for the tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really an example of shooting yourself in the foot, of
the worst kind,'' Giuliani said on Tuesday, criticizing Pataki and
other political leaders in Albany. ``In an effort to have everybody
position themselves with a particular Senate race in Rockland, and
everybody playing gotcha in Albany, what they did was get
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits announced on Tuesday are part of a growing number
of legal challenges to the law. Two private lawyers filed a lawsuit
last week in New York State Supreme Court, and Pennsylvania
officials say that they, too, will challenge the tax.
</P>
<P>
   But Pataki, who says the tax exemption will help stimulate New
York's economy, believes that the courts will uphold it, said his
spokesman, Michael McKeon. ``We are confident that the law will be
upheld,'' he said. ``But even if the plaintiffs are successful, New
Yorkers will still get a $210 million tax cut.''

USC'S MUNSON EXPECTED TO GO IN TOP 5
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Will it be the Detroit Tigers or Arizona
Diamondbacks? Catcher or first base?
</P>
<P>
   Those two questions will be answered for USC baseball player
Eric Munson today when the Major League Baseball draft begins at 10
a.m. Munson, who is considered the top college hitter available, is
expected to be drafted within the first five picks, most likely by
Detroit at No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   As has been his stance all season, Munson said he's not nervous
about his fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really haven't been thinking about it too much,'' Munson
said. ``It's kind of in the back of my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Munson has gone through this before. He was a second-round pick
by the Atlanta Braves as a senior at San Diego's Mt. Carmel High in
1996, but he chose to attend USC. That decision paid off for
Munson, who turned down a signing bonus of close to $1 million from
the Braves three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He'll get at least $2 million from the Tigers, or the
Diamondbacks, who draft fourth. Major-league teams point to
Munson's defense as his only weakness, but USC head coach Mike
Gillespie doubts Munson will be switched to first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make sense for (a team) not to allow him to develop
as a catcher,'' said Gillespie, whose son-in-law Chad Kreuter
catches for the Kansas City Royals. ``His experience as a catcher
is very limited. The guy is very athletic. His chance for being a
major-leaguer is enhanced by his ability to catch.''
</P>
<P>
   In Munson, USC will have a first-round pick for the second
consecutive year; pitcher Seth Etherton went to the Angels in 1998.
Barry Zito, a junior left-hander who is 12-2 for the Trojans this
season, also has a good chance to go in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Zito, who is from San Diego and pitched at Pierce College last
year, is a logical choice for his hometown Padres, who have six of
the top 50 picks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Etherton showed last year you don't have to have a
95-mile-an-hour fastball to go in the first round,'' said Zito,
whose fastball has been clocked as high as 90.
</P>
<P>
   Westlake High's Kevin Howard is the only local prep player
projected to be selected in the first three rounds. Howard has
signed with the University of Miami and is rumored to be asking a
signing bonus of $1 million from the team that picks him. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
A CLOSER LOOK &QL; 
What it is: Major League Baseball's draft is held every year in
June via conference call among the 30 teams. The two-day draft,
which starts at 11 a.m. today, is limited to 50 rounds and will
finish Thursday. &QL; 
How it works: Each team has two minutes to select a player. A
player is eligible to be picked if he has graduated from high
school, or if he has played three years at a four-year university,
or if he is attending a junior college. &QL; 
Tidbits: Tampa Bay holds the No. 1 selection this year and is
expected to take North Carolina high school player Josh Hamilton.
The Dodgers' first pick is No. 37, and the Angels don't have a
first-round pick. USC catcher Eric Munson will probably be taken by
Detroit with the third overall pick.

   ``The following program is brought to you in living color.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember when those words would precede a show on NBC?
Simultaneously, the peacock would morph into a riot of rainbow
plumage and then the ``Bonanza'' theme would kick in and Sunday
nights were off and running among the Ponderosa pines.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the Chinese cook, Hop Sing, was about the only

   Conversely, this is the '90s, almost the double-zeros, in fact,
when TV is much more reflective of our diverse American society.
And if you believe that, then you believe most black people are
felons and the rest are police lieutenants who don't have much to
say. Similarly, you think most Hispanics are felons, and the rest
are hot-blooded hunks on ``Suddenly Susan'' and ``Jesse.'' And when
it comes to people of Asian descent, well, at least you've got
Sammo Hung.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the idea of ``living color'' on network
television is as alive as the concept of letting audiences decide
whether something is funny without the aid of a laugh track. People
of color _ African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans,
Native Americans _ make up nearly 30 percent of the U.S.
population, according to those people-counting people at the Census
Bureau. For the sake of argument, let's round it up to a third,
shall we? One-third of the American population. Eighty million
individuals, give or take. Yet most TV series don't come close to
approximating this ratio. Heck, most would have to put in overtime
just to achieve tokenism. Such as a black lieutenant. Or a Hispanic
hunk. Or a silly buffoon who traces his roots to India or Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the networks are waiting for the next century before
they embrace this idea of diversity in casting. Still, you'd think
that before the big splash next year _ surely there'll a big
splash, no? _ they could have ended the 20th century with just a
tiny acknowledgment of cultural reality. But, with only a few
exceptions, the fall slate of programming unveiled last month by
the networks is so white bread that Wonder must have an exclusive
sponsorship deal. The publicity stills for the new fall shows look
as if they came from the White Supremacy Survival Camp and Photo
Studio.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the occasional ensemble drama, such as NBC's
police/firefighter/paramedic series, ``Third Watch,'' the networks
are not mirroring society, they're mirroring their executive
suites.
</P>
<P>
   I can imagine the typical pitch meeting between a show's creator
and a network programming honcho.
</P>
<P>
   HONCHO: ``So, what's your show about?''
</P>
<P>
   CREATOR: ``It's about several white people who live and work in
close proximity to each other in an urban setting and rarely come
in contact with people of color.''
</P>
<P>
   HONCHO: ``I like it. Sounds fresh. Hip. Edgy.''
</P>
<P>
   CREATOR: ``Thanks. I was tired of all those ensemble shows with
the black guy at the lunch counter or the Asian woman at the dry
cleaner. It just didn't ring true.''
</P>
<P>
   HONCHO: ``I hear ya. So derivative.''
</P>
<P>
   CREATOR: ``Exactly. We think our approach is more organic, and
it'll resonate with all viewers because it's not about race, it's
about the human condition. Everyone can relate to that.''
</P>
<P>
   HONCHO: ``So true. So true. What're you calling it?''
</P>
<P>
   CREATOR: ``Our working title is `The Whites.' ''
</P>
<P>
   HONCHO: ``Catchy. I like it. Think you could get Betty White to
play the wacky grandmother?''
</P>
<P>
   CREATOR: ``I wish. Unfortunately, CBS nabbed her for Sharon
Lawrence's series about a bunch of white people living together in
an urban setting.''
</P>
<P>
   HONCHO: ``Tough break. It's so hard to find the right talent
these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the network honchos are not oblivious of the ``color''
thing. Whenever critics ask them the racial-makeup question,
they're quick to say something like: ``We are very aware of our
responsibility to show racial and ethnic diversity in our programs.
Are we satisfied with our performance? No. But we're constantly
looking for improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Right. And I'm looking to improve my chances of signing with the
Red Sox as their next right fielder.
</P>
<P>
   Is it going to happen?
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, I'd say my chances with the Red Sox are a little
better than a black actor's chances with the networks. Certainly
better than an Asian American actor's. That's because the networks
may be ``aware'' of their shortcomings in achieving cultural
diversity on the TV screen, but they're more acutely aware of the
spending habits of American consumers. As it happens, many people
of color still tend to be clumped together at the bottom of our
wonderful little economic melting pot, so advertisers don't target
them unless they're cynically trying to peddle lottery tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, aside from a few shows on UPN with primarily black casts,
the networks aren't particularly interested in attracting minority
viewers because it's presumed by some wingnuts on Madison Avenue _
the people who really run the networks _ that these viewers aren't
likely to respond to an advertiser's come-ons as enthusiastically
as more affluent white viewers.
</P>
<P>
   But is that any reason to keep a show from reflecting the
increasing diversity of the American peoplescape? You wouldn't
think so, but the networks operate on the assumption that white
audiences aren't comfortable with diversity, even though the most
popular prime-time show in the country, ``ER,'' has one of the most
multi-ethnic casts on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, this small triumph is seen as a great achievement at the
networks because, just as one black actor in a sea of white faces
is seen as ``diversity,'' one multiracial cast in a sea of
all-white shows is seen as progress.

VOLPE'S FATHER SAYS WARLIKE STRESS LED TO VIOLENT OUTBURST 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the first detailed interview since his son pleaded
guilty to torturing Abner Louima in the bathroom of a Brooklyn
precinct house, Justin A. Volpe's father said on Tuesday that he
believed the pressures of working in a high-crime neighborhood had
changed his son and led to the violent outburst that could result
in a life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   By turns emotional and serene, Robert Volpe, himself a former
police officer, likened police work to combat during war and said
the assault on Louima was an unfortunate result of battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was war outside that night, and Justin just lost it after
being beaten, after thinking that death was imminent,'' he said of
the August night two years ago when Volpe arrested Louima outside a
club in Flatbush. Volpe had said he thought that Louima, a Haitian
immigrant, had hit him during a scuffle with the police.
</P>
<P>
   And like soldiers who lock away the memory of atrocities they
commit, his son was in a state of denial about what he had done to
Louima, Robert Volpe said. He said that only after several
courtroom witnesses offered details from that night did he recall
that he had stuck a wooden stick into Louima's rectum and into his
mouth, and then threatened his life if he told anyone.
</P>
<P>
   In the nearly two years between that incident and the start of
the federal trial against Volpe and four other officers accused in
the case, Robert Volpe had consistently maintained that his son was
innocent. During jury selection, he angrily told reporters that his
son was the victim of a ``modern-day lynching'' by prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   During a two-and-a-half-hour interview on Staten Island on
Tuesday, Volpe said that during those two years, he had steadfastly
believed that his son had not attacked Louima. He also said he is
proud his son admitted his crime, and that now that the truth is
out, Justin Volpe is finally at peace with himself.
</P>
<P>
   He described a Memorial Day prison visit with his son, who said,
``What I did was wrong and I deserve to be punished.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his son intended to apologize to the Louima family. But
Volpe said any apology should be a limited one because he believes
that Louima is not entirely blameless. Louima helped instigate the
confrontation with the police, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not an unprovoked situation,'' Volpe said. ``I'm not
condoning what my son did, and I feel for Mr. Louima, I feel for
his pain, I feel for his suffering, but this night started off as a
routine night in the 7-0 Precinct and it developed into a tragedy
for everyone concerned. There was no innocence on the street that
night.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his son took Louima to the bathroom that night because
he wanted to hit him, to continue the fight. After assaulting him
with the stick, Volpe, his father said, yelled, ``Look what you
made me do'' to Louima. At that point, Volpe said, his son entered
a state of denial.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Volpe said he went to the Metropolitan Correctional
Center to visit his 27-year-old son, the youngest of three
brothers. It was the first time the two men had spoken since May
25, the day Volpe entered a guilty plea before Judge Eugene H.
Nickerson, admitting to acts he had long denied.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe said his son appeared calm and more peaceful than at any
time in the last two years. He said that by recalling and
confessing the truth, Volpe had been liberated.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just more or less realized that a good man did something
wrong,'' he said. ``I think for the first time in two years, Justin
is free.''  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a visiting room, the handcuffs on the younger man's wrists
were removed and the two men embraced. Volpe told his father not to
worry about him, saying that he was prepared to pay for his
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pop, right now this is my reality,'' Volpe said his son told
him. He seemed resigned to a long prison term, but told his father
he thought it would not exceed 30 years, Volpe said.
</P>
<P>
   During his first week in prison, all in solitary confinement,
Volpe said he had been treated well by the prison guards, and that
one inmate even gave him a pillow. His only complaint was about the
23 hours he spends each day in a cell measuring 6 feet by 8 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justin has to get his five hugs a day,'' said Volpe, adding
that his son hopes eventually to be put with the general prison
population. ``He's a people person.''
</P>
<P>
   Volpe said he felt it was appropriate that he visited his son on
Memorial Day. ``Justin died a little bit each day, because he was
such a good person,'' he said of his son's time on patrol. ``He's
that Marine that jumped on the grenade.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his son hoped to spare his four co-defendants the
possibility of prison by admitting his guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justin's action is not to protect anyone who's guilty,'' he
said. ``He pulled the fuse. All five men would have gone down if he
had fought to the end, and he knew that. He has sent himself free
by telling the truth, spiritually and emotionally.''
</P>
<P>
   Volpe said he was aware that most of the country views his son
as a symbol of police brutality, but to him and his wife, Grace,
their son is nothing less than an American tragedy. They see him as
the good son who joined the police to serve the public, but then
gradually lost his soul while patrolling the streets of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have breaking points,'' Volpe said. ``People snap.''
</P>
<P>
   No other explanation makes sense, he said, because his son was
such a well-behaved, caring, unassuming child. He did well in
school. He was popular. He was an altar boy, Volpe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave them a healthy 20-year-old man,'' he said, referring to
the Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   But Justin Volpe, who lived with his parents, began to change
long before the assault on Louima, his father asserted. He had
trouble sleeping, and he was disturbed by the violence and neglect
he witnessed in the streets during his midnight shifts in the 70th
Precinct in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he disappeared even before that night,'' Volpe said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Volpe never thought his son capable of such a brutal
assault. He said his son repeatedly denied any wrongdoing under
aggressive questioning by his lawyer, Marvyn M. Kornberg. Not once,
he said, did his son display the slightest hint of a guilty
conscience.
</P>
<P>
   ``For two years,'' Volpe said, ``I truly believed in his
innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   For much of the trial, Volpe continued to cling to the notion
that his son was a victim of a horrible lie. But then came a moment
during the testimony of Patrick Antoine, who was arrested with
Louima that same night outside the nightclub. According to Antoine,
Justin Volpe asked if Antoine thought he was acting crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I knew something happened that night,'' Volpe
said.
</P>
<P>
   For his son, he said, the turning point was the testimony of
Sgt. Kenneth Wernick, who described how Volpe showed him the stick
he used to assault Louima. ``He heard the story for the first time
and it came back to him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He denied that his son pleaded guilty in hopes of a reduced
sentence. ``Justin is going to be shown no mercy,'' he said. ``I'm
a realist. I've seen the blood hunger.''
</P>
<P>
   Volpe said his son delayed entering his plea for a day so that
he could say his goodbyes to friends and family. ``Don't forget me,
but go on with your life,'' Justin Volpe told them, his father
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Since his son's guilty plea, hundreds of people have written
letters of condolence, he said. A steady stream of neighbors have
stopped by to offer comfort, hugs and flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justin is not being sentenced alone,'' he said. ``He is being
sentenced with all the people who ever knew him.''
</P>
<P>
   Volpe is especially upset over what he felt would be an unduly
harsh sentence for his son. Because of widespread antipolice
sentiment, he said he would become a sacrificial lamb to satisfy a
public demand for vengeance. ``Under the Constitution of the United
States, all men are created equal; unless you're a cop, and you
screw up,'' he said. He called his son ``a political prisoner.''

EDITORIAL: THE ANTI-DRUG CAMPAIGN'S MISSING LINK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, June 2:
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Barry McCaffrey, President Clinton's director of national
drug policy, has declared flatly that under-age drinking is the
single biggest drug problem among adolescents, and is intimately
linked to the use of illegal drugs. But as things stand now, the
$195 million national media campaign that General McCaffrey is
running this year to dissuade youngsters from using illicit drugs
will not spend a penny in federal funds to warn teen-agers about
the dangers of drinking.
</P>
<P>
   The White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy offers
two reasons for not including alcohol in the anti-drug campaign.
The first is that it would dilute the basic message, which is that
kids should avoid illegal drugs. That is strange reasoning, given
the solid evidence showing that teen-age drinking is often a
gateway to illicit drug use. Indeed, the first goal of the White
House's national drug strategy is to ``educate and enable America's
youth to reject illegal drugs as well as alcohol and tobacco.'' It
also notes that adults who started drinking as children are nearly
 &UR; eight &LR;  times more likely to use cocaine than adults who did not do
so.
</P>
<P>
   The second reason is that McCaffrey believes that the statute
granting his office authority to combat controlled substances
leaves him no room to target alcohol. That rigid interpretation is
open to question. In any case, however, the statutory problem can
be quickly remedied by legislation. Reps. Lucille Roybal-Allard,
D-Calif., and Frank Wolf, R-Va., have introduced a measure that
would explicitly give McCaffrey the authority to include under-age
drinking among the campaign's targets.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Allard and Wolf have lined up powerful support from groups
like the American Medical Association. The National Beer
Wholesalers' Association opposes the measure, as does the
Partnership for a Drug-Free America, a nonprofit coalition of
advertising firms that has been working on the campaign. The
Partnership argues that an anti-alcohol message would dilute the
anti-drug message, but some of the Partnership's members earn
lucrative fees for promoting alcohol products.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, an amendment to an appropriations bill, deserves
support. If warning about the dangers of excessive drinking is not
statutorily part of McCaffrey's job, it ought to be.

HEZBOLLAH ATTACKS DIMINISH OPTIMISM IN LEBANON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KAFAR FALOUS, Lebanon _ Hezbollah guerillas staged a series of
attacks against an Israeli-supported militia as it was pulling out
of the town of Jezzine, killing a militiaman and an elderly
resident.
</P>
<P>
   The casualties dampened the euphoria Tuesday expressed by the
area's residents after the leaders of the militia, the South
Lebanon Army, announced that they were ending their 14-year control
of the town. The area surrounding the town juts north of the
9-milewide swath of Lebanese land Israel has occupied since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Saturday, there was a breeze of optimism,'' said Nadim
Salem, a Lebanese parliament member and resident of Jezzine,
exiting the Christian village on his way to Beirut. ``But now it
has gone the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah movement planted
the two roadside bombs that exploded and killed the the two
victims. Israeli warplanes responded by pounding suspected
Hezbollah strongholds, providing cover as the militia continued a
pullout from villages around Jezzine that began late Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The bombs were seen as a strong signal that the Hezbollah did
not intend to let the militiamen retreat quietly, despite earlier
pledges by the Islamists group's leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah,
not to ``gloat'' as the men they consider traitors withdrew.
</P>
<P>
   By midmorning the militia had abandoned posts in 25 surrounding
villages and barricaded itself in Jezzine, nearing the end of its
hold on an area of south Lebanon that had proved deadly. Five
militiamen have been killed and 34 wounded in fighting with the
Hezbollah since January.
</P>
<P>
   It remained to be seen whether the militia's unceremonious
exodus from Jezzine foreshadowed a larger withdrawal of the 1,500
Israeli soldiers who occupy the zone, set up to protect Israel's
northern border towns from guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak has promised to pull
troops from the zone within a year, a pledge that will likely
involve lengthy negotiations with Syria, the main power broker in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   As the militia was trying to extricate itself from Jezzine,
local residents and politicians in the mostly Christian town were
calling on the Lebanese government to send in the army after the
SLA withdraws. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Lebanese military officials Tuesday ruled out such a move,
stated televised reports from Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot send the army because we do not want to set a
precedent of giving Israel any security guarantee,'' said one
military official. ``We don't want to encourage any partial
solutions to occupation.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Lebanese and Syrian officials say they want to negotiate a
comprehensive peace that includes the return of south Lebanon as
well as Syria's Golan Heights which has been occupied by Israel
since a 1967 war. Last year, Beirut rejected an Israeli offer of
withdrawal from south Lebanon in return for security guarantees and
accused Israel of trying to separate the Lebanese and Syrian peace
tracks. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; On Tuesday, Lebanese traveling the road to Jezzine said they
hoped the departure of the militia would bring a bit of normality
to a region torn for so long by war that its once-thriving
population of 40,000 had dwindled to less than 3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Fuad Issa and his brother, Murad, said they planned to reopen a
restaurant they had closed several years ago after the SLA
militiamen harassed them and their customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd come in, they didn't want to pay, and they'd come in
with their arms and intimidate the clientele,'' said Issa, 45. ``We
are very happy that the region is now liberated.''
</P>
<P>
   But some residents of Jezzine were left wondering what would
happen to the 70 or so militiamen who opted to stay behind.
Hezbollah and most Lebanese consider the militiamen traitors who
should face trial for treason.
</P>
<P>
   The SLA's commander, Gen. Antoine Lahd, has been sentenced to
death in absentia by Lebanon's courts.
</P>
<P>
   But lower ranking militiamen may not face the death penalty.
Most Lebanese say the militiamen were forced into the SLA's ranks
out of desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hezbollah's leaders offered to grant amnesty to
militiamen who defected and those who have since pledged allegiance
to the Lebanese army have been treated well.
</P>
<P>
   Jezzine residents expressed hopes that the retreat would prove
to be the beginning of the end of Israel's presence in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's hope this is a retreat from all of Lebanon,'' said the
restaurateur Issa, echoing a theme often repeated by the Lebanese
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israelis are here by force,'' he said. ``They entered our
country without asking questions. They must leave the same way.''

IN 1 YEAR, CHANGES APLENTY FOR GOLFER SE RI-PAK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Life used to be much simpler for Se Ri-pak. Early last year, she
would arrive at tournaments attracting little attention, an
unfamiliar face in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knew who I was, and nobody cared,'' Pak recalled with a
smile.
</P>
<P>
   That all changed when Pak became the hottest player in golf in
the spring and summer of 1998. In an incredible three months, Pak
won four tournaments, including two majors, and she recorded the
lowest score for a round in the history of the Ladies Professional
Golf Association, a 61.
</P>
<P>
   Pak became a hero in her native country, South Korea, and a
celebrity in the United States. It was enough to overwhelm anyone,
especially a 20-year-old rookie on tour, adjusting to a different
culture while still trying to learn the English language, as Pak
was last year. The sudden loss of privacy and free time, the raised
expectations and the crush of international news media now hungry
for details about her life became unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Pak who will defend her U.S. Women's Open title
is not exactly the same person, or player, she was a year ago. Pak
has not won a tournament since July and she was ranked 114th in
putting on the tour through last week. Going into the Open, which
begins Thursday at the Old Waverly Gold Club in West Point, Miss.,
her best finish this year in 11 tournaments is a tie for 18th.
Since her last victory, she has split with a coach, dismissed a
business manager and learned that fame and fortune always come with
a price.
</P>
<P>
   But while the upheaval in Pak's life, coupled with the slump,
are cause for concern, they also reflect a young woman who is
taking charge of her life. Pak's career is just beginning, and she
is determined to make it long and successful, much like that of her
idol, Nancy Lopez. Her peers, her supporters and even those who
have been dismissed from Pak's inner circle expect her to win
again, to win often and to leave a special mark on women's golf.
</P>
<P>
   Her talent is immense. Her will is strong. And this week, Pak
hopes to capitalize on one of her special traits: an ability to
play her best when the stakes are highest.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week in Sylvania, Ohio, Pak explained why
she loves the majors. ``I love the huge galleries,'' she said. ``I
love the people. Everything is more tense at a major, more
difficult, especially at the U.S. Open. But somehow, I feel
stronger when it's like that. It doesn't make me nervous. It makes
it more fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Competing in the Open will bring back warm memories for Pak, the
youngest Open champion in history. She prevailed last year at
Blackwolf Run Golf Course in Kohler, Wis., in probably the most
thrilling tournament of 1998. Pak and Jenny Chuasiriporn, also 20
at the time, finished tied through 72 holes, then dueled in a
playoff the next day that was not decided until the 20th hole, when
Pak made a 15-foot putt for birdie and the victory. When she
finally won, Pak burst into tears as her father, Joon Chul-pak,
raced onto the green and lifted her off her feet.
</P>
<P>
   It was the high point of a remarkable year. Most players would
love to win two majors in career, period. Pak won the first two
majors she ever played.
</P>
<P>
   But in the ensuing months, Pak learned valuable lessons,
sometimes the hard way. After winning the McDonald's LPGA
Championship in May 1998, she had no idea how much life would
change. All the tournament directors wanted her to play their
events. More media and fans wanted her time.
</P>
<P>
   By the summer, Pak was checking into hotels under an assumed
name to avoid late-night phone calls. By the end of last season she
was worn down, and her performance fell off after competing in six
consecutive tournaments last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The worst experience occurred on a homecoming visit to South
Korea last fall, when Pak became ill and was hospitalized,
suffering from exhaustion and a severe cold. By all accounts, Pak
was overbooked, faced with nonstop public appearances after a
21-hour flight. Her main sponsor, Samsung, was criticized for
wearing her out. Meanwhile, Pak was bombarded by the South Korean
news media even after she became ill, and some photographers gained
access to her hospital room and took pictures of her while she was
hooked up to an intravenous tube, a tear running down her cheek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned that I'd have to do a better job looking after me,''
Pak said. ``Nobody else could do it. I had to.''
</P>
<P>
   Samsung remains one of Pak's sponsors, and in January she signed
with the International Management Group, which also represents
David Duval, Tiger Woods and Mark O'Meara. On Tuesday, she signed
her first contract under the guidance of IMG, a three-year deal to
promote Maxfli balls that is reportedly the largest ball contract
in women's golf.
</P>
<P>
   Pak said her life had become much more organized.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Song Yung Kil, Pak's former business manager, who was
dismissed last winter, said he was unfairly blamed for some things,
but he also said Pak had probably felt the need to take more
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's young, and she's experiencing a lot of things for the
first time,'' Kil said. ``There's a lot of pressure on her. People
should understand that it takes time to adjust, but I think she's a
golfing genius. When her mind is right, she can win any week.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak bought a home in Orlando, Fla., last year, a three-minute
drive from Arnold Palmer's Bay Hill Golf Club and Lodge, where she
does most of her practicing.
</P>
<P>
   After winning $872,170 last year, has money changed her?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not really,'' Pak said, flashing her warm smile. ``I bought a
house. I pay more taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   This week begins a crucial five-week stretch for Pak in which
she is defending three titles, two of them majors. With powerful
legs and a fluid swing, the prevailing notion is that Pak's malaise
is only temporary. David Leadbetter, Pak's former coach, who has
worked with major winners like Ernie Els, Nick Faldo, Greg Norman
and Nick Price, knows special talent when he sees it. And according
to Leadbetter, Pak is very special.
</P>
<P>
   ``She creates tremendous power without trying to hit the ball
extremely hard, what you might call effortless power,'' Leadbette
said. ``She's a very good athlete, partly due to her track and
field background. She's strong, but she's also flexible, a great
combination. She can call on that extra 10 or 15 yards when she
needs it, plus she has a good imagination, and we all know she
doesn't get flustered very easily on the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always tough for a young player to follow up a great year
with another. This is a phase she'll have to fight her way
through.''

 &HT;    As wildfire burns on, rangers hope for rain
 &HT;    By Gita M. Smith
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Wildfire crackled through the deep cypress swamps and
upland pine plantations of the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge
again Tuesday, bringing to 58,300 the acreage burned in Georgia and
Florida this year.
</P>
<P>
   Since May 22, when the current fire _ nicknamed ``Friendly
Fire'' for its origin at the Friendly Hunting Camp in Olustee, Fla.
_ jumped the Florida-Georgia border, it has destroyed more than
8,000 acres of the Okefenokee.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the Georgia Forestry Commission dispatched 71
firefighters and heavy equipment to help contain the fire, said
Alan Dozier, chief of forest protection for the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Of paramount worry to Dozier and park rangers is the severity of
the drought in southeast Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``To give an idea of how severe, consider the Keetch-Byram
Index. Zero on the scale means water-saturated soil; 800 means no
moisture all the way down to 8 inches. Most of southeast Georgia is
above 700,'' Dozier said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take 10 inches of rain over the next several days to
get that region back to zero, and right now the rain chance is very
slim,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, despite daily forecasts of thunderstorms, the line of
rain heading toward the Okefenokee has played out in Valdosta.
</P>
<P>
   ``To put out this fire, we would need 4 inches of rain to fall
in one or two days' time,'' Dozier said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia forestry officials are severely limiting outdoor burning
permits because of the high risk of wildfires. A 300-acre fire
occurred Monday in Jeff Davis County after someone burned a leaf
pile. It was one of six wildfires to blacken 976 acres in Bacon,
Jeff Davis and Wayne counties on Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   In Stephen Foster State Park in Charlton County, Chief Ranger
Jackie Clay said she is not allowing campfires.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time of year, park traffic tends to thin out anyway,
due to bugs and heat. So far we have not experienced any changes in
air quality or animal patterns because of the fires in the National
Wildlife Refuge,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   No park facilities have been destroyed by the wildfires, but
Dozier predicted a substantial portion of the swamp will be
destroyed if drought conditions don't soon improve.

 UNDATED: way through.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   But Pak is fighting her way through without Leadbetter. After
leaving South Korea in 1997 to work with Leadbetter in Florida, the
coach and player split late last year, partly because Pak felt that
Leadbetter no longer devoted enough time to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great coach, but he was always busy,'' Pak said. ``He
was out of town a lot, taking care of business, taking care of
other players. There were times when I felt like I needed him, and
he wasn't there. Right now, I'm still looking for a coach.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Leadbetter believes Pak may have made a hasty decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most players usually don't change coaches when they're playing
well,'' Leadbetter said. ``She's a wonderful person. I wish her all
the best. But at the end of last year, I saw things I didn't like.
I thought she needed a break, so I told her to rest. The next day I
saw her practicing. She told me she talked to her father and that
he said she needed to practice. She had a lot of people telling her
a lot of different things.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak's father admittedly drove his daughter hard to be a
champion. Pak first touched a golf club when she was 11, but by the
time she was 14, she was winning tournaments. Pak's father would
make her practice for hours, even on days when it was cold enough
for icicles to form in her hair. To make Pak mentally stronger,
father and daughter sometimes camped out together in a tent at
night at a local cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   But to this day, father and daughter remain close. They speak on
the phone daily, and Pak's parents will be in Mississippi this week
to watch her at the Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may have the impression that her father is hard, but
he's very supportive,'' said Jay Burton, Pak's business manager.
``I mean, she hasn't won this year, but he hasn't raced over here
to see what's wrong. When you're a parent, your children eventually
grow up, and then it's up to them. I think he's realizing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak resents the notion that her father is putting too much
pressure on her.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad understands how hard golf is,'' Pak said. ``There's a
lot of pressure on him, too. People in Korea are just waiting. Even
though I won four tournaments last year, they're waiting for No. 5,
then No. 6. They love me, but they want to know, how long do we
have to wait? That makes me unhappy. It's not easy to win
tournaments; it's not easy to be one of the top 10 players.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's Women's Open has the potential to be memorable
again, with many players looking ready to win. Karrie Webb, who
leads the LPGA money list, has won four times this year. Meg
Mallon, Juli Inkster and Rachel Hetherington have each won twice.
Lopez will again be the sentimental favorite, trying to win her
first Open. Two-time Open champion Annika Sorenstam can never be
overlooked, while Chuasiriporn will be making her pro debut after
helping Duke University win the collegiate championship in May.
</P>
<P>
   But Pak has proved what she is capable of. And despite the bumps
in the road, she is still enjoying the ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see other 21-year-olds, and I realize I've given up some
things,'' Pak said. ``I've had to work hard, but it has been worth
it. I love golf. This is the life I want. I don't want to have just
one good year. I want a great career. Sometimes when you push hard,
things get worse. But I feel my best is still ahead.''

ARIZONA BOYS RANCH LICENSED FOR 1 YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
 RANCH-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT FLANNERY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A smaller, less hard-bitten Arizona Boys Ranch was granted a
one-year state license after regulators concluded the controversial
boot camp has been made safer since the death of a student last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you have a rogue employee, something like the Nicholaus
Contreraz case should never happen again with these reforms,'' said
James Hart, assistant director of the Arizona Department of
Economic Security. ``The whole basis for the reforms is to ensure
the safety of children.''
</P>
<P>
   The new operating license, which had been denied by the state
for 10 months, is expected by Boys Ranch officials to boost
enrollment at the 50-year-old home for troubled kids. Enrollment
dropped to 43 from more than 600 after Contreraz, a 16-year-old
Californian, died March 2, 1998, at the Oracle campus from an
untreated lung ailment.
</P>
<P>
   A state investigation found that his pleas for medical help went
unheeded as he was punished and taunted as a laggard by some school
employees.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath, regulators concluded that there was ``a
pattern of abuse and neglect'' at the school fueled by management's
disregard for the rights of youngsters placed in their care.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators and school officials last November agreed to a
settlement and nearly three dozen changes to end the
confrontational disciplinary style that once was a source of Boys
Ranch pride.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, DES officials expressed cautious optimism that
permanent changes are afoot to make the program safer and more
accountable to regulators. They said Boys Ranch has put every
recommendation into effect that was requested by DES and
independent consultants who evaluated the program last year.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Vega of Sacramento, Contreraz's mother, said the state
should nonetheless keep a close eye on the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as they keep on monitoring them and they run the place
like it's supposed to be, it'll be alright,'' Vega said.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal trials are still pending against three former Boys
Ranch employees who were charged in Contreraz's death. Linda Babb,
a nurse, faces manslaughter and child abuse charges in Pinal County
Superior Court. Troy Michael Jones and Montgomery Hoover face child
abuse charges.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Babb, Jones and Hoover were reduced from
murder last month. Charges were dropped entirely against two other
former Boys Ranch workers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Charles Ratliff, a spokesman for the Pinal County Attorney's
Office, said no trial date has yet been set.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious difference in Boys Ranch since Conteraz's death
is in its size. Boys Ranch development coordinator Casandra McCray
said 43 boys are enrolled at the Queen Creek campus. Other campuses
have been shut down, economic casualties of Contreraz's death, when
students were withdrawn and new referrals dried up.
</P>
<P>
   Boys Ranch brought in new management and stayed open under an
extension of its old license. But McCray said welfare agencies and
courts in and out of Arizona withheld new referrals until a
decision was made on a permanent license. Only three current Boys
Ranch students are from Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to continue to grow,'' McCray said. ``What this
does is open doors to people who wanted to wait and see.''
</P>
<P>
   Board chairman Robert Johnson said in a prepared statement that
``rebuilding'' efforts would include partnerships with juvenile
referral agencies in Arizona. He said Boys Ranch intends to ``move
forward with renewed vigor and dedication.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the student population will be much smaller, reflecting
a feeling by consultants that Boys Ranch had grown too fast in
recent years, Hart said.
</P>
<P>
   The new license will permit only the Queen Creek campus
southeast of Phoenix to operate. The student population is capped
at 268. In early 1998, Boys Ranch ran seven campuses with more than
600 students.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators feel the most notable change to date involves how
child abuse is reported. Boys Ranch employees must now call DES'
Child Abuse Hotline if they witness abusive behavior or injuries on
campus, and they must file a written report to Boys Ranch managers
within hours of witnessing a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, reports _ often oral _ went to Boys Ranch
administrators, who decided whether to pass information on to the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an opportunity for cases to fall through the
cracks,'' Hart said. ``This is a major change.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaking with years of tradition, the school also retooled its
policy on physical discipline. Where daily confrontations and
hands-on discipline were once the norm, Hart said employees now may
use physical force only if the student poses a danger to himself or
to others, or is damaging property.
</P>
<P>
   In such cases, problem students are forcibly taken to a cottage
for disruptive students, where they are counseled by
specially-trained employees. Each incident must be reported, and
reviewed by a behavior management review board.
</P>
<P>
   State officials and independent consultants will still keep tabs
to be sure the new policies are strictly followed. Recent
unannounced visits by DES workers found workers adhering to the
changes, Hart said.

VENEGAS GUIDES BRUINS TO NCAA MEET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA throwing coach Art Venegas has guided
athletes to 24 NCAA individual titles. His Bruins have participated
in the NCAA championships every year since his arrival in 1981, and
he claims Jackie-Joyner Kersee, John Godina and Jonathan Ogden as
pupils.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1984 championships, John Brenner unofficially opened the
Venegas era with victories in the discus and shot put. In 1995, his
athletes won an astounding five of the seven throwing events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat there in disbelief,'' said Venegas, a Cal State
Northridge graduate and San Fernando Valley resident since 1962.
``No matter how much you prepare, things can go wrong. Kids get
sick, or have foul trouble, or someone from the other teams does
great.''
</P>
<P>
   Venegas isn't sure what to expect when the NCAA Track and Field
Championships begin today in Boise, Idaho. The UCLA women are
ranked No.1 in the nation according to the U.S. Track Coaches
Association, and they could bring home the Bruins' second NCAA
title in a week, following the softball team's victory Monday in
Oklahoma City. UCLA men are rated sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Venegas has several athletes hoping to add to his sensational
title tally, most notably junior Seilala Sua, ranked first in the
nation in the shot put and discus. Senior Luke Sullivan, ranked
fifth in the discus, also has a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we get to the NCAAs, I'm more like a fan,'' Venegas said.
``I want them to show me what they can do. Can they surprise me?
</P>
<P>
   ``On the men's side, we have good throwers, but they aren't
overwhelming. We do have a superstar in Seilala, and I expect her
to bring home some titles.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Bruins expected to challenge for NCAA individual titles
include senior Joanna Hayes (100- and 400-meter hurdles), freshman
pole vaulter Tracy O'Hara, and sophomore Shakedia Jones in the 200
meters.
</P>
<P>
   However it ends, with more titles or a twinge of disappointment,
Venegas won't waste much time preparing for next season. In fact,
he might have a few more responsibilities. Men's head coach Bob
Larson is expected to retire after the season, sources said, and
Venegas is the leading candidate to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   CSUN junior Brandi Prieto, who helped the Matadors women win the
Big Sky Conference outdoor championship last week, is competing in
Boise in the triple jump. Her leap of 42-11} at the Big Sky meet
ranks eleventh in the NCAA.

BORDER ATTORNEY TO FACE BABY-ADOPTION CHARGES IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By GRACIELA SEVILLA  
 AND KATHLEEN INGLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ Mario Reyes, accused of leading an illegal adoption
ring that smuggled 17 Mexican babies to couples in New York, was
order Tuesday to face charges in a federal court in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes was flanked by three rows of sobbing relatives and friends
as U.S. Magistrate Nancy Fiora ordered him transfered from Arizona
to New York. Fiora postponed a decision on bond for Reyes, who made
his first public appearance since his arrest at his Douglas home
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Steve Yarbrough argued against granting
Reyes bail because his close ties to Mexico made him a flight risk.
</P>
<P>
   But Reyes' attorney, Ivan Abrams, said Mexico would be the last
place Reyes would run since the Mexican federal attorney's office
has issued a warrant for Reyes's arrest on charges connected with
the adoption operation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on the other side of the country, these are
stomach-churning days for Sara and David Kruchkow of Flushing,
N.Y., who fear the child they received from Mexico more than a year
ago may be taken from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely worried, finding it hard to concentrate at work,
that's for sure,'' said Sara Kruchkow, 48. ``We will not be
relieved, we will not be relaxed until this is all resolved and we
know we can keep our daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple already has been through an emotional wringer. He's a
car salesman and she's an administrative assistant for a textile
company. They started trying to adopt in 1995, hoping for a
toddler, a little girl. Twice, the adoption group told the couple
there was a child available, only to dash their hopes a few months
later.
</P>
<P>
   By then, David was suspicious and fed up. But the group said
there was another child, available immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were pretty much dangling the carrot in front of me,''
Sara recalled. She declined to discuss details of the adoption, on
the advice of her lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   But she's happy to tell how delighted the Kruchkows were a year
and a half ago, when they met a bright 20-month-old girl with a
sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   They named her Shelly and ``she took to us immediately,'' said
Sara Kruchkow.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the children in the Mexican adoption scheme had severe
health problems, and Shelly suffers from bad asthma. But the
Kruchkows are hoping she outgrows it.
</P>
<P>
   A few things about her new life in New York startled the little
girl at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she saw running water, she started screaming and jumping
up and down and saying, `Agua, agua,` so evidently where she was
there wasn't running water,'' Kruchkow said.
</P>
<P>
   After figuring in the travel costs, the couple spent around
$30,000 on the adoption, she estimated.
</P>
<P>
   They also spent two years researching adoption options.
Kruchkow's advice to anyone looking to adopt is to go further: ``Do
your research and when you think you've done enough, do some
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Kruchkow said she's had no communication yet from the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service about the status of her
daughter, who is three years old.
</P>
<P>
   She remembers the persuasive words of the adoption agents when
she was hesitating whether to go through with it: ``This is the
child you were meant to have.``
</P>
<P>
   Now, she said, ``my biggest fear is I'm not going to be able to
keep the child I was meant to have.''
</P>
<P>
   That will all depend on how the prosecution of Reyes plays out.
</P>
<P>
   In U.S. District Court in Tucson, Reyes' attorney described him
as a devout Catholic who obtained a law degree at the University of
Guadalajara, in part, through a thesis advocating adoptions as an
alternative to abortions.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney, Abrams, also argued that Reyes has been
cooperative with federal prosecutors. Reyes, a once-prominent
Douglas businessman who recently filed for bankruptcy, contacted
U.S. authorities as soon as he discovered he was under
investigation, Abrams said. Reyes voluntarily sat for seven hours
of questioning on May 3 in which he ``cooperated fully, and
answered every question,'' the attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that cooperation, Reyes was shocked when police
arrested him last Wednesday. He has since been confined to a
federal prison in Florence.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two women from New York, Arlene Lieberman and Arlene
Reingold, also arrested last week, have been released on bail of
$150,000 each. They and Reyes are accused in a federal indictment
of illegally arranging as many as 17 adoptions during the past
decade.
</P>
<P>
   According to U.S. and Mexican officials, Reyes would find
children in Mexico that the two women would offer for adoption to
couples in New York for as much as $22,000 per child. The babies
were smuggled across the border by women posing as their mothers.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Margarita Soto, an employee of Reyes, was arrested
by Mexican police in Agua Prieta, just across the border from
Douglas. She was charged with trafficking in children after
attempting to take a baby across the border into the U.S. &QL;

EDITORIAL: FATIGUE AND THE FAA'S METABOLISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, June 2:
</P>
<P>
   Pilots, airlines and safety experts have long prodded the
Federal Aviation Administration to modernize its 1985 rule
requiring pilots to get at least eight hours of rest in the 24
hours before the end of their flight duty. Since 1989 the National
Transportation Safety Board has urged the agency to develop new
standards that better reflect research findings about sleep, the
body's circadian rhythms and fatigue countermeasures. Yet
throughout this decade, the FAA's efforts to draft new rules have
floundered. The one action the FAA can, and should, take
immediately is to outlaw two practices known to contribute to
fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial aviation in the United States enjoys an enviable
safety record, and fatigue is by no means a major cause of
accidents. Even so, two accidents in the last few years, including
one in 1993 in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, demonstrate that fatigue can
impair pilot performance and decision-making. At Guantanamo Bay, a
cargo airliner struck the ground about a quarter-mile before it
reached the runway, destroying the plane and seriously injuring the
crew. The FAA cited impaired judgment and flying ability as
probable causes, noting that the crew was suffering from
``disruption of circadian rhythms and sleep loss, which resulted in
fatigue. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 draft rule would have cut a pilot's on-duty hours from 16
to 14 a day. Within that it set 10 hours as the maximum for flight
duty, up from 8. The daily rest period would have expanded from 8
hours to 10. Pilots opposed the flight-duty increase. The airlines,
via the Air Transport Association, disliked the price tag. They
said that the draft rule would cost more than $1 billion for new
pilots in the first year.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides, however, approved of two anti-fatigue provisions.
One would rid the rules of language that can be used to supersede
the limit on flight time. The other would end the ability to exceed
the limit on flight time by assigning pilots to so-called tail-end
ferrying, moving near-empty planes from one locale to another.
These anti-fatigue measures would help prevent another Guantanamo
Bay. Both ought to be added to the FAA's books promptly. Then the
FAA should revise the overall rest-and-duty rules based on the
latest scientific evidence. There is no need for further delay.

THREE DISQUALIFIED FROM USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Three USC football players have been academically
disqualified from the university, effectively ending their athletic
careers.
</P>
<P>
   Junior free safety Darnell Lacy, senior wide receiver Quincy
Woods and freshman offensive lineman Robby Wood were dismissed
following the completion of USC's spring semester last month.
</P>
<P>
   Two other players _ sophomore linebacker Darryl Knight and
junior defensive end Shamsud-Din Abdul-Shaheed _ have been
suspended from USC's season opener against Hawaii for poor academic
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Lacy's departure is the biggest blow for the Trojans. He was
listed as a co-starter at free safety following spring drills with
junior Ife Ohalete.
</P>
<P>
   ``The emergence of Darnell Lacy ... Darnell Lacy and Ife are
going tooth-and-nail against each other and we can't make a
decision,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said following spring practice.
``They're going into (fall) camp as co-starters. This area I feel
has been a surprise to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacy has battled academic problems since he arrived at USC.
Hackett suspended him from last year's season opener against Purdue
for academics.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who originally came to USC as a quarterback, redshirted
last season after undergoing knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Woods' departure leaves USC with just four upperclassmen on
scholarship at wide receiver. And two of those _ Stan Guyness and
Troy Garner _ have torn ligaments in their knees in the past seven
months.

SCOTTSDALE DISTRICT EMPLOYEES INCLUDED IN CRIMINAL INDICTMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By HAL MATTERN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   State authorities announced the criminal indictments Tuesday of
several current or former school officials, saying Arizona children
are being robbed by a ``culture of complacency.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictments accuse nine people _ including four with ties to
the Scottsdale School District _ of fraud, bid-rigging and misusing
public funds.
</P>
<P>
   Among the accusations: Public school officials catered a private
party with cafeteria food and workers, used credit cards to pay for
gambling trips and even paid themselves salaries while they served
time in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about public monies for the education of our
kids,'' Attorney General Janet Napolitano said Tuesday in
announcing the indictments. ``It's our job to make sure those
monies are spent in the classrooms, on the teachers and on the
students where they were meant to be spent, and not on personal
benefit for personal gain.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictments involve districts of varying size and wealth and
from both urban and rural areas. Napolitano said she doesn't see an
epidemic of problems with violations of procurement laws by
district officials, but she said that other cases are still under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first wave of cases,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Napolitano, whose office handled the investigations, said the
grand jury indictments focused on four Arizona districts:
Scottsdale Unified, Sunnyside Unified in Tucson, Paloma Elementary
near Gila Bend and Humboldt Unified in Yavapai County.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general issued ``letters of concern'' to three
other districts ordering them to correct potentially illegal
activities. Mesa Unified, Bouse Elementary near Parker and Yuma
Elementary were sent such letters.
</P>
<P>
   Napolitano said the indictments stemmed from investigations by
her office's School Fraud Task Force, which she formed after her
election in January in response to complaints from around the
state.
</P>
<P>
   None of the indictments announced Tuesday appeared to involve
huge sums of money, but Napolitano said they indicated that a
``culture of complacency'' has been allowed to flourish, allowing
the alleged violations to occur without being detected by district
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more extreme cases involved officials in the food
services department at Tucson's Sunnyside Unified District. Juan
Flores, former director of food services, is accused in an
indictment of allowing the use of district food, facilities and
employees to cater a private party for 250 people.
</P>
<P>
   Flores, who retired early last year, couldn't be reached for
comment Tuesday. District officials said they conducted their own
investigation into the allegations, but no corroborating witnesses
came forward until after the attorney general's investigation
began.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been aware of the investigation for a number of
months, and we have been cooperating with the attorney general,''
said Monique Soria, a district spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   In the Paloma Elementary District near Gila Bend, former
superintendent Frank Solano was indicted in the theft of nearly
$5,000 from the district. He is accused of issuing himself a check
for writing and administering grants even though he already was
being paid for those services as part of his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Solano, who reportedly moved to Nevada last year, also is
accused of accepting $1,500 in pay for days he was actually in jail
for failing to pay child support. And he is charged with using a
district credit card to pay for gambling trips.
</P>
<P>
   The largest number of indictments involve former employees of
the Scottsdale Unified District. It was sued eight months ago by
the Attorney General's Office after investigators discovered cases
of fee-splitting, kickbacks and bid rigging in the district's
contract process.
</P>
<P>
   The district admitted to illegally awarding $11.7 million in
contracts and agreed to pay a $300,000 civil penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The Scottsdale indictments announced Tuesday focused mainly on
Edward F. Biszantz, the district's former building services
director. He and his wife, Shirley Henry-Biszantz, are charged with
theft and fraud for allegedly using a district-owned laptop
computer for her private business and then trying to conceal it by
erasing files and making false statements to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Biszantz, who retired from the district in January, also
was indicted with Dennis J. Peloquin for allegedly concocting a
bid-rigging scheme to ensure that Peloquin's business, Amer-X
Security, would be chosen to provide the district's security
system.
</P>
<P>
   In the more than yearlong investigation into the Scottsdale
district's finances, auditors found the couple accepted a discount
on personal and business security systems and monitoring services
worth $2,707 three months after school officials asked for sealed
bids on security services. Auditors cited procurement violations
worth $103,112.
</P>
<P>
   The Biszantzes were unavailable for comment Tuesday. Tod
Schleier, attorney for the couple, said he was reviewing the
charges and planned to meet his clients later this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly they look forward for an opportunity to defend
themselves and have this matter heard by a jury,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Peloquin did not return phone calls. His security company has
been a Scottsdale district vendor for more than five years.
</P>
<P>
   District Board President Barbara Newby said she doesn't expect
the indictments to bring closure to the scandal that has rocked the
school district.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not over in my mind until I hear from them that we are
all done,'' said Newby, who months ago admonished school
administrators for not formally charging Biszantz or putting him on
paid leave.
</P>
<P>
   Two state legislators who backed a bill earlier this year to
strengthen school district procurement laws said they would pursue
plans to hold more hearings on the issue this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Marc Spitzer,
R-north-central Phoenix, said his committee would meet to hear
testimony on alleged violations. The committee might use the
Legislature's power to subpoena witnesses, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a big reservoir of complaints,'' Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barry Wong, R-north-central Phoenix, also said he would
like to conduct joint House-Senate hearings on the issue. Wong
joined Spitzer and Sen. Ruth Solomon, D-Tucson, in supporting
legislation that gives more enforcement power to the attorney
general and the auditor general in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to continue that work,'' Wong said. ``We'll probably
also look at charter school issues, too. It is important to shed
more light on this.'' &QL;

DAWDIE ACCENTUATED THE POSITIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Every so often a column attempting to look on life's
brighter side results in a particularly troubling response.
</P>
<P>
   These are the ones from members of the clergy implying that it's
insensitive, or even heartless, to express the view that while life
in America isn't perfect, each generation has it better than the
last. The columns in question challenge widely publicized efforts
by the chronically lugubrious to make the case that today's
beleaguered working class is losing ground.
</P>
<P>
   Such contentions are at odds with ubiquitous signs of prosperity
even though the authors use myriad statistics to prove their
claims. Columns challenging these claims bring considerable
response from well-meaning folk saying it's bad form to gloss over
the plight of the struggling classes.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally these reproofs come from ministers. What made the
most recent ministerial admonition ironic was its arrival about the
same time a family member was helping me track down a copy of a
column written 16 years ago during similar circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Columnists are probably best served by resisting the urge to
explain themselves, but criticisms occasionally strike a personal
nerve so deeply it becomes impossible not to give in to these
urges. Like this one, the column back in May 1983 focused on
another clergyman. His name was Harvey Orr, and he had more
influence on my life than any other person. His call came
relatively late in life, prompting him to abandon a promising
career as an executive with the Pennsylvania Railroad to become a
Presbyterian minister.
</P>
<P>
   He was my mother's father and his family called him Dawdie, a
nickname bestowed by one of his four daughters who had trouble
saying Daddy. Dawdie was a country preacher ministering to rural
flocks in Virginia and West Virginia. Those who worshiped in
Dawdie's churches were working people, mostly of limited means,
like Dawdie.
</P>
<P>
   None likely considered themselves disadvantaged, however,
because they accepted the struggle of keeping body and soul
together as life's norm. Dawdie never earned much, but his
propensity for thrift allowed him to work miracles with what he
had. One of his most remarkable achievements was sending four
daughters through college during the 1930s. He did this despite the
economic challenge posed by the Great Depression and the cultural
challenge posed by a society that didn't encourage higher education
for women.
</P>
<P>
   Dawdie's legacy to me was a respect for hard work and an
optimism based on the enduring conviction that no matter how bad
things get, they could always be worse. When things don't get
worse, it's cause for joy and thanks.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the stuff of a make-believe Pollyanna. It's a matter
of being able to look around and appreciate your own particular
place in the overall scheme of things. My feedback over the years
leads to the conclusion that those preoccupied with life's downside
are entirely focused on themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Dawdie's world included a lot of people who were disadvantaged,
by the standard of any generation. He never, however, pitied them
or patronized them. What he did was try to appeal to the best they
had to give on their journey through this life.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, he seemed to succeed.

UNION OFFICIALS CRITICAL OF FINAL TWA CONTRACT OFFER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Machinists union officials on Tuesday roundly
criticized Trans World Airlines' final contract offer made last
Friday to 16,000 union members.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators for the union have recommended that members reject
the offer. Union officials said a strike deadline set for next week
probably would be extended to give TWA employees time to study the
proposal and to vote on it.
</P>
<P>
   The three employee groups within the Machinists will conduct a
strike authorization vote at the same time they vote on the offer.
</P>
<P>
   TWA said its proposal would bring all wages within 90 percent of
the airline industry average by July 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The union has remained adamant in seeking a contract that will
bring all employees to industry standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our negotiating committee feels there's more to be gotten in a
new contract,'' said Keith Nelson, president of Machinists Local
1650 in Kansas City. ``Our membership can't continue to subsidize
mismanagement at this company.''
</P>
<P>
   Local 1650 represents about 2,300 mechanics and related
employees at TWA's overhaul base in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The union also represents passenger service employees and flight
attendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly isn't anything improved about TWA's offer,''
said Sherry Cooper, union general chairwoman of the flight
attendants unit. ``It's an insult to (the) intelligence of
our...members, especially the flight attendants.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said meetings will be held at 58 TWA employee stations to
explain the proposal. A 30-day ``cooling off'' period is scheduled
to expire June 9 at 11:01 p.m., after which the union would be free
to strike.
</P>
<P>
   But Nelson said, ``There's a very good chance that (the strike
deadline) will be postponed, although we don't like it.''
</P>
<P>
   After two bankruptcy reorganizations this decade, TWA has little
chance of surviving a systemwide strike, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The employees are walking a fine line here,'' said Bill
DiBenedetto, associate editor of /{Commercial Aviation Report/}.
``If they do go on strike, that could really sink the company.
TWA's cash position isn't good enough to withstand a strike.''
</P>
<P>
   Union officials have said their financial analysts believe TWA
can afford to give more than it is offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``TWA is poised to take off and do something good, but they've
got to get this contract done and take care of their employees
first,'' Nelson said. &QL;

CERNER CORP. OFFICER SAYS MEDICAL SOFTWARE BUSINESS REGAINS
MOMENTUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Cerner Corp.'s medical software business has
bottomed out, and the company's financial fortunes are headed back
up, Cerner's top officer told shareholders Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Neal L. Patterson, the North Kansas City medical software
company's chairman, president and chief executive officer, said he
didn't expect the upward trend to emerge quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Some potential Cerner customers have delayed purchases until
they finish fixing problems related to the year 2000 computer bug.
</P>
<P>
   But while Y2K problems should fade next year, health providers
are ``in for a couple of very tough years'' because of cutbacks in
Medicare payments, Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 took out $115 billion of
payments that were previously targeted toward hospitals, doctors
and home health agencies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Providers must deal with the Medicare cuts along with tighter
reimbursements from managed care companies, Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Patterson said Cerner would market its software as a
tool that hospitals and other providers can use to save money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our technologies are positioned to be part of the answer for
these health-care systems to get through this very tough time
they're heading toward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cerner's HNA Millennium software is designed to loop together
the information systems of hospitals, pharmacies, laboratories,
doctors' offices and other health-related entities, thereby cutting
paperwork and streamlining services.
</P>
<P>
   At the annual meeting, Patterson, Thomas A. McDonnell and former
U.S. Sen. Jack Danforth of Missouri were re-elected to the board of
directors.

IN ALBANY, LEGISLATORS MINGLE WITH LOBBYISTS BEARING GIFTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Soon after the New York Legislature recessed for
the day recently, the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, set up shop
in a secluded room at a hotel near the Capitol. There he stood for
more than an hour, flanked by aides and other prominent lawmakers,
a receiving line of Democrats with the power to give bills wings or
slap them into the trash. The price to enjoy such company: a $2,500
campaign contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Silver and his colleagues were thronged by the very lobbyists
who lobby them by day, including that day. Need to follow up on a
chat in a Statehouse corridor, buttonhole an elusive committee
chairman, smooth the way for a contentious proposal? In the Albany
tradition, buy a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important part of the system,'' said Robert Malito,
a ubiquitous lobbyist who attended the fund-raising event, as well
as a Republican one, here that night. After receiving donations, he
said, legislators ``are more apt to bring you in and say, `What's
on your mind?' later on.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers of both major parties have long sponsored fund-raising
events while the Legislature is in session, realizing that
lobbyists looking for help on legislation would be reluctant to
rebuff requests for contributions. But the practice is more
prevalent than ever in Albany, even as more than 20 states have
banned similar fund-raisers, decreeing it unseemly for legislators
to collect donations in their capitals while they are in session.
</P>
<P>
   Fund-raising, in fact, is one activity that has not bogged down
in Albany in a year when almost everything else has. Legislative
leaders and Gov. George Pataki are so at odds that the state budget
is two months late, significant decisions on health care policy and
other major issues have been shoved aside, and lawmakers are having
one of their least productive sessions in recent memory. Not so
their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   With the cost of political races rising, members are asking for
higher donations and holding far more events than they did only a
few years ago, many lobbyists say. There are 211 lawmakers, and by
the scheduled end of the six-month session on June 16, most will
have passed the hat in the capital area _ even though none of them
face the voters until next year. The political committees run by
the legislative leaders will also have held several events,
including the one at the hotel the other night, sponsored by the
Democratic Assembly Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the cocktails and hors d'oeuvres, it was a scene that
could have been transplanted from the foyer outside the Assembly
chamber. There was Malito, a lion of the lobbying establishment
(whose clients range from Philip Morris to the American Diabetes
Association), greeting Assemblyman Herman Farrell Jr., chairman of
the Ways and Means Committee. Nearby was Lester Shulklapper
(Bankers Association, Beer Wholesalers, et al), as well as
lobbyists for hospitals, doctors, securities firms, funeral
directors, teachers and state workers, to name just a few.
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raisers are not exactly a secret in Albany, but neither
are they widely publicized, and several lobbyists at this one
grimaced when a reporter asked why they attended, as if they had
been questioned about their weight. They then declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The more active lobbyists frequent most lawmakers' fund-raisers,
sometimes half a dozen a night. So it was no surprise that the cast
at the Democratic fund-raiser was similar to one at an affair
sponsored the same evening by state Sen. Michael Balboni, a Nassau
County Republican ($300 a ticket).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really social,'' Balboni said of the practice, playing
down any link to lawmakers' decisions. ``I really mean it. I know
there is a perceived connection.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund-raisers are not intended for ordinary folks eager to
take part in the democratic process. Lawmakers often draw
invitation lists from the state's index of registered lobbyists,
and ticket prices range from $150 for events benefiting one
lawmaker to $2,500 for the private receptions held by the
legislative campaign committees. At those prices, a legislator can
raise $5,000 to $25,000 in a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   Such largess is not available to challengers in elections, for
whom lobbyists have little use. This is one reason incumbents are
rarely defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki and other statewide officials also occasionally sponsor
fund-raisers in Albany, but they are less dependent on them. For
high-ranking politicians, lobbyists are more willing to travel.
</P>
<P>
   A few renegade lawmakers, led by Assemblyman Alexander Grannis,
a Manhattan Democrat, have proposed in recent years that New York
emulate other states and prohibit the Albany fund-raisers. But
legislative leaders of both major parties have quashed the bill in
the past, and it appears to have little chance this year.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers generally oppose changing the state's
campaign finance rules, and assert that there is nothing improper
about the events. State Sen. Serphin Maltese, a Queens Republican
who is chairman of the Elections Committee, said of a ban, ``I
don't think that accomplishes anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's aides declined to say whether the governor favored a
ban.
</P>
<P>
   Even Silver, a supporter of tighter restrictions on fund-raising
in state politics, and the Assembly Democratic leadership see
nothing wrong with the events. ``I don't think it makes a
difference where you hold a fund-raiser,'' Silver said, taking a
break from shaking lobbyists' hands the other night.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Illinois, where the politics is as rough-and-tumble as in New
York, many lawmakers maintained that view until an
influence-peddling scandal embarrassed Illinois politicians. Last
year, the Illinois Legislature passed an ethics measure that barred
both lawmakers and statewide officials from collecting donations
during the session in the capital, Springfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of appearance,'' said state Sen. Kirk Dillard, a
Republican from a Chicago suburb who was a sponsor of the measure.
``The public doesn't believe that you should be holding a
fund-raiser breakfast in a morning and two hours later going over
to a capital building casting votes on legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   In Albany, at times, there seems to be only the narrowest divide
between the work of the Legislature and the political campaigns of
its members. Fund-raisers are sometimes held in state-owned
buildings a few hundred yards from legislative chambers during a
break in legislative action in the middle of the day. One day last
month, just before the state Senate went into session, members of
the Republican majority and lobbyists trooped down to a privately
run restaurant in the state-owned mall connected to the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   For a $500 donation to the Republicans' committee, the lobbyists
hobnobbed at a luncheon sponsored by Joseph Bruno and other
Republican senators. Afterward, many of the participants returned
for the session in the Senate, where some of the lobbyists assumed
their customary positions on the couches outside the chambers,
continuing their talks with the Republican senators who
occasionally exited the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Grannis of Manhattan, who does not sponsor
fund-raisers in Albany, said ``this money hustle is shameful,
really shameful.'' (Similar criticism is also heard in Washington,
where members of Congress routinely hold these types of affairs).
</P>
<P>
   To most lobbyists, the events are practically a price of working
here. Some readily acknowledge the benefits of attending, spending
tens of thousands of dollars on tickets annually _ both their own
money and their clients'. Yet in the same breath, they insist that
money plays no role in lawmakers' decisions about whom to meet or
how to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps with access,'' Shulklapper said. ``It's best to show
your face.'' But he added that ``nobody is bought by a fund-raiser.
There is nothing sinister going on. It's a social event.''
</P>
<P>
   Shulklapper said he opposed a ban on Albany events, particularly
if the alternative would be having to attend fund-raisers in
districts across the state.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the fund-raisers are social events or arm-twisting
sessions, many lobbyists would probably not miss them if they were
banned.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not particularly pleasurable,'' Margaret Boepple,
chief lobbyist for Nixon, Hargrave, Devans &AMP; Doyle, one of the
leading firms in the capital, said of the events. ``But until
things change here, they are a necessary part of doing business.''

EDITORIAL: A NEW APPROACH TO NORTH KOREA 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, June 2:
</P>
<P>
   North Korea can improve relations with the United States by
responding positively to the offer William Perry, the former
defense secretary, delivered last week. Perry carried a letter from
President Clinton offering to phase out American economic sanctions
and begin steps toward diplomatic recognition of North Korea. But
Washington will do so only if Pyongyang commits itself to give up
its nuclear weapons ambitions and long-range missile programs.
</P>
<P>
   Perry got a warm welcome, although he did not get to meet with
the North's leader, Kim Jong-il. Pyongyang should be given
reasonable time to reply to the Clinton proposal, but would be most
unwise to reject it.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's new offer goes well beyond the 1994 agreement that
froze North Korea's nuclear weapons program in exchange for help in
constructing Western-style power reactors. The North continues to
comply with that agreement, as shown again last week when American
inspectors found no evidence of building at a site Washington once
feared was being prepared for new nuclear installations.
</P>
<P>
   But provocative North Korean actions in other areas, like last
year's surprise test of a long-range missile, and repeated requests
for large sums of money in exchange for further arms control
progress, have left Washington wary of making further incremental
deals with the North.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea, for its part, feels that it was led to expect some
progress toward ending sanctions and moving toward recognition in
1994 and that Washington has not yet followed through on these
issues. The administration can return to these questions now
because of a recent change in South Korean policies toward the
North. Kim Dae-jung, who became South Korea's president last year,
favors a conciliatory policy toward Pyongyang, including an end to
American sanctions. He hopes that expanding economic and diplomatic
ties will encourage gradual change in the North and decrease the
chances of a new war on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is right to coordinate America's policies with
Seoul's by also offering better ties. But there can be little
progress unless the North abandons its nuclear and missile
ambitions.

FLORIDA OFFICIAL PESSIMISTIC ABOUT DODGERS TRAINING CAMP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ A leading state official said Florida Gov. Jeb
Bush's vetoing of a $7.5 million funding bill killed Vero Beach's
efforts to keep the Los Angeles Dodgers training at Dodgertown.
</P>
<P>
   Indian River County administrator Jim Chandler said Bush's
surprising decision last Thursday to ax the bill leaves the city
and county without a way to come up with the needed $20 million in
funding. They have $13 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state funding was going to be absolutely critical in
trying to retain the Dodgers,'' Chandler said. ``Without that
funding, at least from our perspective at this time, it kills our
effort to keep the Dodgers here.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's decision also strengthens the bargaining position of the
Fort McDowell Indian Community, which is trying to lure the Dodgers
to the Phoenix area.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers officials will meet with city and county representatives
today in Vero Beach to discuss the next step, but Chandler said he
doesn't believe the Dodgers will remain at Dodgertown ``unless
there's a dramatic change.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers want the city and county to purchase Dodgertown from
the ballclub and renovate the facility. However, the land itself
was appraised by the Dodgers at $14.5 million, and the local
government said it has no other funding available.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Callan, managing director of Dodgertown, said the meeting
was called by the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've planned a meeting with them to go over all of the
events, and see if there's anything we can do to keep the Dodgers
in Vero Beach,'' said Callan, a Dodgers employee who lives there.
</P>
<P>
   Callan was asked if this was the last meeting between the
Dodgers and local officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope not, but it all depends on how the meeting
goes,'' Callan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers began spring training in Dodgertown in 1948 and are
the only major-league team to own its own facility.
</P>
<P>
   Sources in Arizona said the Fort McDowell folks are eager to
take a more aggressive role in negotiating with the Dodgers in the
next few weeks. A spokesperson for the Yavapai Tribe, which owns
the land near Phoenix, said the cost of the project can be cut from
$50 million to near $30 million if the facility is built for one
team instead of two.
</P>
<P>
   Other significant, periphery cutbacks can be made if the Dodgers
make some concessions, such as lowering the number of proposed
housing units from 260 to approximately 100.
</P>
<P>
   Brown starts Friday: The Dodgers, who are off Thursday, will
keep right-handers Kevin Brown and Chan Ho Park on their regular
rotation of four days rest while pushing lefty Carlos Perez back in
the pitching sequence.
</P>
<P>
   Brown will pitch Friday's series opener against the Angels. Park
pitches Saturday. Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said Sunday's
starter is undecided because of various circumstances, ranging from
Ismael Valdes' blister to Darren Dreifort's ailing shin.
</P>
<P>
   Draft talks: The annual amateur draft begins today, and with it
comes the first significant opportunity for the Dodgers' new regime
to begin upgrading their minor-league system.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers lost their first-round pick (20th overall) to the
San Diego Padres as compensation for signing pitcher Kevin Brown
during the offseason. Their first pick is a ``sandwich'' pick
between the first and second rounds (37th overall). The Dodgers
also have picks at 69th and 83rd.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to increase our athleticism, increase our raw talent,
our raw speed,'' said Bill Geivett, Dodgers assistant general
manager and minor-league director. ``Those are the impact tools.
That's something we need to focus on throughout the system.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' minor-league teams entered Tuesday with an
aggregate mark of 96-110 and few good prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Balks, walks and chalk: The Dodgers announced Dodger Stadium
will be the first major-league ballpark to display publicly Mark
McGwire's record-setting 70th home run baseball when they host the
Angels this Friday through Sunday. It kicks off the club's 13th
annual Think Blue Week.... Pittsburgh's Jason Kendall's triple in
the third inning extended his hitting streak to 12 games, matching
a career high.

EDITORIAL: CUNY'S WORST ENEMY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, June 2:
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki's appointment of Herman Badillo as the
chairman of the City University of New York has incited outrage
from some of CUNY's longtime supporters. The man they call CUNY's
``worst enemy'' or ``the purveyor of chaos'' is now in charge. For
all their worry, however, Badillo's reputation could be one of his
assets in today's political environment. A close ally of Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani and a supporter of Pataki, this experienced
politician might be able to wangle more state and city support for
the 200,000-student complex. The problem is that CUNY is a lot
easier to criticize than to fix. Badillo's formidable task will be
to add much-needed value to a CUNY degree without destroying New
York City's traditionally open ``gateway'' to a college education
and its rewards.
</P>
<P>
   Badillo, a City University graduate himself who promotes a
by-your-bootstraps philosophy that he says helped bring him into
power in New York, will first have to find a four-star chancellor.
He needs a forceful and independent-minded educator to take over
CUNY's 6 community colleges, 11 senior colleges and a law school,
medical school and graduate school. High-quality candidates may be
difficult to find, given the dangers of political interference
through Badillo's allegiances to the mayor and governor, the
questions about whether his CUNY chairmanship is a prelude to
running for New York City mayor in 2001 and Badillo's own hot
rhetoric on the subject of city education.
</P>
<P>
   Badillo, who was appointed on Saturday by the governor, said he
would push forcefully to end the ``remediation industry'' at CUNY.
He would make certain that CUNY phases out remedial classes for
most senior colleges and requires students to pass reading, writing
and mathematics exams with the help of ``immersion'' programs run
by CUNY before they can enter CUNY's bachelor's degree programs.
The new chairman also said he planned to ask for extra funds to
expand the College Now program that allows CUNY's professors to
help high schools around the city better prepare their students to
graduate and go on to college.
</P>
<P>
   While giving the CUNY degree more clout, however, Badillo and
his colleagues should not destroy the openness of CUNY or the
freedom that allows some students, such as working mothers, to take
longer than customary to get their degrees. The new chairman must
also find ways to encourage confidence in him by the CUNY faculty
and the Board of Regents. He has already begun saying, as he did
Tuesday in an interview at The Times, that ``we have no secret
agenda to close down CUNY or anything of the sort.'' Those
comforting words, like his sharp criticisms in the recent past, now
compete for reality as Badillo begins his charge at the city's
university system.

REDS SHUT OUT METS, 4-0 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bad became worse for the New York Mets at Shea
Stadium on Tuesday night, as Bobby Valentine's nemesis, Pete
Harnisch, tossed seven shutout innings in leading the Cincinnati
Reds to a 4-0 victory and saddling the Mets with their season-high
fifth straight defeat.
</P>
<P>
   All five losses have come on this home stand, leaving the Mets
(27-25) with a 13-14 record at Shea. Not since April 27 have the
Mets been only two games over .500. That was the day before they
went on a six-game winning streak. Since that streak ended the Mets
have dropped 16 of 26 games.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have scored just 12 runs in the five losses. And the
frustration is beginning to show. Everywhere, especially every time
Bobby Bonilla comes to bat or has a ball hit near him.
</P>
<P>
   There were no boos on Monday, before or after Bonilla homered in
four at-bats in his return from the disabled list. But on Tuesday
night, Bonilla was the subject of the fans' ire again.
</P>
<P>
   He was booed when he struck out in the first and he was booed
when he flied to right in the fourth. He was even booed when he
spanked a line drive right at second baseman Pokey Reese in the
sixth and then again when he grounded out hard in his final at-bat
to end the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   But Bonilla was booed most often in the field, once in the
fourth after he failed to catch up to a ball he might have been
able to run down. It led to Cincinnati's second run off Orel
Hershiser, who allowed four runs in five innings after winning his
previous two decisions. The other boos for Bonilla's fielding came
on balls that he had no chance of getting near, especially while
playing on a sore right knee.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. Bonilla has become the symbol for what is
increasingly becoming a frustrating season. And as the 36-year-old
outfielder ran back and forth between right and center, he
underlined the amount of gap in the Mets' offense, as well.
</P>
<P>
   With Rey Ordonez back from a mysterious injury to his right
knee, the Mets had their Opening-Day lineup back intact for the
first time since Mike Piazza injured his right knee in Montreal
during the fifth game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   It did not help. Harnisch (5-5), who extended his shutout streak
to 16 innings, had to be relishing it as the Mets stranded seven
runners in his seven innings against the right-hander, who hardly
saw eye to eye with Valentine while pitching for the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch was helped when Ordonez pulled the biggest gaffe of the
game, trying to scoot from first base to third on Rickey
Henderson's one-out single to center. Mike Cameron's throw nailed
him easily, then Edgardo Alfonzo was robbed by Barry Larkin at
short to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' frustration grew in the fourth. With Cincinnati up by
2-0, Brian McRae, whose third-inning error in center led to the
Reds' first run, lined out to short to leave runners on second and
third. Even though McRae hit the ball hard, he smashed his bat
along the first-base line before he went out to center field.
</P>
<P>
   It was an image befitting the Mets' struggles.
</P>
<P>
   McRae was part of the Mets' outfield that consisted of Henderson
and Bonilla for the second game in a row. It meant that Roger
Cedeno, who leads the major leagues in stolen bases with 28, and
Benny Agbayani, who is hitting .442, sat for a second straight
game.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Valentine said that he had spoken to all of his
outfielders regarding the new circumstances surrounding their
playing time now that Bonilla is back from the disabled list. On
Tuesday night, however, Bonilla said he had not met with Valentine.
But Bonilla did say, ``I don't think that they would have brought
me here if I wasn't going to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson has insisted that ``if I'm not expected to play, then
I would ask out; that's on any club I'm on.''
</P>
<P>
   There is still some question regarding how often any of the
three veterans will play if they do not produce. But this weekend,
Valentine has an easy opportunity to get either Cedeno or Agbayani
into the lineup because Bonilla has already told his manager he has
no problem being the designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Bonilla had problems with his manager in
Baltimore, Davey Johnson, because of his unwillingness to d.h. But
because Bonilla is still recovering from a partly torn posterior
cruciate ligament, he welcomes the opportunity to take a break from
the duties of the outfield while still being able to swing a bat.

PLAN TO SOLIDIFY RADIOACTIVE WASTE FAILS AFTER $489 MILLION IN
RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to insert new 3rd graf and to add clarifying details in 7th
and 12th grafs.)  (rm) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After spending 16 years and $489 million on a
crucial step in its plan to safely store millions of gallons of
highly radioactive waste, the Energy Department has abandoned the
procedure because it produces explosive gases.
</P>
<P>
   Department officials said Tuesday they will replace the
contractor, a former subsidiary of Westinghouse, and asked outside
scientists to help find another method.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatives could take years to develop and cost billions.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ernest Moniz, the undersecretary of energy, said that
experiments in the early 1980's showed the process was producing
high levels of explosive benzene gas. But rather than trying to
develop a new procedure, ``some rather poor judgment was used''
and, instead, engineers tried to make the process safe.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released Tuesday by Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., the
General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, said
part of the problem was ``design and construction being done
concurrently _ with an emphasis on pushing ahead in the belief that
the problems could be solved later.'' That a test in 1983 produced
more benzene than the instruments could measure ``seemed to have
been forgotten over time,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Dingell, in a statement, said ``mismanagement by the Department
of Energy and Westinghouse led to an extraordinary, and pathetic,
waste of taxpayer money. All we have to show for $500 million is a
20-year delay, and the opportunity to risk another $1 billion to
make a problematic process work.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan is intended to solidify wastes left over from nuclear
weapons production that will be dangerously radioactive for
thousands of years. About 34 million gallons of the wastes are
stored in 51 aging underground tanks, judged to be vulnerable to
earthquakes, at the Savannah River site, near Aiken, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   The South Carolina plant is one of two main sites at which the
government is storing wastes from nuclear weapons. Because the
chemical mixture of the waste there was considered simpler than
that at the second plant, in Hanford, Wash., it was decided to deal
with the problem in South Carolina first.
</P>
<P>
   The first stage in the plan was to concentrate the wastes so the
volume would be manageable. For the second stage, mixing the
radioactive material into molten glass, the department has built a
$2 billion factory.
</P>
<P>
   The factory works, but the process that Westinghouse wanted to
use to concentrate the wastes created benzene, a chemical found in
gasoline that can burn or explode.
</P>
<P>
   With that approach abandoned, the department may be forced to
spend billions more and take many more years to develop an
alternate.
</P>
<P>
   The department decided in January 1998 not to proceed with the
step Westinghouse favored to concentrate the wastes and Moniz said
that the Energy Secretary, Bill Richardson, in a step that is rare
in government, decided last week to ask for bids from other
companies to replace Westinghouse.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Westinghouse said that if the plan it favored
did not work, the government could spend $1 billion to build a
processing plant to handle the waste in smaller batches, to control
benzene emissions. The Energy Department hopes to choose an
alternative by fall.
</P>
<P>
   But the costs may run higher. The General Accounting Office, in
a report released Tuesday, said that an alternative might take
eight years to develop and could cost $2.3 billion to $3.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Moniz, in a telephone interview, acknowledged that ``some
significant amount of funds could have been saved by pulling the
plug somewhat earlier.'' But he added that several billion dollars
would be saved by perfecting a way to concentrate the wastes, and
thereby reducing the volume of material to be sent to the glass
factory.
</P>
<P>
   Westinghouse Government Services, the Westinghouse subsidiary in
charge of concentrating the wastes was sold in March to Morrison
Knudsen and BNFL (formerly British Nuclear Fuels Limited). It will
continue to run other operations at Savannah River. Officials for
the contractor and at the Energy Department would not estimate the
value of the contract that the company will lose.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department has even more wastes in underground tanks
at its Hanford nuclear reservation, near Richland, Wash., and these
are leaking into the Columbia River. It is working with BNFL to
devise a system for solidifying the wastes there, but the Energy
Department had tried to solve the problems at Savannah River first
because they were considered chemically simpler. Savannah River was
built by DuPont and operated by that company for 30 years beginning
in the early '50s; Hanford was run by a variety of companies with
far less chemistry experience.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists at Savannah River discovered, to their dismay,
that copper and palladium in the tanks were acting as catalysts,
and allowing faster production of benzene.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was to add a chemical called tetraphenylborate to the
tanks, to make cesium and strontium, two of the most intensely
radioactive waste products in the liquids, fall to the bottom. The
liquids would then be reduced in volume in an evaporator, and the
resulting solids, which were not highly radioactive, would be mixed
with cement. The solids would go to the glass factory.
</P>
<P>
   The chemical problems at Hanford are different, but experts
there are worried by the problems at Savannah River. Jerry Pollet,
executive director of Heart of America Northwest, an environmental
group, said that ``from a management point of view, it raises a
huge concern here.'' The department signed a contract under which
it promises to provide the wastes to a glass factory to be built by
BNFL, and if it fails to deliver, he said, it would pay penalties.

HONG KONG DOING WORSE ECONOMICALLY TWO YEARS AFTER HANDOVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Two years after being taken back by China, Hong Kong
is doing better politically and worse economically than was
expected in 1997, according to a delegation visiting Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Four Hong Kong spokesmen, two associated with the Hong Kong
government and two from the opposition Democratic Party, addressed
the Asia Society in Seattle Tuesday. While they didn't agree on
everything, there was some consensus.
</P>
<P>
   First, the economy continues downhill. Economist Joseph Lian, a
member of the Hong Kong Government's Central Policy Unit, said
output declined last quarter and that unemployment is at a 15-year
high of 6.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Lian said the economy should be ready to rebound, but that the
rebound would be slow. Because the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to
the U.S. dollar, he said, price adjustment has been slower than in
countries that have devalued currencies. Hong Kong rents have
fallen by a quarter and condo prices by about half. But he said,
``Wages have not adjusted downward.''
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong has had nothing like the U.S. Social Security or
unemployment insurance programs. Sin Chung Kai, the Democratic
spokesman for the economy, said the territory will start a
mandatory retirement fund next year that would take 5 percent of
wages each from private sector employees and employers.
</P>
<P>
   Because it stepped into the markets in the currency crisis of
last summer, the Hong Kong government owns 17 percent of the stocks
traded locally. Sin said the government plans to reduce that to 5
percent, ``which is a good move.''
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong also has about 36,000 unsold condos, the highest in 10
years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the political side, Lau Siu Kai, chairman of the sociology
department at Chinese University and a former adviser to China,
said the return of Hong Kong to China has gone reasonably well.
Polls of Hong Kong people show that China's leaders, Jiang Zemin
and Zhu Rongji, are ``even more popular than C.H. Tung,'' Hong
Kong's appointed governor.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's political parties, once defined by being
``pro-China'' or ``anti-China,'' are having to realign themselves
on socioeconomic issues _ and not doing well at it. ``There seems
to be a sense of chaos in our politics right now,'' Lau said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats (the ``anti-China'' party) are more critical of
the transition. James To, party spokesman for law, said China had
agreed that Hong Kong's courts would have jurisdiction over all
local affairs. Yet in the recent kidnapping case of a tycoon's son,
a criminal dubbed ``Big Spender'' (Cheung Tze Keung) was arrested,
tried and shot in China for a crime committed in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   As for Tung, To said the Beijing-appointed governor ``does not
feel human rights and democracy are important,'' but ``may feel the
rule of law is more important'' because business values it.
