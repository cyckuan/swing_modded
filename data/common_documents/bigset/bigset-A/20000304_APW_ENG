<HEADLINE> Coke's Ivestor Retires in Style  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN BACHMAN, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Coca-Cola's former chairman and chief executive,
M. Douglas Ivester, began his retirement last month with a $1.5
million check and a lucrative severance and pension package that
will pay him $115,000 monthly for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester, who officially retired Feb. 17, also will receive
$675,000 annually though February 2007 to serve as a consultant to
the Atlanta-based company he led until December, when he announced
his retirement plans. Coke has named Douglas Daft as Ivester's
successor.
</P>
<P>
   The compensation was released Friday in Coke's 2000 proxy
statement. Shareholders will meet April 19 in Wilmington, Del.
</P>
<P>
   The richest part of the deal involves the 1.95 million shares of
restricted Coke stock board members granted Ivester in 1983 and
1989. Ivester and other senior executives were not allowed to sell
the shares, but board members agreed to lift those restrictions on
Ivester.
</P>
<P>
   His shares were worth nearly $98 million based on Coke's price
of $50.12{ Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester, 52, also will receive $4.5 million in three equal
payments through February 2002 in place of bonuses he will not
receive in retirement. He received the first $1.5 million check
last month.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the company's early retirement package, Ivester also
will receive $58,700 monthly atop a separate $56,300 monthly
payment he'll receive from age 55 until he dies. Ivester's wife
will continue to receive the $56,300 if he dies before her.
</P>
<P>
   Coke spokesman Chuck Reece said the board of directors developed
the package, which was then approved by the board's compensation
committee. He said board members sought to accomplish four goals
with the package: ensure a smooth transition from Ivester to Daft;
recognize Ivester's contributions during his more than 20 years at
Coke; retain him as a consultant; and keep him from competing
against Coke in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester also will get to keep his company car, a 1996 Mercury
Grand Marquis, his laptop computer and cell phones. Coke also will
pay his club memberships and home security system costs and provide
him an office and secretarial services through May 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, one of the proposals shareholders will vote on at
their annual meeting is a request from a New Jersey woman to
eliminate bonuses, stock options, severance contracts and stock
awards as part of manager's compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Coke directors are urging shareholders to vote against the
proposal by Mary Morse. She did not return a call Friday seeking
comment.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Challenges Online Companies  </HEADLINE>
By KEVIN GALVIN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Assessing the future of the Internet,
President Clinton challenged online companies Friday to strengthen
consumer privacy safeguards and ordered government agencies to
evaluate the security of their own Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   He also urged the high-tech industry to work with him to ensure
that every America, regardless of class, has access to the tools
they need in the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are two (areas) which are absolutely vital to keep the
information economy and all America growing strong,'' the president
said. ''The first is Internet security and privacy and the second
is closing the digital divide.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke at an Aspen Institute forum Friday in the heart of
Silicon Valley at the start of a two-day visit with political
overtones to California. He helped raise money for Democrats such
as Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., whom he promoted as a possible
running mate for Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think she is immensely talented and would be good at
anything,'' Clinton said. ''But this is a decision that the vice
president should make after he wins the nomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Just days before Super Tuesday's primary elections, he also was
raising $1.6 million for Democrats and drawing sharp differences
between his party and Republican candidates on gun control and
patients' rights.
</P>
<P>
   The president issued an executive memorandum directing federal
agencies to ensure that their systems won't be used in the kinds of
''denial of service'' attacks that shut down several high-profile
Web sites last month.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking the day after the nation's largest Internet advertising
company backed away from a controversial plan to build extensive
personal profiles of Web users, Clinton challenged industry leaders
to do more to protect privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Surveys have shown that privacy is a major reason why more
consumers don't shop online. The president applauded the fact that
the number of firms with privacy policies increased from 15 percent
to 65 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''But the American people know it's still not enough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some subjects are so sensitive I believe they should have
legal protection,'' Clinton said. ''Our medical records, our legal
records, our financial records, any interaction we have with our
children online.''
</P>
<P>
   The president told the industry leaders and educators attending
a forum on communications and society that fair practices include
notifying consumers what information is collected and how it will
be used; the option to choose whether information can be shared
with third parties; access to information a site has collected;
security of that information during transmission and storage.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also renewed a pledge to cooperate with industry to
bridge the ''digital divide'' between the rich and poor and urged
the players in the industry to consider the impact of a
''tax-free'' Internet would have on local and state budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, most online transactions are free from sales tax. But
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers last week called for
establishing sales taxes for online purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The West Coast visit gave the president a chance to dabble in
politics just days before California -- the largest electoral state
-- votes chooses Republican and Democrat nominees to succeed him on
Super Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, Clinton was attending two events to raise
$600,000 for the re-election of Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.,
and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, as well as a
$400,000 Democratic National Committee Dinner. Clinton was the
featured guest Saturday at two DNC events in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The president also was holding a private meeting in San
Francisco with leaders the clergy, who often play a key role in
getting Democrats to the voting booths on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said the president would use the
fund-raising speeches to draw stark contrasts between the
Democratic candidates and the Republican candidates on the issues
of gun control and a patients' bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Clinton travels to Alabama to participate in the 35th
anniversary of the civil rights march on Selma.

<HEADLINE> Flames 4, Mighty Ducks 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- Jarome Iginla extended his point-scoring
streak to 15 games with two goals Friday night as the Calgary
Flames defeated the Anaheim Mighty Ducks 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Iginla has 12 goals and 13 assists during the streak, which ties
him with Luc Robitaille, Jaromir Jagr, Pierre Turgeon and Patrik
Elias for the longest streak in the NHL this season. Robitaille's
streak is still going.
</P>
<P>
   Iginla opened the scoring 6:04 into the game and made it 4-0
just 42 seconds into the third period with his 23rd goal of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Valeri Bure, with his 34th goal, and Jeff Cowan, with his first,
also scored for Calgary, winners of three in a row and 5-1-1 in its
last seven.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Savard had an assist on Iginla's goal to extend his points
streak to nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Kip Miller's power-play goal at 7:17 of the third period ended
goaltender Fred Brathwaite's bid for a shutout.
</P>
<P>
   Calgary moved within one point of idle Colorado and San Jose,
who are tied for seventh in the Western Conference. Calgary has a
game in hand on both.
</P>
<P>
   Calgary outshot Anaheim 37-17.
</P>
<P>
   Bure made it 2-0 at 8:31 of the second period when he collected
his own rebound off a backhander and flipped a forehand over goalie
Guy Hebert.
</P>
<P>
   Cowan gave Calgary a three-goal lead from a bad angle,
deflecting in Jason Wiemer's centering pass.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim coach Craig Hartsburgh replaced Hebert with Dominic
Roussel after Iginla's third-period goal and Roussel stopped all
eight shots he faced.

<HEADLINE> Stars 4, Coyotes 1  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Aaron Gavey and Jamie Langenbrunner each had a
goal and an assist as Dallas scored four goals in a 10-minute span
of the third period Friday night to beat the shorthanded Phoenix
Coyotes 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   With the come-from-behind victory, the Stars lengthened their
Pacific Division lead to seven points over the second-place
Coyotes, who were without four of their top players, including
leading scorer Jeremy Roenick.
</P>
<P>
   In the five games the teams have played this season, the home
team has never won. Phoenix won twice in Dallas, and the Stars have
won three times at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes, 1-4-1 in their last six games, have allowed eight
third-period goals in their last two games. Carolina scored four in
the third Wednesday night in Phoenix's 7-5 victory. The Stars
outshot Phoenix 19-10 in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Roenick was out with the flu, defenseman Teppo Numminen had a
hip flexor and goalie Sean Burke was sidelined with a groin pull.
Until Friday, Numminen had the longest current streak of
consecutive regular-season games in the NHL at 360. He hadn't
missed one since Dec. 15, 1995, when the franchise was in Winnipeg.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix has been without Keith Tkachuk for nine games with a
sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Coyotes nursed a 1-0 lead after two periods on Mika
Alatalo's goal at 4:11 of the second.
</P>
<P>
   But Dallas tied it just 1:25 into the third when Gavey passed to
Grant Marshall, who scored from the top of the right circle for his
first goal of the season. The Stars took the lead for good 2-1 at
6:36 on Langenbrunner's 10th goal of the season, with assists from
Mike Modano and Jamie Pushor.
</P>
<P>
   The onslaught on goalie Bob Essensa, who has been fighting the
flu all week, continued with Gavey flipping the puck into the right
corner of the net at 9:27 to make it 3-1, his fifth goal of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Brenden Morrow wrapped up the scoring, taking a pass from
Langenbrunner, faking to his left, then flipping past Essensa's
left glove to put Dallas up 4-1 at 11:07. Langenbrunner had an
assist on the play.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas goalie Ed Belfour had 26 saves. Atalo's goal lined off
Belfour's glove after a pass from Shane Doan. The assist gave Doan
100 career points.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix appeared to have scored again at 13:25 of the second
when Belfour blocked Deron Quint's shot but couldn't cover the
puck. Phoenix's Dallas Drake punched it into the net but referee
Mark Faucette blew the puck dead just before the shot, apparently
believing Belfour had covered it.

<HEADLINE> Whitman to endorse Bush in Connecticut, not New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Gov. Christie Whitman, who said earlier
this week she will formally endorse Texas Gov. George W. Bush prior
to the New York primary, will do just that on Saturday -- in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The governor is slated to endorse Bush at a news conference with
the candidate and Connecticut Gov. John Rowland Saturday night at
Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Conn. New York and
Connecticut are among the states holding primaries on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman on Monday told reporters attending the National
Governors Association meeting in Washington that she would ''do
something in New York'' for Bush as part of the Republican
governors' effort to support him in his bid for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   However, the moderate Whitman won't make the endorsement in New
York because of a scheduling conflict, according to spokesman Peter
McDonough. McDonough said Bush was campaigning in the southern tier
region of upstate New York, and ''she couldn't get to Binghamton.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman has long said she intends to formally endorse Bush, but
that she was waiting for the right time to help make an impact.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman wants to lend some moderate credentials to Bush, who
came under fire for appearing at Bob Jones University in South
Carolina in an attempt to woo conservatives. Bush has subsequently
apologized for not speaking out against ''anti-Catholic sentiments
and racial prejudice,'' while at the university, which bans
interracial dating and whose leaders have labeled the Catholic
church a ''Satanic cult.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonough said the endorsement by Whitman will show Bush has
''fiscal conservatives and social moderates'' in his camp.

<HEADLINE> Quake Hits Papua New Guinea  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- A powerful earthquake struck Papua New Guinea
early Saturday, shortly before another tremor struck the Banda Sea
near East Timor, seismologists in Hong Kong and Australia said.
</P>
<P>
   The first tremor, with a magnitude estimated at 6.4, struck near
the Fly River, about 190 miles west of the capital Port Moresby,
said Mark Leonard, a spokesman for the Australian Geological Survey
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate reports of damages or casualties, he
said, or evidence that there had been a tsunami -- an earthquake
generated wave.
</P>
<P>
   The area was not heavily built up and the small, wooden
buildings common in the region are very resilient in earthquakes,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   A separate quake with an estimated magnitude of 6.4 hit the
Banda Sea, west of Papua New Guinea and north of Western Australia,
the Hong Kong Observatory said.
</P>
<P>
   It was centered beneath the sea about 230 miles east-northeast
of Dili, East Timor, the observatory said. There were no reports of
damage or casualties.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1998, a series of tsunamis killed an estimated 2,000
people in northern Papua New Guinea's Sepik Province.
</P>
<P>
   An earthquake with a magnitude of more than 6.0 can cause
considerable damage when centered under heavily populated areas.

<P>
   BRISTOL, Conn. (AP) -- ESPN plans a $500 million expansion of its
world headquarters that could mean up to 1,000 new jobs in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've grown quite a bit and we'd like to add a lot more in
coming years,'' ESPN spokesman Mike Soltys told The Associated
Press on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Plans include seven new buildings, including a digital broadcast
center that could open in a year, Soltys said.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN first went on the air in 1979, when it was known as the
Entertainment and Sports Programming Network and had 1.4 million
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   It is now a subsidiary of the Walt Disney Co. with more 76.2
million subscribers and includes four cable channels -- ESPN, ESPN2,
ESPNEWS and ESPN Classic -- as well as a radio network with 630
affiliates. The company employs 2,100 people and is Bristol's
largest taxpayer.

<HEADLINE> Trail Blazers 101, Grizzlies 91  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Steve Smith scored 19 points as the
Portland Trail Blazers held off a late run to beat the Vancouver
Grizzlies 101-91 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rasheed Wallace and Bonzi Wells each added 16 points for
Portland, which had its 11-game winning streak snapped Tuesday
night by the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bibby led Vancouver with 25 points and 14 assists, and
Shareef Abdur-Rahim had 21 points and nine rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Since losing the league's best record to the Lakers, Portland
had two days off to prepare for the last-place Grizzlies, but
didn't put them away until the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   After Othella Harrington missed a dunk, Smith grabbed the
rebound and found Scottie Pippen downcourt for an easy layup to put
the Blazers up 94-86 with 1:20 left.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen was then fouled on the baseline, and after hitting his
first free throw, Smith grabbed the rebound on the second and
tipped it in to give Portland a 97-88 lead with 43.4 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers, who committed eight turnovers in the first half and
made just seven of 18 shots in the second quarter, jumped all over
the Grizzlies in the third. Smith scored nine points in the first
five minutes as the Blazers went on a 16-4 run to take a 68-49 lead
with 7:04 left.
</P>
<P>
   But Portland's execution again fell off, and the Grizzlies took
advantage. Bibby used his teammates to cut into the lead, dishing
out six assists in the quarter as Vancouver cut it to 75-66.
</P>
<P>
   The Grizzlies stayed close in the first half because of Bibby's
shooting. He made seven of nine shots and scored 20 points in the
first two quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Portland played tough defense in the opening quarter and went
ahead 35-25 on Rasheed Wallace's dunk with 9.6 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   But the Grizzlies took advantage of the Blazers' sloppy play,
hitting mid-range jumpers and wide-open 3-pointers while the
Blazers missed alley-oop attempts and long 3s. Vancouver survived a
three minute scoring drought and cut the lead to 45-42.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Vancouver coach Lionel Hollins made his first appearance in
Portland since replacing Brian Hill. Hollins played for the Blazers
from 1975 to 1980. ... Starting point guard Damon Stoudamire and
reserve forward Brian Grant did not play for Portland. Grant, who
is nursing a sore foot, suited up, but Stoudamire did not while
resting his sore left knee, which he bumped against the Lakers. ...
The loss ended a tough three-game road trip for the Grizzlies, who
beat Sacramento last week before facing the Lakers and the Blazers.

Bob Jones Univ. Drops Race Date Ban
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Bob Jones University will drop its ban on interracial
dating, Bob Jones III said on CNN's ''Larry King Live'' Friday night. ''As of
today, right now, we're dropping it,'' Jones III said. Criticism followed after
Republican Presidential Candidate George W. Bush visited the school last month.
The ban on interracial dating was just one criticism Bush faced after his visit
to the Greenville school. Bush apologized earlier this week for failing to
criticize the anti-Catholic views of the university when he visited last month.
During his appearance there, the Texas governor told his audience that he shared
their values.

Haiti Postpones Elections

<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Dogged by organizational problems that left
more than 1 million voters unregistered, Haiti on Friday postponed March 19
elections, without specifying a new date. The announcement came only hours after
the U.N. Security Council urged Haiti to stick ''as closely as possible'' to its
schedule for elections, which it said were crucial to the Caribbean nation's
fledgling democracy. ''A new electoral timetable for the balloting will be
published as soon as possible,'' said electoral council spokesman Roland
Sainristil. He cited ''innumerable difficulties surrounding voter
registration.''

Floodwaters Drop, Freeing Thousands

<P>
   CHIBUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- The water level in the flooded Limpopo River
valley dropped unexpectedly Friday, freeing thousands of people who were
marooned for days in trees and on rooftops during Mozambique's worst flooding on
record. Rescuers have saved more than 12,000 people from the floodwaters. But
tragedy struck the rescue effort when a boat capsized, drowning four children.
And in refugee camps, many people went hungry for yet another day. Officials
expect the floods' death toll to run into the thousands, and the collection of
corpses has been hampered by a shortage of body bags.

   FLINT, Mich. (AP) -- At a memorial service Friday night, some 1,000 mourners
grieved for Kayla Rolland, the 6-year-old girl who was shot to death in her
elementary school, allegedly by a 6-year-old classmate. Kayla, in a red dress,
lay in an open casket, a small doll of the TV character Barney beneath it. In
her hands was a small card with a poem titled ''I'm free.'' The boy who shot
Kayla has told police that it was an accident and that he meant only to scare
her. The two are believed to have scuffled on the playground the day before. No
charges are expected against the boy.

Chile Gives Pinochet a Hero's Welcome
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Gen. Augusto Pinochet, 84, returned home a free man
and was greeted by thousands of cheering supporters after 16 months of detention
in Britain. Opponents, however, vowed to prosecute him at home for the abuses of
his 17-year regime. An official government report says 3,197 people died or
disappeared at the hands of Pinochet's secret police after he toppled the
elected Marxist president in a 1973 coup. Pinochet was arrested in London on
Oct. 16, 1998, on a warrant issued by a Spanish judge. Britain considered
extraditing him to Spain and then set him free, saying he was too ill for trial.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration accused a University of

Dr. James M. Wilson of the University of Pennsylvania ''violated regulations
governing the proper conduct of clinical studies'' in a series of gene therapy
experiments designed to correct a liver disease. Wilson headed a gene therapy
experimental study that was halted after the death of 18-year-old Jesse
Gelsinger of Tucson, Ariz. The teen-ager is the first patient known to have died

<HEADLINE> Jury ends week without verdict in Louima trial  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- After more than 20 hours of deliberations over
three days, the jury in the trial of three officers accused of a
cover-up in the torture of Abner Louima has not reached a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Eugene Nickerson sent weary looking
jurors home for the weekend Friday after they spent the day
focusing on statements prosecutors say the defendants tailored to
fit their conspiracy. They were to return to Brooklyn federal court
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In notes to Nickerson, jurors asked to be read testimony by
James Burns, a former investigator who interviewed defendant Thomas
Wiese shortly after the Aug. 9, 1997 attack. They also requested a
statement made to the FBI by defendant Thomas Bruder.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors allege that Wiese, 36, Bruder, 33, and Charles
Schwarz, 34, conspired to clear Schwarz by lying to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz was convicted in another trial last year of violating
Louima's civil rights by leading him into the bathroom of the 70th
Precinct station and holding him down while another officer, Justin
Volpe, sodomized the handcuffed Haitian immigrant with a broken
broom handle in a fit of rage. Schwarz faces a possible life
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   At the current trial, Burns described an interview in which
Wiese identified himself as the second officer in the bathroom, but
denied participating in the assault. Wiese said he never saw
Schwarz anywhere but at the precinct house's front desk.
</P>
<P>
   Bruder told the FBI that he saw Volpe lead Louima to the
bathroom, trailed by Wiese -- not Schwarz. That contradicted an
earlier statement in which he said that Volpe was the sole escort.
</P>
<P>
   Louima has testified at both trials that two officers attacked
him. He positively identified one of his assailants as Volpe, and
the other as ''the driver'' of the patrol car that took him to the
station; records show the driver was Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have relied on records showing Schwarz, Bruder and
Wiese made a flurry of phone calls to each other as investigators
zeroed in. The pattern and timing of the calls proved the officers
were trying to ''get their stories straight'' that Schwarz was
never in the bathroom, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has tried to convince the jury the story was true --
and that there could be no cover-up if Schwarz committed no crime.
Schwarz himself testified last week that during Volpe's attack, he
was outside inspecting his patrol car.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe, who pleaded guilty to the attack and is serving 30 years
in prison, also emerged as a key defense witness. He testified that
Wiese was the second officer, but did not participate in the actual
assault.
</P>
<P>
   As deliberations drew to a close Friday, police union officials
and defense attorneys said they were convinced there was a verdict.
But the rumors were false: Nickerson called the jurors into the
courtroom and sent them home for the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''The one thing you know is that the 12 jurors are taking their
responsibility very seriously,'' defense attorney Joseph Tacopina
said outside court.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the protests sparked by the acquittal of four
officers in the shooting of Amadou Diallo, Patrick Lynch, president
of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said he was worried that
the length of deliberations meant ''the anti-police atmosphere that
is on the street may have seeped into this courtroom.''
</P>
<P>
   The defendants face terms of up to five years if convicted on
obstruction of justice charges.

<HEADLINE> Lakers 107, Pacers 92  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Shaquille O'Neal had 31 points and 15
rebounds Friday night as the Los Angeles Lakers didn't let Indiana
snap their long winning streak again, beating the Pacers 107-92 for
their 14th straight win.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, whose 16-game winning streak was ended in Indiana in
January, jumped out to a 30-16 advantage at the end of the first
quarter, and the Pacers got no closer than nine the rest of the
way.
</P>
<P>
   When Indiana threatened, moving within 82-73 early in the fourth
period, O'Neal took charge, scoring Los Angeles' first nine points
of the quarter to help them pull away again.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant added 22 points and had seven assists for Los
Angeles, and reserve Robert Horry added 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Miller didn't get his first basket until 3:05 before
halftime, but finished with 22 points for the Pacers. Austin
Croshere added 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers won the matchup of the team with the best record in
the Western Conference against the team with the top mark in the
East. Los Angeles improved to 21-2 against Eastern teams.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana, which has been a power at home this season but a
pushover on the road, has the Eastern Conference's best record,
39-19. Los Angeles is a league-best 48-11.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers draw another visitor from the other coast on Sunday,
when they try to extend their streak to 15 straight in a matchup
against Miami, which has the second-best record in the East.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana was coming off its worst defeat in nearly two years, a
118-87 drubbing Thursday in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers halted the Lakers' 16-game run, the league's longest
so far this season, with a 111-102 victory at Indianapolis on Jan.
14.
</P>
<P>
   After leading taking a 14-point lead into the second quarter,
the Lakers extended it to 21 on Horry's jumper that made it 50-29
with 3:21 before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal had 16 points and 10 rebounds by halftime, when Los
Angeles led 56-39.
</P>
<P>
   He powered the Lakers to their early lead, scoring seven points
during a 12-2 run over 2:22 span late in the opening period, as the
Lakers opened a 28-12 lead.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal and Bryant outscored the entire Indiana team in the
opening quarter, with O'Neal getting 11 and Bryant 8 and the Pacers
scoring only 16.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Pacers fell to 13-17 on the road. They're a drastically
different team at home, where they are 26-2. The Lakers have been
far more consistent, going 21-7 on the road, 27-4 at home. ... The
Lakers began their losing streak after their worst loss of the
season, 105-81 at San Antonio. Los Angeles came back the next game
to beat Utah 113-67, the fewest points ever scored by a Lakers'
opponent and Los Angeles' most lopsided win since a 47-point romp
over Miami in 1988.

<HEADLINE> Gen. Pinochet Arrives in Chile  </HEADLINE>
By BILL CORMIER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Former dictator Augusto Pinochet returned
home to sleep in his own bed for the first time in 503 days,
cheered by thousands of supporters after narrowly avoiding
prosecution abroad for alleged human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   But his homecoming from Britain stirred new calls by Pinochet's
opponents for him to be put on trial at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''Justice! Justice!'' about 200 opponents of his 1973-90 rule
chanted during a Friday night vigil outside the government palace.
</P>
<P>
   Many held up photographs of loved ones who were among more than
3,000 people who died or disappeared at hands of Pinochet's secret
police after he toppled elected Marxist President Salvador Allende.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet, arriving Friday morning after a 24-hour trip from
London aboard a Chilean air force plane, was lowered to the tarmac
in a wheelchair on an improvised elevator.
</P>
<P>
   He smiled to family and friends, appearing to make scant use of
a metal cane held in one hand. Hours after he checked into a
military hospital for medical tests, he was whisked by armored car
to his Santiago home, heavily guarded by rifle-toting troops in
camouflage.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's return also brings home to Chile the question of
whether to put him on trial. For 16 months Britain detained him
while it considered a request to extradite him to Spain to face
charges, but then set him free, saying he was too ill for trial.
</P>
<P>
   In Chile, where the population is sharply divided over his
17-year-rule, supporters gave him a welcome that clearly
demonstrated the backing he enjoys from the armed forces,
right-wing politicians and prominent businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   ''Augusto Pinochet rescued our country!'' exclaimed Ana Maria
Aguirre, 51, waving a large poster of Pinochet as he left the
military hospital.
</P>
<P>
   She said Chile had been slipping into chaos under Allende before
Pinochet and his fellow officers stepped in with their bloody coup.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pinochet! Pinochet! Gracias!'' many in the crowd shouted, as
they were held back by police around the gates of the hospital.
Many wore headbands inscribed with Pinochet's name, or waved red,
white and blue Chilean flags.
</P>
<P>
   Marco Figueroa, a 22-year-old student, said he was overjoyed.
''I am just so happy, I can't believe we have him back.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that Pinochet appeared more robust than expected
because he was back at last on Chilean soil. ''He is hardy, he is a
soldier and he found strength upon returning home,'' Figueroa said.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet left the hospital about nine hours later amid extremely
tight security. Troops swiftly shut the doors of his white-walled
compound behind his car when he reached home.
</P>
<P>
   Across the city, dozens of human rights activists and relatives
of dissidents who disappeared during Pinochet's regime held a vigil
in front of the presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
   One demonstrator, Javier Aguilo, called Pinochet's return ''a
shame for our country.'' Other groups protested the government's
role in gaining Pinochet's release.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet was arrested in London on Oct. 16, 1998, on a warrant
issued by a Spanish judge.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Home Secretary Jack Straw ordered Pinochet released
Thursday, saying an independent medical examination had found the
former dictator physically and mentally unfit for trial.
</P>
<P>
   The human rights groups maintained that he looks healthy and
called his illness a ruse to avoid being extradited.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pinochet is not as sick as they say. And it has been proved
today with the kind of reception they organized for him,'' said
Viviana Diaz, head of an organization of relatives of people who
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Straw's final report on Pinochet said doctors found it unlikely
the general could fake mental incapacitation, and Chile's interior
minister dismissed claims of fakery.
</P>
<P>
   Now opponents are focusing on a trial in Chile, something that
many say is no longer the impossibility it once was considered.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet's opponents have moved to have him stripped of the
immunity he enjoys as a senator for life. Judge Juan Guzman, who is
investigating about 60 cases against Pinochet, has forwarded the
petition to an appeals court for a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Leftist groups, chanting ''Pinochet, assassin,'' marched to the
Court of Appeals to express support for Guzman, who has ordered new
medical tests for Pinochet to help determine whether he can be
tried in Chile.

<HEADLINE> Old South, Civil Rights Cross Paths  </HEADLINE>
By JAY REEVES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- The Civil War collides with the civil
rights movement in Alabama this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   A group that wants the South to once again split from the United
States will hold a rally today at the Capitol amid waving
Confederate flags, a day before President Clinton visits Selma to
commemorate a landmark civil rights event.
</P>
<P>
   As much as ever, the regionalism and rebellion symbolized by the
Confederate battle flag will be juxtaposed against the dogged
determination expressed in the old civil rights song ''We Shall
Overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the two sides may feed off each other.
</P>
<P>
   ''Extremists on one end of the political spectrum sort of need
extremists on the other end,'' said Jess Brown, a historian at
Athens State University.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP and other black groups contend the flag is a racist
symbol of oppression and slavery. Supporters say it honors their
Southern heritage.
</P>
<P>
   For today's rally at the Statehouse, bagpipers will join Civil
War re-enactors dressed in woolly gray uniforms to parade up
historic Dexter Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The rally was organized by the Tuscaloosa-based League of the
South. The group, which claims as many as 10,000 members, will
issue a ''Declaration of Southern Cultural Independence'' as part
of its call for the South to become a separate nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're doing here is stating that we don't like the modern
culture that is being forced upon us. We are declaring war on
that,'' said John Cripps, a rally organizer and League chairman in
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers say at least 20 of the League's 27 state chapters
will be represented to the Alabama Capitol, where Jefferson Davis
took the oath as president of the Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's important that we get out the truth about what
the war for Southern independence was about,'' said Mac Watters of
Panama City, Fla. ''The war was about states' rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, on Sunday, Clinton will lead marchers across Selma's
Edmund Pettus Bridge to mark the 35th anniversary of ''Bloody
Sunday,'' when state troopers and sheriff's officers used clubs and
tear gas to turn back voting rights demonstrators trying to march
to Montgomery, 54 miles to the east.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, under the protection of a federal court, the
Rev. Martin Luther King led hundreds of people on the long walk to
the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Images of the ugly violence of Bloody Sunday and the eventual
Selma-to-Montgomery march aroused the nation and helped spur
passage of the Voting Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
   Showing how much things have changed in 35 years, longtime Selma
Mayor Joe Smitherman -- a former segregationist -- is distancing
himself from the Confederates and embracing Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
   Smitherman has never participated in a ''Bloody Sunday''
commemorative walk across the bridge, but said he wouldn't mind
joining the president during the crossing Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever they want me to do I'll participate in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is the first president to come to Selma for the
commemoration, organized in part by the National Voting Rights
Museum, which he will tour.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is important enough for the most powerful person in the
world to come,'' said Democratic state Sen. Hank Sanders, of Selma.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat who suffered a
fractured skull during the Bloody Sunday fracas on March 7, 1965,
will lead a delegation of at least 16 members of Congress attending
the event.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' group, including clergy and other civil rights figures,
planned tours of civil rights sites in Montgomery and Birmingham
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The League of the South, meanwhile, encouraged members and
supporters to attend the Capitol rally in opposition to the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
</P>
<P>
   The civil rights group and other activists have organized a
tourism boycott against South Carolina until the state removes the
flag from atop the Statehouse dome. South Carolina is the only
state that still flies the flag.

<HEADLINE> Campaign 2000 Notes and Quotes  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- If John Rocker can get a
vice
presidential pardon after atoning for bigoted remarks, why not
George W. Bush for his visit to Bob Jones University?
<TEXT>
<P>
   A reporter for Atlanta's WSB-TV put the question to Al Gore, who
has spoken forgivingly of Rocker, the Atlanta Braves relief
pitcher, for seeking counseling and atonement after he was
suspended for making bigoted comments. Gore has condemned his
Republican rival, Bush, for launching his Southern campaign at the
racially segregated Bob Jones University, a center of anti-Catholic
fundamentalism.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bill! Bill! How long did you work on that question?'' Gore
said to the reporter, who was conducting the interview via
satellite as Gore campaigned in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing a distinction between ''a young person who made a
mistake'' (Rocker is 25; Bush, 54) and ''somebody in Gov. Bush's
position,'' Gore said both can learn from their errors and overcome
them.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I think that someone aspiring to national leadership has
to meet a somewhat higher standard.''
</P>
<P>
   BY THE NUMBERS:

</P>
<P>
   VOTER'S VOICE
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm actually a Republican. I came out for the hot dogs and the
excitement. Being from New Jersey, I do like Bill Bradley ... He's
such a more dynamic figure than Al Gore is. I don't know -- maybe
that doesn't translate to the Midwest as well as it does here in
the Northeast.'' -- Luke Littleton, of Franklin, N.J. who nabbed a
free hot dog from Bill Bradley during a campaign appearance
Thursday at Gray's Papaya hot dog stand in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   THIS DATE FOUR YEARS AGO
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Alexander emerged from an Atlanta church service saying he
was pressing on with his campaign for the GOP nomination, despite
House Speaker Newt Gingrich's suggestion that he should consider
bowing out. ''This is just the first inning in the campaign. I'll
swing a little harder and have a better second inning.'' He quit
the race three days later.
</P>
<P>
   FRIDAY'S ROUNDUP:
</P>
<P>
   John McCain charged that Bush supporters were waging a shadowy
effort to ''hijack'' the race by spending $2 million on a TV ad
criticizing his environmental record. McCain also criticized as
misleading a Bush ad that suggests McCain opposes federal funding
for breast cancer research. Bush headed to a breast cancer research
center in New York to emphasize his criticism of McCain for listing
some breast cancer projects as pork-barrel spending. The ad
features a breast cancer survivor saying America deserves ''a
candidate with a record on women's issues we can trust.''
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, Gore ripped Bush for saying during a debate he had
''no problem with trigger locks being sold.'' ''Is that what passes
for courage on the Republican side of this contest?'' asked Gore,
who, like Bradley, wants to make child-safety locks mandatory on
all handguns. Bradley, in Maine, called the race ''a choice between
the politics of division, of exaggerated and unfulfilled promises,
and a politics based upon belief, conviction and straight talk.''
</P>
<P>
   WEEKEND'S TRAIL:
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaigns in New York today before flying to Austin for the
night. On Sunday he will appear on a morning talk show before
flying to California. McCain campaigns in New England and New York
as well, and flies to California on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley campaigns in New York and Missouri today, and flies east
to campaign in Maryland Sunday. Gore campaigns today in Boston and
New York.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker: Census Critic Deceptive  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A fund-raising letter from a critic of the
Census Bureau looks so much like an official agency document that
the public could mistake it for a real census form now being sent
to households, says a lawmaker who wants the group to put its
mailing on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., ranking member of the House
Government Reform Committee census panel, asked the Postal Service
to look into the mailing from the Southeastern Legal Foundation,
claiming it violated federal postal regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The words ''IMPORTANT 2000 CENSUS MATERIALS ENCLOSED'' and ''BUY
U.S. SAVINGS BONDS'' appear in bold letters above the address label
on the group's mailing.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, the Atlanta-based nonprofit foundation asks recipients
to sign a petition requesting the Census Bureau not to use a
statistical method known as sampling when compiling data from the
upcoming count. It also asks for a donation.
</P>
<P>
   ''This kind of behavior crosses the line. When people see that
this solicitation is a shameless fake, I know that they will throw
it out,'' said Maloney, who supports sampling. ''But I am afraid
that when the real mailing comes they might throw it out as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The mailings have been sent to 250,000 households since January.
The foundation's executive director said they don't resemble Census
Bureau forms.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't conceive of why it's considered deceptive,'' said
Matthew Glavin. ''There is no similarity at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Census questionnaires come in envelopes that have the bureau's
''Census 2000'' logo and a Department of Commerce return address.
Delivery to rural homes began Friday, and by the end of the month
most of the country's 115 million households should have one.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. postal inspector Daniel Mihalko said he had yet to see the
foundation's mailing, and that the Postal Service had not received
any consumer complaints about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Census Bureau has had experience over the last several
decades with mailings that are official-looking, and our priority
is to make sure that the American public is educated about what
actual census forms envelopes look like,'' Census Bureau spokesman
Steve Jost said.
</P>
<P>
   The Southeastern Legal Foundation was a plaintiff in a case last
year in which the Supreme Court ruled that the federal government
must use non-sampled, or raw, Census 2000 data to reapportion
Congressional seats. States must decide which data set to use for
redistricting.
</P>
<P>
   Glavin suggested Maloney's attack might be revenge for his
refusal to co-sign a letter with her urging Texas Gov. George W.
Bush, a Republican, to reveal whether he would allow the Census
Bureau to release sampled numbers should Bush become president.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials estimate they undercounted the population by
about 4 million in 1990, mostly minorities and inner-city residents
who tend to vote Democrat, and that sampling improves accuracy. The
GOP fears sampled data could redraw political lines to their
disadvantage.

<HEADLINE> More Rain Looms in Mozambique  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- Just as floodwaters began to recede
and more rescue boats arrived in battered and flood-swollen
Mozambique, a new threat loomed: more rain.
</P>
<P>
   A storm hovering over the Indian Ocean threatened to hit this
impoverished southeastern African country today as thousands of
people who had been stranded in treetops for a week finally made
their way to dry ground.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the dramatic drop in flood levels in at least one
area, which came unexpectedly Friday, rescue workers estimated up
to 15,000 people remained trapped in the central Save River valley.
They also warned of the possibility of outbreaks of disease.
</P>
<P>
   More help was on the way. The first of two British planes
carrying rescue boats arrived in the capital of Maputo on Friday.
An American plane with rescue boats from Florida was expected
today, a day later than previously announced.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll was expected to run into the thousands. So far,
collecting the corpses has been hampered by a shortage of body
bags.
</P>
<P>
   Officials estimate that 1 million people need food, medicine and
other aid throughout Mozambique. Getting it to them is a logistical
nightmare, with many areas still accessible only by air.
</P>
<P>
   Aid officials said people stranded in trees were being driven by
hunger and thirst to eat the carcasses of drowned animals and drink
filthy floodwater, putting them at risk for disease.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Col. Jaco Klopper, commander of the South African Air
Force's rescue operation, said late Friday that rescue workers
believe most people caught by the Limpopo flood in southern Gaza
province have been moved to safety. Planes would go out today ''to
comb the area to make sure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected drop in floodwaters Friday was accompanied by a
blow to rescue efforts when an inflatable boat carrying 17 refugees
capsized along the Limpopo. Four toddlers fell into the swift
current and drowned, said the boat's South African pilot, Peter
Britz.
</P>
<P>
   The engine had cut out after hitting some debris, and the boat
drifted into a tree and flipped over. Britz clambered up a tree
along with the other survivors and got a taste of what thousands of
people have endured since huge swaths of central and southern
Mozambique were flooded by torrential rains last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are snakes in the trees, stinging ants, wasps and lots
of mosquitos,'' Britz said after rescuers ferried him and the 13
others to safety hours later.
</P>
<P>
   ''These people have been sitting in the trees all these days
with these things crawling on them and biting them,'' Britz said.
''I didn't realize what they were going through until I got stuck
in a tree.''
</P>
<P>
   Six hundred American troops expected to arrive in Mozambique
soon were likely to be based in the central city of Beira,
Mozambican officials said. U.S. Embassy officials declined to say
where the troops being sent from Europe along with helicopters and
other rescue gear would be based or when they would arrive.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Settles Discrimination Suit  </HEADLINE>
By DEB RIECHMANN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the second time in nine months, Amtrak has
settled a racial discrimination suit, the latest alleging the
national railway condoned hostile work conditions for blacks that
created a ''segregated work force.''
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak did not admit any wrongdoing in the settlement announced
on Friday, but the railway agreed to change company policies. And
the settlement, which must be approved by a federal judge, sets up
a $16 million fund to provide economic relief to 800 to 1,000 black
employees who suffered discrimination since 1995 and as many as
4,000 black job applicants Amtrak turned away.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed by 13 black members of the Brotherhood of
Maintenance of Way Employees who build and maintain railroad tracks
for Amtrak's engineering department in the Northeast corridor
between Washington and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a clear situation where a rising tide will float all
boats,'' Jed Dodd, an official with the union, said in praising the
agreement. ''All working whites and blacks are going to benefit
from the injunctive provisions.''
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak President George Warrington said settling out-of-court
was the right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ''Amtrak is committed to a cultural change at the company that
will not only make Amtrak a better place in which to work, but also
will enable us to be more responsive to the diverse marketplace we
serve,'' he said. ''We have already taken a number of important
steps in transforming the company's culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak has agreed to change policies affecting hiring,
certification, discipline, training and advancement and computerize
personnel files and applications, said Maia Caplan, a Washington
attorney for employees who filed the federal class action suit in
April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot that Amtrak has agreed to here that would not
have happened if this had gone into litigation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleged that white managers separated employees into
white and black work crews, and then gave white workers better
assignments and kept them from being bumped by black employees with
more seniority. They claimed white work crews were told in advance
about drug tests and that white employees suspected of possibly
failing the tests were encouraged to take the day off.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs said white supervisors called black employees
''boys'' and made comments like ''you people like watermelon'' and
''all you people lie.'' When a black employee's beeper sounded
during a meeting, one white manager remarked that ''someone's drug
deal is going down,'' the suit said.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs also complained in the suit that management did
not promptly remove a racial epithet scrawled on company property
and that a white manager once told a black worker that white
members of a track-laying crew were in the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   ''The result has been a substantially segregated work force,''
the suit said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement settles the first of three discrimination suits
filed against Amtrak in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1999, Amtrak settled a suit filed by black managers and
employees seeking management positions. The railway agreed to
change company policies and set up an $8 million fund to compensate
those who sued. The remaining suit, which has not been resolved,
was filed in November 1999 by 24 current and former workers who
allege that Amtrak's Intercity Strategic Business Unit, which
operates in 29 states, discriminates against black workers.

<HEADLINE> PM-NY--NY Senate-Clinton, Bjt,580  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton is inching forward in her
comments about the Amadou Diallo killing, saying she supports a
federal investigation into the unarmed immigrant's death at the
hands of police but cannot comment on whether a civil rights
prosecution is merited.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Justice Department should look into it and should make a
decision as to whether or not it will proceed,'' she told reporters
Friday. ''And that's up to the Justice Department to decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had previously declined to say whether she thought
federal investigators should look into the Diallo case. The four
officers who shot at Diallo 41 times were acquitted by an Albany
jury last week, angering many New Yorkers and prompting calls for a
federal civil rights prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady spoke cautiously Friday, and did not say whether
she thought the officers should be prosecuted again.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a decision that is going to be made by the people who
should be making it,'' she said, explaining that Justice Department
lawyers would look carefully at the facts of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder met in Washington, D.C.,
Thursday with Diallo's parents and other supporters, who pressed
the Justice Department to take on the case. Holder made no
guarantee that charges would be sought and said in a statement that
''the standard to proceed in federal court is high.''
</P>
<P>
   The first lady spoke after meeting in midtown Manhattan with
leaders of the gun control group PAX, founded by Daniel Gross,
whose brother Matthew was badly injured in a 1997 shooting atop the
Empire State Building.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's focus on guns came in the wake of a 6-year-old
Michigan girl's death Tuesday at the hands of a 6-year-old
classmate. The tragedy has brought new attention to the gun control
debate, and President Clinton sought to rally support this week for
legislation requiring gun safety locks and gun show background
checks.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton said she plans to participate in a Million Mom
March planned for Washington, D.C., on Mother's Day to urge tougher
gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would invite thousands and thousands of New Yorkers to join
this march calling on Congress to make the tough decisions to
protect our children,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether New York has a problem with police brutality -- a
heated issue in recent days -- she replied, ''New York City
obviously has a problem when an innocent unarmed man is gunned
down. ... We need to take steps to make sure that never happens
again.''
</P>
<P>
   She did not specify what should be done, but called for greater
understanding between residents and police and indicated she would
talk more about the issue in a speech at Riverside Church on
Sunday. Many black and Hispanic New Yorkers have accused the police
of racial profiling and said officers are too ready to use violence
against minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very convinced that we can continue to decrease the crime
rate and increase the trust rate in New York,'' she said. ''There
is a lot that we could do with the right kind of leadership, that
brings people together and reaches out to try to understand what
it's like to be on the other side. ... I hope that our efforts can
help to ... bring those who are committed to protecting us together
with people who need protection and also deserve respect.''

<HEADLINE> NATO Peacekeepers Push Ahead  </HEADLINE>
By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO-led peacekeepers have
pledged to push ahead with resettling ethnic Albanians on the north
side of this divided town, despite violent protests by Serbs and
concern from human rights workers.
</P>
<P>
   French troops fired tear gas and stun grenades Friday to break
through a crowd of angry Serbs blocking an apartment complex.
Ethnic Albanians were trying to return to the apartments after
being forced out in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In a second attempt, Danish armored personnel carriers carrying
41 ethnic Albanians lumbered across the Ibar River, which divides
the two communities, pushing through the crowd to reach the
buildings. The Serbs rushed at French troops, who fired more tear
gas and stun grenades to break a path.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Ghedini, a spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees in Pristina, Kosovo's capital, criticized the latest
attempt at repatriation and said the situation was too tense.
</P>
<P>
   ''The events of today -- the fact that they had to be moved with
armored personnel carriers -- that there was barbed wire and tear
gas -- does not indicate the conditions for safe return,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest effort to send home dozens of ethnic Albanian
families came after stone-throwing Serbs forced officials to abort
an earlier attempt to move the ethnic Albanians across a footbridge
linking the north and south banks of the river. Troops disassembled
the bridge earlier because of high water.
</P>
<P>
   Five French peacekeepers were injured in Friday's standoff,
according to French Gen. Pierre de Saqui de Sannes, the NATO
commander in charge of northern Kosovo. Nine Serbs were treated for
injuries, authorities at the local hospital said.
</P>
<P>
   De Saqui de Sannes defended the action as necessary to move the
peace effort forward.
</P>
<P>
   ''All initiatives create tension, but inaction would be worse,''
he said. ''Time is playing against peace here, if we do nothing, we
will head towards catastrophe.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that peacekeepers would provide around-the-clock
security inside and outside the apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovska Mitrovica, 20 miles northwest of Pristina, has been the
scene of repeated ethnic unrest in recent weeks, resulting in
several deaths and dozens of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The renewed violence has thwarted efforts by NATO and Kosovo's
U.N. administration to establish normality in the Serbian province,
eight months after NATO's 78-day bombing campaign forced an end to
the Serb crackdown in Kosovo and the pullout of Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic's forces.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of Serb frustrations in Kosovo, about 1,000 people
gathered in front of a Serbian Orthodox church in southeastern
Kosovo to protest the recent killing of a prominent Serb doctor
there, the state-run Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan warned Friday that the recent
violence in Kosovska Mitrovica could spread within Kosovo and spill
over into southern Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic unrest indicates that progress made since NATO forces
moved into Kosovo in June ''is not yet irreversible,'' Annan said
in a 46-page report to the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   NATO troops and Kosovo's U.N. administration consider the area
east of Kosovo's boundary with Serbia ''to be extremely volatile at
present,'' he said, adding that ''the situation there causes great
concern.''

<HEADLINE> $40B Aviation Spending Bill Close  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers will try again next week to find
common ground on a major aviation spending bill after at least one
key senator objected to a compromise that has been months in the
making.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would authorize $40 billion over three years for
safety, construction and operating programs of the Federal Aviation
Administration, and includes a raise in passenger taxes, more money
for small airports and more flights from several of the nation's
busiest airports.
</P>
<P>
   Federal funding for new airport projects has been held up by
Congress' failure to pass a bill by the beginning of the fiscal
year last Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The safety and modernization goals of the bill have wide
bipartisan support, but it has languished mainly because of a
dispute between House Transportation Committee Chairman Bud
Shuster, R-Pa., and some senators over the Aviation Trust Fund,
which collects some $10 billion a year in user fees.
</P>
<P>
   Shuster wanted to separate that fund from the general budget so
that its revenues could go only to aviation improvement. But
senators said that would undercut the authority of the budget and
appropriations committees that determine spending levels every
year.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., helped craft a
compromise under which the trust fund would stay in the general
budget but spending for aviation projects would at least equal the
revenues and interest from the trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, said the House, without consulting him,
added language that erected a new parliamentary hurdle to waiving
the trust fund provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said he was ''really pained'' and that eight or nine
senators would join him in opposing the compromise. ''It's
untenable for many of us that it was rewritten after an agreement
had been reached,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he had planned to bring the compromise to the Senate
floor Tuesday or Wednesday, but with Stevens' objections the bill
''could be in jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill also allows airports to increase their passenger taxes,
called Passenger Facility Charges, from the current ceiling of $3
per person to $4.50. If all airports imposed the increase, it could
bring in up to $700 million more a year for local construction and
modernization.
</P>
<P>
   Shuster had sought to double the cap to $6, but Senate
negotiators, led by Commerce Committee Chairman John McCain,
R-Ariz., were against any increase. McCain, a GOP presidential
contender, is against any tax increases, spokeswoman Pia Pialorsi
said.
</P>
<P>
   House officials said airports seeking to raise their passenger
fees must show that the increase would significantly help safety,
capacity, noise abatement or security and that they needed funding
above what they receive under the Airport Improvement Program.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would nearly double grants for airport modernization,
with the minimum entitlement for smaller airports going from
$500,000 to $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also would eliminate the ''high density rule''
established in 1969 to limit flights from New York's Kennedy and La
Guardia airports and Chicago's O'Hare, taking effect in 2007 in New
York and 2002 in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Slots -- one slot is a landing or takeoff -- at Washington's
Reagan National Airport would be increased by 24, with 12 of those
reserved for flights beyond the 1,250-mile ''perimeter rule'' in
place since 1986. McCain had pushed hard for this as part of an
effort to increase flights to smaller, less-competitive airports.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation amends the 1920 Death on the High Seas Act,
which bars families of those lost in air disasters -- such as the
1996 TWA 800 crash that killed 230 people just off Long Island,
N.Y. -- from collecting non-economic damages.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, the 1920 law would not apply to air crashes
within 12 nautical miles of the U.S. shoreline. It would be
retroactive to the day before the TWA crash.

<HEADLINE> Albright Doesn't Rule Out US Troops  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY SCHWEID, AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- American troops could be sent to Europe
to quell conflicts even after the creation of a new European
security force, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright says after
high-level meetings here.
</P>
<P>
   Any decision will be based on U.S. national interest, Albright
said Friday while welcoming plans to establish a rapid reaction
force of 50,000 to 60,000 European troops by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to reduce Europe's reliance on American diplomacy
and firepower to quell European conflicts. Albright was briefed at
a meeting with European Union officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we will always judge what is in our national interest
as to when we are part of a military action,'' Albright said at a
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in a speech aboard the USS Wasp, a helicopter carrier
making a stop here on its way to the Mediterranean for exercises,
Albright said ''we must create both a more capable Europe and a
stronger alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   She declined to say whether the European force, had it been in
existence, could have put down the ethnic violence in the Balkans
that led to a NATO attack with U.S. troops now serving as
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must never let the bonds between Europe and the America
erode,'' Albright said. ''These are the bonds that defeated Hitler
and defended freedom through decades of the Cold War.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Russia yielded to demands that it permit European human
rights experts into Chechnya to look for evidence that civilians
were mistreated as the Russian army crushed Chechen separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has jockeyed with the United States and its European
allies for months, and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov's offer was
received with considerable skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   But Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama, who holds the
rotating presidency of the European Union, welcomed the Russian
response. ''The facts point to change in the situation,'' Gama
said. ''A definitive solution has not been found, but things are
beginning to take off.''
</P>
<P>
   Denying all the while that the bloodied area was sealed off from
outside observers and the media as Russian troops hammered Grozny,
the capital, into submission, Ivanov said his government was taking
''significant steps'' to allay Western misgivings.

<P>
   He accused Western reporters who got into Chechnya of
disseminating ''false and twisted information'' and lectured a
French journalist that her newspaper printed unbalanced accounts of
the Russian offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Russia based its assault in the Caucasus on the twofold argument
that it had a right to stop Chechnya from seceding from Russia, and
the rebellion was fomented by terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov held to this argument Friday. He said the fight against
separatism, extremism and nationalism ''in all forms is our common
cause.''
</P>
<P>
   He agreed to the onsite surveys by experts including the Red
Cross' president at a joint session with senior American and
European officials. The meeting marked another step in coordinating
policy with Russia on such diverse topics as peacekeeping in the
Balkans and nuclear safety.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Van Crash Kills Seven  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIVERMORE, Calif. (AP) -- A speeding van crashed and burst into
flames Friday killing a woman and six children, believed to be
hers, the California Highway Patrol said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said firefighters arriving on the scene found a man
at the side of the road sobbing, ''I've lost my family.'' The man,
believed to be the children's father, suffered only a broken thumb.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears that they blew a tire crossed the double yellow
lines, hit a tree, crossed back over, possibly flipped over and
became fully engulfed in flames,'' said Sgt. Rich Luciano.
</P>
<P>
   The van apparently was speeding, but police do not know who was
driving, Luciano said.
</P>
<P>
   The accident happened about 7:30 p.m. just north of Interstate
580 in Livermore, about 45 miles east of San Francisco.

More Rain Looms in Mozambique
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- Just as floodwaters began to recede and more
rescue boats arrived in battered and flood-swollen Mozambique, a new threat
loomed: more rain. A storm hovering over the Indian Ocean threatened to hit this
impoverished southeastern African country Saturday as thousands of people who
had been stranded in treetops for a week finally made their way to dry ground.
But despite the dramatic drop in flood levels in at least one area, which came
unexpectedly Friday, rescue workers estimated up to 15,000 people remained
trapped in the central Save River valley. They also warned of the possibility of
outbreaks of disease.

   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Former dictator Augusto Pinochet returned home to
sleep in his own bed for the first time in 503 days, cheered by thousands of
supporters after narrowly avoiding prosecution abroad for alleged human rights
abuses. But his homecoming from Britain stirred new calls by Pinochet's
opponents for him to be put on trial at home. ''Justice! Justice!'' about 200
opponents of his 1973-90 rule chanted during a Friday night vigil outside the
government palace. Many held up photographs of loved ones who were among more
than 3,000 people who died or disappeared at hands of Pinochet's secret police
after he toppled elected Marxist President Salvador Allende.

Republican Presidential Candidate George W. Bush visited the school last month.
The ban on interracial dating was just one criticism Bush faced after his visit

criticize the anti-Catholic views of the university when he visited last month.
During his appearance there, the Texas governor told his audience that he shared

<HEADLINE> High school student rally against police tactics  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Three hundred high school students
skipped
classes Friday and marched over the Brooklyn Bridge to protest
police tactics.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ''I've been at high school over three years and this is the
first time I've had pride in my high school,'' said Raime
Masket-Roth, a 17-year-old Stuyvesant High School senior.
</P>
<P>
   He said the protesters, who held rallies in Brooklyn and in City
Hall Park, wanted to deliver a message to the city and Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani that the police department must change.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani was not in City Hall at the time.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago Friday, a jury in Albany found officers Kenneth Boss,
Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and Richard Murphy innocent of murder
in the Feb. 4, 1999, shooting of Diallo. The unarmed immigrant from
Guinea died in a 41-bullet barrage in the vestibule of his Bronx
apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, a plainclothes officer shot and killed
Malcolm Ferguson, an unarmed, paroled drug dealer, just three
blocks from Diallo's home. Ferguson had participated in a protest
of the Diallo verdict last week and was detained for resisting
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters who crossed the bridge from Manhattan on Friday
joined more than 100 other high school students waiting behind
police barricades in the street across from the state court
building in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The rally was held near the federal courthouse, where a jury was
deliberating the fate of three officers accused of a cover-up in
the August 1997 police-station torture of Abner Louima.
</P>
<P>
   The students, many of them wearing backpacks full of books,
chanted ''No Justice, No Peace,'' as several dozen relaxed police
officers stood on the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a wallet, not a gun,'' read one sign, which referred to
the claim by police that Diallo had pulled a wallet out of his
pocket which the officers thought was a gun.
</P>
<P>
   ''America's future won't stand for this,'' read another sign.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not every cop is a bad cop but police brutality has got to
stop,'' read still another, attracting the attention of Norman
Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   ''That sign was very balanced and I personally went over and
commended the young woman who made it,'' said Siegel, who crossed
the bridge with the students after they asked him to ensure the
protest was conducted legally. ''Young people show models of
leadership that we can follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Laila Roman, 17, a Beacon High School student, said police
brutality was on the minds of many young people. ''It's hard that
we have to fear the people that are out there to protect us,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another protester, Monica Rose, said it would be hard to change
the police department until officers are better paid and better
educated.
</P>
<P>
   As the rally continued for an hour with students reading poetry,
delivering brief speeches and singing, ''We Shall Overcome,'' three
girls made an early exit, sneaking away under a blue barricade.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know why I wasted my time coming down here,'' one of
them said loud enough for her friends and anyone else nearby to
hear. ''I gotta get my hair done.''
</P>
<P>
   As about 300 of her fellow students marched back across the
bridge to City Hall, they chanted ''41'' -- the number of shots
fired at Diallo -- before holding a ''teach-in'' at City Hall Park.

<HEADLINE> Tourists Visit Philippines Volcano  </HEADLINE>
By OLIVER TEVES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEGAZPI, Philippines (AP) -- While tens of thousands of Filipinos
displaced by eruptions of the Mayon volcano cope with life in
crammed evacuation centers, tourists are flocking here to watch it,
tourism officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Since the volcano began erupting Feb. 24, foreign tourists have
become a frequent sight in the city square and at the ruins of the
Cagsawa church, which was destroyed by an eruption in 1814.
</P>
<P>
   The 18 hotels and lodging houses in Legazpi, the nearest city,
are reporting a 55 percent occupancy rate, up from only 5 percent
before the eruptions, the regional Department of Tourism office
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, more than 66,000 villagers have been forced
from their homes by the eruptions, which have already destroyed
more than 16,000 acres of crops valued at about $4.1 million,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Ligao, the heavy ash fall killed fish in more than 250
acres of fish ponds by clogging their gills.
</P>
<P>
   Mayon remained relatively quiet for a third day Friday, but
scientists said seismographs showed magma is still rising in the
mountain, indicating a likelihood of future eruptions.
</P>
<P>
   The volcano, famous for its near-perfect conical shape, has
always been a modest tourist attraction. But arrivals have risen
sharply since it began erupting.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists have come to Albay province, about 215 miles southeast
of Manila, to watch in awe as Mayon spewed fountains of lava that
formed a flaming red and orange river down its slopes.
</P>
<P>
   The tourists are prohibited from climbing the 8,118-foot volcano
because of safety concerns, said Diosdado Raneses of the city's
tourism office.
</P>
<P>
   He said the city is not actively campaigning for tourists to
visit Mayon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can really feel the suffering of our people,'' he said. ''No
one is trying to ride on this. The priority is still the
evacuees.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice farmers had been almost ready to harvest their crops when
the eruptions came.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would have harvested in three weeks, but the ash now has
stunted the rice's growth,'' said Teodorico Residilla, a town
council member.
</P>
<P>
   Some farmers were cutting their rice early and feeding it to
animals.
</P>
<P>
   The volcanology institute warned that rains may trigger
avalanches of volcanic mud and debris left on Mayon's slopes.
</P>
<P>
   Cedric Daep, head of the provincial disaster management office,
said the number of evacuees could rise to 80,000 if avalanches
occur.

<HEADLINE> NC Trooper Claims Racial Profiling  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT MOONEYHAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- A black North Carolina state trooper who
says he was stopped randomly while off-duty and ordered out of his
car at gunpoint is suing two police officers and the city of
Jacksonville for alleged racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   In his lawsuit, nine-year patrol veteran Todd Williams says he
was stopped for ''fitting a racial profile, to wit: 'a black person
driving a luxury vehicle.'''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 30, said Friday that in June two white officers
ordered him out of his Lexus at gunpoint although he had promptly
obeyed an officer's request to pull over.
</P>
<P>
   He said he told the officers he was a state trooper and demanded
to know why he was stopped. The officers told him he was driving 65
mph in a 55 mph zone, he said. Williams denies he was speeding.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville Police Chief Ken Bumgarner said agents from the
State Bureau of Investigation viewed a video of the traffic stop
recorded from a camera in the accused officers' vehicle and found
no wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Although the lawsuit seeks damages exceeding $10,000 for
humiliation, emotional distress and loss of liberty, Williams said
he doesn't want money. Instead, he said he hopes his lawsuit makes
police in Jacksonville, 100 miles southeast of Raleigh, rethink how
they conduct traffic stops.
</P>
<P>
   He said he filed the lawsuit only after city officials refused
to do anything about his complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, North Carolina began requiring Williams and
other state law enforcement officers to record the race of every
motorist they stop. Connecticut also has the same requirement, and
at least 18 other states are considering it.
</P>
<P>
   Figures released this week by the North Carolina Highway Patrol
show that in the first month traffic stops were monitored, black
motorists were pulled over in numbers proportional to their
population. However, black and Hispanic motorists and passengers
were searched in disproportionate numbers.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon's Finances in Disarray  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN M. DONNELLY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. military's bean counters are under
fire from investigators who say their books are so messed up they
can't be audited.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon accountants last year made nearly $7 trillion in
adjustments to their financial ledgers to make them add up. They
could not show receipts for $2.3 trillion of those changes, and
half a trillion dollars of it was just corrections of mistakes made
in earlier adjustments, the Defense Department's inspector general
office reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Each adjustment represents an accountant's attempt to correct a
discrepancy. The military has hundreds of computer systems to run
accounts as diverse as health care, payroll and inventory. But they
are not integrated, don't produce numbers up to accounting
standards and fail to keep running totals of what's coming in and
what's going out, Pentagon and congressional officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''These ($6.9 trillion in) entries were processed to force
financial data to agree with various data sources, to correct
errors and to add new data,'' the report said. ''The magnitude of
accounting entries required to compile the DoD financial statements
highlights the significant problems DoD has producing accurate and
reliable financial statements with existing systems and
processes.''
</P>
<P>
   The department's ''internal controls were not adequate to ensure
that resources were properly managed and accounted for, that DoD
complied with applicable laws and regulations and that the
financial statements were free of material misstatements,'' it
added.
</P>
<P>
   ''One expects that the financial statements of an entity,
whether of an agency or a company, should reflect accurately what
the department or company has and fairly present the results of
their operations,'' said Jay Lane, chief of the inspector general's
finance and accounting directorate. ''We're saying we can't audit
that to tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   The military says it owns $119.3 billion in ships, trucks, jet
engines and more. But its inspector general said he could not
verify that because records lacked supporting documentation.
</P>
<P>
   Financial records are not in good enough shape to face an audit,
let alone pass one, the inspector general said.
</P>
<P>
   As jumbled as its books are, the Pentagon is not alone: Only 11
of 24 big federal agencies could produce reliable financial
statements for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, said Sen. Fred
Thompson, R-Tenn., chairman of the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Pentagon had much more not to account for than the
other 10 agencies. The military says it spent $275.5 billion in
fiscal 1999, said Lisa Jacobson, director of defense financial
audits at the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The inability to account for where the money went doesn't just
make the military less efficient, she and others said, but also
makes the armed forces less responsive to the will of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Without sound costing data, the Pentagon can't make good
decisions, they contend. For example, they say, the military can't
measure the results of closing a base; can't effectively decide
whether to contract out a service or keep it in government hands;
and may inaccurately peg the cost of programs under debate, from
missile defense to retirees' health care.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last year, the Defense Department corrected errors in its
bookkeeping that totaled $2.3 trillion -- more than the entire
federal budget,'' Thompson said in a statement, calling them
''changes made to plug holes for things they couldn't explain.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress is not assured that DoD is spending money in
accordance with its wishes,'' the GAO's Jacobson said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their criticisms, Jacobson and others say the Pentagon
is improving. Its comptroller, William Lynn, said in a statement
that the military's computer systems are good enough to make it
accountable to Congress. But he added: ''Unfortunately, they do not
do a good job of producing financial statements.''
</P>
<P>
   The first year agencies were required to say whether their books
could be audited was fiscal 1996. This is the fourth consecutive
year the Pentagon has answered no.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you spend money, you account for it -- that is required in
the federal government,'' Jacobson said. ''But DoD doesn't have
that. They just say, ... 'We had money, we spent it.'
</P>
<P>
   ''Then they try to go back later and say how they spent it and
try to pull the balance sheet together.''

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds EPA Pollution Ruling  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency is moving
ahead on a regulation requiring 19 states to take steps to reduce
the interstate drifting of pollution, especially from coal-burning
power plants.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of the U. S. Court of Appeals gave the go-ahead for the
new rule Friday, upholding a 1998 EPA regulation aimed at plants in
the Ohio Valley that the agency says send smog-causing chemicals
into the Northeast, aggravating air quality problems.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-1 decision was a major victory for the EPA and
air-pollution control officials in the Northeast, but a setback for
utilities.
</P>
<P>
   While upholding the EPA's smog directive in general, the court
said in the case of three additional states -- Missouri, Wisconsin
and Georgia -- the rule should be further reviewed by the courts.
EPA officials said that will not inhibit the agency action against
the 19 states, from Massachusetts to Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA issued the regulation in October 1998 in an attempt to
reduce the long-distance travel of smog-causing nitrogen oxide that
spews out of tall utility smokestacks that dot the Ohio Valley,
Midwest and parts of the South. But the rules were locked in limbo
last May because of a lawsuit and a temporary blocking order by the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   All 22 states were to have submitted plans for the pollution
reductions by last September, but those plans never materialized
because of the lawsuit. The new controls are to be required by 2003
for some plants and 2005 for others.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Missouri, Wisconsin and Georgia, the
appeals panel ruled that the EPA had acted properly. It said the
regulation ''reasonably establishes (pollution) reduction levels''
while leaving the question of how to accomplish those reductions to
the states.
</P>
<P>
   ''This decision means that we again can move forward to bring
cleaner, healthier air to more than 138 million people living in
the eastern half of the United States,'' EPA Administrator Carol
Browner said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed by eight states that have the dirtiest
coal-burning plants, and operators of many of these plants in the
Ohio Valley and Midwest. It challenged the way the EPA determined
the source of the air pollution and how it considered the cost of
pollution controls.
</P>
<P>
   The regulation targeted any state the EPA believed caused
pollution that drifted into another state, but the prime targets
were the Ohio Valley plants.
</P>
<P>
   The 19 states are Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois,
Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, North
Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   While Wisconsin, Missouri and Georgia also were listed by the
EPA, the court said in the case of those states the agency would
have to make a better case. It was not clear Friday whether the
agency will pursue the matter with the three states.
</P>
<P>
   Judges Stephen Williams and Judith Rogers voted to uphold the
EPA regulation. Judge David Sentelle dissented, arguing that the
EPA ''has exceeded its statutory authority'' and should be reminded
''its mission is not (to be) a roving commission to achieve pure
air.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists applauded the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ''This puts the agency on track to cut pollution from coal-fired
power plants in the eastern half of the United States by over a
million tons,'' said David Hawkins, an air quality specialist at
the Natural Resources Defense Council.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Stanfield, of U.S.PIRG, another environmental group,
called it a ''huge victory for public health'' because the
coal-fired plants will be required to install additional pollution
controls.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists and politicians in the Northeast have argued
for years that those plants, which are allowed under federal law to
comply with less-stringent air pollution standards, spew out
hundreds of thousands of tons of smog-causing chemicals that drift
into the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Grumet, executive director of the Northeast States for
Coordinated Air Use Management, said a study commission by his
group showed that 25 to 40 percent of the pollution from Ohio
Valley power plants drifts into the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Utilities in the Ohio Valley and Midwest have argued that such
claims are exaggerated and that the Northeast's inability to meet
federal air quality standards stems from urban automobile traffic
and industrial pollution, not chemicals from power plants hundreds
of miles away.

<HEADLINE> Investigators Find Racist Writings  </HEADLINE>
By TIM MOLLOY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILKINSBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Racist writings describing hatred toward
whites, Jews and Asians, were found in the apartment of a black man
accused in a shooting rampage that left three people dead in
suburban Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents released Friday said police found one paper
called ''The Satan List'' that contained the names of businesses
referred to as ''targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ronald Taylor, 39, was arraigned Friday on a third
count of criminal homicide after a third victim died.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Taylor -- who acknowledged to a judge that he has a
history of mental illness -- apparently became enraged over work
being done at his apartment and began screaming racial epithets at
repairmen.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said he shot one of the men, killing him, set the
apartment on fire and walked to two fast-food restaurants, where he
shot four others.
</P>
<P>
   All five victims were white. That, and the writings, led police
to charge Taylor with ''ethnic intimidation'' -- a hate crime. The
FBI is also investigating for possible civil rights violations.

<P>
   James Ecker, Taylor's lawyer, declined comment Friday except to
say that his client feels bad about the victims. Taylor said
nothing at Friday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The night after the shootings, police and federal agents scoured
Taylor's fire-damaged apartment, finding several handwritten notes.
The actual writings were not released, but police described them in
court papers.
</P>
<P>
   The writings called for ''Death to Jerusalem,'' referred to
''white trash,'' and listed ''various racist names and opinions''
about groups including whites, Jews, Asians, Italians, police, the
federal government and the news media, according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It should be noted that in this case, all of those that were
shot or threatened by the suspect were white males,'' investigators
said. ''During the arson/shooting spree, the suspect came upon many
blacks, especially in the areas in and around the restaurants.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Fulton, assistant superintendent of Allegheny County
police, said the fast-food restaurants -- a McDonald's and a Burger
King -- were not on the ''Satan List'' of targets.

<HEADLINE> Croat General Sentenced to 45 Years  </HEADLINE>
By SNJEZANA VUKIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- The 45-year prison sentence of a Bosnian
Croat general for atrocities committed by his soldiers could hamper
future cooperation between Croatia's new government and the U.N.
war crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   The court on Friday found Gen. Tihomir Blaskic guilty of
ordering an ''ethnic cleansing'' campaign against Muslim villages
in central Bosnia, which left hundreds dead and forced thousands
more to flee the area.
</P>
<P>
   Many members of Croatia's newly elected, pro-Western government
criticized the verdict as too harsh because Blaskic -- who commanded
a Bosnian Croat militia during the 1992-95 war -- did not personally
take part in the killings.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict is ''a really severe punishment which I believe will
have to be reviewed through the appeals procedure,'' said Premier
Ivica Racan.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling comes at a sensitive time in Croatia's cooperation
with the tribunal, based in The Hague, Netherlands. The new
government has promised to end years of stonewalling on extradition
requests and grant investigators access to alleged war crimes
sites.
</P>
<P>
   While Croatia's new leaders did not dismiss the ruling simply as
''anti-Croat,'' as was the habit of the former government of the
late President Franjo Tudjman, many see Blaskic as a scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   Blaskic, who surrendered to the tribunal voluntarily, ''ended up
as ... a pawn in the play where others pulled strings,'' said
Zlatko Kramaric, the leader of the Liberal Party, part of the new
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
   Racan insisted his Cabinet would live up to its promises of full
cooperation with the court. But Drazen Budisa, leader of the Social
Liberals -- Racan's partner in the ruling coalition -- said the
sentence will have ''an unfavorable effect'' on relations with the
court.
</P>
<P>
   Zdravko Tomac, deputy speaker of Parliament, went a step
further, saying the case represented ''a crisis situation'' for the
new government.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling also could turn Croats against the tribunal, making
it harder for the government to get public support for its new
campaign of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Hague thought that with the new government in charge, we
wouldn't care for Bosnian Croats at all,'' said a 24-year-old
student, who only identified himself as Marin. ''Blaskic is a
different case.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling set an important precedent by characterizing the
Muslim-Croat fighting in Bosnia as an international conflict,
mirroring an earlier judgment that confirmed Yugoslavia's
involvement in the war on the side of Bosnian Serbs.

<HEADLINE> Anguilla Votes for New Government  </HEADLINE>
By WYCLIFFE RICHARDSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE VALLEY, Anguilla (AP) -- Voters on this Caribbean island have
handed a parliamentary majority to an alliance of opposition
parties, frustrating Chief Minister Hubert Hughes' efforts to keep
his post.
</P>
<P>
   The two-party coalition in this British territory -- led by
opposition leader Osbourne Fleming and Hughes' former finance
minister, Victor Banks -- denied Hughes' hoped-for majority by
capturing four of seven seats in Friday's vote for the House of
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   All seven incumbents were re-elected, but because of a political
realignment, Hughes was expected to lose his post to Fleming, who
had been tapped to become chief minister if the opposition won.
</P>
<P>
   Results of the election were to be presented later today to the
island's British governor, Peter Johnston, who was then to ask
Fleming's coalition to form a new government. The new chief
minister could be sworn in by Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes held onto his district, while Banks -- tapped for finance
minister in a new government -- easily won his. Voter turnout was 64
percent, or 4,815 of 7,517 registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third election since 1994 for Anguilla -- an island of
10,000 people located about 150 miles east of Puerto Rico -- which
has been mired in a yearlong political impasse that has frustrated
London.
</P>
<P>
   The island, which depends heavily on upscale tourism, had
elected a coalition government in March 1999 that quickly crumbled
in a dispute between Hughes and Banks.
</P>
<P>
   Banks left Hughes' Anguilla United Movement and joined the rival
Anguilla Democratic Party United Front. That cut Hughes' party's
seats from four to three. Opposition members boycotted the assembly
and prevented it from meeting, forcing Hughes to call early
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Anguilla's political deadlock has exasperated officials in
Britain, while local residents complained officials did little to
create jobs or respond to a London proposal that would change the
relationship between Britain and its territories.
</P>
<P>
   Before their split, Hughes and Banks had negotiated a deal with
Beal Aerospace, a U.S. company, to build a commercial rocket launch
pad on Anguilla's Sombrero Island. The deal could be worth $6
million annually to Anguilla's economy -- roughly a fifth of its
budget. Development awaits regulatory approval from London.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still committed to see it through,'' Beal spokesman Wade
Gates said Friday. ''We are perhaps frustrated by the length of
time to get the project rolling, but we are still moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Guyana also is negotiating with Beal for a similar launch
facility.

<HEADLINE> Gov. Seeks to Postpone Nuclear Suit  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A fired nuclear weapons scientist's civil
lawsuit against the government should be postponed until after his
criminal trial on charges of mishandling classified data, the
Justice Department argues.
</P>
<P>
   Former Los Alamos National Laboratory scientist Wen Ho Lee filed
the civil suit 10 days after his indictment last December in order
''to interfere with a pending criminal case against him by
attacking the validity of his indictment,'' the government argued
in a motion for delay filed Friday with U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Lee pleaded innocent, and his criminal trial is to begin Nov. 6.
</P>
<P>
   His civil suit charged that government officials leaked false
and misleading information to reporters to smear him as a spy for
China before the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   The department argued that courts have long held that the
validity of a criminal indictment should be determined by the court
hearing the criminal case, in this case the U.S. District court in
New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''Allowing him to proceed with his civil case will interfere
with the prosecution of the criminal case,'' the government added.
It noted that plaintiffs in civil lawsuits have much more freedom
to learn their opponent's evidence through depositions than do
defendants in federal criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any effort to depose government officials familiar with the
Lee investigations, such as FBI agents or Department of Energy
officials -- some of whom are potential trial witnesses -- or
Department of Justice officials working on the case, including
prosecutors, would ... interfere with the government's ongoing work
on the investigation and prosecution,'' the department said.
</P>
<P>
   When the lawsuit was filed, Lee's attorney Brian Sun said it
would allow Lee's lawyers to gather records and testimony about the
investigation and officials' contacts with reporters. ''This
lawsuit is designed to ferret out and identify those folks who
leaked confidential and personal information about Wen Ho and (his
wife) Sylvia Lee to the press,'' Sun said.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department argued that postponing the lawsuit would
not prevent the Lees from pursuing their claims but only
temporarily delay them ''while a greater public interest is served
in the pursuit of an extraordinarily significant criminal
proceeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Dec. 10, in a 59-count indictment in Albuquerque, N.M., Lee
was charged with downloading to an unsecure computer highly
classified data on atomic weapons research, design and testing. The
government charged that he also put the data, with all the
information needed to build a functional hydrogen bomb, on portable
tapes, seven of which remain unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was not charged with spying for China or any foreign
government, but some of the criminal charges alleged his conduct
was done with intent to injure the United States or aid a foreign
power.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's suit accuses the FBI and the Justice and Energy
Departments of violating the Privacy Act by releasing details such
as Lee's job history, his travels to Asia and allegations that he
failed a lie-detector test. The leaks created a ''trial-by-media
atmosphere'' that led to Lee's being charged with improper handling
of classified information, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department told the court that Lee's attorneys
indicated they would likely oppose delaying the civil suit but
wanted to read the government's arguments before responding.
</P>
<P>
   Lee remains held without bail in New Mexico. His wife, a U.S.
citizen born in China who retired from Los Alamos in 1995, has not
been charged with a crime.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Assails Gay Marriage Ban  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP ) -- President Clinton is urging voters in
California to reject a ban on gay marriages, saying it is
unnecessary because no state currently honors such unions.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing a Democratic fund-raiser in San Francisco on Friday
night, the president said Proposition 22, which would bar
California from recognizing same-sex marriages should they become
legal in any other state, would have ''no practical effect
whatever'' except to divert attention from other, more serious
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a solution in search of a problem that isn't there,''
Clinton said during a reception for Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.
''So people are being asked to vote on this to get everybody in a
white heat and to divide people.''
</P>
<P>
   The reception was one of three events headlined by Clinton as
part of a weekend of fund-raisers that raked in $1.6 million for
Democrats. Today, the president was taking a break to spend time
with his daughter, Chelsea, a student at Stanford University,
before traveling to Los Angeles for more fund-raising. He was
finishing his travels Sunday at a civil rights commemoration in
Selma, Ala., before returning to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   For a man who is not seeking office, Clinton offered abundant
advice to voters in Tuesday's primary here, a state that supported
him in 1996 and is pivotal to the fortunes of Vice President Al
Gore in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't vote in this primary, but I hope you'll vote,'' he
said. ''You've got a big ballot. You'll have an opportunity to vote
for things that will affect your future and to send a signal where
California is.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton curried support for Proposition 26, which would allow
school districts to use property taxes to repay loans for school
construction and renovation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It'll build people up,'' Clinton said. ''We've got, already,
untold numbers of kids in schools that are either overcrowded or
tumbling down. ... You need to get all the roadblocks out of your
way to building your children's future.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also used the occasion to offer his first public comment
on the Amadou Diallo case, saying he believes the West African
immigrant's race was a factor in his shooting by four white New
York City policemen.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Diallo's parents and black activists pressed
Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder to have the Justice Department
pursue civil rights charges against the officers acquitted of
killing Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't pretend for a moment to second-guess the jury,''
Clinton said. ''But I know most people in America of all races
believe that if it had been a young white man in a young all-white
neighborhood, it probably wouldn't have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Clinton quickly added, ''That doesn't mean they (the
officers) were guilty under criminal law.''
</P>
<P>
   The president began a marathon day at an Aspen Institute forum
in the heart of Silicon Valley, where he challenged online
companies to strengthen consumer privacy safeguards. He also
ordered government agencies to evaluate the security of their own
Web sites and appealed to high-tech firms to work with him to
spread the prosperity that this new economy is creating.
</P>
<P>
   The West Coast visit gave Clinton a chance to dabble in politics
just days before California -- the largest electoral state -- votes
chooses Republican and Democrat nominees to succeed him on Super
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, Clinton attended two events to raise $600,000
for Feinstein's re-election campaign and the Democratic Senatorial
Campaign Committee, as well as a $400,000 Democratic National
Committee dinner. Tonight, he was the featured guest at two DNC
events in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   He seized the chance to tout Feinstein as a possible running
mate for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think she is immensely talented and would be good at
anything,'' Clinton said. ''But, this is a decision that the vice
president should make after he wins the nomination.''

<HEADLINE> Rules Would Define 'Organic' Foods  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Genetically engineered grains will be banned
from foods labeled ''organic'' under a new Clinton administration
proposal that sets standards for everything from the treatment of
animals to what constitutes organic manure, according to a
published report.
</P>
<P>
   The more than 600 pages of new regulations are expected to be
formally announced next week by the Agriculture Department, The
Washington Post said today, quoting unidentified sources.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines would also ban pesticides on crops labeled
organic, bar the use of sewage sludge as fertilizer, prohibit
irradiation and tightly restrict the use of antibiotics in farm
animals.
</P>
<P>
   The administration had no comment on the report, White House
spokesman Jake Siewert said.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Department officials would say only that officials
had ''finalized a revised proposed rule on organics, and hope to
get it out as soon as possible,'' the Post said.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper quoted Michael Sligh of the Rural Advancement
Foundation International as saying that the administration's first
proposals two years ago were too lax and became an international
embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   ''This time, from what they have said to us, we think they know
what an organic program should be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed regulations could become law within six months, but
they will first be subject to a 90-day public comment period and
could be modified.
</P>
<P>
   European governments have banned some of the same controversial
farming practices that will be prohibited by the proposed organic
rules. The rules may be a way out of a trade conflict with Europe
by offering grains free of genetic engineering and beef free of
hormones and antibiotics.

<HEADLINE> Technician Said To Test Negative  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A former radiology technician at Georgetown
University Hospital arrested after he was found siphoning a
painkiller from a patient's drug infusion pump has tested negative
for HIV and hepatitis B and C viruses, according to health
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Royal submitted the blood test results to the District
of Columbia Health Department on Thursday, The Washington Post
reported today.
</P>
<P>
   The department's senior deputy, Karen Dale, said the blood tests
are encouraging but do not mean that the estimated 600 patients who
had several specific radiology procedures at Georgetown University
Hospital are beyond risk.
</P>
<P>
   Viruses such as HIV and hepatitis are not detectable in the
blood immediately after transmission, so if Royal had been infected
recently, it could be months before tests show it.
</P>
<P>
   Also, officials are uncertain about how he manipulated the
narcotic painkillers. It is possible he recovered discarded
supplies from a waste container for needles and syringes that had
been contaminated by the blood of patients with dangerous viruses,
the Post said.
</P>
<P>
   But, Dale said, ''it's good news in that he's cooperated and
there is not the public health risk that could have been if his
health status were poor.''

impoverished southeastern African country Saturday as thousands of people who
had been stranded in treetops for a week finally made their way to dry ground.

opponents for him to be put on trial at home. ''Justice! Justice!'' about 200
opponents of his 1973-90 rule chanted during a Friday night vigil outside the

Republican Presidential Candidate George W. Bush visited the school last month.
The ban on interracial dating was just one criticism Bush faced after his visit

<HEADLINE> Bob Jones Univ. Drops Race Date Ban  </HEADLINE>
By PAGE IVEY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- The publicity nightmare that followed a
visit by Republican presidential contender George W. Bush has
prompted Bob Jones University to drop its ban on interracial
dating.
</P>
<P>
   ''As of today, we've dropped the rule,'' Bob Jones III,
university president and grandson of its founder, said Friday night
on CNN's ''Larry King Live.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the extraordinary national scrutiny of the
fundamentalist Christian college led to the move.
</P>
<P>
   ''This thing has gotten so out of hand,'' Jones said. ''All of a
sudden the university is at the center of a Republican presidential
debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush appeared at the fundamentalist Christian school last month,
and told his audience that he shared their conservative views. He
later apologized for failing to criticize the school's
anti-Catholic views and racial policies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm pleased that they've changed the policy,'' Bush said
Friday while campaigning in New York. ''Right after my speech, I
spoke out against the policy. The university has made the right
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The Greenville school banned interracial dating in the 1950s,
when an Asian family threatened to sue after their son, a student,
almost married a white girl, a school spokesman has said.
</P>
<P>
   The school did not admit its first black student until the 1970s
and lost its tax exemption in 1983 after a 13-year battle with the
Internal Revenue Service, which said the school's policies were
discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   The school had defended the dating ban based on a biblical
interpretation that God created people differently for a reason.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said Friday night that the school still believes in the
principle behind the rule, but that the public scrutiny was taking
its toll on graduates and the school's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ''If all anybody can see is this rule, which we never talk about
or preach about ... it hurts our graduates,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This thing is of such insignificance to us. It's so
significant to the world at large, the media in particular, why
should we have this thing here as an obstacle?''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the school has a good reputation as a Christian
school, ''but now we're being defined as a racist school, that's
all the media talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he met with administrators Friday afternoon to
discuss the rule change before flying to Washington for the TV
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, the university used full-page newspaper
advertisements in USA Today and South Carolina's largest newspapers
to answer some of the national criticism it has received. Democrats
in Congress this week introduced a resolution seeking to condemn
the university.
</P>
<P>
   The university is a popular stop for Republican candidates
seeking conservative support.
</P>
<P>
   Bush appeared at the school shortly after he lost to Arizona
Sen. John McCain in the New Hampshire primary. The South Carolina
primary was looming at the time, and Bush went on to win in the
conservative state.
</P>
<P>
   After losing South Carolina, McCain's campaign made ''Catholic
Voter Alert'' calls in the next states, Michigan and Washington, to
tell them of Bush's visit to Bob Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Of the school's rule change Friday, McCain said: ''It's the
right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The school of 3,500 students in the Appalachian foothills has
stuck to its fundamentalist guns and often doled out as much
criticism as it received.

   Jones III, president since 1971, and his father, Bob Jones Jr.,
who died in 1997, have been sharp-tongued about those they believe
have abandoned the strict teachings of the Bible, including Billy
Graham and the pope. Graham should not have reached out across
denominations for his crusades, Jones III says. And rather than
meet Pope John Paul II when he visited Columbia in 1987, Bob Jones
Jr. said he would rather ''speak to the devil himself.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Surrounds Self With Women  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- In a none-too-subtle attempt to close his
party's gender gap, George W. Bush is surrounding himself with
women and talking up their issues as he and Republican presidential
opponent John McCain head into their Super Tuesday showdown.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to predict that that traditional old gender gap that
we've heard so much about is going to turn itself inside out,''
Elizabeth Dole -- a former GOP rival not seen by Bush's side in a
month -- said Friday in Syracuse, joining Bush in barnstorming New
York from Long Island to the Canadian border. She appeared with the
Texas governor at a breast cancer research center.
</P>
<P>
   McCain complained Bush had gone too far with a radio ad
criticizing one of the Arizona senator's votes to cut federal
funding for breast cancer research. McCain also said third parties
were attacking his environmental record on TV at Bush's behest.
Bush denied the charge, although Texas investors Sam and Charles
Wyly, prominent Bush donors, were behind the spots.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somebody is putting in $2 million to try to hijack the
campaign here in New York,'' McCain said. ''It's everything I've
been fighting against. Two million dollars in the last few days in
this campaign can make a difference in a race that is a statistical
dead heat.''
</P>
<P>
   New York is one of the biggest prizes at stake Tuesday, when 13
states -- with nearly 60 percent of the delegates needed for the
Republican presidential nomination -- go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The ferocity of the fighting underscored the stakes. Polls have
shown Bush with a lead in California and Ohio -- two other Super
Tuesday prizes -- while New York is close.
</P>
<P>
   Bush turned to the pillars of Republican power in New York in an
effort to snuff McCain's insurgent campaign, but there was
controversy even there. New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was
resisting the McCain-bashing efforts of Gov. George Pataki and
other GOP state leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Bush planned to campaign today in Rochester and Binghamton, then
Hartford, Conn., before flying home to Austin, Texas. McCain was to
campaign in Boston, Portland, Maine; Syracuse and Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's flashpoint between McCain and Bush was the Texas
governor's commercial arguing that McCain voted against breast
cancer research. It followed Bush's focus in recent days on
education -- another issue that polls show is important to women
voters.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he has repeatedly voted to boost breast cancer
research spending and the vote cited in the Bush ad was one where
he opposed putting breast cancer money in a military spending
measure.
</P>
<P>
   In a new radio ad, the McCain campaign called the Bush spot
''shameful.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The last thing we need is a politician like George Bush
spreading fear,'' says the ad, running in New York. ''Reject his
negative politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush rejected the criticism. ''The ad speaks to programs that he
(McCain) called 'garden-variety pork,''' he told reporters after
visiting the Stony Brook Breast Cancer Research Center on Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's allies noted that the senator's sister, Sandy McCain
Morgan, has been diagnosed with breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Told of that, Bush said: ''All the more reason to remind him of
what he said about the research that goes on here. I'm sorry if
that's the case; that obviously is very difficult for her and her
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, when McCain watched Bush's response on the evening news,
his jaw clenched and he said almost under his breath, ''I hope my
sister isn't watching television tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also hit back against the third-party advertising in
another new radio spot in New York that points out that Texas has
the worst toxic air pollution from industrial facilities.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also began airing two new TV spots in New York,
California and Ohio. One touts him as the only Republican who can
win in November; the other cites his expertise in foreign and
military affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator's campaign, in a telephone barrage to New
Yorkers, also was targeting the crucial Roman Catholic vote, 46
percent of the state's GOP electorate.
</P>
<P>
   The pitch being given to Catholic voters touts McCain's economic
plans and his chances to win in November, but also notes that
McCain spoke out against ''bigotry'' at Bob Jones University in
South Carolina. The script does not mention Bush's visit to that
school, which McCain has strongly criticized because the governor
didn't speak out against its anti-Catholic reputation.
</P>
<P>
   The school also banned interracial dating, although Bob Jones
III said Friday on CNN's ''Larry King Live'' that the university
would drop the policy.

<HEADLINE> Texas Donors Behind Bush GOP Ads  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Resolving a brief mystery, two Texas brothers
who have supported George W. Bush for years came forward to claim
credit for more than $2 million in ads touting Bush's record on the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   The ads, airing in key states holding primaries Tuesday, also go
after Bush's challenger in the Republican presidential race,
Arizona Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Sam and Charles Wyly, who have made millions in software and
other businesses, donated $210,273 to Bush's gubernatorial
campaigns. Charles has raised more than $100,000 for the Bush
presidential effort, making him a ''pioneer,'' and the Wyly family
has contributed tens of thousands of dollars to GOP candidates
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have had a lot to do with building the Republican Party in
Texas and nationally,'' Sam Wyly said Friday. ''And we'd appreciate
it if the elected Republicans would look at our cause.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wylys' group, Republicans for Clean Air, said it purchased
close to $2.5 million in ads in three crucial states holding
primaries Tuesday. The ads were running in San Francisco, Columbus,
Ohio, and across New York state, and Burlington, Vt., whose TV
stations reach homes in New York. But some stations were jittery
about running the ads, given questions about whether the group,
which did not exist a week ago, is legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   The ads began airing Thursday, but the group did not publicly
identify itself until Friday. The group was put together so hastily
that that its letterhead contained the misspelling ''Repubicans.''
</P>
<P>
   The spots would amount to an illegal donation if the Bush
campaign were involved with them, but Sam Wyly and Bush both denied
any coordination. ''There is no connection between my campaign and
this ad,'' Bush said in New York on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain cried foul. His campaign filed a complaint with the
Federal Communications Commission and he asked TV stations to pull
the ads from the air. ''It's everything I've been fighting
against,'' said McCain. ''Two million dollars in the last few days
in this campaign can make a difference in a race that is a
statistical dead heat.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other connections between the Bush campaign and clean
air group. The woman who bought the time for the ads also works for
a political action committee led by Republican Rep. Henry Bonilla
of Texas, a longtime Bush backer. The ads were placed by
Multimedia, which has done work in the past for Bush supporters.
And Jeb Hensarling, who is close to some on the Bush campaign, is a
consultant for Wyly who helped connect him to the admaker.
</P>
<P>
   FCC attorney Bobby Baker said he has advised stations to be sure
that the group claiming to sponsor the ads really exists and is not
just a front for someone else.
</P>
<P>
   The group was informally put together last week by the Wyly
brothers -- Dallas entrepreneurs who have made tens of millions of
dollars in computer software and other businesses. Sam Wyly also
owns a company that produces environmentally friendly power,
GreenMountain.com, and he says Bush has worked hard to cut
pollution from coal-burning plants.
</P>
<P>
   Their only motive is promoting the environment, Wyly said. He
added that his interest has nothing to do his with the prospect of
electing a man who may feel indebted to him. ''I doubt I'd have any
access I wouldn't have had anyway,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Wylys may have already benefited from their connections to
the Texas governor. One of the brothers' businesses, Maverick
Capital Fund of Dallas, won a state contract worth more than a
million dollars a year to invest $96 million of the University of
Texas' endowment.
</P>
<P>
   The Wylys have been active donors to GOP candidates across the
country. That includes McCain, who got $1,000 from each Wyly
brother and $1,000 from Sam Wyly's wife in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think he's a good Republican senator,'' Sam Wyly said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Sierra Club complained that the Wylys have given money
to more than a dozen members of Congress who have regularly voted
against environmental bills.
</P>
<P>
   ''So what? So what?'' Sam Wyly responded, saying he hopes to
educate them about the environment. ''I think they're likely to
listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups criticize Bush's record on the environment,
particularly air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans for Environmental Protection has endorsed McCain and
the Sierra Club has spent nearly $100,000 attacking Bush's record
on the environment as governor.

<HEADLINE> Seven N. Koreans Defect to S. Korea  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Seven North Koreans defected to the
South on Saturday after escaping their hunger-stricken communist
homeland, the Seoul government's main spy agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Intelligence Service said the North Koreans, from
two families, had first sought political asylum at a South Korean
diplomatic mission in a third country that the agency refused to
identify.
</P>
<P>
   The unidentified country assisted South Korean diplomats in
bringing the defectors to Seoul, the spy agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The seven included a 55-year-old pharmacist, his wife and three
children who had fled communist North Korea between 1998 and 1999,
the spy agency said.
</P>
<P>
   A 36-year-old woman, who had lived in Japan before emigrating to
North Korea, also defected with her 14-year-old son, the agency
said. It gave no further details.
</P>
<P>
   More than 460 North Koreans have defected to South Korea since
1994, about one-third of them last year. Most came through China.
Many have complained of hunger in their homeland, which has
experienced severe drought and famine in recent years.

<HEADLINE> Indian Communist Mukherjee Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Geeta Mukherjee, veteran leader of the
Communist Party of India, died early Saturday of a massive heart
attack, officials of her party said. She was 76.
</P>
<P>
   Her death came as she was preparing to leave for a party program
in the northern town of Aligarh, 75 miles southeast of the capital,
New Delhi, the Press Trust of India news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Mukherjee was one of the founding members of the communist
movement in the state of West Bengal. She was the widow of
prominent communist party leader Bishwanath Mukherjee.
</P>
<P>
   She also was secretary of the party's national council and its
deputy leader in the Lok Sabha, India's lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Mukherjee was deeply involved with women's issues, spearheading
the communists' demand for setting aside a third of all seats in
parliament and state legislatures for women.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Communist Party of India said Mukherjee's
body would be flown to Calcutta, capital of West Bengal state, and
the funeral would be held Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Cuban-Born INS Official Indicted  </HEADLINE>
By CATHERINE WILSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- An immigration official accused of spying for the
Cuban government has been indicted for allegedly handing over U.S.
secrets to a Cuban citizen and lying about contacts with government
officials from the Communist island.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Faget, a Cuban-born supervisor in the Miami office of
the Immigration and Naturalization Service, has been jailed without
bond since his high-profile arrest Feb. 17 and faces arraignment
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The case led to the expulsion from the United States of a top
Cuban diplomat, Jose Imperatori.
</P>
<P>
   In a federal indictment, Faget was charged with communicating
national defense secrets, converting classified information to his
own use and three counts of making false statements.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Ed O'Donnell did not immediately return
messages seeking comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a jailhouse interview this week, Faget denied spying for the
Cuban government and said he ''would never do anything to hurt the
American dream.''
</P>
<P>
   The indictment offers little of substance beyond information
released by the FBI when Faget was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Faget, 54, was regularly consulted about immigration cases
involving FBI informants and counterintelligence sources, the
indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   He had secret clearance at the INS for 12 years but never
informed the agency about becoming executive vice president of
America-Cuba Inc., a company formed with New York businessman and
Cuban citizen Pedro Font to recruit trade with Cuba if the United
States lifts its trade embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Faget should have submitted an outside employment form
reflecting his ties to America-Cuba and Font, its president, the
indictment indicated.
</P>
<P>
   Faget was introduced to Cuban government officials by Font, met
with them at least three times and talked to them by phone without
reporting his contacts to the FBI or INS, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   He was caught in an FBI sting Feb. 11 when he was shown secret
documents, was told ''very sensitive'' information that a Cuban
official was about to defect and then called Font 12 minutes later,
investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   In a second call, Faget promised to keep Font informed while he
was traveling in China, the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   The false-statement counts charge Faget lied about contacts with
Cuban government officials and lied on a 1998 INS form saying he
had no foreign business connections.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Faget could face up to 35 years in prison and
$1.25 million in fines.

<HEADLINE> FDA: Gene Therapy Rules Violated  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER, AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Food and Drug Administration says in a
letter that a University of Pennsylvania researcher violated safety
regulations in a gene therapy experiment in which a patient died.
</P>
<P>
   In the stern warning letter, the FDA said that Dr. James M.
Wilson of the University of Pennsylvania ''violated regulations
governing the proper conduct of clinical studies'' in a series of
gene therapy experiments designed to correct a liver disease.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson headed a gene therapy experimental study that was halted
after the death of 18-year-old Jesse Gelsinger of Tucson, Ariz. The
teen-ager is the first patient known to have died as a direct
result of a gene therapy experiment.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager died last September just four days after he was
injected with the gene therapy drug. An autopsy report blamed his
death on the effects of the experiment.
</P>
<P>
   In its letter on Friday, the FDA ordered Wilson and the
University of Pennsylvania's Institute for Human Gene Therapy to
continue cessation of all current human experimental drug trials
and not to apply for new studies until ''corrective actions have
been implemented.''
</P>
<P>
   A warning letter is an FDA procedure that notifies a researcher
or institution of what the agency considers to be violations of
federal law. It means that unless the offending actions are
corrected, the agency can take some enforcement action without
further notice. The warning letter said the university had 15 days
to report on steps it plans to correct the violations.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Pennsylvania said in a statement that it takes
the FDA letter ''extremely seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement said the university had already answered many of
the allegations contained in the letter and was ''disappointed''
that the FDA discounted or rejected those earlier responses.
</P>
<P>
   Gelsinger was enrolled in an experiment designed to test whether
new genes could correct an inherited liver condition caused by a
genetic flaw. In the experiment, a virus modified to carry the
corrective gene was infused directly into the liver.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-page letter sent to Wilson said than an inspection showed
that the University of Pennsylvania researchers failed to properly
report serious reactions experienced by patients who had the gene
therapy before Gelsinger.
</P>
<P>
   The letter also said the university failed to make a timely
report about the death of at least two lab monkeys in similar gene
therapy experiments.
</P>
<P>
   The warning letter accused the university of:
</P>
<P>
   --Failure to properly report changes in the experimental
protocol. Among the changes was elimination of a provision to stop
the experiment if two patients experienced serious liver toxicity.
''These protocol revisions reflect significant changes that affect
the safety of study subjects,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   --Failure to immediately notify or properly report serious
adverse reactions in four patients. An annual report by the
university, the letter said, ''misrepresented the true nature of
the toxicities experienced by these four subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   --Enrollment of new patients in the experiments using higher
doses despite adverse reactions experienced by earlier patients at
lower doses. ''Your actions demonstrate a disregard for the
protocol stopping rules you had agreed to follow that were designed
to protect the safety of study subjects,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   --Failure to properly report liver damage found in a laboratory
monkey even though the results suggested ''a significant risk for
human subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   --Failure to revise informed consent documents for new patients
after some earlier patients had serious side effects. This meant,
the letter said, that some patients were not told ''new information
about the possible risks of participation.''
</P>
<P>
   --Failure to properly conduct the required laboratory tests on
patients either before or after the experiment. ''We conclude that
the (institute) did not exert due diligence to ensure that the
follow-up tests were performed according to the protocol,'' the
letter said.

<HEADLINE> Five dead in Bronx killing spree  </HEADLINE>
By LUKAS I. ALPERT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A murder spree in a quiet Bronx neighborhood has
left four family members and a fifth person dead, leaving police
with their hands full with investigating what prompted the
slayings.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said the victims were part of a large extended family
that had moved to the city from Puerto Rico. Their bodies were
found in three different locations.
</P>
<P>
   The first killing occurred in the Parkside Houses on Olinville
Avenue, where 39-year-old Evelyn Santos was found late Thursday
evening. She had been fatally shot and stabbed inside an elevator,
said Detective Joseph Pentangelo, a department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Police efforts to notify Santos' next-of-kin brought them to the
house of Evelyn's sister, where they made another gruesome
discovery. Inside a two-story home on Radcliff Avenue, about 10
blocks away from the first crime scene, police found Evelyn's
30-year-old sister Denise Santos, slashed to death early Friday,
Commissioner Howard Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   Police then returned to another apartment in the Parkside Houses
to locate other family members, when, at 7:30 a.m. Friday, they
found the bodies of the brother of the slain sisters, Denise
Santos' fiancDe and a 14-year-old nephew of the sisters.
</P>
<P>
   The two adult victims -- Eduardo Santos, 34, and Irvine Aguilar,
33 -- were shot and stabbed to death. The nephew, Ishmael Santos,
had been fatally stabbed, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said the times of death had yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   Police were investigating the case as a quintuple homicide. It
wasn't clear whether the murders were committed by one or more
people.
</P>
<P>
   Police had made no arrests by early today.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are some leads but no identification of suspects at this
point,'' Safir said, adding that there was no sign of forced entry
at any of the crime scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Police in the Bronx neighborhood where the killings happened
handed out fliers asking for help in locating the killer or
killers.
</P>
<P>
   One officer remarked after the police news conference that
Friday's killings bore a striking resemblance to the ''Palm Sunday
Massacre,'' a slaying of ten people-- including eight children-- in
the East New York section of Brooklyn in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Thomas, of the Bronx, was sentenced to a total of
250 years in prison for those slayings.
</P>
<P>
   The NYPD offered a $10,000 reward for information leading to the
arrest and conviction of any suspects involved in Friday's
killings. Anyone with information about the murders was asked to
call police at 1-800-577-TIPS.

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart Cutting Meat Departments  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID KOENIG, AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Until two weeks ago, there had never been a
successful union vote at a Wal-Mart in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Butchers at a Wal-Mart Supercenter in Jacksonville, Texas,
changed that in February with their 7-3 vote to unionize their
department.
</P>
<P>
   Now, their victory is in doubt. Wal-Mart said Friday it will
shut down its meat-cutting operations in Jacksonville and 179 other
stores in Arkansas, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas
and sell only prepackaged meat.
</P>
<P>
   Those cuts will come in May and June, Wal-Mart spokesman Jessica
Moser said in a statement from the retail giant's headquarters in
Bentonville, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   The displaced meat cutters will be offered other jobs at their
stores, Moser said.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to switch to prepackaged meat at all 700 of
its superstores, but there is no timetable for eliminating butchers
at the remaining stores, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart's opposition to unions in its stores is legendary in
business circles. The company has even barred charities from its
stores during the holiday season because of concern the food and
commercial workers would use the policy to get inside and conduct
organizing campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Moser denied any connection between the union vote and the
closures.
</P>
<P>
   She said prepackaged meat ''has a better appearance and longer
shelf life'' and is easier to track inventory. Wal-Mart has been
planning the switch to prepackaged meat for months.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was buying the story.
</P>
<P>
   ''They just remodeled our store. They spent about $40,000 on a
new wrapping machine. They just got new pans to hold the meat,''
said meat cutter Maurice Miller in Jacksonville. ''If they'd been
thinking about this for months, why would they spend all that
money?''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 45, was on the winning side of last month's vote to be
represented by Local 540 of the United Food and Commercial Workers.
</P>
<P>
   Local and national union officials said Wal-Mart was responding
not only to the Jacksonville vote but to a pending election at its
store in Palestine, Texas, and organizing efforts at about 20
Wal-Marts around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart officials announced their plan to close meat-cutting
operations during a hearing Monday before National Labor Relations
Board staffers.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart argued unsuccessfully -- all the way to Washington --
that all 300 store employees in Jacksonville, and not just the meat
cutters, should have been able to vote on joining a union.
</P>
<P>
   Now it argues that union officials took improper actions to
influence the vote, and a hearing is scheduled for March 28. Union
officials accused Wal-Mart of violating federal labor law.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Denier, a union spokesman in Washington, said Wal-Mart
cannot legally eliminate meat-cutting operations in Jacksonville
without first negotiating with the 10 employees and the union. He
said the union will file a complaint with the labor board and, if
it loses there, take the retailer to court.

<HEADLINE> Bill Would Shield Tobacco Cos.  </HEADLINE>
By BOB LEWIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- State lawmakers have passed a bill
protecting companies' assets in Virginia, a measure that would
shield tobacco giants such as Philip Morris from a potential
multibillion dollar judgment in a Florida lawsuit filed by ailing
smokers.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which Gov. Jim Gilmore is expected to sign,
caps bonds required to appeal punitive damages judgments at $25
million.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris, which is based in New York but operates the
world's largest cigarette plant in Richmond, is among five tobacco
companies in a class-action lawsuit in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   All could face billions of dollars in damages if they lose,
forcing the companies to post billions of dollars in cash or assets
as bond while the judgment is appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates within the industry have placed the possible punitive
damages from the lawsuit brought on behalf of Florida smokers as
high as $300 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The measure passed the House of Delegates 98-0 and the Senate
33-6 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore persuaded Del. Eric Cantor, a fellow Republican, to
introduce the bill last month. The bill never mentions Philip
Morris or the word ''tobacco,'' and Cantor said Philip Morris was
never mentioned to him in regard to the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The link to Philip Morris was drawn in a story published by The
Virginian-Pilot of Norfolk.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not characterizing it as a Philip Morris bill,'' Cantor
said. ''This allows for a defendant in a lawsuit to avail itself
fully to the appeals process. No entity in the United States could
withstand a $300 billion appeal bond.''

<HEADLINE> Louisville Mayor Fires Police Chief  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE CHAMBERS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Police officers and supporters marched on City
Hall to protest Mayor Dave Armstrong's firing of the police chief
who approved awards for two officers involved in the shooting of an
unarmed 18-year-old black man.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of supporters on Friday, wearing T-shirts that read
''Armstrong's Wrong,'' called on the mayor to step down, saying
Thursday's firing of Chief Gene Sherrard was motivated by a vocal
minority.
</P>
<P>
   ''If anyone needs to be removed from office it's not the chief
of police,'' said Rick McCubbin, president of the local Fraternal
Order of Police lodge. McCubbin met with Armstrong behind closed
doors following the rally.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong fired Sherrard after the chief approved awards
honoring officers Chris Horn and Paul Kinkade for their role in an
incident in which an unarmed black man was fatally shot. Horn and
Kinkade, who are white, were awarded the Exceptional Valor Award at
a ceremony Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Horn and Kinkade shot Desmond Rudolph on May 13 as he was
attempting to flee in a stolen vehicle that had become stuck in an
alley. Police fired 22 rounds into the vehicle, saying they feared
Rudolph was going to run them down.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph died four days later, and his death sparked outrage in
the black community.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said Sherrard violated his trust by quietly approving
the awards a month earlier amid a grand jury investigation and an
internal probe.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury found no criminal wrongdoing but the internal
probe cited several errors by police before and after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Police complained that Armstrong caved to political pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong, who met with union officials and black leaders
following the rally, said despite the turnout of hundreds at the
pro-police rally, community support is on his side.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's one person the chief has to make happy and that's the
elected representative of the people ... and that did not take
place. And so I removed him. It's not complicated,'' Armstrong
said.

<HEADLINE> Study Casts Doubt on Transplants  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- A new study casts doubt on the value of bone
marrow transplants for women with advanced breast cancer and one
noted breast cancer expert is recommending that it be abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers found that among women whose breast cancer had
spread, patients who received bone marrow transplants and received
high doses of chemotherapy ''do not survive longer or have a longer
time to progression of the disease'' than patients who get just
regular chemotherapy over a two-year period.
</P>
<P>
   The study was set to be published in the New England Journal of
Medicine on April 13. The journal released it Friday on its Web
site Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marcia Angell, the journal's editor-in-chief, said a report
out of South Africa that showed some benefit in the procedure later
turned out to be fraudulent.
</P>
<P>
   She said the journal made its report available early because the
South African study ''left a lot of concern and confusion among
women and insurers who weren't sure whether to cover it.''
</P>
<P>
   A total of 199 patients took part in the study, and after three
years, there was no significant difference in the survival of the
groups or in how long the treatment kept the cancer from recurring.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's true that it is no better than the standard treatment and
that's a disappointment,'' said Dr. John K. Erban, chief of
hematology and oncology at New England Medical Center and a
co-author of the study.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said the transplant treatment might be preferable
for some women because it can be completed in three weeks. He said
the conventional chemotherapy regimen takes two years and ''is
unpalatable for some women.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that it's possible that some very small set of patients
might still be found who do better with the transplants.
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Marc E. Lippman of the
Lombardi Cancer Center in Washington, aid doctors should reconsider
the way they treat women with advanced breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''This form of treatment for women with metastatic breast cancer
has been proved to be ineffective and should be abandoned in favor
of well-justified alternative experimental approaches,'' Lippman
wrote.

<HEADLINE> Bronx Detectives Find More Victims  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A homicide probe in the Bronx suddenly
multiplied for police as they worked to notify next of kin and
instead found four more victims.
</P>
<P>
   In all, five people were found in three locations on Thursday
and Friday. Four were members of an extended Puerto Rican family,
neighbors said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation broadened after police found Evelyn Santos,
39, shot and stabbed in an elevator at an apartment complex late
Thursday, said Det. Joseph Pentangelo, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Early Friday, detectives found Santos' 30-year-old sister,
Denise Santos, dead from stab wounds after coming to her nearby
home to speak with her about the slaying, said Howard Safir, the
city's police commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Police say investigators then returned to the apartment complex
about 10 blocks away and found the bodies of the womens' brother,
34-year-old Edurado Santos, along with the fiance of Denise Santos
and a 14-year-old nephew to the women.
</P>
<P>
   Santos and his sister's fiance, 33-year-old Irvine Aguilar, had
been stabbed and shot to death, police said. The nephew,
14-year-old Ishamel Santos, was stabbed.
</P>
<P>
   Times of death had not been determined, Safir said. It was
unclear whether the slayings were the work of one person or more.
</P>
<P>
   Safir said there are ''some leads'' in the slayings, but he
named no suspects. There were no signs of forced entry at any of
the crime scenes, he added.
</P>
<P>
   A $10,000 police reward has been offered.

<HEADLINE> Guinea Bissau Exile May Return  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBON, Portugal (AP) -- Guinea-Bissau's exiled president, who
was deposed in a military coup last year, said he is willing to
return to his West African country to stand trial on charges of
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview published Saturday in the Portuguese daily 24
Horas, Joao Bernardo Vieira, who lives under political asylum in
Portugal, said he would return home if he could choose his lawyers
and have international observers witness the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Vieira, blamed by much of the population for the country's
economic hardship during his 19-year rule, suggested setting up an
independent commission to investigate alleged political and
financial crimes in the former Portuguese colony.
</P>
<P>
   The commission should ''find out exactly what happened in
Guinea-Bissau,'' he told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The military leaders who overthrew Vieira allowed him to leave
for exile in Portugal last June after he pledged to return to face
trial in connection with alleged arms deals with separatist rebels
in the Senegalese province of Casamance.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Guinea Bissau Attorney General Amine Saad asked
Portugal to revoke Vieira's political asylum after a probe into
alleged politically motivated killings under his rule. The
allegations included the 1986 execution of the leaders of a coup
attempt against Vieira.
</P>
<P>
   Saad opened the investigation after a breakaway military faction
deposed Vieira in May last year, concluding an 11-month conflict in
the tiny country wedged between Senegal and the Republic of Guinea.
</P>
<P>
   Vieira came to power in a 1980 coup and was reinstated in the
country's first democratic elections in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Report: 600 Falun Gong Leaders Held  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese authorities have arrested at least 600
leading members of a meditation-exercise sect they outlawed as an
''evil cult,'' similar to the Falun Gong spiritual movement, a
human rights group said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, with security tight ahead of Sunday's opening of the
annual 10-day legislative session of the National People's
Congress, police in Beijing seized at least 10 Falun Gong members
who attempted to sit in a meditation pose in Tiananmen Square. The
would-be protesters were quickly dragged off the pavement and put
into waiting vans.
</P>
<P>
   The vast square is adjacent to the Great Hall of the People,
where the legislature meets.
</P>
<P>
   The government has quietly expanded the crackdown it began in
July, when it banned Falun Gong. Since October it has rounded up
many leading members of Zhong Gong, another offshoot of a
traditional health practice known as qigong, according to the Hong
Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic
Movement.
</P>
<P>
   The moves against Zhong Gong members have come with no official
public comment, unlike the government's vehement and aggressive
campaign to portray Falun Gong as a public menace.
</P>
<P>
   However, the police this week notified relatives of Cheng Yaqin,
a Zhong Gong leader in the northeastern city of Qiqihar in
Heilongjiang province, that she had been formally arrested and
would be charged, the Information Center said.
</P>
<P>
   It said Cheng and several other Zhong Gong leaders were arrested
on Oct. 12 in the southern city of Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
   The report could not be immediately confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Like Falun Gong, Zhong Gong has attracted huge numbers of
followers, including senior government officials. Both groups use
qigong-style exercises they say promote good health, while Falun
Gong adds a spiritual dimension, claiming its practice also
improves morality.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity and organizational flair of such groups alarmed
Chinese leaders who feared they might undermine Communist Party
rule.
</P>
<P>
   Police have quietly moved against the group while trying to
round up its leaders, closing more than 100 Zhong Gong centers. The
group's founder, Zhang Hongbao, has gone into hiding as the
government has begun confiscating the assets of his Qilin Group, a
conglomerate based in the port city of Tianjin that employed more
than 400,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Information Center, Zhong Gong was founded in
1988 and has 20 million followers.

<HEADLINE> Senior Tibetan Buddhist Monk Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- One of Tibetan Buddhism's most revered leaders,
abbot Gungthang Rinpoche, has died at age 74 at his monastery in
northwestern China, a monitoring group reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Gungthang Rinpoche died on Tuesday after returning to the
Labrang monastery in Gansu province from a hospital where he was
receiving treatment for cancer, the London-based Tibet Information
Network said.
</P>
<P>
   As the second most senior religious leader at Labrang monastery,
Gungthang Rinpoche spent more than 20 years in prison for his
refusal to cooperate with Beijing after Chinese troops took control
of Tibet in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Gungthang Rinpoche was very popular among Tibetans for his
loyalty to the exiled leader, the Dalai Lama, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   ''His death is a great loss that will have an impact on both the
religious and political situation in Tibet,'' it quoted Alag Tsaye
Rinpoche, a close friend of Gungthang Rinpoche, as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Following his release from prison in 1979, Gungthang Rinpoche
traveled to Tibetan communities in northwestern China raising funds
to rebuild monasteries destroyed during the 1966-76 Cultural
Revolution and setting up schools, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the group, Gungthang Rinpoche had been a member of
the standing committee of a top government advisory group, the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, but lost favor
with the Communist leadership after he refused to accept its choice
for another important Tibetan Buddhist leader, the Panchen Lama.

<HEADLINE> Stabbed Woman Doesn't Notice Knife  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DARBY, Pa. (AP) -- A 62-year-old woman was stabbed Friday as she
walked to a grocery store, but she didn't notice the knife sticking
out of her back until after she had gone shopping and returned
home, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, whose name was not released, apparently thought her
attacker had only punched her, police said. No one in the store
said anything to her, even though a surveillance camera showed the
woman pushing a cart with the knife clearly visible.
</P>
<P>
   She was in fair condition at the Hospital of the University of
Pennsylvania on Saturday morning. Her daughter had noticed the
knife when she returned home and removed it, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said there seemed to be no motive for the attack. The
woman was walking from her home in Colwyn at about 6:50 a.m. when a
man attacked her, Police Chief Robert F. Smythe said.
</P>
<P>
   ''She thought he punched her,'' Smythe said. ''He stabbed her.
No rhyme or reason.''
</P>
<P>
   The victim was not robbed and the suspect ran away, police said.
The woman then continued on her errand.
</P>
<P>
   ''She walked up to the Acme market and did her shopping with a
knife lodged in her back,'' Smythe said.

<HEADLINE> Plan To Resettle Albanians Scrapped  </HEADLINE>
By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- French peacekeepers
abandoned plans to move more ethnic Albanians to the north side of
this divided town today, a day after the effort prompted violent
protests by Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. spokesman Peter Biro said no Albanian families would be
returned to their homes on the Serb side of the Ibar River today,
but the United Nations was planning to return Serb families to the
Albanian side as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a first step to making the city more open,'' Biro
said. ''It is important to show that we are determined to keep the
city open.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a move is also likely to inflame already tense feelings in
Kosovska Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   The city, 20 miles northwest of Kosovo's provincial capital,
Pristina, has been the scene of repeated ethnic unrest in recent
weeks, resulting in several deaths and dozens of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   French and Greek soldiers today were securing three apartment
buildings where 41 ethnic Albanians were brought Friday by Danish
troops in armored vehicles that forded the Ibar River, after a
failed attempt to get the people across using a footbridge.
</P>
<P>
   Some Serbs living in the same complex were moving out today. It
was not immediately clear how many.
</P>
<P>
   More violence was reported near Kosovska Mitrovica and on
Kosovo's boundary with Serbia, where gunfire was heard overnight.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, peacekeepers used tear gas and stun grenades to break
through a crowd of Serbs protesting in front of the apartment
complex, which the Albanians earlier had to flee because of ethnic
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Hasan Jashari, who returned to his home aboard an armored
personnel carrier, told reporters today: ''I would rather die here
than be in someone else's house. ... There is room and work for all
of us'' in Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Ghedini, a spokesman for the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees in Pristina, criticized the move to return ethnic
Albanians to their homes, saying the situation was too tense for
their return.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, sustained gunfire was heard for about two hours after
midnight in the area of Dobrosin, an ethnic Albanian village inside
Serbia at Kosovo's boundary. Some 180 people in about 20 vehicles
were reported to have fled into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Cmdr. Philip Anido, a NATO spokesman, said the gunfire was
believed to be a shootout between armed Albanian extremists and
Serbian local police authorized to maintain order in the area.
</P>
<P>
   There are fears that the southern Serbian region could be the
scene of renewed fighting similar to violence in Kosovo last year,
which led to NATO attacks against Yugoslavia. Already, hundreds of
ethnic Albanians are fleeing to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Serb protesters, determined to prevent the
resettlement in Kosovska Mitrovica, marched through the city to the
three high-rises and tried to push their way through a cordon of
NATO troops and U.N. police.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers fired tear gas and stun grenades during two separate
standoffs. Five French peacekeepers were injured, said French Gen.
Pierre de Saqui de Sannes. Nine Serbs also were treated for
injuries, hospital authorities said.

<HEADLINE> Putin Denies Rebuke for Campaigning  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN IAMS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Acting President Vladimir Putin's press service on
Saturday denied reports that he was rebuked by Russia's election
commission for kicking off his presidential campaign early in
violation of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's campaign headquarters press service issued a statement
that said the acting president ''never got any official warnings
from the Central Election Commission for any violations in the
course of the election campaign whatsoever, much less for a 'false
start''' of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Segodnya reported Saturday that Putin had violated
election law by campaigning before Feb. 25 -- the first day
campaigning was allowed in the Russian press.
</P>
<P>
   ''One warning to the candidate Putin in connection with
jump-starting the campaign was already made by the Central Election
Commission,'' the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   But Putin's campaign press service said his open letter to
voters ''was published on Feb. 25 of this year, that is, on the day
of the official start of the election campaign in the media,'' the
ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, as the incumbent, has been able to camouflage campaigning
as state business, visiting factories, state farms, hospitals and
military units with plenty of TV cameras to record his encounters
with local residents.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign for Russia's March 26 presidential election hit the
airwaves Friday, the first day when candidates could take advantage
of free ad time on Russian TV and radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   The five-minute spots, and a series of televised, four-candidate
debates starting next week, are intended to give all 11 candidates
an equal shot at reaching Russia's far-flung voters.
</P>
<P>
   Russian media reported Saturday that Putin had no need of
advertising, and would turn down the opportunity for free time.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Izvestia said, ''the refusal of commercials is a
commercial itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin's press service said that the fuss over whether or not he
takes free air time, reports that he did not declare all of his
property or that he jump-started his campaign were links in a
chain.
</P>
<P>
   ''The goal here is simple and understood: to shake the faith of
the voters in the honesty and decency of the candidate,'' the
statement said.

<HEADLINE> Coloring Book Helps Kids Stop Abuse  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MacDONALD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   FARGO, N.D. (AP) -- The letter was just 16 words, printed in a
scared child's scrawl.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cannot call you but I can write,'' it said. ''I'm being
abused of my stepfather. Please help.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter arrived with a Texas postmark at the Rape and Abuse
Crisis Center in Fargo in 1989, and its words seared in center
worker Beth Haseltine's memory.
</P>
<P>
   She later learned that the writer was 7, a second-grader who had
found the center's address inside the cover of a coloring book
called ''Red Flag-Green Flag People,'' part of a sexual abuse
awareness program to help youngsters distinguish inappropriate
touching.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was so scared for her,'' recalled Haseltine, now the
non-profit center's director. ''We had no idea who this little girl
was.''
</P>
<P>
   Staff members eventually were able to track the child down, and
the abuser was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   For Haseltine and others, it is a vivid reminder of the
importance of a coloring book that is now 20 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Red Flag-Green Flag has grown from a program with its creators
struggling to get the book into a single school in Dilworth, Minn.,
to one recognized across the United States and in 63 countries.
</P>
<P>
   Former center employee Joy Williams saw a need to teach children
about sexual abuse, but she wanted to do it in a way that wouldn't
frighten them. She also wanted them to have the skills to recognize
harmful situations and the self-confidence to speak up.
</P>
<P>
   The coloring book she created teaches children about
''red-flag'' and ''green-flag'' touches. A green-flag touch is one
that makes you feel happy and safe, like a hug from your mother, it
says. A red-flag touch makes you feel scared, confused or
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   The book also helps youngsters identify their ''helpers,''
adults such as nurses, their own parents or police officers to whom
they can turn if they experience a red-flag touch, either by a
stranger or even a family member.
</P>
<P>
   The center has countless examples of children who have stepped
forward to report abuse after lessons taught with crayons, coloring
books and chants of, ''Say no, get away, tell a helper!''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to answer how many times a child averted a dangerous
situation because we gave them the knowledge and skills to prevent
it,'' said Carmen Collins, a spokeswoman for Red Flag-Green Flag.
''But that's the real goal of the program.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar programs have been developed, but Red Flag-Green Flag is
considered by many counselors, law enforcement officers and
educators as the premier program of its kind for children.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's so accepted because it's very non-threatening,''
said Susan Kamm, coordinator of ''Safe Kids,'' a Grand Rapids,
Mich., program that has used Red Flag-Green Flag materials in its
lessons for six years. ''It's presented in a format that children
understand. It's basic.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, a 7-year-old Grand Rapids girl was approached by a man
who tried to lure her into his car. She dropped her backpack and
ran away screaming, something she said she learned to do in Kamm's
program the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   There was resistance to the book at first, said Greg Diehl, Red
Flag-Green Flag's marketing and sales manager.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents saw it as an effort to introduce sex education in
grade school, he said. Others believed the program would be too
unsettling for children in the second or third grade.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we first started, it was pretty controversial,'' said
Dave Andersen, then a youth intervention officer with the Moorhead,
Minn., police department. ''There was some misunderstanding about
what we were trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, parents and school administrators in neighboring
Dilworth, Minn., agreed to try it. Andersen presented the first
class to third graders, and it quickly spread.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've reached every third-grader in the county since 1980. How
many kids that is, I don't know. But it's obviously in the
thousands,'' said Anderson, now assistant police chief.
</P>
<P>
   The success of ''Red Flag-Green Flag People'' spawned an entire
line of educational materials for children about abuse. The center
now publishes more than a dozen story books and coloring books,
including one called ''Red Flag-Green Flag: ABCs of Personal
Safety'' for children as young as 3.
</P>
<P>
   The center also developed a line of videos on sexual abuse and
domestic violence, and a therapeutic board game for adult victims
of domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   The coloring books cost about $2 per copy. Diehl said the center
usually makes enough on product sales -- 60,000 coloring books last
year -- to pay for their production.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is something our board of directors truly believes in,''
Haseltine said. ''It has become a major part of our mission.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court: part-time workers who are hurt to get full-timebenefits  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Five years ago, Charles Scott got his left
hand caught in a machine at an Oaklyn bowling alley. The hand was
mangled badly enough to require three corrective surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   While recovering over the next two years, Scott was unable to
work for a few months. In 1997, this drove his family into poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Supreme Court last week ruled that the strange
circumstances that put Scott and his family into an impossible
financial squeeze should never have occurred and shall never occur
again.
</P>
<P>
   Bowling is a sport Scott had enjoyed since childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ''I grew up in a bowling alley,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Scott was not at Holiday Bowl for recreation on that
Saturday night in October, 1995. A copy-machine repair technician
by day, Scott had a second job as a part-time counter clerk and
bowling machine technician on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   He has worked at bowling alleys most of his adult life and still
does.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was on the job at Holiday Bowl when his hand was
mangled in a jammed pin-changing machine, Scott qualified for
workers compensation benefits, which paid a share of his
$208-a-week salary.
</P>
<P>
   And because he qualified for workers compensation benefits, his
full-time employer, Konica Business Machines, denied his claim for
Temporary Disability benefits when he was out of work in 1997
because of the third surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The company had given Scott medical leave after his injury and
two of the surgeries, but by 1997 it had been exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   The result was that for several months he had to support his
family on $146 a week -- a fifth of his ordinary income.
</P>
<P>
   His family was pressed into poverty. His wife had to apply for
food stamps to feed their two children. They could have faced
homelessness had their apartment landlord in Saddle Brook not given
them a few months' leeway.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was very bad times,'' Scott said. ''I didn't know if I
would be able to continue to work at all.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We did without a lot,'' said Carolyn Scott, his wife. ''The
kids had to wait a little longer for summer clothes. Thank God we
had good landlords.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the temporary disability law in place since 1948,
Konica was on solid legal ground.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Paul Schwartz said there have been thousands of cases
in which workers who are injured in side jobs were routinely denied
disability benefits by their full-time employers.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz said someone with a case like Scott's has never
succeeded with an appeal, and his case was no different. The Labor
Department's Board of Review turned him down on the grounds that
since he was getting payments already from Holiday Bowl, he was not
entitled to duplicate benefits from Konica. The fact that the
Holiday Bowl benefits covered only 20 percent of his usual income
was not a factor in judging the law.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled Konica should have honored
Scott's disability claim because it does not matter where he was
hurt. The court ordered Konica to pay him retroactive benefits of
about $4,500.
</P>
<P>
   In so ruling, the court fundamentally changed disability law
that had been in place 52 years, Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They took the case to make it clear that this was not the
intent of the Legislature,'' Schwartz said. ''Good cases can make
good law, and this was a perfect case. I could have picked a school
child and they could have won this argument.''
</P>
<P>
   The ironies in Scott's case were profound.
</P>
<P>
   Had he been injured mowing his lawn, repairing his car or
walking to his second job, Konica would have granted his claim for
temporary disability payments. Had he been bowling at Holiday Bowl
when he was hurt, Konica would have paid.
</P>
<P>
   But because he was working at Holiday Bowl at the time of the
injury, the claim was denied.
</P>
<P>
   ''In this day and age, a lot of people work more than one job.
There was a time I had three jobs,'' Scott said. ''I don't think
the law was taking that into account back in 1948.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz, who handled Scott's case for free, said the legal
defect should have been corrected years ago, but it was not the
sort of case lawyers were willing to bring to the appellate courts
because of the small sums involved.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I billed him $200 an hour for my work, I would be taking
all of his money and he would owe me money. This (case) was never
going to make anybody any money,'' Schwarz said. ''I took it up
because it was the right thing to do and it affects a lot of people
like Charles Scott, who are all our base clients, people who are
hurt on the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than write its own opinion, the unanimous court adopted
the appellate division ruling handled down last April by Judge
Edwin Stern.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can find neither logical support nor empirical evidence
that the Legislature intended to deprive a worker who pays
deductions for temporary disability benefits from obtaining those
benefits to compensate him for the loss of income at his full-time
employment merely because his injury occurred at a second or
part-time job taken to supplement that income,'' Stern wrote.

<HEADLINE> Bank cries foul over state ATM fee report  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Forgive Valley National Bank officials for
bristling at the notion that they charge among the highest ATM fees
in the state.
</P>
<P>
   That is, after all, what it says in the state's new Consumer
Guide to Bank Fees.
</P>
<P>
   What the guide does not say is that the bank charges $2 at only
nine of its machines. At the bank's other 111 machines in northern
New Jersey, the fee is $1.50 per transaction, about what many other
banks in the state charge for non-customers.
</P>
<P>
   It also fails to note that 50 cents of the fee at those nine
machines goes to state coffers. That's because those machines are
located at the Meadowlands and Monmouth Park racetracks, and the
bank pays the state to lease space at the state-operated tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman released the guide with much fanfare at a
news conference last week. The purpose of the guide is to educate
consumers about less expensive options in the banking industry, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Left unsaid was that the guide may also steer customers away
from banks that charge higher fees. According to the guide, one
such bank is Valley National.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone is aware that this is an extremely sensitive issue,''
said bank lobbyist Joe Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   It was misleading for the state to label the bank fees $2 across
the board, especially when the state gets a piece of the action, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd venture to say that a majority of our customers do not use
ATMs at the racetrack,'' Orlando said. ''The old woman who lives in
Wayne sees an article that says our ATM fee $2, but unless she has
a problem with the ponies, I don't think that's accurate.''
</P>
<P>
   State Banking and Insurance spokesman Bill Heine said the state
stands by its report.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the bank choses to pass that expense onto its customers,
that's the kind of information consumers need to know. That's why
we put it in the guide,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Heine said the state did place a footnote next to the $2
notation for Valley National Bank, explaining that its fees vary.
</P>
<P>
   ''How many people read footnotes?'' asked Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Bank officials did not volunteer specifics when filling out the
state questionnaire; they merely wrote that their fees range from
$1.50 to $2 depending on location, Heine countered.
</P>
<P>
   State officials chose to list the higher fee so consumers
wouldn't be surprised if they used one of the Valley National
machines that charges it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Sun National Bank had no apologies for being
one of the other four New Jersey banks the guide says charges
non-customers a $2 ATM fee.
</P>
<P>
   No one complains, said bank spokeswoman Allison Kruse.
</P>
<P>
   At the other two banks that the guides says charges $2, a woman
who answered the telephone at First Morris Bank and Trust declined
comment, and no one returned a phone message left with St. Edmond's
Federal Savings Bank.

<HEADLINE> Rationale for primary schedule is simple: There isn't any  </HEADLINE>
By WALTER R. MEARS, AP Special Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nobody designed the Armageddon of presidential
primaries coming up Tuesday. It just happened, because of
overlapping rules and overriding envy of the influence accorded the
states that vote sooner rather than later in campaigns to choose
White House nominees.
</P>
<P>
   And because presidential nominees are chosen in contests with as
many rules and timetables as there are states. That's led to the
crush at the outset, the front-loading, as politicians call it.
</P>
<P>
   There is no plan involved in what should be the most careful of
talent searches.
</P>
<P>
   So 16 of the 50 will be voting this week, probably settling the
Democratic campaign in favor of Vice President Al Gore, while
determining whether he will be facing George W. Bush for the White
House or watching, as the Democrats hope, while the governor and
Arizona Sen. John McCain struggle on.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, the system that isn't a system may determine the
Republican nominee a week later, when six more states vote. For the
Republicans, that's 19 elections on successive Tuesdays, for 954 of
the 1,034 delegates needed to win the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is the unintended consequence of political reforms
written 30 years ago by the Democrats, fostering primaries as the
fairest way to take nominations out of the hands of party leaders
and put the voters in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen states had presidential primaries in 1968. Forty-three
have them this year, and 90 percent of nominating delegates will be
chosen that way.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast that with John F. Kennedy's nomination in 1960; he ran
in seven primaries to prove his ability to win elections far from
his Massachusetts base, and victories over Hubert H. Humphrey in
two of them -- Wisconsin and West Virginia -- proved his point.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, Humphrey was the Democratic nominee, without
running in a single primary. By 1972, Democratic commissions had
written new rules to broaden the process. Delegates chosen by
insiders were subject to challenge at the national convention, and
the primary boom had begun.
</P>
<P>
   Now both parties have commissions trying to figure out how to
manage it. The National Association of Secretaries of State is
seeking a system of regional primaries phased over four months.
There's a proposal in Congress to do much the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals like those, and others, for a national primary, for
designated primary dates, and for party restraints on state
attempts to leapfrog ahead in the calendar, all have been debated
for years. But attention spans are short; once the nominees are set
-- usually at least five months before the conventions that ratify
the primaries -- the focus turns to the general election.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anyone looking at the current system knows it has to change,''
said Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., co-sponsoring a regional
primary bill with Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash. ''I hope that we can
make that happen before the 2004 campaign begins.''
</P>
<P>
   But to make it happen nationally, Congress would have to
override states' control of their own election laws. And for the
parties to impose changes in 2004, they'll have to settle on
changes at their 2000 conventions. Neither is likely.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats tried with a rule forbidding delegate selection
until March 7, except in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire
primary, leadoff states by tradition and determination to defend
that role. That produced the five-week drought in Democratic
competition that ends Tuesday. The Republicans had five contests --
three of which Bush won -- during those weeks.
</P>
<P>
   But in most cases, the states that write the primary schedule do
it for both parties. Hence the Republican primary pileup on
Tuesday, too.
</P>
<P>
   The mega-primary of the mega-election day is California's, which
used to be last but moved up for influence in the 1996 nominating
campaign and saw everything settled for Bob Dole before the earlier
date. So it was moved up again, to the first day Democrats allow.
</P>
<P>
   It also got more complicated when a referendum created a
California primary neither party would tolerate, putting the
candidates of both and of minor parties on the same ballot. To pry
that apart, the Legislature set up separate counts for Republicans
and Democrats to award the state's nominating delegates. That opens
the possibility that one candidate could win the preference vote --
McCain thinks he will -- while another, Bush, wins all the delegates
in the GOP-only count. ''If there's a split decision, that's going
to have to be a debate that takes place within the Republican
Party,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   That primary system is under challenge in court; on April 24,
the Supreme Court will hear arguments on an appeal seeking to
overturn the all-candidate primary system, so that each party can
choose its own nominees.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's campaign went to court in New York to get him on the
primary ballot by overruling complex petition requirements that
kept state GOP leaders, who back Bush, in control of the process.
McCain won, and he's on.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said in a campaign debate Wednesday night that an overhaul
of the schedule should be considered.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe it would make more sense to have four regional primaries
once a month and have a focus on issues,'' Bradley said. He added
an apt appraisal of the current way:
</P>
<P>
   ''Sure, these primaries are a bit idiosyncratic,'' he said.
''Who knows what's the rationale for when they occur. ...''
</P>
<P>
   There isn't any.

<HEADLINE> Experts: Early Intervention Needed  </HEADLINE>
By NEDRA PICKLER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT MORRIS TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- In communities across the
country, there are children like the 6-year-old boy accused of
fatally shooting a little girl in their first-grade classroom.
</P>
<P>
   They don't have stable families to read them bedtime stories,
make sure they are doing their homework or teach them to play ball.
Some are abused or neglected and they may become angry at being
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   It's these children, a number of experts say, who are likely to
turn to trouble as they get older -- and unlikely to get help when
it can make the most difference: before they break the law.
</P>
<P>
   ''By the time they get to us, it's too late,'' said Warden David
Trippett of the Michigan Youth Correctional Facility.
</P>
<P>
   What's needed, say many juvenile justice specialists, isn't a
get-tough approach, popular in many states, but much earlier
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Brendtro of Traverse City, a researcher and writer on
troubled children, says school officials increasingly are
recognizing such a need.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the mistakes is to assume that since the parents are
screwed up, there is nothing that we can do. That is 180 degrees
wrong,'' said Brendtro, a member of Attorney General Janet Reno's
Coordinating Council on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency
Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the family has problems, the school has even more potential
for positive input.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Mount Morris Township boy accused of killing
classmate Kayla Rolland on Tuesday, his father was in jail, and
after his mother was evicted, he was sent to live in what was
described as a chaotic flophouse where guns and drugs were found.
</P>
<P>
   George Economy is among many juvenile court judges who say
children need help long before they reach the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''Where we as a society is making a tragic mistake is that we
are building punk prisons and jails when we should be taking those
millions of dollars early on when programs can make a difference,''
said Economy, an Ingham County Probate Court judge.
</P>
<P>
   ''The first level of responsibility lies with school,'' said
John Seita, program director for Kellogg Youth Initiative
Partnerships, which helps several Michigan communities better use
their resources for young people.
</P>
<P>
   Programs to spot and help troubled youngsters have become more
common in upper grades, but experts say there aren't many such
programs in elementary schools.
</P>
<P>
   One was getting under way just this year in Mount Morris
Township when Kayla was shot to death.
</P>
<P>
   The boy accused of shooting her had been identified as needing
help, said district Superintendent Ira Rutherford. He wouldn't
discuss his treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Charlevoix-Emmet Intermediate School District
also are trying to help troubled children earlier. The district has
created a separate K-12 facility where about 40 severely troubled
students get intensive care from educators, a psychiatrist and
social workers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will save hundreds of thousands of dollars in the
future,'' said school district Superintendent Mark Eckhardt. ''But
more important it will help save their lives and turn them
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the solution, Eckhardt said, involves just caring and
listening.
</P>
<P>
   ''If every kid had one person -- I don't care if it's the
teacher, the bus driver, the cook, the custodian or the principal --
we wouldn't have the problems we have now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Seita of the Kellogg Youth Initiative Partnerships believes
schools should be more aggressive in referring troubled children to
state agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Seita, who was removed from his mother's home when he was 8 and
spent seven years at a facility for delinquents, believes some
parents simply don't have the necessary skills to raise their
children.
</P>
<P>
   ''So many kids that are in a position of disadvantage don't have
a sense of standards,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the facility where he was sent, ''I learned about justice and
fair play and goals and dreams. I had a sense of hope.''

<HEADLINE> Kosovars Return Amid Uncertainty  </HEADLINE>
By DANICA KIRKA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Hasan and Hanife Jashari
snuggled on their sofa for the first time in three weeks, after
NATO peacekeepers spirited them home in a daring stand to begin
healing this ethnically divided Kosovo town.
</P>
<P>
   But the view from the front window of their high-rise apartment
is different now. They look down and see barbed wire, French flags,
armored personnel carriers and Greek troops.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm in prison,'' Hasan Jashari said.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeepers escorted the Jasharis and 39 other ethnic Albanians
to their homes Friday in the Serb-controlled part of town, north of
the Ibar River -- but it took tear gas and stun grenades to clear a
path through rioting Serbs who oppose the move.
</P>
<P>
   Now that they are home, families like the Jasharis are wondering
what to do next. Despite the chaos below, the two 70-year-old
pensioners were so eager to return that they made few provisions as
to how they would even manage to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's flour,'' Hasan Jashari said. ''We will make do.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a few floors down, Dragomir Vorkapic is also baffled at
what the future may bring. The 57-year-old Serb, who spent much of
his life as a supervisor at the local gold and silver mines, has
sent his family away. He is holed up in his home, uncertain and
afraid that he could ever live in peace the way he once did.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not an answer,'' he said, referring to the armed-camp
atmosphere that now exists in his apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   Building residents described their homes as once being among the
finest in Kosovska Mitrovica. The apartments were granted to mine
employees who worked the rich pits that once made this city
relatively prosperous. Not only did all the neighbors know each
other, they worked together all their lives.
</P>
<P>
   But then came the conflict that has torn this province apart for
the last several years.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of ethnic Albanians were killed by Serb forces during
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's 18-month crackdown against
Kosovo separatists. After NATO bombing forced the Serb troops to
withdraw last spring, ethnic Albanians began attacking Serbs in
revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, attacks and killings have been regular occurrences
here. And with so many Serbs and ethnic Albanians living in the
same community, Kosovska Mitrovica is the most violence-prone city
in the province.
</P>
<P>
   Now the lifelong friends in this apartment building say they are
afraid of one another -- afraid to open their door to those they
feel they can no longer trust. Instead they look to the French
outside their windows, hoping that they might create a sense of
security in a city where there is none.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would rather die here than be in someone else's house,''
Hasan Jashari said.
</P>
<P>
   Hasan, who with his wife returned home Friday in a French
armored personnel carrier, said he trusted the soldiers and hoped
they might make life in Mitrovica possible again.
</P>
<P>
   ''But if they don't take care of us, it's better that they just
drive us out again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Security is likely to be elusive in Kosovska Mitrovica. French
peacekeepers said Saturday they were abandoning plans to move more
ethnic Albanians to the north side of town, apparently because
there were no volunteers after Friday's Serb defiance.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, U.N. officials said they planned next week to start
sending home Serbs who were locked out of the southern, mostly
Albanian part of the city. Such an action, especially now, is
likely to prove inflammatory.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. spokesman, Peter Biro, said it was ''important to show
that we are determined to keep the city open.''
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point it is a little bit delicate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Families like the Jasharis know that all too well, but feel they
have no choice but to find a way to survive here.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I had anywhere to go,'' Hasan said, ''I would.''

<HEADLINE> Nigeria United Despite Divisions  </HEADLINE>
By TIM SULLIVAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   KADUNA, Nigeria (AP) -- Nigeria's divisions are legion: Christian
vs. Muslim, northerner vs. southerner, the people of the Niger
Delta vs. oil companies, the masses of unemployed young people vs.
anyone with money.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these conflicts, and others, have exploded into violence
in recent months, leaving thousands of people dead. Despite its
transition to democracy last year, Africa's most populous nation
remains a deeply fragile country that is capable of horrific
bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet somehow, Nigeria keeps holding together.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two weeks, Christian-Muslim violence shifted back
and forth across Nigeria in a cycle of attack-and-revenge -- the
worst bloodletting since the country's civil war ended three
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   In this northern city where the fighting began, entire
neighborhoods were destroyed. Some officials say more than 2,000
people were killed in the violence, touched off by Christian
demonstrations against a proposal to bring sharia, or Islamic law,
to Kaduna state.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two weeks later, thousands of refugees across the country
still live in army barracks and police stations, fearing further
attacks. While many leaders in the overwhelmingly Muslim north have
agreed to pull back from their demands for sharia, the tension
continues to fester.
</P>
<P>
   If sharia was the match that ignited the fighting, there was
already plenty of kindling. In Nigeria, problems build on top of
one another -- religion twisted with ethnicity and geography, all
magnified by desperate poverty, a history of corrupt politics and a
lack of effective policing.
</P>
<P>
   So when one problem flares, it can draw in others, spiraling
into outright combat and pushing Nigeria, yet again, to what seems
like the brink of complete collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting over sharia cut across Nigeria's many divisions.
While on the surface it is a battle over religion, it also
reflected ethnic and geographic rancor. Northerners, nearly all of
them Muslims of the Hausa tribe, were fighting Christian
southerners, who are mainly Ibo and Yoruba.
</P>
<P>
   In the South, the demand for sharia is widely viewed as part of
a northern plot to ignite violence -- and give the military an
excuse to seize power again.
</P>
<P>
   Northerners, whose domination of the military gave them enormous
power during 15 years of army rule, have lost much of their
influence since last year's transition to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The government lacks control here. Nigerian police are
notoriously ill-trained, known more for demanding bribes than
anything else. Many don't even have fuel for their vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   When major trouble does start, there are few ways to quell it
until the full weight of the army -- regularly chastised by rights
groups for its brutal methods -- is called in.
</P>
<P>
   ''That kind of explosion just tells you the level of frustration
that has built up,'' Rev. Matthew Kukah, secretary general of the
Catholic Secretariat and a keen political observer, said of the
Kaduna violence. ''It's just a mindless orgy of violence that you
can't explain.''
</P>
<P>
   For some Nigerians, the answer to these problems is division.
Many Yoruba nationalists want the country split into semiautonomous
regions, as it was after independence in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria, like many African states, is an unlikely country.
Patched together by British colonialists, it combines hundreds of
ethnicities and languages in a territory that stretches from
jungle-covered hills to the dry sands of the Sahel.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, there would be little to unite Nigerians. But
few people here want to see their country dismembered, and a deep
strain of pride runs through the divided nation.
</P>
<P>
   For all its problems, Nigeria is still the dominant country in
the region. Nigerian-led peacekeepers helped end civil wars in
Liberia and Sierra Leone, Nigerian oil money fuels businesses
across West Africa and -- not unimportantly in a soccer-mad
continent -- Nigeria's national team is among the best in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've come a long way to consider going our separate ways
now,'' said Enema Oguchuku, an aide to President Olusegun Obasanjo.
''No generation of Nigerians would like to be associated with the
breakup of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of a man named James, one of the few Christian Hausas,
exemplifies the complications, the violence and the informal safety
net that coexist in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   James, who didn't want to give his last name, was attacked by
mobs of unemployed young Ibo men during revenge attacks --
supposedly against Muslims -- in the southeastern village where he
was living. As James and the other Hausas ran in terror, their Ibo
neighbors slipped past the mob to smuggle them to the safety.
</P>
<P>
   Fully understanding the irony -- a Christian attacked by
Christians and saved by Muslims in a nation torn by religious
battles -- James refuses to give up on his country.
</P>
<P>
   ''We live together now and we will still live together,'' he
said. ''We need one Nigeria.''

<HEADLINE> Encyclopedia and Web site trace history, culture of blacks  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Some news from the virtual grapevine: The work
that black slaves did in America would be worth more than $1
trillion in today's money.
</P>
<P>
   That's just one fact flying through cyberspace on a new Web site
-- Africana.com -- which aims to be a live forum linking blacks
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ''The grapevine is of huge importance to the black community,
since historically we were excluded from the mainstream media,''
says Henry Louis Gates Jr., the site's cofounder and head of
Harvard University's African-American studies department.
</P>
<P>
   ''A Web site with black content is the new place to 'hang
out,''' he says. ''It's a talking drum for the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   Africana.com is an educational portal that offers a black
perspective on everything from the daily news, history and the arts
to practical advice -- like how to make it in business or manage
your hair.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the site can share views, and differences, in online
discussions, sign up for free e-mail or buy books and music. And
they can listen to 80 radio stations in places from Benin in
Africa, and Guadeloupe in the Caribbean, to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't advocate anything, we don't tell you how to be
black,'' says Gates. ''We want to help raise a healthy black
community, by addressing concerns about health, wealth, love.''
</P>
<P>
   The site was launched to accompany a new 2,095-page book called
Africana -- billed as the most complete record of Africa and the
black diaspora in one volume. A parallel CD-ROM is called Encarta
Africana.
</P>
<P>
   The book realizes the dream of civil rights pioneer W.E.B.
DuBois, himself a Harvard alumnus. By the time he died in Ghana in
1963, he had sketched the beginnings of the encyclopedia.
</P>
<P>
   Then Gates came along, equipped with a brainy Rolodex, the
Internet and millions of dollars in capital.
</P>
<P>
   He is a practical dreamer: The company that runs the Web site is
for-profit. Its president, Darrol Roberts, is a marketing expert
who once worked for Reebok. With Gates' help, he hopes to raise $15
million this year from investors and keep the site
advertising-free. However, sponsors are promised online
acknowledgment and items sold on the Web contribute to profits.
</P>
<P>
   High-power and high-tech, the project is a far throw from
ancient Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Gates' chief business partners are a fellow Harvard professor,
Ghanaian-born philosopher Kwami Anthony Appiah, and Harry Lasker
III, a designer of educational media who helped create ''Sesame
Street.'' Music mogul Quincy Jones chipped in money, too. (By the
way, the encyclopedia reveals, his middle name is Delight.)
</P>
<P>
   The need for a special ''black'' Web site points to a new racial
problem linked to the Internet -- failure of blacks to match whites
in digital literacy.
</P>
<P>
   Among America's 35 million blacks, far fewer households use the
Internet than the general population -- about 11 percent compared to
26 percent in general, according to Commerce Department figures.
And the 700 million blacks in Africa presumably have even less
access.
</P>
<P>
   With Africana.com, ''we want the black content to inspire people
to log on and learn,'' says Roberts. ''We want to be a digital
bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   Africana.com is in the process of hiring 50 people to staff its
offices in Cambridge, Mass. Their goal reaches beyond the Internet
-- to try to close the gap between America's plugged-in blacks and
those with meager financial and educational resources.
</P>
<P>
   With that aim, the site offers free lesson plans for teachers
based on entries from the encyclopedia.
</P>
<P>
   The lessons will go to schools ''with white kids and yellow kids
and brown kids and black kids and change the landscape of what they
take for granted about how the world works,'' says Appiah.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of encyclopedias and CD-ROMS have been donated to
schools across the United States through individual and corporate
grants. And a copy of the printed encyclopedia will be donated to
every library in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Africana also will tap traditional black markets by setting up
sites in churches and mosques.
</P>
<P>
   ''Black people meet more in churches than anyplace else, as a
group,'' says Gates, ''And there, you'll have a minister saying,
'This is important to you, your future, your economic life, your
children. We know you've got a big 36-inch television. Now get a
little computer.'''
</P>
<P>
   With his presence on television and the media, Gates' star power
has drawn a lineup of expert commentators like Nobel Prize-winning
Nigerian novelist Wole Soyinka; Benjamin Carson, a Johns Hopkins
Hospital neurosurgeon and innovator in separating Siamese twins;
feminist critic Bell Hooks; and personal trainer Roberta Leonard.
</P>
<P>
   But Gates, a 49-year-old academic who grew up in a West Virginia
working-class family, also has drawn the disdain of some of the
black intelligentsia -- as an elitist whose Harvard department once
was dubbed the ''Cotton Club on the Charles'' by the Rev. Eugene
Rivers, a Boston-based activist.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers has now signed up as a commentator on the Web site. And a
Boston court is sentencing troubled youth to attend a pilot
Africana program in Rivers' church.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, Africana.com is both highbrow and popular.
</P>
<P>
   It spotlights public figures from 18th century
inventor-astronomer Benjamin Banneker to today's athletes and
rappers, offers advice on daily concerns from health and careers to
fashion, cooking and parenthood, and displays art from historically
black colleges in an online ''gallery.''
</P>
<P>
   Both site and encyclopedia span Africa-rooted cultures in the
Americas, the Caribbean, Europe and Asia. Topics range from ancient
African kingdoms to the continent's modern dictatorships, from a
17th century Brazilian state created by runaway slaves to
contemporary black Jews in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gates was surprised by some of what he learned: ''Many of
the pallbearers in Peru are black people. I had no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to slavery, there's no mincing words: African
blacks helped sell and ship slaves to America and other parts of
the world, according to the Web site. It also posts a scathing
attack on Gates for mentioning this fact in a public television
program. Gates responds online.
</P>
<P>
   Another entry touts the best-selling book ''The Debt: What
America Owes to Blacks,'' by activist attorney Randall Robinson,
who calculated the $1.4 trillion figure as the total value of slave
labor.
</P>
<P>
   A year old, Africana.com claims a half million ''hits'' a month.
Still, it has some strong black-centric competition, including
BlackVoices.com, known for its chat groups and job referrals and
owned by the powerful Tribune Co., and NetNoir.com, heavy with
celebrity interviews and partly owned by America Online.
</P>
<P>
   But the weighty printed encyclopedia, despite some errors in its
first edition and a list price of $100 -- often discounted -- has
little competition in bookstores for the sheer amount and range of
information.
</P>
<P>
   Co-edited by Appiah and Gates, the entries are signed by 220
contributors, and balanced is sought on controversial topics. For
instance, the Nation of Islam's Louis Farrakhan is described as an
African-American religious leader who advocates black
self-sufficiency but has been criticized for ''anti-Semitic
statements.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very important to us that the heart of this is telling
the truth, and it's not just cheerleading,'' says Appiah. ''The
truth includes the 10 million AIDS orphans in Africa -- and
Farrakhan.''

<HEADLINE> Penn Station's clicking, old train board shunted aside  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN M. HUBBELL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The boxy black sign is holding all of them
captive -- the lovelocked couples, the weary commuters, the students
heading home.
</P>
<P>
   It's afternoon in Penn Station. The day's pace is quickening,
more trains are pulling out. Yet under the departure board at its
center, an attentive stillness dominates a patch of shiny linoleum
as passengers await the sign's message.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Herriott, the station announcer, disrupts the calm with
an upbeat ''All aboard!'' The board's domino rows of white-on-black
letters click through the alphabet before the name and track number
of a departing train appear, and travelers rush to get aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Now the board, too, is departing -- a casualty of increasing rail
traffic in Amtrak's burgeoning Northeast corridor. A gleaming,
digital sign, already hanging nearby, should be switched on
sometime this month.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's called technological advancement,'' Herriott says,
laughing in the booth where she commands the sign, known as the
''Solari'' from the name of its Italian manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   The upgrade doesn't faze Herriott -- she'll run the new sign, too
-- except the replacement board can speak. Just how much it will say
is uncertain, but Amtrak officials note that ''All aboard,'' now
Herriot's domain, could be part of its vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to know how many passengers have stood watching
the Solari since 1966, when it replaced an older, similar sign. But
500,000 people pass through Penn Station each day, many departing
on the 1,000 daily trains.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the sign's disappearance will mean another bit of the
past gone, like replacing ham and eggs in Carolina with a breakfast
biscuit sealed in cellophane.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's kind of mesmerizing to watch the letters click to their
next destination,'' said Joe Mitchell, 33, waiting to leave for
Wilmington, Del. ''It's certainly an impression I get every time I
come here.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing nearby as the Solari whirred above, Vanessa Pagan, 21,
a Rutgers University student, said she likes ''the noise it makes,
and trying to decide what's going on next.''
</P>
<P>
   ''When I saw that they were making something new -- well, I don't
know,'' Pagan said. New Yorkers, she said, have ''the subway sound,
you have the bus sound -- and you have that sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the frequent, near-musical clicks are themselves testimony
for change.
</P>
<P>
   With trains leaving more quickly than the Solari can display
them, the board is ''starting to get past its lifetime,'' said John
Roseen, Amtrak's manager of customer service. ''When we get into
the rush hour, we start running out of room on the board.''
</P>
<P>
   The new, $300,000 digital board can display 16 trains at once,
plus service announcements, all in big, colored letters. The Solari
shows only eight trains.
</P>
<P>
   Other Solaris remain in use elsewhere, including Boston station.
Roseen isn't sure where the Penn Station sign is headed -- maybe
another station, a museum, a back lot.
</P>
<P>
   Some Penn Station workers see the Solari as part of their role
in life, a symbol that train travel is somehow more personal, more
human.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are everything here, from psychiatrists to information
people to doctors,'' said Karen Robinson, an Amtrak employee for 21
years. ''The whole feeling of the station is changing, and the
board is something that is going along with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Herriott hopes the new, voice-programmable sign won't add to the
colder world she sees hurrying past. One memory sticks with her as
the worst of modern life: A man suffered a heart attack by the
board, and impatient travelers rushed past, some even jumping over
the prone figure.
</P>
<P>
   ''That'd be a bad way to go out -- to die in Penn Station,'' said
Herriott, 44.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Penn Station announcer Daniel Simmons Jr. understands
the personal touch in train travel but says time can't stand still
-- even if it feels that way waiting for a train.
</P>
<P>
   ''Automation -- you can't stop it,'' said Simmons, 73, from his
home in Delran, N.J. Retired since 1994, he still recalls sometimes
getting applause from travelers as he sang out the destinations of
departing trains.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd put more step in their pep,'' he said, ''because I'd be
rappin'.''
</P>
<P>
   Simmons hopes some personality will linger at Penn Station after
the Solari is gone. Not everyone, he said, comes to a train station
just to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ''I used to have a little old lady who would get off of work at
eight or nine o'clock and stand there and look at me for a
half-hour, just listening to me,'' he remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ''Then she would throw me a kiss, and say goodnight, and go
home.''

<HEADLINE> McCain's Main Guy: A grandpa who would cut your heart out -- andsmile  </HEADLINE>
By JUDIE GLAVE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Guy Molinari is a small, bespectacled man with a
healthy shock of white hair and a smile that is a tad devilish. He
has a grandfatherly aura that immediately puts people at ease.
</P>
<P>
   But don't mistake the man Republican hopeful John McCain has
chosen for his New York state campaign chairman as an easy mark.
</P>
<P>
   ''That grandfather would cut your heart out and leave it on the
table with that same sweet grandpa smile and demeanor,'' said
William Powers, chairman of the state GOP.
</P>
<P>
   And Powers, who has known Molinari for 25 years, considers
himself a friend, despite their recent differences. Powers is
backing Texas Gov. George W. Bush in the GOP race for president.
</P>
<P>
   Even McCain alluded to Molinari's take-no-prisoners political
style, telling reporters at a December news conference: ''There's
no doubt in my mind, anyone who crosses Guy Molinari does so at
great risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Though McCain laughed when he said it, Molinari's 25-year
political record, including six years as a state assemblyman, nine
in Congress and 10 as Staten Island borough president, backs up
that view.
</P>
<P>
   It surprises no one that the 71-year-old Molinari finds himself
in deep GOP cold storage these days after switching to the McCain
camp.
</P>
<P>
   Political analyst Jay Severin said Molinari has caught the ire
of his own party so many times that if the dictionary had an entry
for the words ''buck the party'' it would simply say: Guy Molinari.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a maverick before being a maverick was cool,'' said
Severin.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's raising the ire of President Ronald Reagan over a
bill to rehire fired air traffic controllers, or crossing party
lines to endorse Democrats, Molinari's ''political derring-do'' --
as Severin calls it -- has repeatedly gotten him in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Molinari, who is both conservative and Catholic,
advocated executing doctors who perform late-term abortions. He
also referred to one Democratic candidate for state office as unfit
for office because she was a lesbian.
</P>
<P>
   Former New York Mayor Ed Koch, who clashed frequently with
Molinari when in office, says Molinari is the kind of politician
''who likes to go for the jugular'' and ''throws his weight
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Molinari's political, pit bull personality comes in large part
from his roots.
</P>
<P>
   Coming from the city's least-populated and most suburban
borough, he has had to fight to get Staten Island's point of view
across in vastly larger -- and mostly Democratic-run -- New York.
</P>
<P>
   And whether its fighting to close the mammoth 3,000-acre Fresh
Kills landfill or presiding over a local spelling bee, he does it
with unmatched passion.
</P>
<P>
   ''The people love him out there,'' said Koch. ''He could be
borough president for life'' -- if not for term limits which will
force him out of office at the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Even Koch admits having a grudging respect for his old
adversary. ''He's got political street smarts. He's got courage.
He's got chutzpah,'' Koch said.
</P>
<P>
   That much was evident last fall when Molinari announced he was
backing McCain. The defection seemed even more treacherous since
Molinari chaired George Bush Sr.'s New York presidential campaign
in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Molinari, interviewed last week at his Staten Island office,
said it wasn't an easy decision to make. ''In the end, it's gotta
be who you believe in,'' Molinari said, speaking softly, in a voice
that carries just a tinge of New Yawkese.
</P>
<P>
   Backstage rumblings said Molinari was irked at being left out of
an early appearance by Gov. George W. Bush in New York. Others
believe it was the result of a power struggle with aides to Gov.
George Pataki, Bush's state campaign chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Molinari said neither is true. ''I had already considered
endorsing McCain and I don't care if anyone believes that or not.''
</P>
<P>
   The fallout led to an anti-Molinari chill that stretched from
Albany -- where his relationship with Pataki has broken down -- to
his own backyard. Molinari had expected some local Republicans he
helped get elected to follow him, but no one did.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Long Island Rep. Peter King, Molinari is the only
well-known state Republican backing McCain. Even his daughter and
son-in-law, ex-Reps. Susan Molinari and Bill Paxton, are Bush
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's fine. I don't have a problem with that,'' Molinari
said. But he said he does have a problem with Bush's people using
arm-twisting to get others not to support McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ''People should be able to back the person they think is right
for the job,'' he said. ''It's as simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP officials deny they've used pressure to block switches to
McCain. But it's hard to deny the Republican chill toward Molinari,
especially after he led a court battle that got McCain on Tuesday's
primary ballot in all 31 districts over state GOP opposition.
</P>
<P>
   One New York Times story about Molinari, headlined ''The
Patriarch as Pariah,'' quoted anonymous Republican sources as
calling him both a hypocrite and a has-been.
</P>
<P>
   ''What it really means is that you're a player,'' Molinari said,
shrugging off the pariah label. ''In a perverse kind of way, I take
it as a compliment.''
</P>
<P>
   Severin, who hosts a radio talk show and analyzes politics at
NBC's Web site, believes Molinari's battle for McCain ''is probably
the biggest role of the dice for him.'' If he loses, he may have
permanently damaged his Republican powerbase.
</P>
<P>
   If McCain wins in New York, he said Molinari will have the
shiniest shoulders in town ''from the arms of all the Republican
pols who will be draping them around him, reminding him what good
buddies they've always been.''
</P>
<P>
   Molinari, who was treated for prostate cancer nearly three years
ago and still suffers from a car accident, has been drained by the
political infighting.
</P>
<P>
   He talks of curtailing his involvement in GOP politics, but says
he still expects to campaign for Republican ally Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani in the upcoming U.S. Senate race and to help select his
own successor as borough president.
</P>
<P>
   After that, he says, all he wants to do is play grandpa to
granddaughters, Susan, 3, and Katherine, 1, who live just outside
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   But would he give up politics even if McCain won, Molinari is
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ''Vice president,'' he says pointing to himself, joking. But
with the unpredictable Molinari, who knows?

<HEADLINE> Diana Bodyguard Wishes He Had Died  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The sole survivor of the car crash that killed
Princess Diana says he wishes he had died instead.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Rees-Jones said in an interview with The Daily Telegraph,
published Saturday, that he feels haunted by the Aug. 30, 1997,
crash. Diana, her boyfriend Dodi Fayed and driver Henri Paul were
killed. Rees-Jones, her bodyguard, was severely injured.
</P>
<P>
   Tests showed that Paul's blood alcohol level was more than three
times the legal limit, and he had taken prescription drugs
including the antidepressant Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I could have died and those three survived, I would have
done it,'' Rees-Jones said. ''If I could have done something ... I
go mad thinking about 'if onlys.'''
</P>

   The Daily Telegraph will serialize excerpts from Rees-Jones' new
book, ''The Bodyguard's Story.''

<HEADLINE> Spice Upstaged by Former Member  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The Spice Girls said something nice about
ex-member Geri Halliwell at the annual Brit awards, only to be
upstaged by the former Ginger Spice's raunchy musical act.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting the Outstanding Contribution to British Music award
for the Spice Girls' worldwide sales of 35 million albums Friday,
''Scary Spice'' Mel G said: ''We've all got to say a big, big thank
you to Geri because without her we wouldn't be able to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Halliwell left the Spice Girls in May 1998, and her relations
with the four remaining members have been frosty.
</P>
<P>
   She emerged on stage from between a huge pair of inflatable
women's legs, then cavorted suggestively with a troupe of male
dancers. Her routine also featured four plump women pushing
trolleys and shopping for men, an apparent dig at her former group.

<HEADLINE> DeGeneres Avoiding Controversy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Comedian Ellen DeGeneres is getting laughs
from some non-controversial subjects these days. Shampoo bottles,
for example. Just who needs those instructions? And why is there an
800 number on the back?
</P>
<P>
   DeGeneres, who came out as a lesbian along with her lead
character on ''Ellen,'' the ABC sitcom canceled two years ago, says
she doesn't want to be viewed as a political symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Even though she gets the biggest response with references to her
sexuality, in her new standup material she's sticking mostly to
observational humor.
</P>
<P>
   ''The truth is, I've saved people's lives,'' DeGeneres told the
Los Angeles Times for Saturday's editions. ''But I'm really just a
comedian. That's all I am. So it's a very awkward place.
Everybody's got so many different expectations of me.''
</P>
<P>
   DeGeneres now has a pilot deal at CBS for a sitcom in which
she'll play the host of a sketch-variety show. She's also working
on an hourlong comedy special for HBO.

<HEADLINE> Madonna Isn't Sure About Marriage  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Madonna enjoys being in love again but isn't
sure she's ready for marriage.
</P>
<P>
   In the March 13 issue of People magazine, she calls her romance
with film director Guy Ritchie a ''serious relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the subject of marriage, she said: ''I don't know about
that. We'll cross that bridge when we get to it. If we get to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple met two years ago at a luncheon given by Sting's
wife, Trudie Styler. Their romance was rekindled when Madonna
returned to London last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna, who divorced actor Sean Penn in 1989, also acknowledges
she still has feelings for former boyfriend Carlos Leon, the father
of her 3-year-old daughter Lourdes.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people have implied that I used Carlos as a sperm
donor,'' she said. ''But I had had a relationship with him for two
years, and we had discussed having children. ... I had a baby with
somebody I loved and still love, actually.''

<HEADLINE> Woodward: Tough To Give Up Career  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Joanne Woodward admits it was tough to put her
career on hold to focus on child-raising while husband Paul
Newman's career was flourishing in the early years of their 42-year
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ''My life was a frenzy of diapers and bottles and scripts and
half-sorted clothes,'' she says in the April issue of More
magazine. ''I was constantly going off in different directions,
trying to be the best at everything.''
</P>
<P>
   She quit acting for a while after the couple's third child,
Clea, was born in 1965. Meanwhile, Newman was enjoying success in
films such as ''The Hustler'' and ''Hud.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I made a conscious choice to be less successful
than Paul was. It just happened, because of the nature of what I
was doing. But it was uncomfortable. How corny of me, to be worried
about professional competition!''

<HEADLINE> Romanian Ship in Danger in North Sea  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- A Romanian freighter was listing
sharply and in danger of capsizing in stormy conditions Saturday
off the Dutch North Sea coast, the Royal Coast Guard said.
</P>
<P>
   A Belgian Air Force helicopter plucked 11 of the 17 crew members
off the 6,000-ton Lugoj, which was listing at 30 degrees about 30
miles west of the shore point of Hoek van Holland, said coast guard
spokesman Peter van Oorschot.
</P>
<P>
   A Dutch chopper was standing by on a nearby oil platform to
collect the remaining crew members if necessary, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two tug boats managed to secure the distressed vessel and were
pulling it toward the shore in near gale-force winds and eight-foot
waves.
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman said an attempt to right to boat had been
abandoned because it was close to capsizing. He said the 700-foot
freighter, which was carrying metallic cinders, had ''problems with
the loading.''

<HEADLINE> New York GOP primary a test for Pataki team  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- While competing candidates George W. Bush
and John McCain stumped across New York on Saturday, Gov. George
Pataki also has much on the line in Tuesday's ''Super Tuesday''
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki is heading up Bush's New York campaign effort, a job that
once seemed like a plum and now has the possibility of turning into
a pumpkin for the New York governor.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when Pataki and almost all of New York's Republican
Party hierarchy lined up behind the Texas governor, polls showed
Bush running well ahead of every other Republican contender in New
York. That began to change after McCain trumped Bush in New
Hampshire's leadoff primary. Recent polls have McCain running
neck-and-neck with Bush in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush-Pataki team still appeared confident on Feb. 13 as the
Texas governor officially placed Pataki in charge of the New York
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''He knows New York and how to win,'' Bush said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know our team will reach out to every Republican voter to
deliver New York state for Governor Bush,'' Pataki boasted.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 22, the stakes grew bigger for Pataki as McCain beat
Bush in Michigan despite the support there for the Texas governor
from Gov. John Engler. Like New York, Bush had entrusted the
Michigan race to its governor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pataki has a real risk of being Englerized,'' Nelson Warfield,
a Republican operative who helped run Bob Dole's 1996 presidential
campaign and who knows New York politics well, said. ''If he is
seen as losing his state for Bush, that hurts him.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been some talk, mostly from his New York supporters,
of Pataki as a possible running mate for Bush. But that hinges
largely on a demonstration that the New York governor has at least
a chance of delivering his home state to the Republicans in
November. A loss to McCain's forces on Tuesday would do little to
enhance such thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Pataki has been eyeing running for a third term in 2002, a
campaign that could become more difficult in terms of fund raising
and maintaining party unity if a perception of weakness is created.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Tuesday's bar is set high for Pataki. In 1996, the New
York Republican organization delivered every delegate at stake in
the primary to Dole.
</P>
<P>
   But that was back when the New York GOP was still riding high.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Democrats turned Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and state
Attorney General Dennis Vacco out of office and last year the party
lost control of the Nassau County legislature, until then a Long
Island bastion of Republicanism.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the New York GOP suffered an embarrassment when it
lost a battle to use the state's arcane election rules to keep
McCain off the ballot. The move served to enhance McCain's
credentials as an insurgent.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Pataki seemed to be preparing for trouble on
''Super Tuesday,'' which he told reporters would be a ''difficult
fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed about whether the primary was also a referendum on the
New York GOP, Pataki bristled.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ultimately it comes down to the candidates ... Next Tuesday's
a referendum on George Bush and John McCain,'' Pataki said.
''That's what all elections are.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Pataki has had trouble even keeping the New York troops
in line.
</P>
<P>
   While Staten Island Borough President Guy Molinari was a leading
New York supporter of former President George Bush and an early
backer of the Texas governor's campaign, the former congressman
switched over late last year to McCain. Molinari now heads up
McCain's New York campaign along with U.S. Rep. Peter King of Long
Island, a Roman Catholic who deserted the younger Bush after his
visit to Bob Jones University where some officials have expressed
anti-Catholic views.
</P>
<P>
   And, just days ago, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who
has endorsed Bush, went public with his refusal to join a
Pataki-led effort to attack McCain's legislative record as
''anti-New York.'' The mayor, who is running for the U.S. Senate
against Hillary Rodham Clinton, said he admired McCain and looked
upon him as a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are some people, they want to demand that you get
involved in negative campaigning and they question your loyalty if
you won't do it,'' the mayor said Thursday in a slap at Pataki's
staff.
</P>
<P>
   McCain sent Giuliani a thank-you note.

   VALDOSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Air Force personnel rescued two people from
a ship hundreds of miles off the Atlantic coast after the men were
injured in an accident that killed a member of their crew.
</P>
<P>
   The two crewmen from the 465-foot, British-flagged petroleum
tanker Johann Schultewere were flown by helicopter Friday night to
a hospital in Hamilton, Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   One tanker crew member had been killed and four injured Thursday
while trying to secure an anchor in rough seas, said Lt. Col. Mike
Korcheck, operations officer for the 41st Rescue Squadron at Moody
Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-foot swells and 40-knot winds had been reported in the
area hundreds of miles east of Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   Two who were hurt remained on board the tanker and did not
require emergency medical care, said Korcheck.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force sent two helicopters and two C-130 cargo planes to
Bermuda on Thursday after the Coast Guard requested their
assistance.

<HEADLINE> Church Eyes Samba Group for Symbols  </HEADLINE>
By ANA A. LIMA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Working feverishly to get ready
for carnival, members of the popular samba group Unidos da Tijuca
were surprised this week by a visit from lawyers for Rio's Roman
Catholic archdiocese -- and police.
</P>
<P>
   After inspecting the group's parade floats, police seized an
iron cross and a panel depicting Our Lady of Good Hope. Directors
of the group were charged with mocking religious symbols, a crime
punishable by up to one year in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The group went to court to overturn the order, and eventually
the objects were returned and the charges dropped. But the run-in
heightened the uneasy relations between Catholicism and carnival --
two defining forces in Brazilian society.
</P>
<P>
   The annual carnival blowout, a bit like Mardi Gras on a grander
scale, is traditionally a time for Brazilians to drink and dance
the night away. The showpiece of the celebration is a two-day
parade of 14 neighborhood groups, each with ornate floats, a
brain-numbing 300-piece percussion section and up to 4,000 costumed
dancers.
</P>
<P>
   But the church has clashed with carnival's excesses before. And
the line between religious and profane became more blurred this
year when the Rio tourism board decided the carnival parade's theme
would be the 500th anniversary of the Portuguese arrival in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials say sacred symbols and dissolute partying
should not mix.
</P>
<P>
   ''They committed a thoughtless and crudeact,'' said Antonio
Passos, a lawyer for the archdiocese, said of the Unidos da Tijuca
floats. ''The offense is to bring a sacred symbol to parade with a
samba group in a festival that is absolutely profane.''
</P>
<P>
   But this year's theme has left carnival participants wondering:
How to depict the colonization of the world's largest Roman
Catholic country without mentioning the church?
</P>
<P>
   ''The discovery was made entirely by Catholicism,'' said Chico
Spinosa, the carnival designer for Unidos da Tijuca.
</P>
<P>
   Spinosa denied his group's float was offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you have fathers dancing, mothers dressed up ... and kids
participating in the children's group, then this is not a pagan and
pornographic party,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The church and carnival have clashed before. In 1989, Rio's
Cardinal Eugenio Sales went to court to ban a model of Rio's famous
Christ statue from a carnival float. With carnivalistic ingenuity,
the group that had designed the float ended up parading with the
statue wrapped in black plastic and a sign: ''Even though you are
banned, watch over us.''
</P>
<P>
   While police say they will not bar floats or costumes when the
carnival parades start Sunday, Passos and five other lawyers will
be on call throughout carnival to ensure that sacred images are
respected.
</P>
<P>
   Some Catholics said the Church is overreacting.
</P>
<P>
   ''Isn't this carnival?'' said Rio taxi driver Andre Duarte.
''What does one thing have to do with the other?''

<HEADLINE> Breast Cancer-Marrow Link Studied  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- A new study that casts doubt on the value of bone
marrow transplants for women with advanced breast cancer found no
difference in the survival rates of women who underwent the
procedure and those who had only chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. cancer officials had announced in early February that a
South African study which suggested positive results from the
transplant treatment was based on falsified data.
</P>
<P>
   In the new study, directed from the University of Pennsylvania
Cancer Center, researchers found that among women whose breast
cancer had spread, patients who received bone marrow transplants
and high doses of chemotherapy ''do not survive longer or have a
longer time to progression of the disease'' than patients who have
regular chemotherapy over a two-year period.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were set to be published in the New England Journal
of Medicine on April 13, but the journal released it Friday on its
Web site. The journal made its report available early because of
concern and confusion over the South African study, said Dr. Marcia
Angell, the journal's editor-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 199 patients took part in the latest study. After
three years, the researchers found no significant difference in the
survival of patients getting transplants plus high-dose
chemotherapy and those given only conventional dose chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   A co-author of the study, Dr. John K. Erban, chief of hematology
and oncology at New England Medical Center, said the transplant
treatment might be preferable for some women because it can be
completed in three weeks. He said the conventional regimen takes
two years and ''is unpalatable for some women.''
</P>
<P>
   Erban said it is possible that a small set of patients might
still be found who do better with the transplants.
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Marc E. Lippman of the
Lombardi Cancer Center in Washington, said doctors should
reconsider the way they treat women with advanced breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''This form of treatment for women with metastatic breast cancer
has been proved to be ineffective and should be abandoned in favor
of well-justified alternative experimental approaches,'' Lippman
wrote.

<HEADLINE> Burgers Recalled Due to Bacteria  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- A food distributor issued a recall Saturday for
its 6.5-ounce double cheeseburgers after tests found a bacteria
that can cause fatal infections in children and the elderly, a
federal official said.
</P>
<P>
   No illnesses have been reported in connection with the frozen
burgers produced by Regal Food Service of Houston, said Ruth Welch,
a spokeswoman for the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The cheeseburgers were distributed to convenience stores, truck
stops and vending machines in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Florida,
Mississippi, Arkansas and Alabama, Welch said.
</P>
<P>
   They were packaged in clear plastic containers and marked with a
four-digit code. All codes were recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Welch said FDA tests revealed the presence of the bacteria
Lysteria monocytogenes, which is frequently cited in food recalls.
Symptoms of infection include fever, severe headache, stiffness,
nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment from company president Don Dean.
Calls to his home on Saturday were not answered.

<HEADLINE> It's Mardi Gras Time in New Orleans  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN CLENDENNING, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Mardi Gras partiers swarmed the French
Quarter on Saturday and lined the city's streets to grab beads
thrown by strangely costumed people on parade floats.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the greatest party you've ever been to,'' said
70-year-old Jim Hennosy of Dublin, Ohio, as he downed a Guiness
beer at 11 a.m. at Molly's at the Market, a bar near Bourbon
Street. ''The whole place is partying, that's why we come down.''
</P>
<P>
   A few barstools away, Carolina Greene was wearing three strands
of multicolored beads and working on her third beer since 6 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm getting primed for whatever happens,'' said the
39-year-old lumber saleswoman from Tchula, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   The party will last in heavily Catholic southern Louisiana and
along much of the Gulf Coast until Mardi Gras, or Fat Tuesday,
traditionally the last day of feasting and celebration before Ash
Wednesday and the sacrifices of Lent.
</P>
<P>
   Lenten solemnity was the last thing on anyone's mind along
Bourbon Street, where an engineer at the Royal Sonesta hotel
dutifully spreads petroleum jelly every morning over the metal
posts holding up the wrought iron balconies overlooking one of the
French Quarter's busiest spots.
</P>
<P>
   ''Guests entice people in the crowd to come up,'' explained
hotel spokeswoman Jeannine Landry. ''But they fail miserably
because the poles are so slippery.''
</P>
<P>
   The hotel's ''greasing of the poles'' tradition has been going
on for 30 years and has caught on at other Bourbon Street buildings
with balconies packed with revelers.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of people are expected to visit the French
Quarter over the long weekend, and a million may watch the dozen or
so parades taking place around New Orleans and its suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Among the celebrities scheduled ride on parade floats: Whoopi
Goldberg, Luke Perry, New Orleans native Harry Connick Jr. and
Britney Spears.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism officials hope this Mardi Gras will be their biggest
yet. They say they're encouraged by forecasts of balmy weather and
a potentially big showing of college students coming to New Orleans
during spring break.
</P>
<P>
   Though posters have been plastered around the French Quarter
warning people against exposing themselves, police deny they are
cracking down on Carnival tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Drinking alcohol on the streets is legal and socially acceptable
in New Orleans, and Linda Duane took advantage of the opportunity
by having a beer for breakfast while watching the scene outside the
Mango daiquiri bar.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mardi Gras is craziness,'' said Duane, 38, of New York City.
''Everyone has to experience it once in their lifetime.''

<HEADLINE> German Party Contender Drops Out  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- The debate over who should lead Germany's
Christian Democrats out of the worst scandal in the party's history
narrowed Saturday, after one of the leading candidates said he was
dropping out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   Volker Ruehe, a former defense minister under ex-Chancellor
Helmut Kohl who had been a contender for party chairman, told the
Welt am Sonntag newspaper in a report to be published Sunday that
he would not vie for the post.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's conservatives have been publicly debating who will
replace Wolfgang Schaeuble as chairman since he announced last
month that he would resign. His resignation came after others in
the party questioned his handling of the scandal involving
off-the-books cash handovers, secret accounts abroad and illegal
financial reports.
</P>
<P>
   Ruehe was the party's losing candidate last weekend to be
governor of Schleswig-Holstein state. But he still had managed to
pull in a larger percentage of votes there than the Christian
Democrats were getting in national polls.
</P>
<P>
   The two main remaining candidates to head the party are
Secretary-General Angela Merkel, considered the front-runner, and
Kurt Biedenkopf, governor of the eastern state of Saxony. The party
leadership will decide its recommendation March 20, to be voted on
at a Christian Democrat convention in April.
</P>
<P>
   Merkel refused during a local party convention in Berlin on
Saturday to speak about the job, but received a warm reception.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main obstacles to her getting the post also appeared
to be fading.
</P>
<P>
   The arch-conservative sister party to the Christian Democrats,
the Bavaria-only Christian Social Union, had questioned whether
Merkel would turn away the more conservative members of the party.
A former East German, she has liberal views on immigration and
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   But in an interview to be published Sunday in Bild am Sonntag,
Bavarian governor and CSU party leader Edmund Stoiber said his
''advice for a strong anchor from the state level with a governor
in top leadership'' should not be interpreted as reservations
against Merkel's ability.
</P>
<P>
   Ruehe, however, spoke out for Biedenkopf, 70, in making his exit
from the leadership debate.
</P>
<P>
   ''With Kurt Biedenkopf, the concept of the future will be more
strongly connected than with some who are younger,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Merkel, 45, is a Kohl protege, but has been able to distance
herself from the statesman who led the party for 25 years, 16 as
chancellor. Biedenkopf is highly popular in his state for bringing
in outside investment and making it the most prosperous in the
former east.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a newspaper reported that Kohl plans to make an
appearance in the German parliament for the first time in months.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl has withdrawn from public life since the scandal broke
after he admitted accepting up to $1 million in donations from
sources he has refused to name, and he hasn't taken his parliament
seat since Nov. 24.
</P>
<P>
   The Leipziger Volkszeitung reported Saturday that Kohl plans to
return to the Bundestag on March 17 for a ceremony marking the 10th
anniversary of the vote that set the stage for Germany's
reunification.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, the embattled government of Hesse state survived
a test of confidence after the Free Democrat Party there voted to
stay in the ruling coalition with the Christian Democrats and not
demand the governor resign. Roland Koch has come under fire for
acknowledging that $750,000 in campaign money he declared as a loan
actually came from a state party slush fund.

<HEADLINE> Some Vignettes From the Campaigns  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John McCain double-fisting mouthfuls of gummy
bears and campaigning in front of a flag -- the Russian flag. The
very conservative Alan Keyes diving into a very liberal mosh pit.
Al Gore canoeing on an artificially swollen river.
</P>
<P>
   Selections for the nation's campaign scrapbook are many this
quirky presidential primary season.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an odd one: Americans lining up in large numbers, as if
for lottery tickets, to vote.
</P>
<P>
   The indelible images of the campaign were being made long before
most people were paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   Back in August, the Iowa air was swollen with ambition and
carnival-like celebration as eight men and one woman stood on a
stage together, each laying claim before a straw-poll crowd to the
Republican nomination. One by one they would exit that race -- one
exiting the party. And now there are three.
</P>
<P>
   Those early months were formative for the Democrats, too, a tale
told in Gore's choice of footwear.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa crowds noticed how his pants bunched below the knees from
the rims of cowboy boots, once Gore adopted a studied informality
for his campaign style.
</P>
<P>
   The previous summer, he'd gone canoeing with New Hampshire Gov.
Jeanne Shaheen in a sun-splashed show of solidarity. But there was
something wrong with that picture: A dam had released 4 billion
gallons so the VIPs would not get stuck.
</P>
<P>
   In the grip of winter, McCain stood outside the Russian
consulate in Manhattan as flurries fell and the flag flapped, and
declared Russia to be more democratic than New York. His protest
against state GOP rules keeping him off many ballots succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Mishaps, tender moments and memorable joinings of hands compete
for space in the scrapbook.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush got a proud embrace from his father, the former
president, in New Hampshire. ''My boy,'' the candidate's father
said. Republican rival Gary Bauer lost his balance while flipping
pancakes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush held the hand of former South Carolina Gov. David Beasley,
who held the hand of Bob Jones III, as they sang a hymn together at
the Christian fundamentalist college where Bush -- to his later
regret -- chose not to criticize the school's anti-Catholic dogma.
</P>
<P>
   Keyes found a support group of a different sort.
</P>
<P>
   On a dare and a promise from liberal filmmaker Michael Moore, he
went into Moore's mosh pit -- normally a group that catches a
performer who jumps off the stage.
</P>
<P>
   A fierce critic of cultural decline, Keyes was held aloft by a
variety of people, one with purple hair.
</P>
<P>
   Nominally keeping his promise to endorse the first candidate
into the pit, Moore sponsored two mocking ads on Keyes' behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Republican McCain and Democrat Bill Bradley reached across party
lines and shook hands in New Hampshire on campaign finance reform.
McCain and Bush shook hands in a Michigan debate over an agreement
not to run negative ads, not long before they ran negative ads.
</P>
<P>
   Gore tried to shake Bradley's hand on an offer to stop ads
altogether. ''I like that hand,'' Bradley said coldly. ''The answer
is no.''
</P>
<P>
   In more relaxed moments, Bradley, the former basketball star,
signed basketballs brought to him by supporters.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, more accessible than the rest, has produced more
striking images for the campaign scrapbook.
</P>
<P>
   Here's McCain munching his morning doughnut -- pink frosting
preferred -- with sprinkles.
</P>
<P>
   Here he is crossing Puget Sound in Washington state, getting his
picture snapped with the granddaughter of Teddy Roosevelt, a
president he so often invokes.
</P>
<P>
   Here he is approaching the shore at sunset, a crowd of 5,000
supporters, in silhouette, stretching up from the docks to the
crest of a hill.
</P>
<P>
   And finally -- for that day -- here he is curled up on a U-shaped
couch on his bus, waiting for the wheels on his plane to come
unstuck from the mud.
</P>
<P>
   The scrapbook might save a page, too, for Ruth McPherson, at 99
the oldest resident of Atkinson, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 27, she sat front row in her wheelchair, staring up at
McCain at a town hall meeting.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 1, the town police chief wheeled her into the voting
booth, where she cast her ballot for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've voted Republican all my life,'' she said, ''and I always
will.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for Gun Restrictions  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- President Clinton appealed to lawmakers
Saturday to reject ''the pressure tactics and the threats'' of the
gun lobby in anticipation of this week's White House meeting on
gun-safety legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In his weekly radio address, Clinton said he will push for a
requirement that handguns come with child safety locks, a ban on
importation of large-capacity ammunition clips and mandatory
background checks on handgun purchases at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Those are similar to provisions in a bill the Senate passed last
year on a tie-breaking vote by Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's meeting, Clinton said, he will insist that
lawmakers ''get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited the death last week of 6-year-old Kayla Rolland, killed
in Michigan by a 6-year-old classmate who brought a gun to school.
American children are killed by gun fire a rate nine times higher
than the combined total of the next 25 top industrial nations.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is intolerable, and we must act, because we can do
something about it,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee,
accused Clinton of exploiting the Michigan incident ''to score
political points for himself and Al Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, on a political fund-raising trip to California, the
address was the fourth time in a week that he criticized Congress
for failing to act on legislation he submitted after last year's
Columbine High School shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ''In a country of 270 million people, no law can stop every act
of gun violence. But we can't just throw up our hands as if gun
safety laws don't make a difference,'' Clinton said. ''We all have
a responsibility to do our part: parents, community leaders,
members of the gun industry and, yes, members of Congress, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he also wants Congress to approve state-issued
licenses for newly purchased handguns; stricter punishment for
adults whose guns fall into children's hands; and money to hire
1,000 new prosecutors for firearms cases and to develop ''smart
gun'' technology that makes the weapon work only for its rightful
owner.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, after Clinton said he was summoning congressional
leaders to the White House, Rep. Henry Hyde said compromise is
possible in good-faith bargaining. ''I think the country wants
legislation,'' said Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sought Saturday to defuse arguments by critics that his
proposals would do little to stop a criminal determined to get a
gun. He said the same argument was used against the Brady
background-check law, and it has stopped 500,000 firearms purchases
by felons since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The president blamed the National Rifle Association for
Congress' inaction. The NRA has a $20 million advertising campaign
under way on gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only reason Congress hasn't already sent me a bill with
comprehensive gun safety provisions is because of the pressure
tactics and the threats of the NRA,'' Clinton said. ''When
first-graders shoot first-graders, it's time for Congress to be
guided by their hearts and their heads, not by fear or the pressure
tactics of the NRA.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.C. Watts, the chairman of the House Republican
Conference, responded in a statement: ''What we have here is not a
failure of gun laws but a failure of parents, society and personal
responsibility. ... We can pass new gun laws, but tragedies like
the one in Michigan will continue until violence and neglect are
replaced with love and personal responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   As GOP leaders have said for months, Watts said the answer to
such tragedies is ''to start enforcing the 20,000 gun laws
currently on the books.''
</P>
<P>
   In the weekly Republican radio address, Connecticut Gov. John
Rowland alluded to the Rolland slaying in saying that states and
local governments need more flexibility to educate and help
troubled children.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most far-reaching laws cannot always prevent the most
outrageous of human behaviors,'' Rowland said. ''We must enforce
current laws that are on the books, and we must continue to examine
the profound effects of cultural violence. We see violence depicted
in our popular culture, almost without interruption. It is routine,
and it is wrong.''

<HEADLINE> Two Accused of Using Stolen Credit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Tax police arrested an Italian man and his Israeli
wife Saturday, accusing them of using thousands of American credit
card numbers snagged off computer lists to place $750,000 worth of
online lottery bets.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, arrested at their house in the eastern Sicilian city
of Catania, won about $400,000 from the betting, Capt. Giancarlo
Sulsenti of the paramilitary tax police said in a telephone
interview from Catania.
</P>
<P>
   The pair, who allegedly hacked into computers to obtain
thousands of Visa and Mastercard numbers, also went on an online
buying spree, ordering clothing, watches, ''but most of all
books,'' Sulsenti said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They set up a library in their Catania studio,'' the captain
said. ''There were thousands of volumes, mainly novels in German.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuseppe Russo, 34, an electronics system expert, and
Croatian-born Sandra Elazar, 33, a linguist and interpreter, were
charged with illegal use of credit cards. In most cases, the couple
would run about $2,500 worth of charges on each card, the captain
said.
</P>
<P>
   The tax police, who are continuing the investigation, said they
didn't know exactly how many credit cards were involved, but that
they numbered in the thousands. With the exception of a handful of
Italian cards, the vast majority were issued by two U.S. banks --
Chase Manhattan in Wilmington, Dele., and Citibank Universal MC
Card in Columbus, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ''We suspect the numbers were obtained through hackers. None of
the holders of the cards used were ever in Italy,'' Sulsenti said.
</P>
<P>
   The cardholders who noticed charges for purchases they never
made all sent letters to their banks to complain, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But investigators in Italy were tipped off by a banking service
that became suspicious about bets placed with an online lottery
agent in Bergamo in northern Italy. The Bergamo agent was one of
the few in the country to take bets via computer, Sulsenti said,
and has been forced to shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Without worrying about the expense and playing all possible
combinations so as to secure the win, the couple was able to win
$400,000, a tax police statement said. The winnings were then
laundered through various bank accounts, including some abroad.

<HEADLINE> Live Movie Auction Gets No Takers  </HEADLINE>
By CYNTHIA L. WEBB, Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST HOLLYWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Independent filmmakers drew laughs
and a few bids at the first live movie auction, but failed to sell
a single film.
</P>
<P>
   Promoters are still holding out hope that some bidders will
follow through and snap up some of the 15 films that included a
tale of four 20-something sunbathers talking about sex and a
documentary starring live rodents from the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not like we threw a party and no one came,'' said Alfred
Newman, an event spokesman, who pointed to the auction's
standing-room-only turnout.
</P>
<P>
   The Films4Auction event Friday night was touted as a new way for
independent films to get distribution. Some 300 people gathered at
a hotel ballroom for the public sale and watched clips of the
independent films, but only an estimated 27 in the audience were
potential buyers, organizers said. A few waved paddles to offer
bids.
</P>
<P>
   The entire lot failed to meet the non-disclosed reserve prices
set by the organizers, the auction house and the movies' producers.
</P>
<P>
   The screenwriter and director of a romantic comedy dubbed
''Killing Cinderella'' said festivals like Sundance have become a
showcase for polished works, not for getting independent films
distributed. Even if her film didn't get picked up at the auction,
Lisa Abbatiello, 29, thought it might be good just to say she was
part of the premiere event.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just decided to take the risk,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bidding for her film, a romantic comedy about a young woman torn
between a sophisticated Prince Charming and her bartending best
friend, was started at $175,000, but the minimum price needed to
sell the film was not met.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolf Van Den Berg of Holland was trying to get distribution
for his sixth feature film, ''For My Baby,'' about a troubled man
who dresses up like his dead sister as a way to remember her. But
the $750,000 minimum bid passed with no interested buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The director said before the auction that a no-sale would make
him sad, but said ''it's all in the game'' of moviemaking.
</P>
<P>
   Entrants had to pay $375 to get their film in the auction. Fifty
films were submitted and a panel whittled them down to 15, said Hal
''Corky'' Kessler, a lawyer and partner in the group that staged
the event. Many of the works were first time projects. Eleven had
been at various film festivals.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler said representatives from reputable companies -- he
wouldn't say which ones -- had approached him after the auction and
told him to let them know which films were still available. He said
representatives from Miramax, USA Films and Tristar had attended.
</P>
<P>
   ''The very fact that we had bids out there tells us this
works,'' Kessler said.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to introduce the category to the public and that is
what we did,'' said Kathleen Doyle, CEO of William Doyle Galleries,
which teamed up with Kessler's Art in Motion to hold the auction.

<HEADLINE> China Debates Impact of Joining WTO  </HEADLINE>
By ELAINE KURTENBACH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Legions of jobless farmers, backward factories
bankrupted by foreign competition, Chinese products banished by
Western brand names -- for some in China, the prospect of joining
the World Trade Organization conjures up nightmarish scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   Others here have the opposite take. More open markets, they say,
will bring greater wealth and help transform China into a more
modern, competitive and possibly more democratic country.
</P>
<P>
   China is expected to enter the WTO later this year. While U.S.
lawmakers battle over whether to grant Beijing permanent normal
trade status, easing its way into the world body, the Chinese are
debating their nation's future under a global trade regime.
</P>
<P>
   Dialogue over political and economic reforms is usually confined
to China's cloistered academic and Communist Party elite. But it
may surface more openly during the annual session of the National
People's Congress, which begins Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The government has thrown itself behind WTO, but an increasingly
outspoken group of nationalists are pushing for more open debate
about the risks of globalization.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to speak out on behalf of the farmers. No one else
will. After we join WTO, what will happen to them? Once cheaper
foreign products flood in, many jobs will be lost,'' said Wang
Xiaodong, former editor of the conservative magazine ''Strategy and
Management'' and a leading voice in the nascent nationalist
movement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not opposed to entering WTO, but I believe we have to
consider many problems,'' Wang said.
</P>
<P>
   China's farmers account for 70 percent of its 1.26 billion
people. They remain much poorer than their urban cousins and are
among the most vulnerable to foreign competition.
</P>
<P>
   Increased trade and investment resulting from WTO membership
would create about 12 million jobs, but about as many will be lost
in farming, the auto industry and other weak sectors, according to
Chinese estimates. Those who lose jobs would join tens of millions
already out of work because of layoffs at inefficient state-run
factories.
</P>
<P>
   In the near term, few economists or other experts say they
expect the impact of WTO membership to be catastrophic. Most
market-opening measures -- including those allowing greater foreign
competition in insurance, banking and telecommunications -- will
take effect gradually over five years or more.
</P>
<P>
   Bracing for change, the government has stepped up a long-term
program to funnel more domestic and foreign investment into the
country's vast Western region. It hopes to bridge the widening
divide between the landlocked, impoverished hinterland and the
rapidly growing, more prosperous east.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its eagerness to finally gain admittance to the body
that makes world trade rules, the Chinese echo other countries in
accusing the United States and other affluent countries of using
global trade to their own advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Control of globalization is in the hands of the West, in the
hands of the United States,'' said Wang, citing U.S. controls on
exports of sensitive technology. ''I believe this could threaten
our national security and productivity.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many Chinese intellectuals welcome the possibility that
WTO membership might bring enough pressure for change to override
domestic resistance to needed economic and political reforms.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Want Diallo Fed Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several dozen people protested Saturday in
front of the Justice Department to demand a filing of a federal
lawsuit against the New York Police Department because of the
Amadou Diallo shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the four New York City policemen acquitted in the
fatal shooting of the unarmed African plan to meet with Attorney
General Janet Reno's top deputy Monday and urge him not to pursue
civil rights charges.
</P>
<P>
   The main speaker at Saturday's rally said charges should be made
not against the four men but the police department and New York
City itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''What happened to Amadou Diallo, what has happened to others
... is a pattern of abuse within the New York Police Department
that has been going on for many years,'' Mauri Saalakhan, of the
human rights group Peace and Justice Foundation, told a noon rally
of about 50 people.
</P>
<P>
   ''They should spend the money on a federal suit against the NYPD
and the city of New York for a pattern of civil rights
violations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department already is investigating the patterns and
practices of the New York department, a probe expanded to include
the Street Crime Unit after Diallo's shooting. All four officers in
that case were assigned to Street Crimes, a roving group of
plainclothes officers.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Diallo's parents and black activists met for almost
two hours with Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder to press for
Justice Department action and to bring attention to the broader
issue of police brutality. Holder made no guarantee that charges
would be sought.
</P>
<P>
   The officers fired 41 shots at Diallo in the early hours of Feb.
4, 1999, as the West African immigrant stood in the vestibule of
his Bronx apartment building. They testified they fired when Diallo
reached for what they thought was a gun but what turned out to be a
wallet.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a jury of eight whites and four blacks acquitted the
officers of all charges, which ranged from second-degree murder to
reckless endangerment.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton offered his first public comment on the Diallo
case Friday night at a Democratic fund-raiser in San Francisco,
saying he believes Diallo's race was a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't pretend for a moment to second-guess the jury,''
Clinton said. ''But I know most people in America of all races
believe that if it had been a young white man in a young all-white
neighborhood, it probably wouldn't have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton quickly added, however: ''That doesn't mean (the
officers) were guilty under criminal law.''

<HEADLINE> Businessmen Bid for Havana Humidors  </HEADLINE>
By ANITA SNOW, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Billowing smoke cast a veil across the room as
hundreds of businessmen from around the world puffed on Cuban
cigars and bid tens of thousands of dollars on humidors at an
auction attended by President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highest prices bid in the early morning hours of
Saturday: $130,000 for a wooden humidor set in a 6-foot-tall bronze
sculpture of a man holding a cigar.
</P>
<P>
   The auction, conducted by Christie's of London, was the final
event in the weeklong second annual International Habano Festival.
</P>
<P>
   After the auction, organizers said that $800,000 collectively
was raised for the purchase of medicines for Cuban children from
the sale of seven fancy humidors filled with premium cigars.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is my first visit here and I'm sure to come back next
year,'' said a 38-year-old American real estate investor who gave
his name only as Jeff in apparent fear of getting into trouble with
the U.S. government for traveling to the communist island. He
wouldn't give his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've smoked about 20 cigars since I got here three days ago
and have a few more days to go,'' said the man, who wore a
specially made white long-sleeved shirt with metal buttons
fashioned like a hand holding a cigar.
</P>
<P>
   Under U.S. Treasury Department regulations, legal travel by most
Americans to Cuba is made impossible by restrictions on spending
money on the island. U.S. citizens who break those regulations can
receive written warnings and even fines if the government discovers
they traveled to Cuba without a special license.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Habanos S.A., the national cigar company, say that
the United States remains the largest potential market for Cuban
cigars because of its geographic proximity and American fascination
with the product.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. embargo of nearly 40 years blocks the importation
of Cuban cigars into the United States. Nevertheless, cigar company
officials here estimate that about 6 million cigars annually enter
the United States as contraband.
</P>
<P>
   There was a smattering of Americans in the group of about 800
lovers of Cuban tobacco who dined in candlelight and with classical
music at the ''cigar dinner'' held before the auction at Havana's
Pabexpo convention center. But, like the real estate investor, they
were reluctant to talk with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The $350-a-plate meal that began Friday night featured lobster
cooked in Havana Club rum, pumpkin soup, Moet &AMP; Chandon Champagne
and a dessert of raspberries and blackberries soaked in rum and
arranged next to a large piece of chocolate shaped like a tobacco
leaf. White and red Chilean wine flowed, and Cohiba and Punch brand
cigars were offered between courses.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque and Vice President Carlos
Lage were the highest ranking Cuban officials at the dinner.
</P>
<P>
   But after the plates were whisked away, diners burst into
applause as Castro showed up around midnight in his traditional
olive green uniform for the auction. Castro, a former cigar smoker,
gave up the habit years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Positioned at a table near the auctioneer, he sat next to
Colombian writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez, a longtime friend and
frequent visitor to the island.
</P>
<P>
   Although Castro's attendance was not announced ahead of time, it
was largely anticipated. The 73-year-old leader, now in his 41st
year in power, signed the auctioned humidors and personally greeted
every participant when the dinner finished in the early hours of
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He also commented to reporters on the two main issues absorbing
his interest in recent weeks, criticizing the United States for not
moving more quickly to return 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to his
father in Cuba and insisting on the innocence of a Cuban diplomat
expelled from the United States last week because of suspicions of
espionage.
</P>
<P>
   Natayla Bondarenko, a Russian woman who imports and distributes
Cuban cigars in Moscow, said she hoped that the new partnership
announced several weeks ago between Habanos S.A. and the European
firm Altadis will help business in Moscow, where Cuban cigars are
in great demand.
</P>
<P>
   Habanos in early February sold 50 percent of its shares for $500
million to Altadis, a partnership of Tabacalera of Spain and Seita
of France, which collectively control 25 percent of the world cigar
market.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba exported 148 million cigars last year, of which 128 million
were hand-rolled. Western Europe is the largest market for Cuban
cigars -- accounting for 90 million cigars, or 65.5 percent of the
total.

<HEADLINE> Two gun threats cause scares at schools  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- Two separate threats of deadly gun violence
involving students were promptly defused Friday, school officials
and police said.
</P>
<P>
   In the first case, a kindergarten student in Sayreville told
another student that he would put a gun in the 6-year-old boy's
mouth and pull the trigger, officials at Wilson Elementary School
said.
</P>
<P>
   The victim's mother, Gina Swanson, told school officials of the
threat.
</P>
<P>
   The threat was taken seriously by officials but later ''we
determined the child was not a threat,'' said Georgia Bauman, the
school's principal. Bauman said the incident wasn't reported to
borough police and that school disciplinary action was taken
against the child.
</P>
<P>
   Bauman said she couldn't say what specific action was being
taken. The school's disciplinary policy includes possible
suspension for such activities.
</P>
<P>
   Swanson, meantime, said her son was scared when he reported the
threat but added, ''I'm proud of him, that he came home and told
me.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second incident, police say a 16-year-old student
threatened a teacher with a fake gun at Irvington High School.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a cheap plastic gun, but it looked pretty real,'' said
Irvington Police Chief Steven Palamara.
</P>
<P>
   The student, who wasn't identified because of her age, was taken
into custody, charged with juvenile delinquency and taken to the
Essex County Youth House.
</P>
<P>
   About ten police officers went to the school at about 11 a.m.
Friday after school officials called police and said a student had
pointed a gun at a teacher. Police later found the fake gun using
information given by students.

<HEADLINE> 'The Rock' To Testify in Kid's Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- The attorney for a 12-year-old boy
accused of killing a 6-year-old playmate by slamming her onto a
table and railing has subpoenaed a professional wrestler to testify
at the boy's trial.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's lawyer, Jim Lewis, filed a subpoena Friday for Dwayne
''The Rock'' Johnson of the World Wrestling Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis wants Johnson to show jurors how pro wrestlers choreograph
their moves to avoid injury while making the action appear
authentic.
</P>
<P>
   Lionel Tate was mimicking such moves and didn't realize the
injuries they could cause, Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Lionel faces a first-degree murder charge for the July death of
Tiffany Eunick. No trial date has been set.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer said he chose Johnson because he lives in South
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was traveling and was unavailable for comment. A
spokesman for the World Wrestling Federation said the group was
unaware of the subpoena and had no comment.

<HEADLINE> Eel Could Disrupt Everglades Sealife  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A voracious Asian eel found near Everglades
National Park could become a biological nightmare if it slithers or
swims into the park, federal scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you want to be fatalistic, you'd have to say there's no way
we can stop it,'' said Bill Loftus, a biologist with the U.S.
Geological Survey's Florida Caribbean Science Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian swamp eel has razor sharp teeth, reaches lengths of
three feet or more and hunts at night. Scientists said the eels eat
massive quantities of just about anything, including fish, worms,
shrimp, crayfish and frogs.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have the potential to disrupt food webs, eat native
species and compete with native fish and wading birds for food,''
said John Curnutt, another USGS biologist.
</P>
<P>
   The swamp eel surfaced in south Miami-Dade County last month
when the Army Corps of Engineers began pumping water from a canal.
</P>
<P>
   The swamp eel, whose scientific name is Monopterus albus, is
native to subtropical and temperate climates in eastern Asia, where
its main predators are crocodiles and fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   Loftus believes the eels might have been released into canals by
someone who wanted to establish a population as a food source.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think there's a very good chance that somebody tried to
stock the canals,'' Loftus said. ''And because the eels are still
pretty sparse in South Dade, this is probably a fairly recent
introduction.''

<HEADLINE> Lottery-funded scholarship program criticized by Democrats  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The Pataki administration's plan to award
$4,000 scholarships to some 1,300 New York high school seniors
using state Lottery revenues is illegal, Democrats in the state
Senate are charging.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican governor needs legislative approval before
authorizing the so-called ''Leaders of Tomorrow'' scholarship
program, the Democrats contended.
</P>
<P>
   The Lottery Division has already started promoting the program
with full-page newspaper advertisements advising high school
seniors they have until March 31 to apply. The awards would be made
in June, Lottery officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your actions in advertising and promoting the program are an
unlawful exercise of your authority under the state constitution,
which denies you the power to implement and expend money on a
program unless it has been authorized by the Legislature,'' three
senators argued in a letter sent to Gov. George Pataki last week.
</P>
<P>
   Those signing the letter were state Sens. William Stachowski of
Buffalo, Eric Schneiderman of Manhattan and Richard Dollinger of
Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Deister, a spokesman for Pataki, dismissed the
lawmakers' complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a program that does not need legislative approval,''
he said. ''Therefore this (letter) is irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Teens must be graduating from high school with a ''B'' average
or higher to qualify for consideration for a scholarship, plus have
showed they are ''well-rounded'' academically, socially and
athletically and are going to attend a public or private college or
trade school in New York state. Schools were directed to forward
the names of two nominees to the state, and a panel appointed by
Pataki would decide the recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Winners will get $1,000 a year for up to four years. A new set
of scholarship winners will be selected each year.
</P>
<P>
   The legislators also questioned the fairness of the selection
process, arguing that school officials are being given no criteria
to judge the phrase ''well rounded'' by.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Leaders of Tomorrow'' scholarships would deepen the state
Lottery's ties with public schools. Previous programs have included
''New York Wired,'' a Lottery-funded initiative providing schools
with computers and Internet hookups, and an ''Educator of the
Week'' program which recognizes successful teachers across the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery officials say revenues for their games go to support
education and that it is only natural to reaffirm that connection
through various school-based programs.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say a too-cozy relationship between the Lottery and
schools could cause some youngsters -- too young yet to legally buy
Lottery tickets -- to get the signal that gambling on the Lottery is
to be encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   State Assemblyman Sam Hoyt, a Buffalo Democrat, said there would
undoubtedly be an outcry if companies involved in two other
activities not legal for youngsters -- tobacco giant Philip Morris
and beer maker Anheuser Busch -- began to sponsor scholarships for
high schoolers in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the merits, the (Lottery scholarship) program sounds like a
good one -- rewarding students for high achievement, for excellence
in education,'' Hoyt said. ''I like that concept. But I don't like
the fact it is a direct earmark from the Lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoyt in 1998 complained about the Lottery Division's use of a
modified yellow school bus to promote the state's games, saying it
was a marketing ploy aimed at young people. The vehicle is still
being used, but it looks less like a school bus now.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Letson, head of the New York Council on Problem Gambling
said that, for better or worse, the link between the Lottery and
education exists in New York. She said the Lottery sponsoring
scholarships for high schoolers may not be inappropriate, but she
urged the Pataki administration to ''move forward very cautiously''
so it does not allow the Lottery to be promoted among underage
people.
</P>
<P>
   She agreed that an Anheuser-Busch scholarship program would be
frowned upon, but complained that gambling among young people is
not recognized as posing the same kind of hazard as alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why is it that government's message when it comes to alcohol,
drugs and children is abstinence and why is it when it comes to
gambling it is moderation?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery officials deny marketing their products for minors and
say they try hard to make sure underage people do not buy Lottery
tickets.

<HEADLINE> South Africans Hailed in Mozambique  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- For three weeks, Sipiwo Dlomo has
worked tirelessly to save people from the floods that have devoured
this African nation.
</P>
<P>
   He's pulled people to safety from the tops of trees and
buildings, dangled from a wire to pluck people from the
fast-flowing water, and witnessed daily suffering.
</P>
<P>
   He is part of South African air force's effort to rescue people
from the floods that have left an estimated one million Mozambicans
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa was the fastest nation to respond to the disaster,
sending seven helicopters that, along with South African boat
crews, have rescued more than 12,000 people in Mozambique's flooded
Limpopo River valley.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Dlomo's fellow soldiers have since been sent home, but
Dlomo was kept on because his superiors considered him too
valuable. He is one of a handful of South African soldiers who
speak Portuguese, a huge benefit to the rescue mission in the
former Portuguese colony.
</P>
<P>
   The broad-shouldered airman is finally headed home on Sunday, he
said, after having been forced during this mission to make
life-and-death decisions every day.
</P>
<P>
   He has lost count of the number of flights he has flown over the
swirling floodwaters and of the number of dazed Mozambicans he has
pulled to safety.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes you realize the value of human life, and makes you
ask what you want from your own life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The most dangerous aspect of the rescue operation, he said, was
being lowered on a winch to rescue people caught in the
fast-flowing water.
</P>
<P>
   ''The mud is terrible. That is your worst enemy,'' he said. ''We
always make sure we rescue everybody, even if it means taking the
highest risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The rescue effort will be joined by British, U.S. and
international aid groups. But some have criticized the west for not
responding quickly enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''The South Africans ... are real heroes,'' said Mozambican
Foreign Minister Leonardo Simao. ''It is touching to see this
solidarity unfold.''
</P>
<P>
   That affection is no small thing, especially given the two
countries' past. South Africa supported right-wing RENAMO rebels in
a 15-year civil war with the Marxist FRELIMO that ended in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Since then FRELIMO's head Joaquim Chissano has become
Mozambique's president, while South Africa's white-minority rule
has ended with two consecutive black presidents -- Nelson Mandela
and now President Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
   Dlomo himself was born in Durban, on South Africa's eastern
coast, and went into exile in 1982 to join the armed wing of the
African National Congress, which fought the apartheid government
until all-race elections in 1994. He spent years in Mozambique and
Angola, where he picked up Portuguese, and also had stints in
Swaziland and Zambia before returning home in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his fellow soldiers once served under the apartheid
government, but Dlomo said everyone works hand-in-hand.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are all working for the same government. It is a concerted
effort, and everyone gives their best,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When he returns home, Dlomo said his priorities would be to
catch up on the chores and to assuage his girlfriend, who was
unhappy with his long stay in Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
   ''She must understand. It's my job,'' he says, shaking his head.

<HEADLINE> Teachers Shun Pupil for Grisly Work  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAEFORD, N.C. (AP) -- Three English teachers at Hoke High School
are refusing to teach a 16-year-old freshman who was suspended for
writing a paper that portrayed the killings of students and
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The state Attorney General's Office said the teachers can refuse
to have Russell Almanza in their classrooms as long as he receives
his English assignments from another certified instructor.
</P>
<P>
   Almanza was suspended Feb. 18 for 10 days after writing an essay
describing a shooting at the school. He portrayed himself as an FBI
agent investigating the shooting and used the names of people he
knew, including English teacher Erica Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   He said he didn't want to scare anyone and just wanted a chance
to be a hero.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they really read the story, they could see I'm the good
guy,'' he said. ''I never threatened anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   After an appeal, the suspension was reduced to five days and he
was allowed to return to school on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the conditions of his return was that he be assigned to
another English teacher. He also agreed to receive counseling and
signed a contract promising to behave.
</P>
<P>
   However, none of the ninth-grade English teachers would allow
him in their classrooms. Instead, he was placed in the library
during his English period and he was to be given assignments and
monitored by another teacher, said principal Barry Wall.

<HEADLINE> Russians Bombard Southern Chechnya  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   STARIYE ATAGI, Russia (AP) -- Federal troops battled rebel forces
along Chechnya's southern Argun Gorge on Saturday, and the Russian
military said both sides were suffering significant casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Russia's earlier claims to controlling much of the
gorge, fighting raged Saturday in villages in and around the
canyon. The clashes were accompanied by incessant salvos of Russian
artillery and the roar of warplanes heading farther south to bomb
suspected rebel positions.
</P>
<P>
   The strategic Argun Gorge cuts south from Russian-occupied
regions in Chechnya's north to rebel-controlled territories in the
mountains. The militants have many bases hidden on the slopes, and
move supplies and reinforcements along the gorge.
</P>
<P>
   At least 50 Russian servicemen were killed in the area during
the past week, the Interfax news agency quoted unidentified
military sources as saying Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The sources said Russian and Chechen forces were suffering
''considerable'' casualties in fighting around Ulus-Kert -- a
village east of the Argun Gorge and the site of some of the
bloodiest battles Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Gen. Georgy Shpak, the Russian paratroops commander, said
Saturday that 12 of his troops and hundreds of rebels had been
killed in recent days around the gorge.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're seeing the heaviest fighting ... and several losses,''
he told Russia's RTR television. But he denied reports that 70
paratroopers had been killed in the past two days.
</P>
<P>
   Federal troops were suffering losses in a battle with some 500
militants near the village of Selmentauzen, halfway between the
Argun and Vedeno gorges, according to the office of the top
presidential aide on Chechnya, Sergei Yastrzhembsky. The office
refused Saturday to provide numbers of casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen rebels have been weakened by a half-year of heavy
bombing and shelling, but remain a powerful force capable of
staging painful attacks on the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Russian Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo flew to Chechnya on
Saturday to investigate a bloody rebel attack on a column of
Russian Interior Ministry troops in the Chechen capital, Grozny, on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The casualty toll was uncertain, with estimates ranging between
20 and 37 Russian troops killed.
</P>
<P>
   Acting President Vladimir Putin and other officials blamed the
attack on inefficiency by federal military commanders. The Russian
army has claimed to have Grozny under control since Feb. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Rushailo told reporters that commanders ''responsible for this
tragedy will be subject to a most harsh punishment, up to criminal
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Igor Sukhov, a private who was wounded in the attack, described
the attack from his hospital bed Saturday. ''To lose 20 people in
three hours -- it's too much,'' he said on RTR television. The
attack ''was clearly planned to the last detail.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-eight Chechens have been detained on suspicion of taking
part in the ambush, officials at the Russian Interior Ministry
branch in North Caucasus said Saturday, according to Interfax.
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces in Chechnya routinely seize fighting-age Chechen
men, accusing them of being militants. Many are sent to detention
camps, where inmates claim they are beaten and tortured in order to
extract confessions.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials deny the torture allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Despite intense international pressure, Russia refuses to
negotiate with Chechnya's separatist government, and has issued a
warrant for the arrest of Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov on
charges of leading an armed rebellion, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two Polish biologists who were held hostage in
Chechnya flew to Moscow on Saturday prior to their return home.
</P>
<P>
   The biologists, Ewa Marchwinska-Wyrwal and Zofia
Fiszer-Malanowska, were seized in August 1999 while working in the
Russian republic of Dagestan, which borders Chechnya to the east.
</P>
<P>
   The women were freed Friday in an operation by Russia's GUBOP
anti-organized crime agency in the town of Shatoi in the Argun
Gorge.
</P>
<P>
   One Russian serviceman was killed when he stepped on a mine
during the rescue operation, Russia's RTR television reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Marchwinska-Wyrwal said she and her colleague were held by two
Chechen brothers, and were taken from Dagestan to various places
around Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 people have been kidnapped in and around
Chechnya over the past three years, most of them taken by criminal
gangs seeking ransom money.

<HEADLINE> Fifteen Killed in Algerian Attacks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- Three brutal attacks against civilians
in Algeria have left 15 dead, including 10 members of one family,
local newspapers said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The daily Liberte said an armed group killed the 10 family
members on Thursday night in Larbaa, 12 miles east of the capital
Algiers. The group used explosives to force their way into the
house, and then shot their victims or killed them with knives.
</P>
<P>
   Another paper, Le Matin, said an armed group killed three
villagers and injured three others Wednesday night in Gheraibiya, a
small town 43 miles south of Algiers.
</P>
<P>
   Two more people were killed Thursday when they were stopped at a
roadblock set up near Tipaza, west of Algiers, by an armed group of
Islamic militants. The victims' throats were cut and the bodies
burned, Le Matin reported.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a peace drive by President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, Islamic
insurgents continue to carry out attacks on civilians in this North
African nation. They have been fighting since 1992, when the army
canceled legislative elections that the now-outlawed Islamic
Salvation Front was poised to win.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100,000 people have been killed in the eight years of
fighting since then.
</P>
<P>
   A key element of Bouteflika's peace plan offered partial amnesty
to Muslim rebels who surrendered by Jan. 13. Bouteflika said more
than 6,000 insurgents had accepted the offer, and promised ''a
fight without mercy'' for those who refused.
</P>
<P>
   Although some groups have turned themselves in and disbanded,
the most radical Armed Islamic Group has not officially accepted
the peace plan.

<HEADLINE> NATO: Dozens Flee Yugoslav Fighting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Dozens of ethnic Albanian women and
children fled into Kosovo on Saturday after an exchange of gunfire
in a town just outside the province's border, NATO peacekeepers
said.
</P>
<P>
   The exodus of some 175 people was the latest push from Dobrasin,
a predominantly ethnic Albanian town in eastern Serbia. Hundreds of
people have fled the area in the past two months, streaming into
the closest Kosovo town of Gnjilane, about 30 miles southeast of
Kosovo's provincial capital, Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   The area near Dobrasin has been the site of sporadic clashes
between ethnic Albanian guerrillas and Serb police. There are fears
that the southern Serbian region could be the scene of renewed
fighting similar to the conflict in Kosovo last year, which led to
NATO attacks against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The newly formed rebel group is called the Liberation Army of
Presevo, Medvedja and Bujanovac -- named after three predominantly
ethnic Albanian towns just outside Kosovo in southern Serbia. The
group's fighters say they are trying to protect villagers in the
region from attacks by Serb forces.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees from Dobrasin crossed a checkpoint being manned
about 2{ miles inside Kosovo by U.S. Sgt. Kelly Leaverton of Salem,
Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last night they rushed through here,'' he said. He said the
villagers were traveling in cars, on horseback and on tractors.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some 70 Serbs demonstrated in the Kosovo town of
Gracanica to protest a grenade attack on a Serb home. Five people
were injured, one seriously, said Warrant Officer Mark Cox, a NATO
press spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   NATO peacekeepers sealed off the city after violence broke out,
Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Infuriated at the attack, Serbs in Gracanica set up roadblocks
on the highway to Pristina and hurled stones at passing Albanian
cars, the Belgrade-based Beta news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of ethnic Albanians were killed by Serb forces during
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's 18-month crackdown against
Kosovo separatists. Since NATO bombing forced the Serb troops to
withdraw last spring, ethnic attacks and killings have been regular
occurrences in the province.

   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- U.S. Immigration officials have ordered the
repatriation of foreign sailors who have been stranded since their
freighter was damaged by Hurricane Georges in the fall of 1998.

   The Golden Star was towed into Tampa after the hurricane, and
the Coast Guard ordered the ship held until repairs made it
seaworthy.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, a succession of foreign crew members have been
stranded here, some for more than a year, unpaid, unable to leave
the ship. They lived without heat or air conditioning, a garden
hose their only source of fresh water.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not the fault of the crew,'' said Ron Johnson of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service. ''They were told to come
here and do a job. They had no way of knowing what they were
getting into. But the ship owners knew darn well that ship wasn't
going anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The INS ordered the sailors to be returned home by March 13. If
that deadline isn't met, the INS said it would deport the crew
members and send the bill to the ship owners.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also lifted restrictions that kept six crew members
aboard the Golden Star and five others stuck at a local motel
waiting for back pay and a plane ticket home.
</P>
<P>
   ''The end result is we're going to have 11 Lithuanians who are
pretty happy,'' Johnson said after the orders were issued Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The men were to collect back pay ranging, in some cases up to
$9,000, from the ship owner, listed in documents as Tamboril
Properties Inc.

<HEADLINE> Officials: Israeli Base Attacked  </HEADLINE>
By SAM F. GHATTAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Guerrillas attacked an Israeli military
outpost in southern Lebanon on Saturday night, wounding an Israeli
soldier and prompting strikes from Israeli warplanes, Lebanese
security officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas fired rockets at the military base at Beaufort, a
centuries-old mountaintop castle 12 miles north of the Israeli
border with commanding views of southern Lebanon and northern
Israel. Soldiers returned fire from tanks, and Israeli artillery
pounded the surrounding area, the officials said on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The wounded Israeli soldier was evacuated by helicopter to
Israel for treatment, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, the Israeli army spokesman's office confirmed an
exchange of fire at the castle. No further information was
available on the casualties or exchanges, which lasted more than an
hour. None of the guerrilla groups active in southern Lebanon
immediately claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   About 1{ hours after the attack, Israeli warplanes struck an
area southwest of the castle, firing at least one missile. Two
missiles were fired in a second airstrike 20 minutes later,
security officials said. The planes were believed to be pursuing
the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas have killed seven Israeli
soldiers and six pro-Israeli militiamen, including the South
Lebanon Army militia's No. 2 commander, since Jan. 25. The
escalation in violence prompted Israeli warplanes to bomb three
power stations deep inside Lebanon on Feb. 8, wounding 15 civilians
and causing widespread power outages.
</P>
<P>
   Israel set up the zone it occupies in southern Lebanon in 1985
to protect its northern communities from cross-border guerrilla
raids. The border strip, 10 percent of Lebanon's territory, is
patrolled by 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 allied South Lebanon
Army militiamen.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who has set a July deadline
for the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon, has
pledged even harsher retaliation if attacks continue.

<HEADLINE> Buchanan Predicts Three Party Race  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENBELT, (Md.) -- The acrimony dividing the Republican and
Democratic parties creates an opening for ''a fighting three-way
race for the presidency of the United States'' this year,
conservative columnist Patrick Buchanan said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we're seeing is a process of the disintegration of those
national parties,'' Buchanan told the Maryland Reform Party, which
awarded the state's 11 delegates to the national nominating
convention to Buchanan. ''We hope to gather together some of those
pieces and put together a plurality in November.''
</P>
<P>
   Nasty primary battles between Republicans George W. Bush and
John McCain and Democrats Al Gore and Bill Bradley have permanently
weakened the major parties, he said. By default, Buchanan said,
that situation strengthens the third party, despite its own
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're seeing a process of de-alignment, which I think
ultimately is going to result in a realignment of the two
parties,'' Buchanan said. ''One national party will emerge with the
ideas we represent...and we will take over parts of both parties
that share these views and values.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of his ''peasants with pitchforks'' taking over the
political process is a familiar refrain for Buchanan, who left the
GOP in October after two White House bids in which he vowed to
steer the party away from free trade and moderate social positions
only to lose in Republican primaries.
</P>
<P>
   By his own admission, Buchanan this year bolted the GOP in part
because he realized that his candidacy and the arguments in his
controversial book, ''A Republic, Not an Empire,'' would get lost
in the flood of Republican candidates and their memoirs.
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party, still roiling over its direction, its leaders
and the whereabouts of $2.5 million in federal convention funding,
provides Buchanan a bullhorn almost all to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Through it, he plans to tone down his rhetoric on issues that
critics have branded extremist and that could alienate core Reform
Party constituencies, especially on social issues, according to
National Chairman Pat Choate.
</P>
<P>
   ''He talks less about abortion, for example,'' Choate said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A sign of the continuing unrest in the Reform Party was the
decision by the Minnesota Reform Party Saturday to separate
officially from the national party. The Minnesota group reclaimed
the name Independence Party and gave itself the slogan ''socially
inclusive, fiscally responsible.'' The state party followed the
lead of Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, who urged that it take the
step as he left the Reform Party last month.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the moves were upset with the unrest in the
national party and concerned about the impact of potential Reform
Party presidential nominee Buchanan's conservative views. Opponents
of the decision to break free wanted to stay and fight for the
future of the Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   Now Buchanan uses softer rhetoric. For example, on Saturday he
called his opposition to free trade agreements ''economic
patriotism,'' and his opposition to the Clinton administration's
don't-ask-don't-tell policy ''social experiments in the military.''
On issues like abortion, Buchanan said he would trumpet ''a
traditionalism on social issues.''
</P>
<P>
   One issue on which Buchanan believes Reform Party members can
agree is an opposition to free trade agreements. Choate said
Buchanan will ride that issue heavily as the Clinton administration
raises its pressure on Congress to normalize China's trade status.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan plans to turn up the volume on his campaign as the
primary battles fade. If upcoming primaries in more than a dozen
big states kill off the candidacies of Bradley and McCain, Buchanan
will have his opening at a time when the surviving major party
candidates are broke and tired, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The winter campaigning is about over and we're just starting
spring training,'' Buchanan told about 80 people gathered at the
Marriott here.
</P>
<P>
   ''The press that likes Bradley and loves McCain'' will look for
a better story than ''a boring battle between Bush and Gore,''
Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to take aim especially at Bush, his former fellow
Republican, for being ''basically a nice fellow, but clueless'' on
foreign policy issues, an area of expertise for Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ''They think they've shed a lot of blood in that Republican
Party lately,'' Buchanan said. ''But you wait 'til we get ahold of
old W.''

<HEADLINE> Whites' Farms in Zimbabwe Vacated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Some former guerrillas gave in to a
government ultimatum Saturday and vacated white-owned farms, while
others defied the threat and seized other property.
</P>
<P>
   Home Affairs Minister Dumiso Dabengwa had set a Saturday
deadline for the ex-insurgents to leave the white-owned farms or
face expulsion by police.
</P>
<P>
   There were no immediate reports of measures to remove the
squatters still in place. President Robert Mugabe had expressed
sympathy for the ex-guerrillas this week, saying they were engaged
in ''peaceful and lawful demonstrations.''
</P>
<P>
   Veterans of the rebel-led drive for Zimbabwean independence from
Britain in the 1970s reportedly withdrew from farms in the Norton
and Enterise valleys, while others occupied properties in the
Zimbabwean Midlands and the Troutbeck resort area in the eastern
highlands.
</P>
<P>
   David Hasluck, executive director of the Commercial Farmers'
Union, said the number of farms involved doubled Friday from 70 to
142.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Dabengwa said the squatters, angered by recent
rejection of a new constitution that would have permitted seizure
of white farms without compensation, had exceeded the bounds of
''peaceful political protest.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite overwhelming rejection by voters of Mugabe's planned new
constitution, the president plans to reintroduce the land provision
in 30 days as an amendment to the current constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Since farm invasions began a week ago, fences have been smashed,
farmers and workers beaten, and millions of dollars worth of export
crops left to rot in fields and barns.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is getting worse,'' said Henry Elsworth, a rancher near
Kwekwe. ''The police are completely powerless to do anything and if
they tried they'd be massacred.''

<HEADLINE> Pope Praises S. Korea for Aid  </HEADLINE>
By FRANCES D'EMILIO, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Urging other countries to help North Koreans
suffering from hunger, Pope John Paul II praised South Korea's
humanitarian aid to the North in a meeting Saturday with the
South's president.
</P>
<P>
   President Kim Dae-jung visited the Vatican during a 10-day
European tour to gather support for efforts aimed at eventually
uniting the two Koreas and defusing tensions there. John Paul
warmly greeted Kim, who is Catholic, and met privately with him for
nearly a half-hour. The two exchanged written speeches, copies of
which were released by the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, the pope singled out Kim's ''fresh initiatives to
foster inter-Korean dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly, the path of reconciliation will be long and
difficult,'' he said. ''Yet, despite the obstacles, you have not
allowed yourselves to become discouraged in your endeavors to
establish a climate of good and harmonious relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting the suffering in North Korea from floods and repeated
poor harvests, John Paul said South Korea had shown its commitment
to better relations by coming to the assistance of the North.
</P>
<P>
   ''I take this opportunity to call upon the international
community to continue to show generosity,'' the pope said.
</P>
<P>
   Kim's speech praised the church in South Korea for having a
''guiding role in the defense of human rights and in the struggle
for democracy'' at the end of the last century. He also pledged
that South Korea would continue its policy of cooperation and
exchange with the North.
</P>
<P>
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said human rights in
Asia were among the topics discussed during the private talks,
which Kim also held with the Holy See's secretary of state and
foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   South and North Korea fought a war from 1950 to 1953, but have
never signed a peace treaty.

<HEADLINE> INS Takes Back Once-Deported Man  </HEADLINE>
By BERT WILKINSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) -- U.S. immigration officials have taken
back a man deported to Guyana last year, but still have not been
able to confirm his true identity, an embassy official said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Edgar Garfield Gibbons, insists he is American. On
Friday night, he was accompanied by Immigration and Naturalization
Service agents on a commercial flight from Georgetown to New York.
He was then to be transferred to Texas, the state from which he was
deported in April, U.S. Embassy spokesman Vincent Principe said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in this South American nation had pressed the United
States to take Gibbons back after they were unable to find any
record of him. They said they believed his contention that his
identity had been confused with that of a Guyanese-born man in New
Jersey with the same name and a similar birth date.
</P>
<P>
   Now U.S. officials are investigating a theory that the deportee
stole the identity of the Gibbons living in New Jersey, Principe
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''And so he was stuck with the identity and had to accept his
deportation to Guyana,'' Principe said. ''That is the most likely
theory, but we are still not sure what is his real name and true
identity, but we are getting close.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons was deported after serving one year in a Texas prison on
a drug charge. He insisted he was born in Monroe, La., and grew up
in Houston. But INS officials have not been able to find any record
of him there.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have taken fingerprints from Gibbons and have
been working with Interpol to determine his identity. Until his
identity is clear, Gibbons will remain at a Texas facility,
Principe said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Guyanese Home Affairs Minister Ronald Gajraj
said that if U.S. officials did not act in two weeks then Guyana
would expel Gibbons, whom the government had already declared a
stateless person.
</P>
<P>
   Since his deportation in April, Gibbons had been living in a
Georgetown police station.

<HEADLINE> Rampage After Indian Election  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PATNA, India (AP) -- Furious that their party was dislodged from
power in India's troubled Bihar state, political activists
protested Saturday by ripping up railroad tracks and blocking train
service.
</P>
<P>
   The activists were members of the Rashtriya Janata Dal party, or
RJD. Their rampage came a day after the main opposition -- the
National Democratic Alliance, or NDA, of Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee -- formed a government following elections in the
eastern state.
</P>
<P>
   No one was hurt in the protest action, but all trains passing
through Bihar had to halt on their way to or from India's eastern
and northeastern states. The route is crucial for transporting
minerals and food products throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Railroad tracks were damaged in at least four places. Passenger
trains to eastern Calcutta and to the northern capital, New Delhi,
were parked on the tracks all day, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Bihar's fractured elections ended with no party taking a
majority. RJD ran the government before the elections. But in a
constitutional convention, state Gov. Vinod Chandra Pandey asked
the NDA to take power and prove a majority.
</P>
<P>
   The state's NDA leader, Nitish Kumar, took over as chief state
minister, replacing RJD leader Rabri Devi. Kumar said police would
crack down on the rioters attacking railroads.
</P>
<P>
   Violent protests are common in Bihar, India's poorest and most
lawless state. The state is wracked by caste clashes and a
rebellion by Maoist groups.

<HEADLINE> Diallo Protesters Want Fed Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Calls for action in the death of Amadou Diallo
increased Saturday as the Justice Department continued reviews of
New York City police practices as well as the case of four New York
policemen who shot him.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow police officers, fellow Muslims and even President
Clinton weighed in over the weekend on the case of the West African
immigrant killed in a hail of gunfire by police who say they
mistakenly thought he pulled a gun on them.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, several dozen people, mostly American Muslims,
protested Saturday in front of the Justice Department, saying the
department should file a federal lawsuit against the New York
Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''What happened to Amadou Diallo, what has happened to others
... is a pattern of abuse within the New York Police Department
that has been going on for many years,'' Mauri Saalakhan, of the
human rights group Peace and Justice Foundation, told a noon rally
of about 50 people.
</P>
<P>
   ''They should spend the money on a federal suit against the NYPD
and the city of New York for a pattern of civil rights
violations.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, a coalition of black law enforcement groups called
for a review of the Diallo case.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want the Justice Department to look into this, to
investigate,'' Charles Billups, head of the Grand Council of
Guardians, said in a press conference on the steps of City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   His group represents black members of the NYPD, the state
troopers and law enforcement agencies on Long Island and the
northern suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has said it already is doing both of
those things. It is reviewing the Diallo case, specifically, as
well as investigating the patterns and practices of the New York
department, a probe expanded to include the Street Crime Unit after
Diallo's shooting.
</P>
<P>
   All four officers in that case were assigned to Street Crimes, a
roving group of plainclothes officers.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Diallo's parents and black activists met for almost
two hours with Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder to press for
Justice Department action and to bring attention to the broader
issue of police brutality. Holder made no guarantee that charges
would be sought.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the policemen plan to visit the Justice Department
Monday to argue against civil rights charges.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton offered his first public comment on the case
Friday night at a political fund-raiser, saying he believes
Diallo's race was a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't pretend for a moment to second-guess the jury,''
Clinton said. ''But I know most people in America of all races
believe that if it had been a young white man in a young all-white
neighborhood, it probably wouldn't have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The officers fired 41 shots at Diallo in the early hours of Feb.
4, 1999, as he stood in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment
building. They testified they fired when Diallo reached for what
they thought was a gun but what turned out to be a wallet.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a jury of eight whites and four blacks acquitted the
officers of all charges, which ranged from second-degree murder to
reckless endangerment.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Pistol Smuggling Goes Awry  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Surgeons operated on a woman who
smuggled an automatic pistol into a high-security prison by
concealing it in her rectum but was unable to remove the gun from
its hiding place.
</P>
<P>
   Tirsa Ruiz slipped the 7.65 mm pistol past security checks at
Bogota's La Picota prison on a visit last week to a suspected
leftist rebel prisoner, local newspapers reported Saturday. But
once inside the prison, she realized the gun was stuck.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming she was pregnant, Ruiz, 43, complained of acute stomach
pains and was taken to a hospital. She stayed there for three days,
the gun firmly lodged inside her.
</P>
<P>
   Surgeons finally removed the pistol Wednesday after Ruiz
confessed to the real cause of her discomfort. On Saturday, she was
recovering in the hospital under police guard. She was charged with
illegal weapons possession.
</P>
<P>
   Prison guards say visitors have often used body cavities to
smuggle drugs and liquor to inmates since a court ruling last year
banned intimate body searches.

Clinton said. ''But I know most people in America of all races
believe that if it had been a young white man in a young all-white
neighborhood, it probably wouldn't have happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The officers fired 41 shots at Diallo in the early hours of Feb.
4, 1999, as he stood in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment
building. They testified they fired when Diallo reached for what
they thought was a gun but what turned out to be a wallet.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a jury of eight whites and four blacks acquitted the
officers of all charges, which ranged from second-degree murder to
reckless endangerment.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Cycling Star Abducted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Military troops and police combed the
mountains south of Bogota on Saturday after suspected leftist
rebels kidnapped a national cycling hero -- the second to be
abducted this year.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Alberto Herrera, the 1987 Vuelta de Espana champion, was
snatched by seven heavily armed men from his parents' farm near the
town of Fusagasuga, police said. The abduction came a month after
rebels from the National Liberation Army freed cyclist Oliverio
Rincon after keeping him for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Herrera competed several times in the Tour de France and the
Gira de Italia before retiring from cycling.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen -- who cut the farm's telephone cable before abducting
the retired sportsman -- claimed they were guerrillas, but didn't
say which faction they belonged to, Herrera's mother told local
radio news.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC,
Colombia's largest guerrilla group, maintain a strong presence in
the Andean mountains south of Bogota, and often carry out
abductions for ransom.
</P>
<P>
   The National Liberation Army -- called the ELN -- is Colombia's
second largest rebel force with 5,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, the military said rebels in western Colombia
kidnapped at least 25 workers from a company that repairs electric
towers.
</P>
<P>
   The workers were en route Friday to repair a tower knocked down
by guerrillas of the National Liberation Army in Guatape, 125 miles
northwest of Bogota, the military said.
</P>
<P>
   The ELN opposes the privatization of Isagen, the state electric
company, and has been blamed for many attacks on electrical
transmission towers.

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Prosecutor: Trial Is On  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEABODY, Mass. (AP) -- Scotland's top prosecutor met Saturday
with the families of the victims of the Lockerbie jet bombing to
assure them the case was going to trial, despite the sudden
resignation of his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Colin Boyd asked to attend an annual meeting of
Northeast-based families of the victims so he could address their
concerns. He's scheduled to meet with more victims' families and
U.S. officials Monday in Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd took over as lead prosecutor after Lord Andrew Hardie
resigned last month to accept a judgeship.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is set to begin May 3 in the Netherlands under
Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Monetti, 57, from Cherry Hill, N.J., listened to Boyd's
assurances, but said Hardie's departure was another blow to the
families.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't need the agony and the trial is going to be long
enough as it is,'' said Monetti, whose 20-year-old son Rick died on
the plane. ''I wish it was half over already.''
</P>
<P>
   Libyans Abdel Basset Ali al-Magrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhiman
face charges including murder and conspiracy to murder in the
bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. The plane exploded over Lockerbie,
Scotland, in December 1988, killing 259 passengers and 11 people on
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors maintain that the two men were responsible for
placing a suitcase bomb on a flight originating in Malta and having
it transferred onto the Pan Am airliner in London. The men,
employed by the Libyan national airline in Malta, were allegedly
undercover intelligence agents.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd on Saturday said he wouldn't object to the release of a
letter from UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan to Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi, though he pointed out he has no authority to
release the document, which is in the hands of the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the victim's families believe the letter indicates that
Gadhafi turned over the two suspects in exchange for protection
from prosecution.

<HEADLINE> Confederate Flag Rally Held in Ala.  </HEADLINE>
By JAY REEVES, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- A group that wants the South to secede
from the union staged a Confederate flag-waving rally Saturday, a
day before President Clinton was to lead marchers across a Selma
bridge to mark the 35th anniversary of ''Bloody Sunday'' in the
civil rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   Confederate flags and rebel yells rose from the steps of
Alabama's Capitol at the Old South rally. Kilt-wearing bagpipers
playing ''Dixie'' joined Civil War re-enactors dressed in gray and
butterscotch uniforms to lead a parade to the building, where
Jefferson Davis took the oath as president of the Confederacy in
1861.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, members of the Southern nationalist organization that
staged the rally signed a ''Declaration of Southern Cultural
Independence,'' described as the first step in what they hope is a
second secession by the South.
</P>
<P>
   ''The national culture of the United States is violent and
profane, coarse and rude, cynical and deviant, and repugnant to the
Southern people and to every people with authentic Christian
sensibilities,'' read the document.
</P>
<P>
   ''Independence Now!'' chanted the virtually all-white crowd.
Hundreds signed petitions demanding that the Rebel flag with its
familiar X-design be returned to the Capitol dome, where it used to
fly.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a cultural heritage we are proud of and we will defend
it by all honorable means,'' said Michael Hill, president of the
Tuscaloosa-based League of the South, which put the event together.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery police and Hill estimated the crowd at about 2,500.
Officers arrested four protesters who tried to enter the barricaded
area reserved for Confederate backers, and police removed two women
who drew jeers for carrying American flags.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to stay in the Union. We don't want racism and hate,''
said Anne Torma of Birmingham, a U.S. flag draped over her
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   As speakers criticized groups that claim the Confederate flag is
a symbol of racism and hate, a congressional delegation led by Rep.
John Lewis, D-Ga., toured civil rights sites in Birmingham and
Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' group is to join Clinton on Sunday in Selma for the 35th
anniversary of ''Bloody Sunday,'' the day scores of black voting
rights demonstrators were beaten by state troopers and sheriff's
officers as they crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge on a march to
Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., marchers returned two weeks
later and began the weeklong Selma-to-Montgomery march, which
helped spur quick passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be a very moving and meaningful day,'' Lewis said of
the anniversary march. ''It's a historic site -- a lampost in a long
journey toward equal rights.''
</P>
<P>
   At the League of the South rally, a blue banner emblazoned with
''No King But Jesus'' provided the backdrop for more than three
hours of Civil War-era music and speeches against moral decay, the
media and the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ''The South was right! Say it loud enough that they can hear you
in Selma with Mr. Clinton!'' screamed Walter Kennedy, drawing
cheers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the few blacks in the crowd, H.K. Edgerton, stood in a
Confederate uniform beside 93-year-old Alberta Martin of Elba, a
Confederate widow. The southeast Alabama woman married an
81-year-old Confederate veteran when she was 21.
</P>
<P>
   She wore a rebel flag as a scarf as Edgerton explained how he
went from being president of the Asheville, N.C., chapter of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to one
of the few blacks active in the Confederate separatist movement.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a Southerner. Am I supposed to walk away from that?'' said
Edgerton, 52, who has defended the Confederate flag since being
suspended from the NAACP in 1998 for violating the organization's
rules.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP, which claims the rebel banner is a symbol of racism
and oppression, is trying to pressure South Carolina into removing
the flag from its Capitol dome through a tourism boycott.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, a judge ruled in 1993 that only the state and
national flags were allowed to fly above the seat of government.
Then-Gov. Jim Folsom Jr. did not appeal the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   As the Confederate rally began, a biracial group called One
Montgomery met at the nearby Civil Rights Memorial, with Mayor
Bobby Bright on hand, to promote racial harmony.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Neukomm of Adairsville, Ga., said the South should break
away from the United States even if it means another Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we stay, my children will be living under communism,'' said
Neukomm, a Confederate flag in hand.

<HEADLINE> Indianapolis Church Battling IRS  </HEADLINE>
BY JEFF TUCKER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Hundreds of people rallied in Indianapolis
Saturday in support of a church that is refusing to pay a $6
million tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Indianapolis Baptist Temple, who number their
Christian congregation at 1,000, say they will not pay the money
the Internal Revenue Service claims they owe from 1987 through
1993, nor will they surrender their church if it is seized to pay
the tax debt.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters chanted ''No more Waco'' throughout the protest,
referring to the 1993 raid on the Branch Davidian compound in Waco,
Texas, and making some worry that violence might break out.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the protest was more like a church picnic in springtime
as the crowd gathered at a downtown Indianapolis federal
courthouse, heard speeches, chanted and sung ''God Save America''
to the tune of ''God Bless America'' before walking to another
downtown federal building.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case, about 20 law enforcement officers were on hand in
addition to plain-clothes federal agents. But there were no arrests
or violent incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Church leaders renounced the organization's tax-exempt status in
1986, claiming that governmental regulation conflicts with their
religious faith. That prompted a legal battle after the church
refused to pay federal withholding taxes on the income of its 60
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did these things because we wanted to make Jesus Christ our
head, our master and our Lord,'' said the Rev. Greg Dixon Jr., the
church's pastor who succeeded his father in the post.
</P>
<P>
   ''We passed the point of no return a long time ago and there's
no turning back,'' Dixon told about 700 church members, supporters
and other activists who peacefully demonstrated in downtown
Indianapolis Saturday. Many were from Ohio, Kentucky and Michigan
in addition to Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   The rally, which church leaders had said would attract at least
1,000 people, had captured the attention of conservative talk show
hosts nationwide as supporters took their cases to the Internet,
claiming the issue goes beyond religion and raises questions about
what they see as the federal government's growing authority.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know the government can do whatever they want to do,'' said
Joe McDonald, a church member and protester. ''We'd like to make it
inconvenient for them to take us out. This is the last stand.''

<HEADLINE> Brit Appoints New Anguilla Leader  </HEADLINE>
By WYCLIFFE RICHARDSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE VALLEY, Anguilla (AP) -- Britain's governor to Anguilla named
Osbourne Fleming as the Caribbean territory's new chief minister
Saturday after his former opposition party won legislative
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming, whose coalition won four of seven seats in Friday's
vote, will be sworn in Monday, British Gov. Peter Johnston said in
his statement.
</P>
<P>
   All seven incumbents in the assembly were re-elected -- but
because one of the assembly members had switched political parties,
outgoing Chief Minister Hubert Hughes lost his majority.
</P>
<P>
   Anguilla, which depends heavily on upscale tourism, had elected
a coalition government in March 1999 that quickly crumbled in a
dispute between Hughes and Finance Minister Victor Banks.
</P>
<P>
   Banks left Hughes' Anguilla United Movement and joined the rival
Anguilla Democratic Party United Front. The defection shrank
Hughes' share of seats in the assembly from four to three.
Opposition members boycotted the assembly and prevented it from
meeting, forcing Hughes to call early elections.
</P>
<P>
   Voter turnout on the island of 10,000 people was 64 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Anguilla's political deadlock had exasperated officials in
Britain, while local residents complained officials did little to
create jobs or respond to a London proposal that would change the
relationship between Britain and its territories.

<P>
   FRASER, Mich. (AP) -- A possible arson fire at an apartment
complex killed a firefighter and a resident early Saturday,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser volunteer firefighter David Sutton, 27, died trying to
put out the fire at the O'Brien Co-Op Apartments in suburban
Detroit where a resident, whose name was not immediately known,
also died, police said.
</P>
<P>
   A second firefighter, Robert Kokko, 32, was listed in serious
condition in the University of Michigan Medical Center's burn unit.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities responded to a garage fire at 2:46 a.m., about 45
minutes before being told another fire had broken out at the
Woodside Manor Apartments. A report then surfaced that smoke had
been spotted at the nearby Co-Op Apartments, police said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear if the fires were related. Arson
was suspected at the Co-Op complex, but authorities had not yet
pinpointed the cause.
</P>
<P>
   Another fire, also believed to be arson, swept through Woodside
Manor on Friday morning, when two residents suffered smoke
inhalation.

<HEADLINE> A&AMP;M Plants Commemorative Saplings  </HEADLINE>
By MEGAN K. STACK, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) -- Slim saplings, just taller than a
grown person, were nestled into the dirt Saturday in memory of 12
students crushed to death in the bonfire collapse at Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   Aggies dabbed at their eyes or stood quietly, watching the
shovels flash. For years to come, 12 live oaks will grow at the
edge of campus, with plaques bearing a victim's name.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Nutt, 20, helped spade dirt over the tree dedicated to
victim Jerry Self.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was our buddy,'' he said. ''This'll last forever.''
</P>
<P>
   The 50-foot tower of logs collapsed Nov. 18, killing 12 and
injuring another 27.
</P>
<P>
   The fatalities cast a somber shadow on the springtime tradition
known as replant. Founded a decade ago, the ritual is meant to
replenish the greenery in and around College Station, a balance to
the massive tree cutting done in the months before the bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the young trees planted every year, the replant
committee wanted to create the live oak grove in memory of their
dead peers, said student Christopher McRae.
</P>
<P>
   ''These things last 300 years -- crazy long amounts of time,''
McRae said. ''They won't go away in a few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to hundreds of Aggies clustered at the polo fields for
the planting ceremonies, A&AMP;M president Ray Bowen said the trees
will stand in tribute to ''that horrible day.
</P>
<P>
   ''For generations, we will be able to come to this place and
contemplate the Aggies we lost,'' Bowen said.

<HEADLINE> World's Population Getting Fatter  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The world's population is growing -- at the
waist. For the first time in history, there may be as many people
overweight, 1.1 billion, as underfed, researchers report.
</P>
<P>
   Just because people are gaining weight does not mean the world
is better fed or healthier than it was two decades ago when
millions more were starving, the environmental research group
Worldwatch Institute said in a report released Sunday. In fact, the
report says being obese and underweight often results from the same
problem: malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
   In some countries there is a growing ''weight gap.'' Well-off
minorities in India, China, Brazil and some other developing
nations are growing fat as the poor go hungry.
</P>
<P>
   America and other wealthier countries have the opposite problem:
The richer and better-educated tend to eat right, while the poor
often balloon from a diet of cheap and fatty fast foods.
</P>
<P>
   ''Often, nations simply have traded hunger for obesity, and
diseases of poverty for diseases of excess,'' said Worldwatch
researcher Brian Halwell, who wrote the report with fellow
researcher Gary Gardner.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, 55 percent of the population is
overweight, with one in four adults considered obese, according to
the most recent surveys cited in the report.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, the United Kingdom and Germany also have overweight
majorities, U.N. studies show.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, 56 percent of Bangladesh's population is
underweight. The figure is 53 percent for India.
</P>
<P>
   Despite overall progress in feeding the world that has led to
sharp reductions of underweight children in Asia and Latin America
since 1980, the number of underfed children continues to grow in
the poorest countries, in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Both the overweight and the underweight live in worlds of
sickness, disability, shortened life expectancy and lower
productivity levels, Halwell said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not based on some fashion magazine's notion of proper
weight or the standard set by the latest sitcom star,'' but on a
widely accepted international standard, Halwell said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusions are based on the ''body mass index,'' or BMI,
with 19-25 considered normal. A person's BMI is weight in pounds,
divided by the square of height in inches, then multiplied by 703.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have the coexistence of a sizable and growing population of
overweight people with a persistent population of underweight
people in poorer countries,'' Halwell said. Both groups suffer from
malnutrition, he said, a condition of nutritional deficiency often
associated only with those who have too little to eat.
</P>
<P>
   While countries, including the United States, do not generally
include height and weight questions in census questionnaires,
medical clinics, doctors and hospitals in most countries collect
and report the data.
</P>
<P>
   Halwell and Gardner use World Health Organization, United
Nations and individual government figures to calculate that a
global weigh-in would find 1.1 billion men, women and children
underweight, down slightly from the 1980s, and about the same
number overweight -- a considerable increase.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusions differ from recent U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization estimates that 790 million people in poor countries
are chronically hungry. Halwell said that figure is lower because
it is based on calories available in the food supply rather than
actual medical data.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the hungry Third World, reports in the Journal of
the American Medical Association in October described obesity as a
U.S. epidemic that now affects one in five adults, killing 300,000
a year. A decade ago, only one in eight Americans hit the obesity
mark of 30 on the body mass index.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwatch cites nutrition programs in Cuba and Kerala state in
India as significantly reducing the number of underweight people by
focusing on vulnerable women and children. In Singapore, a school
program called the Trim and Fit Scheme has cut obesity among
children by up to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Worldwatch report also proposes a tax on foods based on
nutritional value per calorie, with fast food items getting the
highest tax and fresh fruits and vegetables possibly sold tax-free.

<HEADLINE> Civil Rights Groups Want LAPD Probe  </HEADLINE>
By ERICA WERNER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A coalition of 49 civil rights groups added
its voice Saturday to the growing chorus of people calling for an
independent review of the widening Los Angeles Police Department
corruption scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Coalition supporters including state Sen. Tom Hayden, D-Los
Angeles, and representatives of Amnesty International and the
American Civil Liberties Union insisted at a downtown news
conference that the police department cannot police itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''By now it should be painfully clear to any impartial observer
that nothing less than a truly independent investigation of the
ever-deepening LAPD corruption and brutality scandal can ever hope
to uncover the full truth,'' said James Lafferty, executive
director of the National Lawyers Guild in Los Angeles, an activist
group that's part of the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ''Trusting the LAPD to police itself is like trusting the fox to
guard the hen house,'' said Daniel P. Tokaji, an attorney with the
Southern California branch of the ACLU.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition called the news conference in front of police
headquarters in response to an internal police report on the
Rampart scandal released Wednesday. The report was brutally
critical of mediocrity and lax oversight in the department, but did
not call for outside review.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal, which came to light last fall, has centered on
allegations by former Officer Rafael Perez that officers in an
anti-gang unit operating in the poor, mostly Hispanic Rampart
neighborhood beat, framed and even shot suspects. The revelations
have led to 40 convictions being overturned and 20 officers being
relieved of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Bernard C. Parks has insisted no outside
investigation is necessary, pledging to implement the 108
recommendations in the 362-page Board of Inquiry report. Mayor
Richard Riordan has backed Parks up and so have the majority of
members of the city council.

<HEADLINE> Gay Pride Parade in Australia  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE CORDER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- A rainbow-colored Noah's Ark complete
with pairs of dancing men in animal costumes led more than 7,000
marchers Saturday in the Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras parade through
Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   This year was the 23rd parade, a celebration that grew from a
civil rights march into one of the world's largest gay pride
events. The crowd was expected to reach three quarters of a million
people.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 200 floats and thousands of marchers, some had a
social point to make.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lawrence was among dozens of Aboriginals who took part in
order to raise the profile of gay men in indigenous communities.
Daubed in purple paint and wearing only a shimmering miniskirt, he
was dancing behind a float with ''Our community our Queen'' written
in gold on a huge pink boomerang.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are expressing and celebrating sexual diversity in
Aboriginal ... communities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other marchers dressed as tampons to protest the government's
decision to tax women's sanitary products.
</P>
<P>
   One float was covered in multicolored ''rings of friendship''
echoing the five Olympic rings and reminding onlookers that Sydney
will host the 2000 Games in September.
</P>
<P>
   Others simply dressed up in the most exotic costumes they could
piece together. Two marchers were dressed only in empty water
bottles collected from gay dance parties.
</P>
<P>
   Costume designer Barbara Hardman from Sydney wore a sequined
outfit she said had 1,500 peacock feathers and took six people 50
hours to make.
</P>
<P>
   The event has become a huge moneymaker for the city. An economic
impact survey showed that the 1998 parade generated just under $60
million in revenue for Sydney businesses as tourists flooded the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the vast number of participants and spectators crammed
into a few streets in the upscale Paddington neighborhood, police
Sunday reported only four arrests during the celebrations and said
the crowd was well-behaved.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney's two most senior Roman Catholic and Anglican clerics
condemned the event last week as ''an exercise in gross
exhibitionism that promotes a homosexual lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Event president David McLachlan was unrepentant.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that is probably a pretty good analysis of what this
is about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More religious groups than ever before -- including Roman
Catholics and Anglicans -- took part.

<HEADLINE> Rev. Jackson Targets Race Profiling  </HEADLINE>
By KATE N. GROSSMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- The Rev. Jesse Jackson on Saturday called for
Congress to hold hearings on racial profiling among police, in the
judicial system and in expulsion policies in schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an old sick phenomenon with a new name,'' said Jackson
during a rally at his Chicago headquarters. ''It used to be called
just racism. Now they dress it up and call it racial profiling.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson was flanked by attorney Johnnie Cochran Jr. and several
Highland Park police officers who have accused their department of
targeting minority drivers.
</P>
<P>
   He also announced plans for a Chicago ''Day of Dignity'' march
on April 4 that will focus on ending the ''expelling, shelling and
jailing'' of minorities. April 4 is the day Martin Luther King Jr.
was assassinated in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson had hoped to make his announcement with Kadiatou Diallo,
mother of slain West African immigrant Amadou Diallo, and the Rev.
Al Sharpton at his side. But they canceled because Diallo was ill.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Jackson used the rally to call for civil rights
charges against the four New York City police officers acquitted in
the shooting death of Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said the officers were driven by racial fear when they
shot the unarmed man outside his Bronx apartment last year. Jackson
said he was disturbed to hear a juror say that race wasn't
discussed during deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The jury's tragic mistake was that they never discussed race
in the jury room,'' Jackson said. ''That's like trying a drowning
case without discussing water.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is reviewing the case to determine if
federal civil rights charges should be filed.

Confederate Flag Rally Held in Ala.
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- A group that wants the South to secede from the
union staged a Confederate flag-waving rally today, a day before President
Clinton was to lead marchers across a Selma bridge to mark the 35th anniversary
of ''Bloody Sunday'' in the civil rights movement. Bloody Sunday was the day
scores of black voting rights demonstrators were beaten by state troopers and
sheriff's officers as they crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge on a march to
Montgomery. After today's rally, members of the Southern nationalist
organization signed a ''Declaration of Southern Cultural Independence,''
described as the first step in what they hope is a second secession by the
South.

Bradley Invokes Truman During Speech

   NEW YORK (AP) -- An upbeat Bill Bradley brushed aside long odds facing his
campaign today and spoke of ''a world of possibilities guided by goodness,''
reminding his volunteers that another Missouri native, Harry Truman, defied the
polls to win an election more than 50 years ago. Bradley was accompanied by
former New York City Mayor Ed Koch and actor Harvey Keitel when he met in
Greenwich Village with volunteers. He and his wife, Ernestine, also were holding
a rally on New York's Upper West Side before heading to a ''Democrat Days''
event in Hannibal, Mo.

Suprowicz was abducted Wednesday by members of the Yamaneyatain tribe. The

Mozambique Survivors Flock to Camps

rooftops and clinging to trees. As supplies and equipment arrived from around
the world, many survivors gulped down the first meal they had eaten in four or
five days. Aid workers expected the death toll from the disaster to soar into
the thousands as floodwaters in southern Mozambique receded and revealed the
twisted mud-covered remains of the dead.

World's Population Getting Fatter
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the first time in history, there may be as many people
overweight, 1.1 billion, as underfed, researchers report. Just because people
are gaining weight also does not mean the world is better fed, officials said
Sunday. In some countries there is a growing ''weight gap.'' Well-off minorities
in India, China, Brazil and some other developing nations are growing fat as the
poor go hungry. America and other wealthier countries have the opposite problem:
The richer and better-educated tend to eat right, while the poor often balloon
from a diet of cheap and fatty fast foods.

UCLA Upsets No. 1 Stanford 94-93 in OT
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- A wild and controversial UCLA upset of top-ranked
Stanford ended with Bruins coach Steve Lavin hugging a referee and shirtless
UCLA players running back and forth to the locker room in dismay and then
celebration. JaRon Rush, playing his first game after a nine-game suspension,
hit a disputed baseline jumper with 3 seconds remaining in overtime as UCLA
defeated Stanford 94-93 today. Rush, who scored 19 points to lead the Bruins,
grabbed a loose ball under the UCLA basket after a wild scrum during which the
shot clock appeared to expire. Stanford's Casey Jacobsen then missed a desperate
half-court shot, and UCLA ran to its locker room in celebration.

<HEADLINE> Polish Ambassador Freed in Yemen  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA ABU-NASR, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN'A, Yemen (AP) -- Yemeni tribesmen released the Polish
ambassador unharmed early Sunday after holding him captive for
nearly four days.
</P>
<P>
   Krzysztof Suprowicz arrived Sunday morning at the embassy in the
capital San'a, his wife Nina said.
</P>
<P>
   Suprowicz was abducted Wednesday by members of the Yamaneyatain
tribe after dropping his wife and daughter off at the dentist in
downtown San'a. The abductors were demanding the Yemeni government
free fellow tribesmen arrested recently in exchange for the
diplomat's release.
</P>
<P>
   An Interior Ministry official said the kidnappers had been given
a midnight deadline to turn over the diplomat or the government
would use force. Officials said he was freed just after midnight
Sunday morning, but gave no details on how the release took place.
</P>
<P>
   ''I confirm he's at the embassy. He's on his way home. I'm
waiting for him,'' Nina Suprowicz told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Suprowicz was the first ambassador to be kidnapped in Yemen,
where tribesmen often kidnap foreigners, including diplomats, to
pressure the government into releasing jailed tribesmen or to
provide money or better services, such as new roads.
</P>
<P>
   Hostages usually are treated as guests and released unharmed.
However, in 1998, four kidnapped tourists were killed in a botched
rescue attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The ambassador's release followed a day of roller-coaster
negotiations, which nearly set him free hours earlier. He was being
held in rural areas a few hours drive from the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Yemeni Deputy Foreign Minister Abdullah al-Sayeghi had met with
Polish Embassy officials Saturday and it appeared Suprowicz was
about to be released. However, the kidnappers then abruptly called
off their plans.
</P>
<P>
   Sources within the tribe who spoke on condition of anonymity
said the kidnappers had taken Suprowicz to a neutral party late
Saturday afternoon with the intent of releasing him. But shortly
after the kidnappers arrived, they changed their minds and decided
to keep the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   The sources said without elaborating that the Yamaneyatain tribe
felt the government had broken a promise it had made to the
kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
   Suprowicz has been living in the impoverished Arab state since
1996.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Poland's President Aleksander Kwasniewski suggested
Warsaw should reconsider whether maintain a Polish diplomatic
mission in the country because of its poor safety record.

<HEADLINE> Texas Team Falls Short After Tragedy  </HEADLINE>
By JIM VERTUNO, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- The quest by the Brock High School girl's
basketball team to win a state title in honor of their teammates
killed in an automobile crash had captivated their entire
community.
</P>
<P>
   About 600 of the town's 700 residents made the 244-mile trip to
see their team compete Saturday for the Class 2A crown.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Eagles wanted to win their first state title to honor
the family, friends and teammates who were supposed to be with
them. And they wanted to bring some comfort to a town still
grieving the December 1998 crash that killed four students.
</P>
<P>
   Brock lost the championship 47-35 to Farwell, but the team -- and
its devoted followers -- did not lose their determination or
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel real bad, but we have two more years,'' said Brock
sophomore Emily Osina, whose sister, Lacey, was one of those
killed. ''We will win state the next two years.''
</P>
<P>
   The players dedicated their title run to former teammates Lacey
Osina, Staci Lee and Mandy McWhorter and friend Whitney Welch. Lee
and McWhorter were underclassmen and would have been on this year's
team.
</P>
<P>
   Rickey Carter, the driver of the pickup truck that hit the
girls, has been charged with four counts of intoxication
manslaughter. He awaits a March 20 hearing on whether to move the
case to another county.
</P>
<P>
   A memorial service marked the one-year anniversary of the
deaths, and an eternal flame burns at the gravesite in the town
cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   The team's run through the playoffs had been relatively easy.
The starting lineup of four sophomores and a freshman rolled over
defending champion Hughes Springs in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   With the motivation of playing for something deeper, this would
be the year they won state. Ten previous state tournament
appearances had come up short.
</P>
<P>
   Brock fans filled their section of the University of Texas'
Frank Erwin Center 45 minutes before tipoff.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the publicity surrounding their championship run,
the Brock team smiled and giggled through their pregame
shootaround.
</P>
<P>
   Kaycie Cole's 3-pointer for a 3-0 lead brought the Brock fans to
their feet. And then it got grim. Farwell, the team that was
supposed to be overmatched, hit two quick shots for a 4-3 lead and
never trailed again.
</P>
<P>
   Brock rallied to pull within 39-32 in the fourth quarter but
couldn't sustain the comeback. As the closing seconds ticked off
and the game out of reach, Emily Osina headed to the bench with her
jersey pulled up to her face.
</P>
<P>
   She broke into sobs when she sat down, the Brock fans sitting in
stunned silence.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a hurt inside,'' said Doug McWhorter, Mandy McWhorter's
father. ''But I know Mandy, Staci, Lacey and Whitney were with them
today, encouraging them on. We can't say how proud we are.''
</P>
<P>
   The tears eventually stopped and smiles returned to the players'
faces by the time of the trophy presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sure they'll beat themselves up for a couple of days. I
know in Emily's case, she really wanted to win for her sister.''
said Brock coach Tony Phillips. ''But this is a strong bunch. They
played their hearts out, so they didn't come up short.''

<HEADLINE> Lift of Dating Ban Stunned Campus  </HEADLINE>
By JIM DAVENPORT, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- Bob Jones University's decision to lift
its half-century-old ban on interracial dating has stunned students
and the fundamentalist Christian school's supporters who learned
about it Friday night in a national television interview with
President Bob Jones III.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think even his own secretary knew what he was going to
do,'' said school spokesman Jonathan Pait.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of students and supporters gathered at the
university's auditorium to watch Jones' interview on CNN's ''Larry
King Live.'' People were surprised, said senior Naion Lundy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't expect it at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lundy, also a sergeant with the university's public safety
department, said Saturday that reporters were not permitted to
interview students and faculty on campus.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said the extraordinary national scrutiny the school has
received since George W. Bush made a campaign appearance led to the
move.
</P>
<P>
   ''This thing has gotten so out of hand,'' Jones said. ''All of a
sudden the university is at the center of a Republican presidential
debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush appeared at the school last month and later apologized for
failing to criticize the school's anti-Catholic views and racial
policies.
</P>
<P>
   The Greenville school banned interracial dating in the 1950s,
when an Asian family threatened to sue after their son, a student,
almost married a white girl, a school spokesman has said.
</P>
<P>
   The first black student was not admitted until the 1970s and the
school lost its tax exemption in 1983 after a 13-year battle with
the Internal Revenue Service, which said the school's policies were
discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   The school had defended the dating ban based on a biblical
interpretation that God created people differently for a reason.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Dayton graduated from Bob Jones last year and now works at
a Bible gift shop across the street. He and his wife, who still
attends, were surprised and happy about the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can tell you they are not Jew-hating, they are not
Catholic-hating and they are not racist,'' Dayton said. ''This was
just an old rule that needed to be changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The university is a popular stop for Republican candidates
seeking conservative support. Bush appeared at the school shortly
after he lost to Arizona Sen. John McCain in the New Hampshire
primary.
</P>
<P>
   After losing South Carolina, McCain's campaign made ''Catholic
Voter Alert'' calls in the next states, Michigan and Washington, to
tell them of Bush's visit to Bob Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Those remarks have hurt McCain more than Bob Jones, said Jerry
Brockman, who owns a clothing store nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just admire that university for sticking up for its
principles,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina House Speaker Pro Tem Terry Haskins, a Greenville
Republican and Bob Jones graduate, resigned as co-chairman of
McCain's state campaign after the Arizona senator's criticism
increased.
</P>
<P>
   He said Jones wrestles with reconciling deep spiritual
convictions and the changing social and political landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ''It hurts him to be portrayed as an institution that teaches
hate,'' Haskins said.
</P>
<P>
   The school of 3,500 students in the Appalachian foothills has
stuck to its fundamentalist guns and often doled out as much
criticism as it received.
</P>
<P>
   Jones III, president since 1971, and his father, who died in
1997, have been sharp-tongued about those they believe have
abandoned the strict teachings of the Bible, including Billy Graham
and the pope.
</P>
<P>
   Graham should not have reached out across denominations for his
crusades, Jones III says. Instead of meeting Pope John Paul II when
he visited Columbia in 1987, Jones Jr. said he would rather ''speak
to the devil himself.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Jones family almost reflects the changes facing the
school.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Jones IV is the first in four generations to break ranks for
a career outside the university. Jones, 33, a writer for the
Christian magazine World, said he made a deliberate decision not to
follow in his namesakes' footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   He said his own academic career belies the charge his father is
anti-Catholic. He earned a master's degree in history at Notre Dame
with the full support of his father, he said.

<HEADLINE> Bush skips '60 Minutes' after CBS agrees to McCain request forequal time  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- George W. Bush scrapped a planned interview
on Sunday's ''60 Minutes'' after his Republican presidential rival,
Sen. John McCain, was offered equal time by CBS.
</P>
<P>
   McCain campaign aides say they contacted the show to suggest a
debate or at least get equal time for their candidate. A CBS
official says the network was interested in offering McCain a
chance to appear on the show anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign had viewed the interview as ''a good
opportunity to speak to a lot of people'' before Tuesday's
13-state, ''Super Tuesday'' voting, spokesman Karen Hughes said
Saturday. She said giving McCain equal time ''changed the nature of
the interview request,'' so the campaign canceled.
</P>
<P>
   ''They said they would understand if we decided not go to
forward, and so that's what we decided to do,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, Bush had accepted a longstanding invitation
to appear on the CBS program.
</P>
<P>
   With the Super Tuesday contests so near, CBS came to the
conclusion that devoting a segment to the Texas governor would be
unfair to McCain. Producers approached the Bush camp about
alternatives, but none was acceptable and the interview was
scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   ''With him accepting at that late hour so close to Super
Tuesday, we felt it would be necessary to have Senator McCain
either in the same segment, different interviews on the same show
or some way to give it balance,'' CBS spokesman Kevin Tedesco said.
</P>
<P>
   A McCain campaign aide said the Bush decision was not
surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the eve of Super Tuesday, he clearly is not interested in a
free-flowing exchange of ideas on one of the most-watched
television shows in the country,'' said McCain campaign spokesman
Todd Harris.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is he afraid of? It's no accident he's turning this down
as news is breaking on the $2.5 million being dumped into this
campaign by his cronies.''

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Victims Enter Camps  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE COHEN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALMEIRA, Mozambique (AP) -- Thousands of Mozambique's hungry and
thirsty flood victims straggled into makeshift camps Saturday after
days of huddling on rooftops or clinging to tree branches.
</P>
<P>
   As more supplies and equipment arrived from around the world --
including the first of three U.S. planes carrying boats from Miami
-- survivors converged on camps.
</P>
<P>
   There they gulped down cornmeal soup and beans, the first food
many had eaten in four or five days. Authorities estimated that 1
million people in this southeast African country urgently require
food, medicine and shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Aid officials said hunger and thirst had driven some to eat the
carcasses of drowned animals and to drink filthy floodwater,
putting them at risk of cholera, a highly contagious, often lethal
disease. People waiting for emergency help also stood among clouds
of malaria-carrying mosquitos.
</P>
<P>
   Aid workers expected the death toll from the disaster to soar
into the thousands as floodwaters in southern Mozambique receded
and revealed the twisted mud-covered remains of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Cyclone Eline, which along with three weeks of torrential rains
caused the flooding, was downgraded Friday to a tropical storm. On
Saturday, the dazed and dirty survivors, stripped of all their
possessions by the surging water, recounted their ordeals as they
congregated in the camps.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Mareleko spent five days in waist-deep water clinging
with his two wives to a tree. The tree's branches were beyond reach
and the swift current froze them against the trunk so they stood,
unable to sleep, until a South African Air Force helicopter rescued
them Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While they held on for their lives, the bodies of six neighbors
floated past.
</P>
<P>
   Mareleko, waiting in line to register at a camp near the village
of Palmeira, said he had no idea what he would do next. He was
simply thankful he and his immediate family were alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm feeling very happy I survived the water,'' the 24-year-old
farmer said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, clean water was in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   In one camp near Chokwe, there was not enough drinking water for
the 3,500 refugees, the World Food Program said.
</P>
<P>
   At the airport near Mozambique's steamy seaside capital of
Maputo, Charles Monteiro of the Spanish Red Cross was overseeing
the unloading of six water purifiers that together can clean 4,160
gallons an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ''These will be in operation soon,'' Monteiro said as the
equipment descended from the bowels of a massive Antonov cargo
plane. The machines are vital in averting outbreaks of cholera from
contaminated drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby on the airport tarmac, two other Antonovs from Germany
and Belgium were disgorging relief supplies, which smaller planes
and helicopters ferried to outlying regions.
</P>
<P>
   An Italian cargo plane landed in the central city of Beira with
40 tons of relief supplies, and the U.S. planeload of boats arrived
in Maputo on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Mozambique's National Disaster Coordination Center welcomed the
aid but said more was needed. Authorities stressed that
distribution of the aid needed to be better coordinated to prevent
the relief supplies from piling up at depots or winding up in the
hands of corrupt officials. Officials at the center said some food
relief was already being sold in town markets.
</P>
<P>
   The agency also warned that floodwaters had shifted land mines
left over from Mozambique's civil war, which ended in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a dispute with neighboring South Africa was delaying
the arrival of American and British military relief efforts, the
Saturday Star of Johannesburg reported, quoting unidentified
British diplomatic sources.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said the South African government was insisting
that the United States and Britain base their aid operations in
Maputo rather than Hoedspruit air base in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   A Royal Air Force Tristar transport aircraft was being held on
the ground at Hoedspruit and a second Tristar was awaiting
clearance before taking off from Britain, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. military aircraft, dispatched by President Clinton to aid
the relief operation, were also delaying their departure for
Africa, pending clearance from the South African government to land
at Hoedspruit, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
   London and Washington prefer the superior facilities at
Hoedspruit to those in Mozambique, but Mozambican officials have
said the military relief effort would be better based on their
soil, it said.
</P>
<P>
   In London, Mozambique's high commissioner to Britain on Saturday
criticized the international response to the flood as being too
slow.
</P>
<P>
   ''The delay of response from the international community to come
with relief to the Mozambican people really has caused the loss of
so many lives,'' Eduardo Koloma said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Explains Chechnya in Mideast  </HEADLINE>
By TAREK AL-TABLAWI, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- In an attempt to ease Arab anger over its
war against Muslim rebels in Chechnya, Russia has reportedly
invited a delegation from the Arab League to come to the breakaway
republic.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-member Arab League released a statement Saturday saying
visiting Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov issued the invite.
The statement did not say whether a delegation would go to
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Many people in the Arab world sympathize with fellow Muslims in
Chechnya. Several Arab nations have sent aid to the Russian
republic and have urged Moscow to end its military offensive there.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow sent ground forces into Chechnya in September after
Muslim fighters based there invaded the neighboring republic of
Dagestan and after several bombing at apartment buildings blamed on
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov met Saturday with President Hosni Mubarak in the Red Sea
resort of Sharm el-Sheik. Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported
that the talks revolved around the situation in Chechnya and the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
   In a later meeting with his Egyptian counterpart Amr Moussa,
Ivanov denied that the conflict in Chechnya had hurt Russia's
historically warm relations with the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov blamed the conflict in Chechnya on ''terrorism,'' adding:
''You in Egypt have suffered from this before.'' He was referring
to the Egyptian government's nearly 8-year struggle against Muslim
extremists seeking an Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Chechen people are victims of this terrorism,'' which is
aided by ''elements that have no relation to Chechnya,'' Ivanov
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, university students protested Ivanov's visit to Egypt
with rallies in Cairo and the Mediterranean coastal city of
Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
   In demonstrations on two separate campuses of Alexandria
University, students called for Arab unity, shouted anti-Israel
slogans and distributed leaflets saying ''Russian Foreign Minister
... You are not welcome.'' Police maintained a heavy presence just
outside the grounds, but the demonstrations did not spread.
</P>
<P>
   In the Egyptian capital, Cairo University students peacefully
protested Russia's offensive in Chechnya as well as last month's
Israeli air strikes on Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   In Saudi Arabia, Russian envoy Ramazan Abdulatipov met with
Crown Prince Abdullah. The prince told him the conflict in Chechnya
must stop, and the two sides should negotiate instead of spilling
more Muslim blood, a Saudi foreign ministry official said on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Abdulatipov was expected to meet Sunday with officials at the
Organization of the Islamic Conference to exchange views on the
conflict. The organization, based in the Red Sea port city of
Jiddah, represents 55 Islamic nations.
</P>
<P>
   Charity drives in Saudi Arabia for Chechen refugees have raised
more than $12.5 million.

<HEADLINE> Guerrillas Attack Israeli Base  </HEADLINE>
By SAM F. GHATTAS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Guerrillas attacked an Israeli military
outpost in southern Lebanon on Saturday night, wounding an Israeli
soldier and prompting strikes from Israeli warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas fired rockets at the military base at Beaufort, a
centuries-old mountaintop castle 12 miles north of the Israeli
border with commanding views of southern Lebanon and northern
Israel, Lebanese security officials said. Soldiers returned fire
from tanks, and Israeli artillery pounded the surrounding area, the
officials said on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The wounded Israeli soldier was evacuated by helicopter to
Israel for treatment, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, an Israeli security official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said the soldier was seriously injured and
being treated at a hospital in the northern Israeli city of Haifa.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army spokesman's office confirmed an exchange of
fire at the castle and airstrikes nearby.
</P>
<P>
   No further information was available on the casualties or
exchanges, which lasted more than an hour. None of the guerrilla
groups active in southern Lebanon immediately claimed
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   About 1{ hours after the attack, Israeli warplanes struck an
area southwest of the castle, firing at least one missile. Two
missiles were fired in a second airstrike 20 minutes later,
security officials said. The planes were believed to be pursuing
the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Iranian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas have killed seven Israeli
soldiers and six pro-Israeli militiamen, including the South
Lebanon Army militia's No. 2 commander, since Jan. 25. The
escalation in violence prompted Israeli warplanes to bomb three
power stations deep inside Lebanon on Feb. 8, wounding 15 civilians
and causing widespread power outages.
</P>
<P>
   Israel set up the zone it occupies in southern Lebanon in 1985
to protect its northern communities from cross-border guerrilla
raids. The border strip, 10 percent of Lebanon's territory, is
patrolled by 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 allied South Lebanon
Army militiamen.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, who has set a July deadline
for the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon, has
pledged even harsher retaliation if attacks continue.

<HEADLINE> Organic Food Standards To Be Set  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER, AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans hunger for any food promoted as
natural, consuming $6 billion worth of products labeled organic,
often with no guarantee they actually were grown and processed
without synthetic chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   That should change with the release, as early as Tuesday, of the
first national standards for organic food.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, expected to take effect this summer, will spell out
for the first time what it means for foods to be labeled organic.
They also will bar the use of genetically engineered crops or
irradiated ingredients in organic foods.
</P>
<P>
   Food grown and processed in accordance with those rules can
carry a seal of approval from the Agriculture Department, agency
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The rules ''give the consumers assurance that they've been
looking for that the products meet a set of standards that have
been enforced and that those standards are the same regardless of
the state it was grown in,'' said Katherine DiMatteo, executive
director of the Organic Trade Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''That will build consumer confidence in the label and certainly
will encourage sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the organic industry say the rules could lead
consumers into thinking organic products are safer or more
nutritious than conventional food. There is no evidence that is
true, said Christine Bruhn, director of the Center for Consumer
Research at the University of California-Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope they will understand what organic means and make this
an informed choice,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the 10,000 farms nationwide that claim to be organic,
only 6,600 are approved by the 88 different state or private
certifying agencies around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen states have no regulations for organic farming. Eleven
others, including California, have production standards but no
certification process for ensuring that farmers comply with them.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the industry has been growing at a rate of 20 percent
annually over the past decade. Sales are expected to reach $6
billion this year, according to the trade association.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the nation's biggest food manufacturers are getting into
the natural-foods business, including General Mills Inc. and H.J.
Heinz Co. General Mills has a new organic cereal and announced in
December that it was buying Small Planet Foods, a leading producer
of organic food products.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half the population eats organic products at least
occasionally, a recent ABC News Poll found.
</P>
<P>
   The organic market is likely to continue growing at a
double-digit pace for years to come, said David Nelson, a food
industry analyst with CS First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ''Consumers are buying food less as a staple or basic fuel and
more as an expression of lifestyle, like clothing or choice of car.
It's a niche market certainly, but rapidly growing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rules are expected to:
</P>
<P>
   --require that farmers go through a mandatory planning process
and have their practices certified by an approved state or private
agency.
</P>
<P>
   --restrict the pesticides, fertilizers and seed treatments they
can apply.
</P>
<P>
   --limit the kind of additives and packaging processors can use.
Banned will be additives like sulfites, nitrates or nitrite, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   Congress ordered national organic standards in 1990. Seven years
later, rules proposed by USDA were rejected by the industry because
they left open the possibility of allowing irradiated and
genetically engineered food and the use of sewage sludge as
fertilizer. Those possibilities have been ruled out in the new
proposals, said Andy Solomon, a spokesman for Agriculture Secretary
Dan Glickman.
</P>
<P>
   Producers and processors are expected to have 18 months to
comply; enforcement is left to states and private agencies approved
by USDA.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of national standards, foods claiming to be
organic are labeled in many different. Some list a certifying
agency, others do not.
</P>
<P>
   ''They can charge more if it says organic and it may not be,''
said Jennifer Brenner, who was shopping Saturday at a Fresh Fields
natural foods store in Falls Church, Va. ''It's healthy whether
it's truly organic or not, but it would be nice to know for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   The store carried four varieties of organic apple sauce: One
claimed certification by ''OCIA,'' a reference to the Organic Crop
Improvement Association; a second was certified by Vermont Organic
Growers; a third cited a private California certifying agency,
Quality Assurance International; the label on Fresh Fields' house
brand simply said it was grown in accordance with California law.

Bush, McCain Take on Northeast

<P>
   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) -- Presidential hopefuls John McCain and George W. Bush
were back on the campaign trail in the Northeast region today, hoping to sway
voters before the ''Super Tuesday'' primary on March 7. Accompanied by New York
Gov. George Pataki and a host of New York congressmen, Bush spoke about
education policy as he visited Rochester and Binghamton in a quest for the
state's 101 convention delegates. Polls show McCain leading Bush in some New
England states, so the Arizona senator started his day in Boston before flying
to an event in Portland, Maine. Polls indicate a tight race in New York and
McCain was also making stops in Syracuse and Rochester.

as UCLA upset No. 1 Stanford 94-93 today. Rush, who scored 19 points to lead the
Bruins, grabbed a loose ball under the UCLA basket after a wild scrum during
which the shot clock appeared to expire. Stanford's Casey Jacobsen then missed a
desperate half-court shot, and UCLA ran to its locker room in celebration.

<HEADLINE> Polls: McCain Trailing in Calif.  </HEADLINE>
By RON FOURNIER, AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In the dreamy days after his New Hampshire
landslide, John McCain set out to win five more primaries, divorce
George W. Bush from his establishment allies and march triumphantly
into California promising to fight the ''evil influences'' of
political money.
</P>
<P>
   Reality wasn't quite so kind: The Republican presidential
candidate won two more primaries, helped galvanize Bush's
conservative base and staggered into California promising to fight
the ''evil influences'' of Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somewhere along the way he lost his way,'' said California GOP
consultant Don Sipple.
</P>
<P>
   Poor scheduling, a muddled message, a skeptical electorate and
the sheer force of Bush's political organization combined to put
McCain 20 percentage points behind in polls of California
Republicans, according to GOP analysts and some of his own
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   And they say he has little chance of catching up before
Tuesday's primary.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator is still in good position to win the state's
non-binding popular vote, but party rules will deny him
California's 162 delegates -- which would be lifeblood for his
candidacy -- unless he wins a majority of GOP voters.
</P>
<P>
   California is the biggest prize in this week's 13-state election
bonanza, a ''Super Tuesday'' of GOP voting that will yield 613 of
the 1,034 delegates needed to claim the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Latest polls showed Bush leading in Georgia, Maryland, Missouri
and Ohio -- which combine for 189 delegates. New York, with 101
delegates, was competitive and most of New England -- which together
award 102 delegates -- was leaning McCain's way.
</P>
<P>
   With Bush gaining ground all over, McCain's battlefield was
shrinking.
</P>
<P>
   His advisers don't think he can remain in the race without
winning California's delegates or claiming a moral victory with a
majority of the state popular vote and a sweep of the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need something from both coasts,'' said political director
John Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   That is why McCain and Bush plan to wrap up their ''Super
Tuesday'' campaigns here.
</P>
<P>
   After rallying religious conservatives for victories in South
Carolina and Virginia, Bush modified his message for California. He
focused on his education record as Texas governor, knowing that
voters in California and other ''Super Tuesday'' states put a
premium on school reform.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's $3 million TV ad campaign, matched almost
dollar-for-dollar by McCain, includes a spot that highlights his
school agenda. Despite his efforts, Bush's support in California is
soft and the state could be troublesome for him in the general
election, as evidenced by polls showing that his unfavorable rating
among Californians has exceeded 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   His California political organization, in place for more than a
year, is a who's who of GOP powers, led by state Sen. Jim Brulte.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's California campaign began when Brian Kennedy, former
political director for failed GOP candidate Lamar Alexander, was
dispatched to the state in October. He found a threadbare team that
consisted of former Rep. Frank Riggs, R-Ca., and one of McCain's
former Naval Academy classmates.
</P>
<P>
   The organization doubled in size the next month, when two
congressional aides were hired.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his inability to court the Republican faithful in early
primary states, California's closed primary was fertile territory
for McCain. The central valley is loaded with former Democrats with
an independent streak, and GOP moderates dominate the coastal
areas.
</P>
<P>
   California consultant George Gorton said that once Bush
established himself as the front-runner, McCain needed to dislodge
the Texan's support by portraying him as a captive of the right
wing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think McCain has convinced California moderate
Republicans that Bush is not a moderate,'' Gorton said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain tried.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in Michigan's primary last week, he called Bush a ''Pat
Robertson Republican'' and tied him to a South Carolina university
with anti-Catholic traditions. Some analysts said that backfired,
particularly among the 40 percent of GOP voters in the state who
tell pollsters they are ''strongly conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He bit the hands that pray for him,'' said Republican
consultant Alex Castellanos.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had transformed the race. He was no longer just a
political reformer and Vietnam war hero -- the labels that brought
him this far -- he was a bloc-bashing politician, striking out at
the party's core. A senior McCain strategist said seeking a
fundamental party change hurt him in California.
</P>
<P>
   Along with his message, McCain lost momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Bush victories last week in Virginia, North Dakota and
Washington, a state McCain was expected to win, sapped energy from
the senator's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller things also hurt. McCain's local leadership complained
that the media savvy candidate spent too much time in conservative
strongholds at the expense of the large media markets such as Los
Angeles and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem was the candidate himself. Worn out by the
Michigan and South Carolina campaigns, McCain canceled a day's
worth of California time to rest.
</P>
<P>
   He also pulled out of a debate, then changed his mind and
participated by satellite. The damage was already done: Polls
showed voters questioning his commitment to the state, and the
initial decision to bow out divided his staff.
</P>
<P>
   On the bright side, McCain proved in New Hampshire and Michigan
that his support isn't always reflected in polls. Eleventh-hour
surges are common in California.
</P>
<P>
   ''He can still win,'' said Sipple, who worked on Bush's 1994
governor's race. ''But the cosmic tumblers would have to turn just
right.''

<HEADLINE> Balloonist Expected Home Next Week  </HEADLINE>
By KATE N. GROSSMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- After resting overnight in a hospital in the
Asian nation of Myanmar, balloonist Kevin Uliassi spent Saturday
packing up his 160-foot balloon and capsule.
</P>
<P>
   Uliassi on Friday abandoned his attempt to become the first solo
balloonist to circle the globe, 10 days after lifting off from a
stone quarry outside Rockford in northern Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   He landed his balloon safely in a field in central Myanmar,
formerly known as Burma, after traveling more than 13,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't injured, except for a few bruises, flight spokesman
Scott Lorenz said. He expects Uliassi to return to the United
States sometime next week.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the location Uliassi chose for landing is near
the only ballooning port in Southeast Asia, Lorenz said. Cary
Crawley, a pilot at the ballooning station, helped UIiassi pack up
the balloon, which was described as being in good condition.
</P>
<P>
   Because of limited communications since the landing, the ground
crew still does not know why Uliassi ended the flight, Lorenz said.
They believe he had enough fuel, food and oxygen to complete the
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Renee Uliassi said her husband should have no regrets about
failing to circle the planet.
</P>
<P>
   ''This project was a success for us,'' she said Saturday. ''As
two individuals -- like the common man out there -- we were able to
pull together a balloon that could fly around the world. And Kevin
got a trip of a lifetime.''

<HEADLINE> Portuguese Consul Missing in Brazil  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- A Portuguese consul in southern
Brazil has disappeared, and police said Saturday they found a
bloody trail leading through his house.
</P>
<P>
   A maid reported Miguel Jose Fawor missing after she found his
home empty and the door open when she reported for work Friday at
the house in Curitiba, 420 miles southwest of Rio de Janeiro,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators found a bloody trail leading from an upstairs room
to the garage, police chief Fauze Salmen said. Later, Fawor's
Mercedes was found abandoned in a nearby neighborhood, a bloody
towel and hood in the trunk, Salmen said.
</P>
<P>
   A witness told police two men left the car there around midnight
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Fawor was last seen at his house late Thursday night by a
security guard, Salmen said. An answering machine was missing from
the house, probably because there was information recorded there
that could have helped investigators, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Fawor lived alone and had been stationed in Curitiba for three
years.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Invokes Truman During Speech  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- An upbeat Bill Bradley brushed aside long odds
facing his campaign Saturday and spoke of ''a world of
possibilities guided by goodness,'' reminding his volunteers that
another Missouri native, Harry Truman, defied the polls to win an
election more than 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley entered the final weekend before Super Tuesday behind in
the delegate count, trailing in polls and no longer considered a
threat to Democratic presidential rival Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know Harry Truman. They said he was finished in 1948, he
didn't have a chance,'' Bradley told volunteers in Greenwich
Village, who were preparing to canvass door to door. ''And you know
what happened there. He came from behind and won.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether by accident or by design, Bradley campaigned Saturday in
two states crucial to his life story -- Missouri, where he was born
and raised, and New York, where he became a professional basketball
star with the Knicks and learned both how to win and how to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was accompanied by former New York City Mayor Ed Koch
and actor Harvey Keitel when he met in Greenwich Village with
volunteers. He and his wife, Ernestine, also were holding a rally
on New York's Upper West Side before heading to a ''Democrat Days''
event in Hannibal, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore, meanwhile, campaigned in clear-sailing
style in Massachusetts and New York. He dropped by Charlie's
Sandwich Shoppe in Boston for blueberry pancakes, escorted by Mayor
Thomas M. Menino and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, who called Gore ''Mr.
Strong Economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Pecora, a Massachusetts state worker who said he
historically votes Republican, offered this observation: ''Bradley
doesn't have a shot. He doesn't seem to be competing with Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   All references to Bradley long gone from Gore's speeches, he
turned his fire on Republican presidential contenders John McCain
and George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by state officials and wrapped in sunshine, Gore told
about 2,000 supporters outside Faneuil Hall that Tuesday's votes in
15 states ''will be the decisive moment.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Republican candidates go into private meetings -- one of
them with Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson -- and they come out and
Falwell and Robertson pat them on the back and say 'we heard
everything we wanted to hear,''' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let me break that code for you. What they're saying is they
heard a solemn promise to give the right-wing extremist wing of the
Republican Party control of our Supreme Court and the
interpretation of our Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times endorsed Gore in Sunday editions saying he
has ''a burning desire to step out of his mentor's shadow and prove
that he possesses the self control and presidential high-mindedness
so lacking in Mr. Clinton.'' The Kansas City Star and the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch endorsed Bradley in weekend editions.
</P>
<P>
   The Post-Dispatch declared: ''Mr. Bradley lacks charisma but not
sincerity.'' In its editorial, The Star said Bradley ''can offer
fresh perspectives and can champion the party's best ideals without
the baggage that Gore must carry.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Gore changed into a kelly-green necktie and
promised the Irish-American Presidential Forum he would be
''studying up on'' the complexities of the Northern Ireland peace
process and would make peace there ''one of my causes'' in the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Bradley also launched a new direction for his
campaign, unveiling a stump speech criticizing Gore as a political
chameleon. Now Gore's name has disappeared from his speeches, and
Bradley is talking about ideas again and staking his survival on a
strong showing in New York and New England states in Tuesday's
string of primaries, although he's far behind in the polls in every
state.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he'll quit, Bradley smiles, ''One thing we know about
polls is they close very fast.''
</P>
<P>
   At Bradley pep rallies, however, introductions have taken on a
valedictory feel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Senator Bradley has brought some ideas to the table,'' Ben
Waxman, a Bradley volunteer, told students at Portland High School
in Maine. ''They are the best. They are the biggest. They are the
most daring.''
</P>
<P>
   And campaign post-mortems have begun.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign supporters in the Northeast, Bradley's strongest
region, wondered aloud when Bradley spent six days in Washington
state in advance of a Feb. 29 ''beauty contest'' primary that did
not assign delegates to the Democratic convention. To make matters
worse, Gore trounced Bradley there.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters have also expressed regrets that Bradley opted to
challenge Gore aggressively in the Iowa caucuses, hoping for a
January ''surprise,'' rather than stay focused on winning New
Hampshire. Gore won easily in Iowa and beat Bradley again by a
narrow margin in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, there is envy and disappointment that
McCain, Bradley's counterpart underdog on the GOP side, grabbed so
much press attention and support of independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not that I'm whining,'' said Gale Kaufman, a senior advisor to
the Bradley campaign in California, but the campaign ''fell off the
map'' once the press became fascinated with the McCain insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and his traveling core of advisors remain locked in the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign's theme song, played at most rallies, is ''Right
Here, Right Now.'' On the occasions when Bradley does look back, he
invokes history to explain his ''think big'' approach to child
poverty and health care, holding up Franklin Delano Roosevelt and
Thomas Jefferson as examples.
</P>
<P>
   After rallies, Bradley fans mill about, Bradley campaign
stickers affixed to their jackets, describing their feelings of
inspiration tinged with disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think his best position is to provoke thought, and he's done
that,'' said Judith Lessler of Fairfield, Conn.

<HEADLINE> Families of Lockerbie victims have tough questions for newprosecutor  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new chief prosecutor in the Pam Am Flight 103 bombing case
arrived in the U.S. Saturday to reassure families of the victims
that the case against two suspects remains on track.
</P>
<P>
   Scotland's Lord Advocate Colin Boyd met with families and U.S.
officials near Boston, and has scheduled another meeting Monday in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Monetti, 57, of Cherry Hill, N.J., listened to Boyd's
assurances, but said the sudden resignation of Boyd's predecessor
was another blow to the families.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd took over the case following the unexpected resignation of
former Lord Advocate Andrew Hardie last month. It was the latest in
a series of indications raising doubts as to whether the
prosecution's case is as straightforward or watertight as U.S. and
British authorities have asserted.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't need the agony, and the trial is going to be long
enough as it is,'' said Monetti, whose 20-year-old son, Rick, died
on the plane. ''I wish it was half over already.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyd can expect more tough questions from families at Monday's
meeting, according to the parents of another New Jersey victim.
</P>
<P>
   ''He can reassure to his heart's content, but we still have lots
of questions,'' said Susan Cohen of Cape May Court House, whose
20-year-old daughter, Theodora, was among 38 New Jerseyans killed
when the Pan Am jet exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland on Dec. 21,
1988.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion killed 259 passengers and crew -- including 189
Americans -- and 11 people on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Two Libyan suspects are to stand trial for the bombing in May,
but Cohen said she considers the trial a farce that fails to
address the central question of who ordered the bombing. Her
husband, Daniel, plans to attend Monday's meeting in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can assure you (Boyd) is not going to have an easy time in
Washington,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cohen said she is sure a deal was cut with Libyan leader
Moammar Gadhafi that prompted him to turn Abdel Basset Ali
al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah over to prosecutors last year
to stand trial at Camp Zeist, a former U.S. air base in the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   ''I consider this trial little more than political theater,''
she said Saturday. Using the analogy of a mob trial, she said the
prosecution fails to go high enough up the chain of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a conspiracy case; (the suspects) are just the hit men
for the head of the Mafia. The guy who's the head of the Mafia is
protected before the trial starts. If you made that kind of a deal
in this country, it would be quite a scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Cohen said someone -- whom she would not identify -- read her
and other victims' families excerpts from a letter purporting to be
from United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan to Gadhafi last
February. The deferential tone of the letter, with references to
not wanting to undermine Gadhafi's regime, led her to believe
private assurances were made to the Libyan leader about what would
and would not be discussed at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only reason Gadhafi turned these two over is because
negotiations occurred,'' she said. ''I call this the Gadhafi
protection trial. I'm not accusing the Lord Advocate of suppression
of evidence, but the deal is out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyd said Saturday he wouldn't object to the release of the
Annan letter, though he pointed out he has no authority to release
the document, which is in the hands of the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors maintain that the two Libyan suspects were
responsible for placing a suitcase bomb on a flight originating in
Malta and having it transferred onto the Pan Am airliner in London.
The men, employed by the Libyan national airline in Malta, were
allegedly undercover intelligence agents.
</P>
<P>
   But in January, Scottish legal sources reported that a star
witness had backpedalled on his earlier account that he saw one of
the men place the suitcase on the conveyor belt in Malta.
</P>
<P>
   An investigative report in the Scottish Sunday Herald last month
claimed Hardie resigned ''because he realized that the Lockerbie
case was a shambles and would probably end in acquittal for the two
Libyan defendants.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The case,'' it said, ''is plagued with problems including
witnesses changing statements, allegations that original FBI
witness statements no longer tally with witnesses' current account
of events and new witnesses coming forward who will throw the whole
concept of a Libyan plot into disarray.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardie dismissed the reports, and said if he had doubts about
the strength of the case, he would have ended the prosecution.

<HEADLINE> Mich. School Copes After Violence  </HEADLINE>
By LISA SINGHANIA, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT MORRIS TOWNSHIP, Mich. (AP) -- To help students and
teachers at Buell Elementary move past the shooting of 6-year-old
Kayla Rolland, counselors will ask them to relive the tragedy, to
remember as much as they can.
</P>
<P>
   It might not sound like the right thing to do, said John Stein,
the deputy director of the National Organization for Victim
Assistance. But he says it's the best way for anyone to recover
from the trauma.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems to alleviate the power of these memories to be
disruptive and debilitating. ... Without doing much thinking,
you're a prisoner to emotional fragments,'' Stein said.
</P>
<P>
   Six NOVA volunteers talked to teachers and students at the
school on Friday. There will be counselors in each classroom Monday
when school reopens, and teddy bears for each student, the
organization's Bill Pfohel said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''As soon as we can get back into a routine, the healing can
begin,'' Pfohel said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the people they work with, he said, ''We will see anger, deep
sadness, grief and guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're really happy their child is alive, but they feel
tremendous guilt because another child -- a 6-year-old isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Kayla was shot to death Tuesday, allegedly by a 6-year-old
classmate. She was laid to rest Saturday at a private funeral.
</P>
<P>
   NOVA teams have worked with counselors at events such as the
Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, places where hurricanes have struck
and with refugees in Bosnia. Some members of the team are veterans
of other school shootings across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Stein said one of the things counselors will face most in the
next few days are people having feelings they're not proud of.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rage at a murder is an unpleasant emotional experience, and
our religion and ethical upbringing says don't do this, but that's
how we feel,'' Stein said.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are normal reactions -- you don't have to be ashamed of
them. You don't have to cast out yourself, or someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   The training focuses on how to help the victims create a
''clear, chronological narrative'' of what has happened, he said.
He said the human brain doesn't store memories of traumatic events
like a school shooting the way it would a normal memory.
</P>
<P>
   ''To some degree, we're asking them to go back to those memories
in a categorical form that allows them to revisit (the event)
without it being so powerful,'' he said. ''It's a reminder that
much of what they're experiencing afterwards is the human mind
trying to sort through a lot of unpleasant stuff it doesn't want to
absorb.''
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Trimer-Hartley, a communications consultant with the
Michigan Education Association, said MEA and the school district
jointly asked NOVA to send a team. She said the district and the
union also have been giving teachers material to take back to the
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''When kids come up to out members and ask 'What happened, What
happens when you die?' we have information for our members to give
them,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers are having a rough time too, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're caring an equal amount for them, as well as the kids
they teach,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At Roma's pizza restaurant in Mount Morris Township, employees
have put up a sign reading: ''Kayla, our heart and love are with
you.'' A coffee can with Kayla's picture on it sits on the counter
for people to leave donations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just to think we are doing something helps,'' said manager
Shawn Bullock, 24, who has a sister about Kayla's age.

<HEADLINE> GOP Rivals Battle As Big Votes Loom  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) -- George W. Bush charged John McCain with
''clouded'' education views Saturday and the senator asked
''Where's the outrage?'' over a late surge of money to pay for
negative TV ads, as the two Republicans battled for the vote on
Super Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's question about ''outrage'' mimicked a line from the
1996 presidential campaign of Bob Dole, a close friend of McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In the weekend before Tuesday's 13-state sweepstakes, Bush
campaigned in New York while McCain started in New England, the
geography highlighting the presidential contenders' different
strategies as they seek their share of the 613 delegates up for
grabs.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by New York Gov. George Pataki, the state's
Republican party chairman and a host of New York congressmen, Bush
spoke about education policy as he visited Rochester and Binghamton
in a quest for the state's 101 convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   That bounty is second only to the 162 at stake in California,
where Bush leads McCain among Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show McCain leading Bush in some New England states, so
the Arizona senator started his day in Boston before flying to an
event in Portland, Maine. Polls indicate a tight race in New York
and McCain was also making stops in Syracuse and Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Pataki has put his organization -- and his political
capital -- behind the candidacy of Bush, an effort made
unsuccessfully by Michigan Gov. John Engler in his own state.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pataki has a real risk of being Englerized,'' said Nelson
Warfield, a Republican operative who helped run Bob Dole's 1996
presidential campaign and who knows New York politics well. ''If he
is seen as losing his state for Bush, that hurts him.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Pataki has had trouble keeping the New York troops in
line, with Staten Island Borough President Guy Molinari and U.S.
Rep. Peter King switching to McCain from the Bush camp.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday editions, The New York Times endorsed McCain as a
candidate ''who has the potential to prolong a healthy battle for
the soul of the GOP.'' The New York Daily News also endorsed McCain
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokeswoman Karen Hughes said Bush has ''received
a number of endorsements from newspapers all over America,
including some of the newspapers that know him best, such as the
Austin American-Statesman in his hometown.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush later traveled to Hartford, Ct., where he was greeted by
three governors -- John Rowland of Connecticut, Paul Cellucci of
Massachusetts and Christie Todd Whitman of New Jersey, who had
withheld an endorsement while New Jersey publisher Steve Forbes was
in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's conservative philosophy ''transcends the litmus test,''
Whitman said, adding, ''we need somebody who will unite us through
our strength, not divide us because of our differences.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain aides also have their eye on California, where he's been
20 points behind among Republicans in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the theme of a new campaign ad airing in New York and
California, Bush charged that McCain offered a ''clouded vision''
on education policy when asked during a debate Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Graham Keegan, Arizona's superintendent of public
education, said McCain has a strong record on supporting state
education efforts, but believes that states must be responsible for
academic standards and testing.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the education ad will run concurrently with a
controversial ad that accused McCain of being opposed to breast
cancer research
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign has been running the breast cancer ad arguing
that McCain voted against research on the disease, while McCain
says he has repeatedly voted to boost breast cancer research
spending. The vote cited in the Bush ad was one where McCain
opposed putting breast cancer money in a military spending measure.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's campaign staff called a news conference Saturday
in Southern California with survivors of the disease. California
Assemblywoman Marilyn Brewer, R-Newport Beach, joined the survivors
and their relatives in decrying Bush's use of the subject as a
campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I take it as a huge offense'' that Bush would try to make
political hay out of McCain's voting record on the subject, said
LaVerne Friedmann, an Irvine, Calif., breast cancer survivor who
had a double mastectomy four years ago this month.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, two Texas brothers and prominent Bush
supporters, Sam and Charles Wyly, were spending $2.5 million on ads
attacking McCain's environmental record, but Bush denied any
connection or prior knowledge of the ads.
</P>
<P>
   On his way to a rally in Syracuse, N.Y., McCain again referred
to the infusion of money from outside sources. ''It's disgraceful
and shameful conduct and he should tell them to stop,'' McCain
said. ''This is one of the great scandals of American political
history.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain later said Bush campaign was ''doing the same kinds of
things Bill Clinton would do.'' When McCain compared him to Clinton
in a South Carolina television ad, Bush complained that ''was the
lowest blow'' one could give to a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Bush planned to spend the night Saturday in Austin, Texas,
before returning to California on Sunday. McCain was also heading
to California on Sunday after making stops in Ohio, another Super
Tuesday state.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with reporters aboard his ''Straight Talk Express''
bus, McCain conceded this campaign was probably his last shot at
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ours is a campaign of reform,'' McCain said. ''If we can't
sell the message this time, I'm not sure we can generate that kind
of interest and enthusiasm again.''

Republicans Spar for Primary Votes
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) -- The race for the Republican presidential nomination
picked up speed this weekend as Texas Governor George W. Bush and Arizona
Senator John McCain made stops throughout the Northeast region. Bush made
campaign stops in New York state in a quest for the state's 101 convention
delegates. Polls show McCain leading Bush in some New England states, so the
Arizona senator started his day in Boston before flying to an event in Portland,
Maine. Polls indicate a tight race in New York and McCain was also making stops

Camps Welcome Mozambique Flood Victims

   PALMEIRA, Mozambique (AP) -- Thousands of Mozambique flood survivors ate
their first meal in four or five days today in makeshift camps as supplies and
equipment arrived from around the world. Mozambique's National Disaster
Coordination Center welcomed the aid but said more was needed. Authorities
stressed that distribution of the aid needed to be better coordinated to prevent
the relief supplies from piling up at depots or winding up in the hands of
corrupt officials. Aid workers expected the death toll from the disaster to soar
into the thousands as floodwaters in southern Mozambique receded and revealed
the remains of the dead.

   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Thousands marched today in Chile demonstrating

under house arrest in Britain. He had been held on a warrant by a Spanish judge
who wanted to extradite him and try him for human rights abuses during his
1973-90 dictatorship in Chile. His return -- and the fact that he dodged trial
abroad for his alleged crimes -- have exacerbated the tensions here.

released a statement Saturday saying visiting Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov issued the invite. The statement did not say whether a delegation would
go to Chechnya. Many people in the Arab world sympathize with fellow Muslims in
Chechnya. Several Arab nations have sent aid to the Russian republic and have

security tight ahead of Sunday's opening of the annual 10-day legislative

grabbed a loose ball under the UCLA basket after a wild scrum during which the

<TEXT>
<P>
   MUSCAT, Oman (AP) -- The American Jewish Committee awarded Omani
Sultan Qaboos its Leadership for Peace Award Saturday for promoting
regional peace, the Oman News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Prince Al-Sayed Fahd bin Mahmoud Al Saeed, the deputy prime
minister for Cabinet affairs, received the award on behalf of
Qaboos. The sultan was not expected to meet with committee members
during their visit.
</P>
<P>
   Qaboos was honored by the New York-base group for his
government's efforts toward promoting Middle East peace and also
for trade and investment with the United States, the news agency
said.
</P>
<P>
   Committee members were also heading to Qatar, where they were
expected to meet with the Qatari leader, or emir, Sheik Hamad bin
Khalifa Al Thani.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gulf countries have had limited official relations with
Israel, though both backed off when Arab-Israeli peace efforts
stalled under the leadership of former Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Oman established commercial ties with Israel in 1995 and opened
a trade mission in Tel Aviv. But it froze relations with the Jewish
state two years later, under Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Qatar has no diplomatic relations with Israel, but established
trade ties in 1995. The following year, then-Prime Minister Shimon
Peres became the only Israeli leader to visit Qatar. The trade
ties, however, were frozen after Netanyahu's election later in
1996.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Essie Green Edmiston, an art dealer who
represented many 20th century black artists through her Harlem
gallery, died Feb. 26 of bladder cancer. She was 61.
</P>
<P>
   Edmiston began showing art in her Brooklyn apartment in the
1970s, while running a full-time psychiatric social work practice.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979 she focused on art, establishing the Park Plaza Gallery
in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn, and a decade later, the
Essie Green Galleries in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   There she showed work by Romare Bearden, Lois Mailou Jones and
Jacob Lawrence, all of whom she knew as friends. She also showed
the work of Allen Stringfellow, Norman Lewis, William S. Carter,
William Ossawa Tanner, Charles Ethan Porter, Edwin Bannister and
Charles Alston.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s she organized shows of Bearden and Stringfellow at
the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.
</P>
<P>
   Edmiston was a founding stockholder of the Innercity

   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Geeta Mukherjee, a veteran leader of the
Communist Party of India, died Saturday of a heart attack,
officials of her party said. She was 76.
</P>
<P>
   Mukherjee was preparing to leave for a party program in the
northern town of Aligarh, 75 miles southeast of the capital, New
Delhi, when she was stricken, the Press Trust of India news agency
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mukherjee, the widow of prominent communist party leader
Bishwanath Mukherjee, was one of the founding members of the
communist movement in the state of West Bengal.
</P>
<P>
   She also was secretary of the party's national council and its
deputy leader in the Lok Sabha, India's lower house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Mukherjee was deeply involved with women's issues, spearheading
the communists' demand for setting aside a third of all seats in
parliament and state legislatures for women.

<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Federal appeals court Judge Charles Wiggins,
who as a California congressman in the 1970s was among President
Nixon's staunchest defenders before urging him to resign, died
Thursday of cardiac arrest. He was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Wiggins was appointed in 1984 by President Reagan to the 9th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. He had been a
senior judge on the court and lived in Las Vegas for the last 3{
years.
</P>
<P>
   Wiggins, a Republican from the Southern California district once
represented by Nixon, served in the House from 1967 to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   He was considered Nixon's strongest defender on the House
Judiciary Committee during the Watergate hearings in 1974. He later
switched positions and called for Nixon's resignation or
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The defection of the respected congressman was regarded as a key
factor in the final erosion of Nixon's support on Capitol Hill and
Nixon's decision to resign.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1974, after Nixon acknowledged lying about his role in
the Watergate coverup, Wiggins announced he was ready to vote for
impeachment on Article 1, alleging obstruction of justice. Three
days later, Nixon resigned.

<HEADLINE> Bradley invokes long-shot Harry Truman in valedictory weekend  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- An upbeat Bill Bradley brushed aside long odds
facing his campaign Saturday and spoke of ''a world of
possibilities guided by goodness,'' reminding his volunteers that
another Missouri native, Harry Truman, defied the polls to win an
election more than 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley entered the final weekend before Super Tuesday behind in
the delegate count, trailing in polls and no longer considered a
threat to Democratic presidential rival Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know Harry Truman. They said he was finished in 1948, he
didn't have a chance,'' Bradley told volunteers in Greenwich
Village, who were preparing to canvass door to door. ''And you know
what happened there. He came from behind and won.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether by accident or by design, Bradley campaigned Saturday in
two states crucial to his life story -- Missouri, where he was born
and raised, and New York, where he became a professional basketball
star with the Knicks and learned both how to win and how to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley was accompanied by former New York City Mayor Ed Koch
and actor Harvey Keitel when he met in Greenwich Village with
volunteers. He and his wife, Ernestine, also were holding a rally
on New York's Upper West Side before heading to a ''Democrat Days''
event in Hannibal, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore, meanwhile, campaigned in clear-sailing
style in Massachusetts and New York. He dropped by Charlie's
Sandwich Shoppe in Boston for blueberry pancakes, escorted by Mayor
Thomas M. Menino and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, who called Gore ''Mr.
Strong Economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Pecora, a Massachusetts state worker who said he
historically votes Republican, offered this observation: ''Bradley
doesn't have a shot. He doesn't seem to be competing with Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   All references to Bradley long gone from Gore's speeches, he
turned his fire on Republican presidential contenders John McCain
and George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by state officials and wrapped in sunshine, Gore told
about 2,000 supporters outside Faneuil Hall that Tuesday's votes in
15 states ''will be the decisive moment.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Republican candidates go into private meetings -- one of
them with Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson -- and they come out and
Falwell and Robertson pat them on the back and say 'we heard
everything we wanted to hear,''' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let me break that code for you. What they're saying is they
heard a solemn promise to give the right-wing extremist wing of the
Republican Party control of our Supreme Court and the
interpretation of our Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times endorsed Gore in Sunday editions saying he
has ''a burning desire to step out of his mentor's shadow and prove
that he possesses the self control and presidential high-mindedness
so lacking in Mr. Clinton.'' The Kansas City Star and the St. Louis
Post-Dispatch endorsed Bradley in weekend editions.
</P>
<P>
   The Post-Dispatch declared: ''Mr. Bradley lacks charisma but not
sincerity.'' In its editorial, The Star said Bradley ''can offer
fresh perspectives and can champion the party's best ideals without
the baggage that Gore must carry.''
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Gore changed into a kelly-green necktie and
promised the Irish-American Presidential Forum he would be
''studying up on'' the complexities of the Northern Ireland peace
process and would make peace there ''one of my causes'' in the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Bradley also launched a new direction for his
campaign, unveiling a stump speech criticizing Gore as a political
chameleon. Now Gore's name has disappeared from his speeches, and
Bradley is talking about ideas again and staking his survival on a
strong showing in New York and New England states in Tuesday's
string of primaries, although he's far behind in the polls in every
state.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he'll quit, Bradley smiles, ''One thing we know about
polls is they close very fast.''
</P>
<P>
   At Bradley pep rallies, however, introductions have taken on a
valedictory feel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Senator Bradley has brought some ideas to the table,'' Ben
Waxman, a Bradley volunteer, told students at Portland High School
in Maine. ''They are the best. They are the biggest. They are the
most daring.''
</P>
<P>
   And campaign post-mortems have begun.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign supporters in the Northeast, Bradley's strongest
region, wondered aloud when Bradley spent six days in Washington
state in advance of a Feb. 29 ''beauty contest'' primary that did
not assign delegates to the Democratic convention. To make matters
worse, Gore trounced Bradley there.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters have also expressed regrets that Bradley opted to
challenge Gore aggressively in the Iowa caucuses, hoping for a
January ''surprise,'' rather than stay focused on winning New
Hampshire. Gore won easily in Iowa and beat Bradley again by a
narrow margin in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, there is envy and disappointment that
McCain, Bradley's counterpart underdog on the GOP side, grabbed so
much press attention and support of independent voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not that I'm whining,'' said Gale Kaufman, a senior advisor to
the Bradley campaign in California, but the campaign ''fell off the
map'' once the press became fascinated with the McCain insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley and his traveling core of advisors remain locked in the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign's theme song, played at most rallies, is ''Right
Here, Right Now.'' On the occasions when Bradley does look back, he
invokes history to explain his ''think big'' approach to child
poverty and health care, holding up Franklin Delano Roosevelt and
Thomas Jefferson as examples.
</P>
<P>
   After rallies, Bradley fans mill about, Bradley campaign
stickers affixed to their jackets, describing their feelings of
inspiration tinged with disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think his best position is to provoke thought, and he's done
that,'' said Judith Lessler of Fairfield, Conn.

<HEADLINE> Black Former Coke Workers Rally  </HEADLINE>
By ERIN McCLAM, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Hundreds of black former Coca-Cola employees
rallied Saturday, calling the company's massive job cuts ''ethnic
cleansing'' and accusing the soft-drink giant of severely
mistreating workers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Blacks in the company are humiliated, intimidated, yelled at,
called the N-word, treated with disrespect,'' said Larry Jones, a
former Coke manager who organized a meeting of about 500 laid-off
black workers Saturday at a church outside Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the real thing,'' he said, mocking a company slogan.
''This is the real Coca-Cola.''
</P>
<P>
   Coke spokesman Ben Deutsch called the allegations of racial
discrimination in the job cuts ''outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The decisions we're making are being done for business
purposes only,'' he said Saturday night. ''We are trying to do
everything we can during this extremely difficult time to do the
right thing for our current and former employees at every turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Protesters applauded Coca-Cola's decision not to require
laid-off workers to sign a waiver forcing them to choose between
participating in a discrimination lawsuit pending against the
company or enjoying better severance benefits. But the workers said
a future boycott of Coca-Cola by black leaders remained an option.
</P>
<P>
   The waiver had left black workers with a difficult decision
because of a racial discrimination suit filed last year by current
and former black employees.
</P>
<P>
   Coke is reducing its worldwide work force by 6,000, with 2,500
of the eliminated jobs coming from its Atlanta headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Plaintiffs in the lawsuit contend that Jones, a black human
resources manager, was laid off Feb. 15 after meeting with Coke
President Jack Stahl to express black employees' concerns about job
cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ''What happened on Feb. 15 was essentially ethnic cleansing,''
Jones said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Coke spokesman Ben Deutsch has said Jones' dismissal was
unrelated to his meeting with Stahl.
</P>
<P>
   The workers demanded Saturday that Coke work harder to settle
the lawsuit, develop a fairer system of employee evaluation and
''stop looking at the price of the stock'' to pay more attention to
diversity.

<HEADLINE> Medical Marijuana Called 'a Crock'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. (AP) -- White House drug czar Barry McCaffrey
spoke harshly against the medical use of marijuana, calling much of
it ''a crock'' and saying more research is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ask a doctor if he really wants a big blunt stuck in a
patient's face as treatment,'' McCaffrey said on Friday, the final
day of a national conference on addiction at the Ronald Reagan
Presidential Library and Museum. ''A lot of this is a crock.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 20 medical marijuana supporters protested outside the
library, carrying signs, banners and a pot plant.
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana is banned by the federal government, although voters
in six states -- Alaska, Arizona, California, Maine, Oregon and
Washington -- have approved laws allowing the drug to be used for
medical purposes.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey -- a longtime opponent of medical marijuana use and
other forms of drug legalization -- said the federal government is
spending increasing sums to fight substance abuse, and suggested
state and local governments need to do more to ensure the money is
well-spent.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain battle anew in final weekend before Super Tuesday  </HEADLINE>
By GLEN JOHNSON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) -- George W. Bush charged John McCain with
''clouded'' education views Saturday and the senator asked
''Where's the outrage?'' over a late surge of money to pay for
negative TV ads, as the two Republicans battled for the vote on
Super Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's question about ''outrage'' mimicked a line from the
1996 presidential campaign of Bob Dole, a close friend of McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In the weekend before Tuesday's 13-state sweepstakes, Bush
campaigned in New York while McCain started in New England, the
geography highlighting the presidential contenders' different
strategies as they seek their share of the 613 delegates up for
grabs.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by New York Gov. George Pataki, the state's
Republican party chairman and a host of New York congressmen, Bush
spoke about education policy as he visited Rochester and Binghamton
in a quest for the state's 101 convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   That bounty is second only to the 162 at stake in California,
where Bush leads McCain among Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show McCain leading Bush in some New England states, so
the Arizona senator started his day in Boston before flying to an
event in Portland, Maine. Polls indicate a tight race in New York
and McCain was also making stops in Syracuse and Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   A Zogby/Reuters/MSNBC poll released Saturday indicated 44.6
percent of New York voters favored Bush while 38.6 percent
supported McCain, with a margin of error of 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Pataki has put his organization -- and his political
capital -- behind the candidacy of Bush, an effort made
unsuccessfully by Michigan Gov. John Engler in his own state.
</P>
<P>
   ''Pataki has a real risk of being Englerized,'' said Nelson
Warfield, a Republican operative who helped run Bob Dole's 1996
presidential campaign and who knows New York politics well. ''If he
is seen as losing his state for Bush, that hurts him.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Pataki has had trouble keeping the New York troops in
line, with Staten Island Borough President Guy Molinari and U.S.
Rep. Peter King switching to McCain from the Bush camp.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday editions, The New York Times endorsed McCain as a
candidate ''who has the potential to prolong a healthy battle for
the soul of the GOP.'' The New York Daily News also endorsed McCain
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokeswoman Karen Hughes said Bush has ''received
a number of endorsements from newspapers all over America,
including some of the newspapers that know him best, such as the
Austin American-Statesman in his hometown.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush later traveled to Hartford, Ct., where he was greeted by
three governors -- John Rowland of Connecticut, Paul Cellucci of
Massachusetts and Christie Todd Whitman of New Jersey, who had
withheld an endorsement while New Jersey publisher Steve Forbes was
in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's conservative philosophy ''transcends the litmus test,''
Whitman said, adding, ''we need somebody who will unite us through
our strength, not divide us because of our differences.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain aides also have their eye on California, where he's been
20 points behind among Republicans in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the theme of a new campaign ad airing in New York and
California, Bush charged that McCain offered a ''clouded vision''
on education policy when asked during a debate Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Graham Keegan, Arizona's superintendent of public
education, said McCain has a strong record on supporting state
education efforts, but believes that states must be responsible for
academic standards and testing.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the education ad will run concurrently with a
controversial ad that accused McCain of being opposed to breast
cancer research
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign has been running the breast cancer ad arguing
that McCain voted against research on the disease, while McCain
says he has repeatedly voted to boost breast cancer research
spending. The vote cited in the Bush ad was one where McCain
opposed putting breast cancer money in a military spending measure.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's campaign staff called a news conference Saturday
in Southern California with survivors of the disease. California
Assemblywoman Marilyn Brewer, R-Newport Beach, joined the survivors
and their relatives in decrying Bush's use of the subject as a
campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I take it as a huge offense'' that Bush would try to make
political hay out of McCain's voting record on the subject, said
LaVerne Friedmann, an Irvine, Calif., breast cancer survivor who
had a double mastectomy four years ago this month.
</P>
<P>
   On another front, two Texas brothers and prominent Bush
supporters, Sam and Charles Wyly, were spending $2.5 million on ads
attacking McCain's environmental record, but Bush denied any
connection or prior knowledge of the ads.
</P>
<P>
   On his way to a rally in Syracuse, N.Y., McCain again referred
to the infusion of money from outside sources. ''It's disgraceful
and shameful conduct and he should tell them to stop,'' McCain
said. ''This is one of the great scandals of American political
history.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain later said Bush campaign was ''doing the same kinds of
things Bill Clinton would do.'' When McCain compared him to Clinton
in a South Carolina television ad, Bush complained that ''was the
lowest blow'' one could give to a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Bush planned to spend the night Saturday in Austin, Texas,
before returning to California on Sunday. McCain was also heading
to California on Sunday after making stops in Ohio, another Super
Tuesday state.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with reporters aboard his ''Straight Talk Express''
bus, McCain conceded this campaign was probably his last shot at
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ours is a campaign of reform,'' McCain said. ''If we can't
sell the message this time, I'm not sure we can generate that kind
of interest and enthusiasm again.''

<HEADLINE> Drug Czar Criticizes Medical Pot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. (AP) -- White House drug czar Barry McCaffrey
spoke harshly against the medical use of marijuana, calling much of
it ''a crock'' and saying more research is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ask a doctor if he really wants a big blunt stuck in a
patient's face as treatment,'' McCaffrey said on Friday, the final
day of a national conference on addiction at the Ronald Reagan
Presidential Library and Museum. ''A lot of this is a crock.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 20 medical marijuana supporters protested outside the
library, carrying signs, banners and a pot plant.
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana is banned by the federal government, although voters
in six states -- Alaska, Arizona, California, Maine, Oregon and
Washington -- have approved laws allowing the drug to be used for
medical purposes.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey -- a longtime opponent of medical marijuana use and
other forms of drug legalization -- said the federal government is
spending increasing sums to fight substance abuse, and suggested
state and local governments need to do more to ensure the money is
well-spent.

<HEADLINE> No. 4 Duke 90, North Carolina 76  </HEADLINE>
By ELIZABETH A. DAVIS, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Chris Carrawell didn't want all the
attention on his Senior Day.
</P>
<P>
   Carrawell, Duke's lone senior, scored 21 points, Shane Battier
had 30 and Nate James 19 as the No. 4 Blue Devils beat North
Carolina 90-76 on Saturday to sweep the season series for just the
fourth time in 36 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I told the guys to play. Don't get caught up in trying to give
me the ball. I don't want to score every time,'' said Carrawell,
who played in his final game at Cameron Indoor Stadium.
''Definitely they attacked it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils (24-4, 15-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) won their
fifth straight game in the 81-year-old rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina (18-12, 9-7) has not won at Cameron since 1996.
Even with the loss to Duke, the regular-season ACC champion, the
Tar Heels finished in a tie for third place with Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ''A win against Carolina any day is especially sweet and to do
it for Chris today is great,'' Battier said.
</P>
<P>
   Duke took control early and never trailed.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are the best team in the league and I think they have a
great chance to win the national championship,'' North Carolina
coach Bill Guthridge said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Forte, who led North Carolina with 24 points, made a
layup with 1:41 left to pull North Carolina within 11 at 80-69, but
that was as close as the Tar Heels would get.
</P>
<P>
   As the Cameron Crazies chanted ''Thank you, C-Well,'' Carrawell
made two free throws and then punctuated the victory with a dunk
off a steal to make it 84-69 with 1:30 remaining. He went to the
bench with 32 seconds left to more showers of cheers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly, I'm proud of Chris. It's been an emotional day,''
Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said. ''Our kids should have won today
for him, and we did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Devils stretched their lead from four to 10 points in a
dazzling one-minute span in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Williams scored on a fast break and made another basket
eight seconds later after a North Carolina turnover. Then on the
inbounds pass, the Tar Heels again turned the ball over and
Carrawell, who had 11 points in the first half, grabbed it for a
dunk to put Duke ahead 22-12.
</P>
<P>
   That spurt keyed an 18-8 run that gave the Blue Devils a 40-20
lead with two minutes left. Duke led 42-27 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   The Tar Heels didn't look the same after senior point guard Ed
Cota left for about seven minutes in the first half to get five
stitches over his left eye. Senior Terrence Newby substituted for
Cota while trainers worked on his eye, but he didn't handle the
ball as well. North Carolina finished with a season-high 23
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We really turned up our intensity (after Cota's injury),''
Battier said. ''We really pressured Newby and left him out to dry a
couple of times.''
</P>
<P>
   With a large bandage over his eyebrow, Cota finished with 11
points and 13 assists. He moved into third place on the NCAA
all-time career list for assists with 992.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina tried to trim Duke's lead in the second half and
got it down to 11 after Jason Capel's 3 and Julius Pepper's layup
to make it 54-43 with 13:34 left.
</P>
<P>
   But Battier hit consecutive 3-pointers to make it 60-43 a minute
later.
</P>
<P>
   The Tar Heels cut the lead to nine on Forte's 3 with 5:14 left,
but Carrawell pushed it back to double figures with a leaping layup
on the next possession.
</P>
<P>
   Carrawell, Duke's leading scorer this season, has been a part of
Duke's four straight ACC regular-season titles and has only seen
Duke lose four times at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never imagined doing the things that I have done. I just
want to keep on going,'' he said. ''I also cried in the warmups. I
checked around to see if anyone was looking at me and I pushed the
tear back in my eye,''

Mozambique Flood Victims Flock to Camps

<P>
   PALMEIRA, Mozambique (AP) -- Victims of the massive Mozambique floods found
refuge in makeshift camps Saturday, gulping down meals after being stranded for
days in trees and on rooftops. Mozambique's National Disaster Coordination
Center welcomed the aid but said more was needed. Aid workers expected the death
toll from the disaster to soar into the thousands as floodwaters in southern
Mozambique receded and revealed the remains of the dead. Cyclone Eline, which
along with three weeks of torrential rains caused the flooding, was downgraded
Friday to a tropical storm.

The Times, which has not endorsed candidates for the presidential primaries
since 1992, will publish the announcement in Sunday edition's op-ed page,
according to a press release today. The release said the endorsements were made
because of the competitiveness of the contests and as a ''tribute to the vigor

base at Beaufort, a centuries-old mountaintop castle 12 miles north of the
Israeli border with commanding views of southern Lebanon and northern Israel,

under house arrest in Britain. He had been held on a warrant by a Spanish judge
who wanted to extradite him and try him for human rights abuses during his
1973-90 dictatorship in Chile. His return -- and the fact that he dodged trial
abroad for his alleged crimes -- have exacerbated the tensions here.

called the allegations of racial discrimination in the job cuts ''outrageous.''
Protesters applauded Coca-Cola's decision not to require laid-off workers to
sign a waiver forcing them to choose between participating in a discrimination
lawsuit pending against the company or enjoying better severance benefits. But
the workers said a future boycott of Coca-Cola by black leaders remained an
option.

Chinese Congressman Investigated

National People's Congress Vice Chairman Cheng Kejie was not re-elected to the
presidium of the legislature this year because he is suspected of having broken
the law, legislative spokesman Zeng Jianhui told reporters. Cheng is now
''reflecting on his own problems'' and had asked for a leave from the congress,
Zeng said. Cheng's case and that of a former deputy governor of Jiangxi province
are just two of a slew of high-level corruption cases that have undermined
popular support for the Communist Party.

<HEADLINE> China's Premier Makes Taiwan Warning  </HEADLINE>
By ELAINE KURTENBACH, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China will not ''sit idly by'' and accept Taiwan
going its own way, but hopes the island's leaders and people will
accept peaceful reunification, Premier Zhu Rongji said Sunday in a
nationally televised speech.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu, in his annual address at the opening session of the
national legislature, also demanded a tougher fight against
corruption and warned that efforts so far ''fall far short of what
the people expect of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Overshadowing this year's 11-day session of the National
People's Congress are corruption investigations in two wealthy
coastal provinces that reach to the governing State Council and
Communist Party Politburo. Rampant graft has undermined popular
support for the Communists, who hold a monopoly on political power.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a former vice chairman of the legislature is under
investigation for economic crimes, a legislative spokesman
announced Saturday, and a former deputy governor of Jiangxi
province, Hu Changqing, has been sentenced to death for
bribe-taking.
</P>
<P>
   While Zhu did not mention the scandals, he devoted much of his
speech to anti-corruption themes and warned all major corruption
cases would be investigated and corrupt officials would be severely
punished.
</P>
<P>
   In his appeal to Taiwan, Zhu did not specifically repeat the
government's latest threat, made in February, to use force if
Taiwan puts off reunification talks indefinitely. That threat had
raised tensions with the island and concern from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The premier said Beijing would not ''sit idly by and watch any
serious separatist activity aimed at undermining China's
sovereignty and territorial integrity, such as those advocating the
two-state theory or the independence of Taiwan,'' Zhu said. But he
stressed a conciliatory approach.
</P>
<P>
   ''We place our hopes on the Taiwan authorities and even more on
the people of Taiwan,'' he said. ''We are willing to continue
working with the vast numbers of our Taiwan compatriots in
developing cross-straits relations and achieving peaceful
reunification of the motherland.''
</P>
<P>
   The mainland and the island of Taiwan have been ruled separately
since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. China claims Taiwan
as a province that must be reunited eventually.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu, who has guided China's economic development, said Beijing
would push ahead with measures to reform debt-ridden state
enterprises, develop infrastructure and stimulate domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
   He also called for tougher police work, including prosecution of
members of ''evil cults.'' The government's crackdown on the
multimillion-member Falun Gong was one of China's ''great
victories'' of the past year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As about 5,000 of China's political elite -- top leaders,
legislative deputies and members of an advisory group -- gathered in
the Great Hall of the People on Tiananmen Square, police at the
nearby Gate of Heavenly Peace detained at least 16 people suspected
of being followers of Falun Gong and checked bags and questioned
many others. The banned spiritual movement draws on ideas of
Buddhism, Taoism and its founder, a former government clerk who
lives in exile in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Police several days ago rounded up 68 Falun Gong followers in
Beijing and were holding them in a drug rehabilitation center to
prevent them from making trouble during the legislative meeting, a
Falun Gong follower said Sunday, speaking on condition of
anonymity. The 68 were on a hunger strike, some in their third day,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The largely powerless National People's Congress meets annually
to approve decisions made by Communist Party leaders and discuss
national issues.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Times has endorsed Vice President
Al Gore and Arizona Sen. John McCain for the upcoming state primary
on Super Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Times, which has not endorsed candidates for the
presidential primaries since 1992, published the announcement in
Sunday editions.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper said the endorsements were made because of the
competitiveness of the contests and as a ''tribute to the vigor and
seriousness that the four candidates have brought to this campaign
season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Times said it chose McCain over Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
because Bush has embraced a ''hard-right agenda'' and has allowed
himself to become ''an instrument,'' of his party's congressional
leaders, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, on the other hand, ''has a proven ability to get votes
from the vital center of the American spectrum,'' which also cited
his bravery in challenging leaders of the religious right ''for
intimidating the party with religious-based litmus tests.''
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, the Times said it chose Gore over Bill
Bradley because the long, hard-road of campaigning had shown ''a
lack of energy'' in Bradley's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''If overeagerness to please is a defect in Mr. Gore, Mr.
Bradley possesses an even more disturbing inability to convey a
real hunger for the opportunity to serve.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper lauded Gore's ''passion to lead, a determination
to leave a positive mark on history, and a burning desire to step
out if his mentor's shadow and prove that he possesses the
self-control and presidential high-mindedness so lacking in Mr.
Clinton.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Army To Shorten Tours Abroad  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Army has decided to limit overseas
deployments of National Guard and Reserve units in peacekeeping and
other military operations to a maximum of six months, The New York
Times reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes as Pentagon officials are becoming increasingly
concerned about a backlash to its growing reliance on such units,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's decision will shorten the time these troops have to
be away from home, which Pentagon and Army officials hope will ease
the strain that a rising number of calls to active duty have had on
reservists, their families and, especially, their employers.
</P>
<P>
   The new limit is the first significant step by the Army to
recognize that its greater reliance on the Guard and Reserve has so
intensified the burden on its citizen-soldiers that it threatens to
undermine the willingness to join or stay in those units, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Since the scaling back of the military that followed the fall of
the Berlin Wall in 1989, the Guard and Reserves have played a
larger role in American military operations than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   There are now three simultaneous presidential mobilizations of
reservists -- for Bosnia, Kosovo and the continuing containment of
Iraq -- and there is no end in sight to any of them.
</P>
<P>
   With the tempo of peacekeeping operations having increased
through the 1990's, the Army's leaders say they now have no choice
but to turn even more to the 564,000 members of its Guard and
Reserve to ease the burden on its active force of 479,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's decision to shorten rotations for its Guard and
Reserve units applies only to operations other than war.
</P>
<P>
   In the event of a conflict, the Army will still be able to
mobilize its Guard and Reserve units and send them overseas for the
270 days allowed by law.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's chief of staff, Gen. Erik K. Shinseki, was expected
to announce the decision Tuesday, the Times said.
</P>
<P>
   The policy brings the Army closer in line to the other services.
Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve units, for example,
generally deploy no more than three months.

<HEADLINE> No. 10 Iowa St. 75, Baylor 54  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN HAWKINS, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas (AP) -- Keep the nets. No. 10 Iowa State will instead
take the outright Big 12 Conference regular-season title.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Fizer scored 34 points Saturday night as the Cyclones
(26-4, 14-2 Big 12) won 75-54 at Baylor, only to be denied by the
home team the opportunity to cut down the nets in celebration of
their first conference title since 1945.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the crown jewel,'' said Iowa State coach Larry
Eustachy, who did not address the net-cutting issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''We won the title outright. ... We didn't have to share it with
anybody. The hardest part is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State led from start to finish after Fizer scored his
team's first 10 points, eight before Baylor made a basket. Fizer,
the Big 12 scoring leader, has scored 30 points in four of the last
five games.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's only a handful of games left. I just go out there with
the mentality that every time I get the ball and I've got a good
shot, I'm aiming to knock the shot down,'' Fizer said. ''I came out
with the mentality that we were going to win this game. My
teammates got the ball in great places.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cyclones have already set a school record for victories.
They have won 11 more games than last season, the biggest increase
from one season to the next in school history.
</P>
<P>
   When Baylor (13-14, 4-12) battled to 43-40 midway through the
second half, Iowa State responded with nine straight points,
including Fizer's floater in the lane. Stevie Johnson's follow shot
started the run, and Michael Nurse's long 3-pointer pushed the
Cyclones ahead 52-40 with just under 10 minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State is seeded No. 1 and gets a first-day bye in next
week's Big 12 tournament. Baylor is the No. 9 seed, and would face
the Cyclones again Friday if its beats Nebraska in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   After Fizer made two free throws to give Iowa State a 41-30 lead
with 17:38 left, Baylor had a 10-2 run to get close. Three players
had follow shots and Tevis Stukes made an underhand scoop during
the six-minute stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears, who had 20 turnovers and shot just 37 percent
(19-of-52), couldn't avoid the inevitable. Baylor has lost all
eight games this season against ranked Big 12 teams.
</P>
<P>
   ''We battled back and then we missed dunks, we didn't block out
and we had poor shots,'' Baylor coach Dave Bliss said. ''We
obviously have shortcomings we try to play around.''
</P>
<P>
   Stukes, a senior playing his last home game, led Baylor with 19
points and fellow senior Jamie Kendrick added 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Nurse added 13 points for Iowa State and Kantrail Horton
had 10.
</P>
<P>
   It is still uncertain if Fizer has played his last regular-
season game for Iowa State. He's yet to announce whether he'll
declare early for the NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   ''I try not to think about the NBA too much. I'm thinking about
finally winning the conference. That was my first goal,'' Fizer
said. ''My next goal is to go far in the Big 12 tournament, and
then to go farther and farther in the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now I'm just playing basketball at Iowa State.''

<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Gary Payton scored 28 points as the Seattle
SuperSonics beat the Atlanta Hawks 93-81 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Vin Baker added 16 for the Sonics, who had lost three of their
last four.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Henderson, Jim Jackson and Bimbo Coles each scored 11 to
lead Atlanta, which has lost three of four and six of its last
nine.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Dikembe Mutombo, who had more fouls (five) than points
(three), matched his season low in scoring. Isaiah Rider took only
three shots and finished with two points.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle took control with 1:01 left in the second quarter. With
the Sonics leading 39-35, Seattle went on a 10-3 run. Payton hit a
12-foot jump shot, Rashard Lewis made a 3-pointer and Baker
converted a pair of free throws. Then, Payton threw a long pass to
Brent Barry, whose 3-pointer from the left corner gave Seattle a
49-38 lead at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks, coming off an 83-70 victory over the New York Knicks
on Friday night, jumped out to their biggest lead at 21-14 when
Jackson hit a 3-pointer with 40 seconds remaining in the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Rider, who leads Atlanta with 21.2 points per game, reported
late for the second consecutive game. Chris Crawford again started
in Rider's place and was 1-for-6 for two points.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Making four of six free throws, Payton needs 11 to pass
Lenny Wilkens, a former Seattle star player and coach, for fourth
place in franchise history. ... Barry missed his first seven shots,
including a breakaway dunk attempt, but hit his next four to finish
with 10 points. ... Atlanta dropped to 4-25 when trailing after
three quarters.

<HEADLINE> Virginia 89, No. 17 Maryland 87 OT  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN POPE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- Adam Hall hit two free throws to
force overtime then hit the game-winning 3-pointer with 25.8
seconds left in the extra period as Virginia rallied to beat No. 17
Maryland 89-87.
</P>
<P>
   The loss ended Maryland's nine-game Atlantic Coast Conference
winning streak and gave a big boost to Virginia's hopes for an
at-large berth in the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   After trailing throughout the second half, the Cavaliers (19-10,
9-7) went on an 11-4 run over the final 3:17 of regulation to force
the overtime. They tied it for the first time in the second half
when Hall stole the ball and hit two free throws with 35.2 seconds
left to even the score at 76.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland (22-8, 11-5) led 86-83 with 1:14 remaining in OT after
Tahj Holden hit two free throws, but Hall cut the lead to 86-84
with a free throw with 48 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   After a turnover by Juan Dixon, Virginia took an 87-86 on Hall's
3-pointer, moving ahead for the first time since a 12-11 first-half
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Miller led the Terrapins with 20 points, including 16 in
the first half, before fouling out with 3:39 left in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Hall and Chris Williams led Virginia with 16 points each.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia made several runs in the second half but could get no
closer than five until Donald Hand converted a three-point play off
a driving lay-up to cut the lead to 72-70 with 2:54 remaining in
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Hand, who finished with 11 points, shot just 1-of-8 from the
field before halftime and made a critical mistake just before
intermission, shooting an errant 3-point attempt as Virginia,
trailing 41-39, tried to hold for the last shot.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland turned that miss into a 3-pointer at the other end as
time expired, and Virginia, within striking distance of a tie found
itself down five at intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland jumped out early in the second half with six straight
points and built its lead to as much as 11 in the second half
before Virginia rallied.
</P>
<P>
   The game was the regular season finale for both teams.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO (AP) -- The Toronto Maple Leafs turned two mistakes by
Montreal goalie Jeff Hackett into goals and held on to beat the
Canadiens 4-3 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Igor Korolev, Jonas Hoglund, Steve Thomas and Nik Antropov
scored for the Leafs, who maintained a three-point lead over Ottawa
for first place in the NHL's Northeast Division.
</P>
<P>
   Benoit Brunet had two goals and Eric Weinrich scored for the
Canadiens, tied with Buffalo for third place in the Northeast
Division.
</P>
<P>
   Leading 1-0, Hackett skated 40 feet out of his crease after a
loose puck. Darcy Tucker got a stick on it first and the puck
bounced to Korolev in the middle of the zone. Korolev whipped it
into the vacated net as Hackett scurried back too late.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett again was out of his crease when Hoglund put Toronto up
2-1 at 13:09.
</P>
<P>
   The goalie went behind the net to stop the puck and tried to
clear it along the boards with Steve Thomas skating towards him.
Thomas blocked the clearing attempt with a hip, the puck
ricocheting onto Hoglund's stick. Hoglund scored from a
near-impossible angle before Hackett could get back into position.
</P>
<P>
   The Leafs pulled away with two goals in 44 seconds in the second
period. Antropov lifted the stick of Patrice Brisebois to gain
possession of the puck in front of Hackett and put in his own
rebound at 10:26.
</P>
<P>
   Then on a power play, Thomas deflected in Alexander Karpovtsev's
shot.
</P>
<P>
   Brunet got one back at 11:15 after he was set up by Saku Koivu.
Brunet's second goal, on the power play at 13:53 of the third, made
for an exciting finish.
</P>
<P>
   Weinrich opened the scoring, on a power play at 5:19 of the
first, with his third goal this season.

<HEADLINE> Bulls' John Starks Awaits Ruling  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- John Starks swears he's not pouting because he's
still with the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Starks, who wants to be waived so he can go to a playoff
contender, sat out his fourth game Saturday because of tendinitis
in his right knee. While coach Tim Floyd said he won't play until a
grievance arbitrator rules on his request, Starks said it all
depends on his knee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fans don't understand -- can't understand -- what an injury is
until they get inside my body and feel the pain I'm feeling,'' he
said. ''I never sat down on anybody and never will. If I'm able to
go out there and play the way I'm capable of playing, then I'll
step out there on the court. Other than that, I have to wait until
it gets well.''
</P>
<P>
   Bulls fans don't seem to care how Starks feels, though. As he
sat on the bench in street clothes during the 95-84 loss to the
Philadelphia 76ers, one fan yelled, ''Hey Starks! Got a uniform
under there?'' A small group chanted, ''Starks' a bum,'' at the end
of the game, and one fan held up a sign that read, ''Hey Starks, No
Cry Babies Allowed!''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not unhappy. I never said I didn't want to be here,''
Starks said. ''I said I want a chance to go to the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Starks, 34, offered to forfeit the rest of his $4 million salary
-- roughly $900,000 -- if the Bulls would waive him, clearing the way
for him to sign with a playoff contender.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Knicks and Miami Heat were interested in adding him
if he won his case, several league sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Arbitrator Kenneth Dam ruled Friday that the NBA didn't
circumvent the collective bargaining agreement when it rejected
Starks' request. There is no provision in the collective bargaining
agreement for such a move, the NBA said.
</P>
<P>
   The players union argued that if Starks was willing to give up
his salary, the league shouldn't stand in his way of joining a team
with a shot at a championship.
</P>
<P>
   Because there was no circumvention, Dam said a grievance
arbitrator needed to hear the case. Dam is a system arbitrator.
</P>
<P>
   Starks' case will go to a grievance arbitrator, with a hearing
expected sometime this week.
</P>
<P>
   While the Starks' saga has the potential to be a distraction for
a team that's already struggling, it hasn't been, Floyd said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Potential is a good word. Potentially, it is a distraction,''
he said. ''Up until this point, it has not been a distraction at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Guard Randy Brown agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's hurt. His knees are hurting and he's not prepared to
play,'' Brown said. ''Am I going to question the man's integrity
when he says he's hurt? No.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls can still release Starks and let him sign with another
team, but they'd have to pay the remainder of his salary. Starks
would still be shut out of the playoffs, too.
</P>
<P>
   Players released after 11:59 p.m. on March 1 who then sign with
another team are not eligible to compete in the playoffs. Starks
wanted his release retroactive to Wednesday night to make him
eligible for the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ''I understand he wants to be with a contender,'' Brown said.
''Who doesn't?''

<P>
   KANATA, Ontario (AP) -- Daniel Alfredsson scored on a penalty
shot early in the second period and the Ottawa Senators went on to
beat the Atlanta Thrashers 3-2 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Zamuner and Joe Juneau also scored for the Senators, who
extended their unbeaten streak to five games (3-0-2).
</P>
<P>
   Hnat Domenichelli and Steve Guolla had goals for Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa rebounded from a 5-5 tie against the New York Islanders
on Thursday in which they allowed three short-handed goals.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, outshot 10-4 in the first period, opened the scoring
with 1:48 left in the period. Domenichelli swung behind the net,
with the teams skating 4-on-4, turned and beat Patrick Lalime to
the short side.
</P>
<P>
   The Senators took a 2-1 lead early in the second period when
Zamuner scored shorthanded at 2:15 and Alfredsson converted his
penalty shot at 3:14. Both goals came with Janne Laukkanen in the
penalty box for roughing.
</P>
<P>
   Alfredsson was awarded the penalty shot when rookie goalie Scott
Langkow got caught out of position and threw his stick at the puck.
The Ottawa captain beat Langkow on a backhander for his 13th goal.
</P>
<P>
   Juneau was all alone in front of Langkow when he converted Shawn
McEachern's pass with 2:09 left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Guolla cut the deficit to 3-2 at 4:26 of the third.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta was outshot 38-19.

<HEADLINE> Czeschin, Byrnes Win at World Cup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- Tommy Czeschin and Tricia Byrnes
converted near-perfect runs into victories in World Cup halfpipe
events on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Czeschin, of Mammoth Lakes, Calif., picked up his second World
Cup victory with a score of 45.3 points in his first of two runs.
Ross Powers, the 1998 Olympic bronze medalist, was second at 43.6
and Magnus Sterner of Sweden was third at 41.6.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pipe's really good,'' Czeschin said. ''It's a little
small, but it turned out to be a really good pipe. My first run was
solid. I wanted to land smooth and clean so I could go all out on
my second run.''
</P>
<P>
   Czeschin is currently fourth in the World Cup standings behind
Sweden's Thomas Johansson and Fredrick Sterner and Finland's Pasi
Voho. Johansson was hurt in training and missed Saturday's event.
</P>
<P>
   Byrnes, of New Canaan, Conn., won with a 37.8 in her first run,
edging teammate Kim Stacey of Stratton Mountain, Vt., with 37.5
</P>
<P>
   Germany's Sabine Wehr-Hasler, who leads the points race, was
third with a 35.1.
</P>
<P>
   Byrnes' fifth World Cup victory of the year left her in second
place in the season standings behind Wehr-Hasler, with Sweden's
Anna Hellman third.

<HEADLINE> Blues 1, Panthers 1, tie  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) -- Michal Handzus scored with 2:16 left in
regulation as the St. Louis tied the Florida Panthers 1-1 Saturday
night, ending the Blues' 10-game road-winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   The streak equaled the NHL record set by the Buffalo Sabres
during the 1983-84 season. The Blues' last road loss was Jan. 19
when they were beaten at Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Handzus tied it after Florida's Robert Svehla, who lost his
stick, tried to cover a loose puck in front of the crease. Instead,
the puck rolled through his hands and Handzus slapped it past
goalie Mike Vernon. Lubos Bartecko and Pavol Demitra, who extended
his point streak to six games, got the assists.
</P>
<P>
   Florida took a 1-0 lead at 6:40 of the second period on the
Panthers' third power play.
</P>
<P>
   Svehla's slap shot from the top of the right faceoff circle
deflected off goalie Roman Turek's pad. Peter Worrell slapped the
airborne puck into the net for his second goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis had killed 33 of 34 power-play opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Pavel Bure assisted on the goal to raise his team-leading point
total to 72.
</P>
<P>
   The Blues had other quality scoring opportunities late in the
first.
</P>
<P>
   Vernon barely got a glove on Scott Young's backhanded wrist
shot, sending the puck sailing over the crossbar. Less than a
minute later, Vernon made perhaps the biggest save of the game when
a wide-open Chris Pronger sent a wrist shot, from just outside the
crease, into Vernon's body.

<HEADLINE> No.17 Miss St. 62, No.2 Georgia 61  </HEADLINE>
By TERESA M. WALKER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) -- Mississippi State coach Sharon Fanning
has taken the coaching cliche of one game at a time all the way to
the Southeastern Conference title game.
</P>
<P>
   ''Y'all get bored with what I'm saying. We take it one day at a
time. I don't even know what the game time is tomorrow,'' Fanning
said after her No. 17 Lady Bulldogs beat No. 2 Georgia 62-61 on
Saturday to reach the championship game for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not finished, and we really have to maintain our focus
on just the little things to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Bulldogs (23-6) will play Tennessee, tied with Georgia
for No. 2 in the AP poll, in the championship game Sunday.
Tennessee beat Vanderbilt 61-53 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Nitra Perry scored all 12 of her points in the second half,
including two free throws with 1:42 left to put Mississippi State
ahead to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia (29-3) had a chance after Tawana McDonald blocked
Perry's shot with 13 seconds left. Kelly Miller inbounded the ball
with 8.2 seconds left to McDonald, took a return pass and then
clanked a 12-foot jumper off the rim.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't do a good job of drawing it,'' Georgia coach Andy
Landers said. ''They didn't do a good job of running it. It wasn't
very effective. It was a total screwup. I'll take credit. I've got
three more years on my contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi State, which had trailed by as much as eight in the
second half, rebounded the ball and ran out the final seconds to
end Georgia's 15-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia had been trying to win its first tournament title since
1986 and thought it had the perfect combination with the Miller
twins, Kelly and Coco.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams had trouble shooting Saturday, and the twins were
among the worst. Kelly Miller was 5-of-18 for 13 points, Coco
Miller 5-of-12 for 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   Landers didn't sound worried about his Lady Bulldogs' first loss
since Jan. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to go home, take the hood off the car and
break the engine down. This is a very good basketball team. I've
lost no confidence in them. If anything we have a chance to learn a
very valuable lesson,'' Landers said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is you may have to play a little bit harder on the
offensive end to get the results that were easier to get earlier
(in the season).''
</P>
<P>
   Mississippi State, playing its third game in as many days,
looked tired for much of the game and didn't start clicking until
Angela Harris' layup tied it at 51 with 4:56 left. The Lady
Bulldogs took their first lead since late in the first half on a
three-point play by LaToya Thomas with 2:43 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The teams swapped the lead three times with four ties in the
final 4:56. Georgia's luck was summed up when Coco Miller saw a
jumper roll around and fall out down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, the SEC's leading scorer, led Mississippi State with 19
points. Perry finished with 12, Cynthia Hall had 12 and Harris 10.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia led by as much as 44-36 at the 8:56 mark on a layup by
Coco Miller. But then Thomas finally wore down senior center Angie
Ball with three quick fouls. She connected on a three-point play
and then made two free throws within the next minute.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald finished with 12 for Georgia, and Angie Ball and Deana
Nolan each had 10.

<P>
   CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) -- Michelle Snow hit her first six shots
and finished with 20 points to help No. 2 Tennessee beat Vanderbilt
61-53 Saturday night and reach the Southeastern Conference
tournament title game for a third straight year.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Vols (27-3) will face No. 17 Mississippi State, a 62-61
upset winner over Georgia, which was tied for No. 2 in the country
with Tennessee. The Vols will be trying to win their 10th SEC
tournament championship Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt (20-12) was in the semifinals for the first time
since 1995 when the Commodores won the tournament by beating
instate rival Tennessee. But the Commodores haven't beaten the Lady
Vols since then and had to face them for the third time in 29 days.
</P>
<P>
   Snow took away any hopes of an upset in the opening minutes as
Tennessee won for the 12th straight time in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Snow hit jumpers from all over the court and keyed a 13-2 run
with eight points. Her 3-footer with 13:30 to go made it 15-4, and
Vandy didn't get to within eight until it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, which has won more SEC tourney games than any other
school, led 36-23 at halftime and built that to as much as 54-39
with 7:24 to go on a bucket by Semeka Randall.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady Vols survived a nearly four-minute stretch without a
point in the second half when Vandy could only get a one basket
from Zuzi Klimesova. They had a chance to get closer inside the
final five minutes. Jillian Danker hit a jumper to get within 56-46
with 4:43 left and then scored on the next possession only to have
the basket nullified by a charge.
</P>
<P>
   Tamika Catchings added 12 points for Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Chantelle Anderson led Vanderbilt with 19 points, and Klimesova
finished with 13.

<P>
   MEDICINE HAT, Alberta (AP) -- Canadian swimmer Tara Sloan was in
critical condition Saturday after a highway accident in which the
van she was driving rolled over several times.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan, 20, of Calgary, was heading east Friday afternoon on
Highway 1 east of Medicine Hat when the accident occurred. The RCMP
said road conditions were good at the time of the accident and that
Sloan was wearing a seat belt.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan was airlifted to a Calgary hospital where she was in a
coma with head and abdominal injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan, who specializes in the 100- and 200-meter breaststroke,
is a five-time Canadian champion. In last summer's Pan-Am Games in
Winnipeg, Manitoba, she finished eighth in the 200. She holds the
Canadian record in the 100.

McCain, Bush Campaign in New England
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) -- Republican presidential hopefuls George W. Bush and
John McCain continued on the campaign trail today in different parts of the
Northeast region. In the weekend before Tuesday's 13-state sweepstakes, Bush
campaigned in New York while McCain started in New England, the geography
highlighting the presidential contenders' different strategies as they seek
their share of the 613 delegates up for grabs. Polls show McCain leading Bush in
some New England states, so the Arizona senator started his day in Boston before
flying to an event in Portland, Maine. Polls indicate a tight race in New York
and McCain was also making stops in Syracuse and Rochester.

they'd eaten in four or five days after being stranded in trees and rooftops,
waiting for aid. Mozambique's National Disaster Coordination Center welcomed the

   NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Times has endorsed Vice President Al Gore and

The Times, which has not endorsed candidates for the presidential primaries
since 1992, will publish the announcement in Sunday edition's op-ed page,
according to a press release today. The release said the endorsements were made
because of the competitiveness of the contests and as a ''tribute to the vigor
and seriousness that the four candidates have brought to this campaign season.''

China's Premier Makes Taiwan Warning

<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- China will not ''sit idly by'' and accept Taiwan going its
own way, but hopes the island's leaders and people will accept peaceful
reunification, Premier Zhu Rongji said Sunday in a nationally televised speech.
The mainland and the island of Taiwan have been ruled separately since the end
of the Chinese civil war in 1949. China claims Taiwan as a province that must be
reunited eventually. Zhu, who has guided China's economic development, said
Beijing would push ahead with measures to reform debt-ridden state enterprises,
develop infrastructure and stimulate domestic demand.

   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- A group that wants the South to secede from the
union staged a Confederate flag-waving rally today, a day before President
Clinton was to lead marchers across a Selma bridge to mark the 35th anniversary
of ''Bloody Sunday'' in the civil rights movement. Afterward, members of the
Southern nationalist organization that staged the rally signed a ''Declaration
of Southern Cultural Independence,'' described as the first step in what they
hope is a second secession by the South. Montgomery police and Hill estimated
the crowd at about 2,500.

World's Population Getting Fatter
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Researchers reported today that for the first time there
may be as many people overweight as there are underweight. But just because
people are gaining weight does not mean that the world is better fed or
healthier than two decades ago when millions more were starving. The report by
Worldwatch researchers suggests that both underweight and overweight poor people
are victims of malnutrition. Well-off minorities in India, China, Brazil and
some other developing nations are growing fat as the poor go hungry. America and
other wealthier countries have the opposite problem: The richer and
better-educated tend to eat right, while the poor often balloon from a diet of
cheap and fatty fast foods.

scored 11 to lead Atlanta, which has lost three of four and six of its last

<HEADLINE> No.25 Illinois 73, Northwestern 44  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KELLY, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) -- In a meaningless game for both teams, it
was a sapped Northwestern squad that came out looking ahead -- to a
fresh start, next season.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just need to put the year behind us,'' Northwestern coach
Kevin O'Neill said after the Wildcats dropped a 73-44 decision to
Illinois on Saturday to end the regular season without a Big Ten
victory.
</P>
<P>
   No. 25 Illinois, which has won 10 of its last 12, starts the
postseason Friday against Indiana in the quarterfinals of the
conference tournament in Chicago. Northwestern (5-24 overall, 0-16
Big Ten) plays another game there, too, in the first round
Thursday, but it didn't seem apparent in O'Neill's words.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hit a wall tonight,'' O'Neill said. ''This is just a result
of the whole year now. When you're 5-24 and 0-16. It catches up
with you. I actually feel kind of bad for the players. It's been a
tough year for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats didn't get a single point off the bench as Illinois
(19-8, 11-5) got a victory to dull the pain of its 64-51 loss six
days ago to sixth-ranked Ohio State in Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   Cory Bradford scored 20 points and Frank Williams added 16, the
best output Illinois coach Lon Kruger has seen from his starting
backcourt all season.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both made some threes and they moved the ball for one
another,'' Kruger said. ''You can list a lot of people and feel
good about their progress and that translates into progress as a
group.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams and Bradford both said they are getting more
comfortable sharing the court with one another with each passing
game.
</P>
<P>
   Watching a sloppy game dominated by errant 3-pointers and
fumbled passes, the loudest the Assembly Hall fans got was during
pregame Senior Day festivities and a halftime show featuring doggy
hurdle races.
</P>
<P>
   Northwestern didn't start quite as badly as when the teams met
earlier this season, when the Wildcats didn't score in the game's
first 15 minutes and had just six points in the first half on the
way to a 63-30 loss at Evanston.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hard to work much harder than we did at Northwestern,''
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats did struggle again, however, shooting 27 percent
and turning the ball over 13 times in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Lepore, the only Northwestern player who seemed able to
find the basket, scored 10 of his 12 points in the first half. His
3-pointer with 10:50 left in the half got Northwestern to 19-14,
the closest it would be in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats couldn't shoot, rebound or hold the ball after
that. Illinois outscored Northwestern 18-4 from there, and could
have made things a lot worse.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of Illinois' big run, freshman guard Frank Williams
tried a couple behind-the-back passes and an alley-oop. All three
were turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois' attempts at style points finally netted some actual
points with 13:55 to go in the game, when Bradford lobbed a
floating pass that Griffin dunked to give the Illini their biggest
lead to that point, 47-27. After that, Illinois just roared away.

<HEADLINE> Farmworkers Protest In Florida  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE SCHNEIDER, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Three dozen farmworkers, joined by nearly
200 supporters, finished a 15-day march Saturday to the
headquarters of the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association to
protest the wages and working conditions of tomato pickers.
</P>
<P>
   The 230-mile march from Fort Meyers was only the latest in a
series of actions members of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers
have undertaken in an effort to get Florida's tomato growers to
talk to them. The coalition isn't a union but is seeking some
collective bargaining powers.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, members of the coalition engaged in a work
stoppage and two seasons ago six tomato pickers went on a hunger
strike that gained the attention of former President Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ''What we want first is a dialogue with the growers,'' said
Lucas Benitez, a coalition leader.
</P>
<P>
   Added Laura Germino, a march coordinator: ''They're not asking
for overtime. They're not asking for vacation time ... They're
asking for the right to talk to their bosses for a decent wage.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Florida Fruit and Vegetable Association
refused to meet with the marchers Saturday, saying they're not in a
position to represent the growers on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been told by our membership that it isn't in our
place,'' said Ray Gilmer, communication's director of the growers'
association. ''That's between the workers and their employers.''

<HEADLINE> No. 16 Texas 99, Kansas St. 70  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG TUCKER, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN, Kan. (AP) -- This was every shooter's dream game.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Kelly hit 13 of his first 15 shots and scored a
career-high 33 points Saturday night, leading No. 16 Texas to a
99-70 victory over Kansas State that doomed the Wildcats to last
place in the Big 12 race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was on fire,'' the 6-foot-3 guard said.
</P>
<P>
   Eclipsing his season average by 15 points, Kelly threw in
everything from off-balance fallaway jumpers to driving layups to
long-range bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt like I couldn't miss out there, especially after I hit
that first 3-pointer when they left me all alone in the second
half,'' he said. ''Look at me -- I'm not even tired. I wish I could
go right back out there and play another game.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly wound up 13-for-17 and missed only two of eight 3-point
attempts and compensated for the absence of 7-footer Chris Mihm,
who sat out much of the game because of foul trouble.
</P>
<P>
   'A lot of good things happened in this game, especially Darren
Kelly,'' Texas coach Rick Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas (22-7, 13-3 Big 12) finished second in the regular season
Big 12.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats (9-18, 2-14) who earlier in the season tied their
single-season team record with an 11-game losing streak, ended the
miserable regular season losing 15 of 17.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Tom Asbury, who also finished last in the conference race
his first season in 1994-95, is certain to come under greater heat
from fans and alumni and could be the first Kansas State coach in
55 years to depart with an overall losing record.
</P>
<P>
   ''Through the good times and the bad times and we've had a lot
of bad times this year, that family in the locker room has always
stuck together,'' said Tony Kitt, Kansas State's senior forward.
''If I had the chance to do it all over again, I wouldn't trade it
for anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Asbury drew a technical foul in the first half for arguing with
officials and threw his suit coat onto the floor in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think if we would have played perfectly, over our heads, we
would still have ad a hard time beating them,'' Asbury said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, which had never before won at Kansas State, put the game
out of reach with a 9-0 run early in the first half, turning a
54-44 lead into a 63-44 bulge. Kelly made sure the Wildcats never
recovered, hitting a 3-pointer for a 78-55 lead with eight minutes
to go, then scoring every point in a 7-0 run that gave the
Longhorns a commanding 88-61 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Gabe Muoneke finished with 27 points, including 12-of-15 from
the foul line. Mihm had 17. Groves had 17 for Kansas State and
Travis Reynolds and Josh Reid each had 12.
</P>
<P>
   Mihm went to the bench with his second foul halfway through the
first half with Texas leading by 10. But Muoneke and Kelly took up
the slack as the Wildcats failed to take advantage of the
7-footer's absence and trailed 44-35 when Kelly hit a baseline
jumper at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   Texas outrebounded the shorter Wildcats 39-31.

   STILLWATER, Okla. (AP) -- Nolan Johnson scored 21 points and held
Desmond Mason without a field goal as No. 21 Oklahoma beat No. 13
Oklahoma State 59-56 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The victory makes the Sooners (24-5, 12-4 Big 12) the No. 3 seed
in the conference tournament. It also spoiled the final home game
for Oklahoma State's seniors in the final game before Gallagher-Iba
Arena is renovated.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma State (23-5, 12-4) let a 13-point second-half lead slip
away and as a result will be the fourth seed in the Big 12
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Mason, third in the league with 18.6 points per game, was 0-of-8
from the field and finished with six points. Oklahoma's Eduardo
Najera scored just nine -- none in the final 18{ minutes -- but he
got help from Johnson and Kelley Newton down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   A baseline jumper by Joe Adkins gave Oklahoma State a 50-39 lead
with 8:49 to play. Then Oklahoma made six straight shots and scored
on seven consecutive trips in a 17-2 run that gave the Sooners the
lead for good, 56-52. Newton had two 3-pointers, Johnson hit three
baskets and Hollis Price scored five.
</P>
<P>
   Adkins scored on a backdoor layup with 1:11 remaining to get the
Cowboys within 58-56, but they didn't score again. Johnson made a
free throw with 15.3 seconds remaining for a 59-56 lead, and
Glendon Alexander's 3-point try with two seconds left bounced off
the rim.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Montonati had 15 points and Adkins scored 12 for the
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Najera, second in the Big 12 with an 18.9 average, didn't make
his first basket until 3:08 remained before halftime. He converted
a three-point play at that point and added four free throws the
rest of the way. He wound up 2-of-10 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher-Iba Arena, which opened in 1938, will be doubled in
size to about 13,000 when it reopens in December. The Cowboys had
won all 14 of their home games before Saturday, when Oklahoma won
its second straight in Stillwater.

<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta (AP) -- German Titov scored a power-play goal
and set up Jiri Slegr for the game-winner as the Pittsburgh
Penguins halted a six-game winless streak Saturday night with a 3-2
victory over the Edmonton Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   Oilers goalie Tommy Salo had a tough night as two of
Pittsburgh's goals came from bad angles.
</P>
<P>
   Titov had to be helped off the ice early in the third period
after taking a vicious check from Janne Niinimaa. The Edmonton
defenseman was assessed a five-minute boarding major and game
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Penguins right-wing Aleksey Morozov opened the scoring 5:25 in
by banking a shot off Salo from behind the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonton enforcer Georges Laraque tied it when he lifted a shot
past Jean-Sebastien Aubin with 21 seconds left in the first.
</P>
<P>
   The Oilers were outshot 12-8 in the second, during which Titov
and Slegr gave Pittsburgh a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Penguins held off a late charge by the Oilers that was
sparked by Edmonton forward Alex Selivanov, who redirected a Josef
Beranek pass on a power play at 12:32 of the third for his 21st
goal.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh played without captain Jaromir Jagr, out with
hamstring and thigh injuries. The Penguins are 2-6-3 without Jagr
this season.

<HEADLINE> Virginia 89, No.17 Maryland 87 OT  </HEADLINE>
By JUSTIN POPE, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- Adam Hall was at his best with the
game on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Hall hit two free throws to force overtime then hit the
game-winning 3-pointer with 25.8 seconds left in the extra period
as Virginia rallied to beat No. 17 Maryland 89-87.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was the greatest game anybody on our team played all
year,'' Virginia's Donald Hand said of Hall, who finished with 16
points, seven rebounds and three steals. ''He really stepped it up
on defense. When we needed a bucket he got steals, went down, got
fouled and hit his free throws, then knocked down the big shot to
win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss ended Maryland's nine-game Atlantic Coast Conference
winning streak and gave a big boost to Virginia's hopes for an
at-large berth in the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are definitely in now. I thought they should been in
before tonight's game having won eight games in the ACC,'' Maryland
coach Gary Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   After trailing throughout the second half, the Cavaliers (19-10,
9-7) went on an 11-4 run over the final 3:17 of regulation to force
the overtime. They tied it for the first time in the second half
when Hall stole the ball and hit two free throws with 35.2 seconds
left to even the score at 76.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland (22-8, 11-5) led 86-83 with 1:14 remaining in OT after
Tahj Holden hit two free throws, but Hall cut the lead to 86-84
with a free throw with 48 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   After a turnover by Juan Dixon, Virginia took an 87-86 on Hall's
3-pointer, moving ahead for the first time since a 12-11 first-half
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ''To tell you the truth I didn't know the score,'' Hall said.
''I was just playing ball. If you look at the score, that means
you're thinking about it too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Danny Miller led the Terrapins with 20 points, including 16 in
the first half, before fouling out with 3:39 left in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Hall and Chris Williams led Virginia with 16 points each.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia made several runs in the second half but could get no
closer than five until Donald Hand converted a three-point play off
a driving lay-up to cut the lead to 72-70 with 2:54 remaining in
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Hand, who finished with 11 points, shot just 1-of-8 from the
field before halftime and made a critical mistake just before
intermission, shooting an errant 3-point attempt as Virginia,
trailing 41-39, tried to hold for the last shot.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland turned that miss into a 3-pointer at the other end as
time expired, and Virginia, within striking distance of a tie found
itself down five at intermission.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland jumped out early in the second half with six straight
points and built its lead to as much as 11 in the second half
before Virginia rallied.
</P>
<P>
   The game was the regular season finale for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   ''We beat the 17th-ranked team in the country, we finished 9-7
in the conference and we beat Carolina twice -- I think we deserve
to be in,'' Cavaliers coach Pete Gillen said.

<HEADLINE> Houston Honored by Soul Train  </HEADLINE>
By CADONNA M. PEYTON, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The artist formerly known as Prince took top
honors along with Whitney Houston for the rare ''artist of the
decade'' awards at the annual Soul Train Music Awards on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The female trio TLC took home two awards for best rhythm 'n'
blues group for their frank put-down of men, ''No Scrubs,'' and
best R&AMP;B/soul album for ''Fanmail.'' The dynamic group also nabbed
two Grammy awards last month.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa ''Left Eye'' Lopes, the co-host of the show, was the only
one present to accept the award for TLC. She used most of her
acceptance speech to thank her family.
</P>
<P>
   ''To my brother who takes it much too personal when they don't
play the rap version on the radio ... and my mother who's always
there when I need her,'' Lopes said.
</P>
<P>
   Mary J. Blige, who won best R&AMP;B female album, won the Sammy
Davis Jr. Award for female ''Entertainer of the Year.'' The male
designee was multi-platinum selling hip-hop star DMX.
</P>
<P>
   Blige mentioned that minorities have struggled for recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel really good because this is a really big black awards
show, for black music and black people,'' she said backstage. ''And
I am the struggle, I am black music and I am black people.''
</P>
<P>
   On stage, Blige thanked her fans.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's because of each and every one of y'all that I've lasted
10 years and I'm not even out of my 20s,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''To all the thugs on the streets that give Mary love ... to
every little girl out there who ever wanted a Mary hairdo, thank
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginuwine won for best R&AMP;B male album for his ''100% Ginuwine.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The Artist,'' who changed his name to an unpronounceable
symbol, was singled out for his leadership during the decade for
pioneering a concept of Internet distribution of CD releases by
artists attached to his record label.
</P>
<P>
   He said the ''game'' of life is a struggle and not everyone will
excel.
</P>
<P>
   ''A selected few of us will do well, the majority will not,'' he
said. ''As a people we're considered a minority. There's nothing
minor about you. You are the most talented people.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitney Houston thanked God for her award as well as the
individuals who worked on the album.
</P>
<P>
   Houston distinguished herself in the 1990s with millions of CD
sales, while co-starring in movies ''The Bodyguard,'' ''The
Preacher's Wife,'' and the television special ''Cinderella.''
</P>
<P>
   Other winners included Lauryn Hill, who reigned at last year's
show with three awards. She was awarded for her single
''Ex-Factor,'' and male artist Maxwell for his song ''Fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither were present to accept their awards.
</P>
<P>
   The show's hosts also included recording artists Tamia and Eric
Benet, and Shemar Moore, the newest host of the Soul Train TV
program, which began airing in 1970.

<HEADLINE> Suns 110, Mavericks 96  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Rodney Rogers, looking like a top contender for
the NBA's Sixth Man award, scored 14 of his 29 points in the fourth
quarter Saturday night as the Phoenix Suns increased their
homecourt winning streak to 10 games with 110-96 victory over the
Dallas Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers made 10 of 13 field goals and grabbed 10 rebounds for the
Suns, who have won 11 of 13 overall.
</P>
<P>
   He made consecutive 3-pointers as Phoenix outscored Dallas 19-8
during the final five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff Robinson scored 21 of his 27 in the first half for the
Suns. Tom Gugliotta added 18 points and 14 rebounds, and Jason Kidd
had 13 points and 14 assists.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix took the lead for good 60-50 with a 10-2 run to close
the first half, then stretched the margin to 16 in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But Dallas rallied behind Cedric Ceballos, whose rebound basket
capped an 8-1 run that cut the Suns' lead to 91-88 with 5:36 to
play. Phoenix scored the next nine points, punctuated by Rogers'
fastbreak slam-dunk on an underhand lob pass from Kidd to make it
100-88 with 3:07 left.
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos came off the bench to make 13 of 19 shots and score 33.
Michael Finley added 22 points and Dennis Rodman followed his
21-rebound performance against New Jersey with 19.
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive game, the Mavericks were without
coach Don Nelson because of the flu. His son, assistant coach Donn
Nelson, filled in.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers scored the last five points of the Suns' 10-2 run to end
the first half. Penny Hardaway, just 4-for-17 from the field,
started the surge with a 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   Another 12-2 spurt gave Phoenix a 76-60 lead. Gugliotta began
the run with a 3-point play and ended it with an inside basket.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson hit eight of 11 shots in the first half, including
4-of-7 3-pointers, for 21 points.
</P>
<P>
   Ceballos scored 11 in the second quarter as Dallas climbed back
from an early 11-point deficit to tie it at 50-50 on Erick
Strickland's 20-footer with 3:36 left in the second period.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Suns' Rex Chapman missed the game with the flu, and the
Suns used small forward Shawn Marion as the backup off-guard. ...
After shooting 28 percent in the first quarter, the Mavericks made
13 of their first 15 shots in the second. ... Robinson scored 15 in
the first quarter, including 3-pointers on three consecutive
possessions. ... Dallas had won three in a row on the road, and
seven of 10. ... Rodman drew a technical foul in the first quarter
for throwing the ball into the stands, then gave the ''T'' signal
simultaneously with referee Joe Forte. Later, he blew a kiss to
some hecklers after missing a free throw. With 40 seconds to play,
Rodman went to the bench and tossed his jersey into the crowd. ...
During its home streak, Phoenix has never won by fewer than 12.

<HEADLINE> Honduran Soccer Fans Keep Cool  </HEADLINE>
By MARCOS ALEMAN, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras (AP) -- Despite fears of border tensions
spilling over onto the soccer field, fans kept their cool Saturday
night as Honduras beat Nicaragua 3-0 in a World Cup qualifier amid
tight security.
</P>
<P>
   Police were out in force in this northern Honduran city due to a
renewed border dispute between the two Central American countries.
No problems were reported.
</P>
<P>
   At the stadium, about 500 police and soldiers provided security
and the city banned the sale of alcoholic beverages to prevent
potential problems.
</P>
<P>
   Honduran fans seemed to make an extra effort to put the visitors
at ease. The crowd of 20,000 people -- overwhelmingly Honduran --
cheered the Nicaraguan national anthem before the game and the
Nicaraguan team as it left the field. On Friday, about 100
schoolchildren greeted the Nicaraguans at their hotel, giving them
flowers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Honduran team showed no mercy on the field. It dominated
play, leaving Nicaragua with no serious scoring opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   A crisis developed between the two countries in November when
Honduras approved a treaty with Colombia that conflicted with
Nicaraguan claims to a large swath of the Caribbean that is claimed
by Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   Troop maneuvers -- and rumors of maneuvers -- near the borders
have kept tensions high. Last month, Nicaragua claimed that
Honduran patrol boats fired on Nicaraguan naval boats in another
disputed region, the Gulf of Fonseca in the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman last week called the game
''dangerous'' and expressed hope that it would not lead to a repeat
of the so-called ''soccer war'' of 1969 between El Salvador and
Honduras, which followed a World Cup qualifying game. Most
historians say the soccer match had nothing to do with that border
conflict, in which some 6,000 people died.

<HEADLINE> Timberwolves 91, Bucks 84  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Terrell Brandon scored 22 points in his return
to Milwaukee and Kevin Garnett had 21 points and 10 rebounds as the
Minnesota Timberwolves won for the sixth time in seven games,
beating the Bucks 91-84 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota, which went 20-of-20 from the free-throw line,
survived 27-percent shooting in the fourth quarter thanks to the
cool heads of Brandon and Garnett, who scored on four straight
possessions in the final minutes as the Timberwolves hung on.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett briefly left the game after landing awkwardly on his
left foot in the opening seconds of the third quarter. A team
spokesman said he had a mild foot sprain, but Garnett took a
pain-killing shot and didn't look limited as he scored 15 points in
the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee fell behind by 13 points in the third quarter but
opened the fourth with a 10-2 run before Brandon, who was traded by
the Bucks last season, and Garnett led the Wolves to their fourth
straight win at the Bradley Center.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the reeling Bucks' 10th in 12 games and eighth in
nine home games. Ray Allen had 28 points for the Bucks, and Glenn
Robinson added 21.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee returned to its slow-starting, weak-finishing ways at
the Bradley Center, where the Bucks snapped a seven-game losing
streak last Sunday against Orlando. The Bucks also blew a chance to
move past Detroit into the Eastern Conference's eighth playoff
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Minneapolis and Milwaukee are just 300 miles apart, but because
the teams play in different conferences, the geographical rivals
meet just twice a season. A large number of Timberwolves fans were
in attendance Saturday night, and Garnett's pregame cheer was as
loud as those for the Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   But the crowd's goodwill didn't extend to Brandon, traded last
season after refusing to negotiate a contract extension with the
Bucks. The trade also brought Sam Cassell, who had 14 points and
nine assists, to Milwaukee and sent Stephon Marbury to New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee fans booed Brandon loudly in introductions and every
time he scored. His former Bucks teammates laughed and joked with
him all night.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Mitchell's sprained left ankle kept him out of his eighth
straight game for Minnesota. Wally Szczerbiak started in his place
and scored 19 points, including 13 in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the game was officiated by two referees after Blane
Reichelt tripped and fell hard just three minutes into the first
quarter. Reichelt spent three minutes writhing in pain on the court
before being helped to the locker room by the Bucks medical staff.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee's Tim Thomas also jammed his left ankle late in the
second half and was helped to the locker room. Thomas returned and
finished with 13 points.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Oregon 86, No. 3 Arizona 81  </HEADLINE>
By LANDON HALL, Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Oregon's second amazing comeback in three
days sent the Pac-10 race into even further disarray, and made
Arizona that much more desperate to get Loren Woods back.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick Jones scored a career-high 27 points, and Oregon
outscored Arizona 15-1 in the final 4:46 to hand the third-ranked
Wildcats their second straight upset loss, 86-81 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just one of those grooves you get in,'' said Jones, who
scored 16 second-half points to help the Ducks come back from 17
points down.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon was coming off a wild 76-74 win over Arizona State on
Thursday night in which the Ducks scored six points in the final
five seconds and won it with Darius Wright's buzzer-beating heave.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think we got lucky the other night, but tonight we just
stuck with it,'' said Wright, who scored 15 points on 12-of-12 free
throws. ''It was our defensive intensity. Everybody stepped up and
rotated correctly.''
</P>
<P>
   Alex Scales, who scored a career-high 31 points Thursday night,
had 20 and hit two straight 3-pointers to begin the monumental
comeback for the Ducks (21-7, 12-5 Pac-10).
</P>
<P>
   Michael Wright scored a career-high 28 for Arizona (24-6, 13-3),
but was held scoreless in the final 6{ minutes as the Wildcats
missed a chance to grab a share of the Pac-10 lead after Stanford
lost to UCLA in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ''We played 30 minutes of great basketball. Unfortunately, the
game is 40 minutes long,'' said Arizona coach Lute Olson, whose
team lost 70-69 at Oregon State on a 3-pointer at the buzzer
Thursday night. ''Oregon is the kind of team that is not going to
quit. We had to play 40 minutes of tough basketball, and we kind of
wilted.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona, which played just seven players without 7-foot-1 center
Woods, who's out with an injured back until the NCAA tournament,
had just one field goal in the last 11:15. A mid-range jumper and a
free throw by Gilbert Arenas put the Wildcats ahead 80-71 with 4:46
left.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks chipped at the lead, and Jones dished to Scales for a
layup that tied it at 80 with 1:10 left. Wright stole the ball from
Arizona's Luke Walton and hit two free throws for an 82-80 lead,
and two more from the line made it 84-81.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona had a chance to tie in the final seconds, but Jason
Gardner's leaning, desperate 3-pointer was off, and Jones rebounded
with 2.6 seconds left. His free throws sealed it at 86-81.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had our lead, and we just tried to take time off the clock
instead of shooting the ball. That hurt us,'' said Gardner, who had
22 points despite feeling ill. ''We got too patient instead of
going at them.''
</P>
<P>
   Arenas added 15 for the Wildcats, who were swept in Oregon for
the first time since 1989-90. They had won 16 of their last 17
against the Ducks.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks clinched no worse than third in the Pac-10 by reaching
21 regular-season wins for the first time since 1944-45, when the
team was 28-15.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Oregon beat such a highly ranked team was Jan. 5,
1995, when it defeated No. 2 and eventual national champion UCLA
82-72.
</P>
<P>
   That also was the last year the Ducks went to the NCAA
tournament, a feat they're virtually assured of this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''What a fantastic victory,'' Oregon coach Ernie Kent said. ''To
have that kind of success against the No. 3 team in the nation,
that will have some effect on the pairings. This will help us going
into the postseason.''
</P>
<P>
   Oregon shot 24-of-25 from the line (96 percent), breaking the
school record of 95 percent set in a win over Rice in December
1977.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks nearly blew it with two stretches of poor shooting and
abysmal ball-handling, and the latter drought appeared to be fatal.
</P>
<P>
   After pulling to 55-51, Oregon committed four turnovers and
didn't score a point for more than two minutes. The Wildcats ran
off 13 quick points, and a driving layup by Arenas put his team up
68-51.
</P>
<P>
   But Arizona would get just two baskets after that -- a fallaway
bank shot by Wright and Arenas' jumper.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks took a 36-28 lead on a dunk by Jones, but didn't hit a
field goal in the last 5:10 of the first half. On its nine
possessions during that stretch, all the Ducks got were two field
goals after a technical foul was called on Arizona's Richard
Jefferson, who shoved a group of fans during an altercation after
he tumbled out of bounds going for a loose ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks had four turnovers and missed all three of their shots
during the bad stretch, and Gardner scored five points during a
16-2 run, including a leaning 3-pointer with 2.1 seconds left that
made it 44-38 at the half.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks had their fast break going early and got a big lift
when A.D. Smith entered the game four minutes in. Smith wasn't
expected to play until the postseason, but he wore a plastic mask
to protect the left cheekbone he broke in a victory at Southern
California last week.
</P>
<P>
   Smith was in primarily to help guard Wright, but Smith hit two
layups, and a 3-pointer by Jones gave Oregon an early 22-15 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a sophomore, had his previous career high of 23 last
season at Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   Wright, also a sophomore, surpassed his high of 24 against New
Mexico State last November.

<HEADLINE> No. 15 Tulsa 83, SMU 78, 2 OT  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON, AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Tony Heard hit a 3-pointer with 0.5 seconds left
to force overtime, then sank two free throws with 2.1 seconds
remaining in the second extra period to give No. 15 Tulsa an 83-78
victory over Southern Methodist on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Heard celebrated the last of his last of 24 points by putting
his right index finger to his mouth, as if to hush the rare sellout
crowd at Moody Coliseum, then killed the final seconds by throwing
the ball into the air.
</P>
<P>
   Teammates mobbed him at midcourt to celebrate the Golden
Hurricane's 27th victory, which tied the school record and gave
them the Western Athletic Conference championship.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa (27-3, 12-2 WAC) will be the top seed in the league
tournament next weekend. The champion doesn't get an automatic bid
into the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Mustangs (21-7, 9-5), who haven't beaten a ranked team in
seven years, could have gone a long way toward their first NCAA bid
since 1993 by beating Tulsa. However, inexperience in big games
showed, as SMU blew a three-point lead in the closing seconds of
regulation and a 1-point lead late in the first overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa star Eric Coley rebounded from a cold, sloppy start to
score five of his seven points in the extra periods.
</P>
<P>
   He set the tone in the second overtime by grabbing the opening
tip after several others dropped it, and turned it into a layup for
a 71-69 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Mustangs got within 71-70 but Tulsa scored the next eight
points, all on free throws.
</P>
<P>
   SMU hit some bombs to make it 81-78. Then Heard's final two foul
shots ended it.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Davis led SMU with 23 points and Jeryl Sasser added 15.
Each had 10 rebounds. They also had potential game-costing gaffes.
</P>
<P>
   Davis stole a pass at midcourt with 20 seconds left and the
Mustangs up 63-60. As he went for a layup, he spun away from a
defender and lost the ball out of bounds into the SMU bench. That
led to Heard's 3-pointer from the right corner that forced the
first overtime.
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Hurricane scored the first three points in the first
overtime and remained ahead until Damon Hancock's layup with 39.7
seconds left put SMU up 69-68. Brandon Kurtz hit a free throw with
19.1 seconds left to tie it.
</P>
<P>
   Sasser could have put SMU ahead, but he missed two free throws
with 13.4 seconds to play. Heard again took the final shot, but he
missed and time expired as the teams fought for the rebound.
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa, which has won seven of eight, beat the Mustangs for the
eighth straight time. Last month, the Golden Hurricane cruised to a
70-59 victory as SMU shot 24 percent and hit just 1-of-18
3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   The Mustangs ended the season 13-2 at home, both losses coming
in their last two games.

GOP Rivals Battle As Big Votes Loom
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) -- George W. Bush and John McCain campaigned through
the Northeast region today, the weekend before the 13-state ''Super Tuesday''
primary. Bush campaigned in New York while McCain started in New England, the
geography highlighting the presidential contenders' different strategies as they
seek their share of the 613 delegates up for grabs. Polls show McCain leading
Bush in some New England states, so the Arizona senator started his day in
Boston before flying to an event in Portland, Maine. Polls indicate a tight race
in New York and McCain was also making stops in Syracuse and Rochester.

Camps Open For Mozambique Flood Victims

   PALMEIRA, Mozambique (AP) -- Thousands of Mozambique's hungry and thirsty
flood victims straggled into makeshift camps Saturday after days of huddling on
rooftops or clinging to tree branches. As more supplies and equipment arrived
from around the world -- including the first of three U.S. planes carrying boats
from Miami -- survivors converged on camps. There they gulped down cornmeal soup
and beans, the first food many had eaten in four or five days. Authorities
estimated that 1 million people in this southeast African country urgently
require food, medicine and shelter.

the latest push from Dobrasin, a predominantly ethnic Albanian town in eastern
Serbia. Hundreds of people have fled the area in the past two months, streaming
into the closest Kosovo town of Gnjilane, about 30 miles southeast of Kosovo's

   MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- A group that wants the South to secede from the
union staged a Confederate flag-waving rally today, a day before President
Clinton was to lead marchers across a Selma bridge to mark the 35th anniversary
of ''Bloody Sunday'' in the civil rights movement. Afterward, members of the
Southern nationalist organization that staged the rally signed a ''Declaration
of Southern Cultural Independence,'' described as the first step in what they
hope is a second secession by the South. Montgomery police and Hill estimated
the crowd at about 2,500.

about $400,000 from the betting, Capt. Giancarlo Sulsenti of the paramilitary
tax police said in a telephone interview from Catania. The tax police, who are
continuing the investigation, said they didn't know exactly how many credit
cards were involved, but that they numbered in the thousands.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The artist formerly known as Prince took top honors along

Soul Train Music Awards on Saturday. Houston distinguished herself in the 1990s
with millions of CD sales, while co-starring in movies ''The Bodyguard,'' ''The
Preacher's Wife,'' and the television special ''Cinderella.'' ''The Artist,''
who changed his name to an unpronounceable symbol, was singled out for his
leadership during the decade for pioneering a concept of Internet distribution

after taking a vicious check from Janne Niinimaa. The Edmonton defenseman was
assessed a five-minute boarding major and game misconduct.
