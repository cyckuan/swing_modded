<HEADLINE> U.S. Vows To Seal China Trade Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Signaling their commitment to reaching a trade  
deal, President Clinton and Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji agreed to 
``move intensively'' in talks on opening China's markets and 
allowing the world's most populous nation to join the World Trade 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Zhu made the announcement in a joint communique  
after a 20-minute telephone conversation Tuesday while Zhu was 
visiting New York. Zhu left Washington last week disappointed that 
talks hadn't yielded a deal in time for his official visit to the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the conversation, they agreed that both sides should  
move intensively on negotiations toward resolution of the remaining 
issues in their talks on China's accession to the WTO,'' the joint 
communique said. ``They have agreed to have negotiations continue 
by the end of the month in Beijing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came as the administration rebutted  
congressional criticism of its failure to complete a trade deal and 
open China's vast market to American exporters during Zhu's visit. 
</P>
<P>
	A White House official closely tracking the issue said that  
although major differences remained in a half-dozen areas -- 
including rules governing banking, auto financing and greater 
access for Hollywood movies to China's markets -- there was still 
hope for a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's clear from the conversation the president had with Zhu  
today is that both parties want to try intensively to move the ball 
forward,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
The official cautioned, ``It's hard to predict outcomes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several lawmakers have expressed concern that China would  
withdraw concessions it made if a deal wasn't struck before Zhu 
left the country today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to ensure that we work very hard on resolving the  
remaining differences,'' said White House spokesman Jake Siewert. 
``But we've said all along, and we'll say it again -- in the end, 
what will drive the deal is real progress on opening China's 
markets, not any artificial deadlines or visits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky told lawmakers  
earlier Tuesday that Clinton was committed to seeing that 
negotiations are finished in time to clear the way for China to 
join the WTO, which regulates world trade, this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will re-engage with the Chinese shortly ... and work on  
each of the issues that are open to bring this full agreement to 
closure,'' Barshefsky told members of the Senate Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Many senators expressed fear Tuesday that a number of major  
concessions China was willing to make last week in order to close a 
deal during Zhu's visit may now be withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
	Several pointed to comments made by Zhu and other Chinese  
officials criticizing the administration for mischaracterizing 
commitments China has made, and the United States issued a detailed 
17-page fact sheet outlining the Chinese offers. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu complained last Friday the administration had ``made public  
many documents and said we had agreed to them, but in fact we have 
not agreed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, accused the administration of  
abandoning free-trade principles in an effort to force the Chinese 
to agree to blatantly protectionist provisions being pushed by U.S. 
textile and steel companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling the government's stance ``raw, rotten protectionism,''  
Gramm said the administration was trying to force China to extend 
U.S. textile quotas for five years longer than allowed under WTO 
rules. He said high U.S. barriers in this area already cost the 
average family of four $700 more in clothing bills each year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to lose more jobs by protecting noncompetitive  
American industries than we are going to possibly gain in those 
areas,'' Gramm said. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials have said that allegations about  
Chinese espionage and human rights abuses in China had made it even 
harder to win congressional approval for any trade deal short of an 
exceptional market-opening package. 
</P>
<P>
	According to one administration strategy being considered, U.S.  
and Chinese negotiators would wrap up a deal this year but delay a 
congressional vote on the matter until after the 2000 presidential 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Under this approach, China would join the Geneva-based WTO, but  
the United States would ``reserve approval.'' That would mean U.S. 
business would not get the benefits of China's market-opening moves 
until Congress got around to passing legislation ending annual 
reviews of U.S. tariff rates for Chinese goods.

<HEADLINE> Tapani To Miss Saturday Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- It seems the Chicago Cubs have more starting  
pitchers who are hurt than healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Tapani, who left Monday's home opener after three innings  
because of a sore right shoulder, will miss his scheduled start 
Saturday in Milwaukee as a precautionary measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Tapani will throw on the side Thursday to see if the pain  
returns. He sustained what was initially diagnosed as a muscle 
strain when he made a check-swing while batting against Houston 
last week. The condition flared up in Monday's loss to the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	``My concern is getting it healthy first,'' Tapani, a 19-game  
winner, said Wednesday after resting his shoulder for a second 
straight day. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't want it to drag through and then in August not be  
able to make a start. You want to go out there and let the game 
dictate when you come out, not whether you're feeling good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Mulholland, who's made the transition from reliever to  
starter and back the last two seasons, is slated to start Saturday 
at County Stadium in Tapani's place. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a utility pitcher,'' Mulholland said with a smile. ``I'm  
not worried if I start or relieve. If I had my way, I'd start every 
fourth day and also relieve. But that's not practical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tapani's condition is among a series of arm problems for the  
Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to be cautious with it and see if it needs to be  
more than one start,'' Cubs manager Jim Riggleman said. 
</P>
<P>
	NL Rookie of the Year Kerry Wood is out for the season after  
surgery to repair a torn elbow ligament. Reliever Terry Adams is 
also on the disabled list with a sore elbow, and on Tuesday the 
Cubs placed right-handed spot starter and reliever Kurt Miller on 
the DL with a strained rib cage muscle. 
</P>
<P>
	There's also Jeremi Gonzalez, on the DL while he recovers from  
elbow surgery last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs, looking for pitchers, signed Hideo Nomo to a Triple-A  
contract at the end of spring training. He will make the second of 
three scheduled starts Friday for Iowa before it's determined if 
he's ready to pitch for the major league team.

<HEADLINE> Cancer Researchers Await Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Cancer researchers and patients are expecting  
long-awaited studies on bone marrow transplants in treating 
advanced breast cancer to have inconclusive results, and thus are 
bracing for new controversy over whether women should undergo the 
costly and difficult treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the data are released Thursday, they are working to  
ensure that insurance companies continue to pay for the treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real dilemma we're in is, what happens now,'' said Dr.  
Harmon Eyre of the American Cancer Society. ``We think it's 
important that women still have the procedure covered until we have 
absolutely definitive studies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At issue is an aggressive treatment reserved for the most  
advanced breast cancer: Ultrahigh doses of chemotherapy followed by 
a bone marrow transplant to repair the immune system destruction 
caused by such high-dose therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	The therapy can cost $50,000 to $150,000, and dying patients  
have sued insurance companies to force coverage. Nine states have 
mandated payments: Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Massachusetts, 
Minnesota, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is no scientific proof that women undergoing the risky  
and painful procedure do better long-term than women given standard 
doses of chemotherapy and radiation. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, an estimated 6,000 Americans had the experimental  
treatment last year, less than 10 percent of whom entered clinical 
trials designed to determine if it's effective. 
</P>
<P>
	Why do women flock to an unproven treatment? Because the  
prognosis for advanced breast cancer is extremely grim. When cancer 
spreads to other organs, called metastatic disease, only 22 percent 
of patients survive five years. Some 43,000 women will die of 
breast cancer this year. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the American Society for Clinical Oncology will  
release preliminary results from the first four major studies of 
bone marrow transplant therapy. People familiar with the research 
say that overall, the results are equivocal. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientist who led the largest study and believes the  
treatment can work warned that the research is not complete yet. 
``It's too early to draw conclusions,'' stressed Dr. William Peters 
of the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute in Detroit, saying at 
least three more years of study is required. 
</P>
<P>
	Peters said Thursday's data would include ``some very  
encouraging news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But others questioned how good the news could be.  
</P>
<P>
	``If it were going to show a clear benefit, those data would  
have been out months ago, and they would have stopped (the studies) 
early,'' said Fran Visco of the National Breast Cancer Coalition. 
Visco has discussed the research with investigators and advises 
women now considering a bone marrow transplant to look carefully at 
Thursday's data. 
</P>
<P>
	How will insurance companies interpret the findings? Many won't  
make coverage decisions until they see more in-depth data from the 
studies, scheduled to be released next month at a major cancer 
meeting and then published in medical journals, said Dr. Don Young 
of the American Association of Health Plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Some doctors are eager to see if certain subgroups of patients  
responded better to bone marrow transplants, or if one type of 
high-dose chemotherapy worked better than another. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trials will leave open as many questions as they answer,''  
cautioned Dr. Stephen Forman of City of Hope National Medical 
Center. He offers bone marrow transplants and says patients 
expected to die have lived significantly longer with them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard to ignore those responses,'' Forman said, even as he  
noted that the question is whether less arduous treatments produce 
similar results. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's studies have flaws: They began 10 years ago, and both  
standard cancer treatments and the bone marrow transplants have 
improved since then. Also, too few cancer patients agreed to be in 
studies where they might be given a standard chemotherapy instead 
of the bone marrow transplant they desired. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tragedy here is that we would have had the answer years  
ago'' with better studies, Visco said. ``Physicians did not insist 
that that happen. Patients were told, 'This is the only thing that 
could possibly save your life.' That's why we're in the situation 
we are today,'' with more confusion inevitable.

<HEADLINE> Holocaust Necklace Fetches $277,500 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A diamond-and-emerald-studded platinum necklace  
that a European Jew hid under a kitchen tile during the Holocaust 
sold for $277,500 at auction Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the owner nor the buyer was identified.  
</P>
<P>
	The necklace has 235 diamonds and 18 emeralds.  
</P>
<P>
	According to Christie's auction house, the necklace was owned by  
a man who sold almost everything he owned to buy the jewelry to 
secure his family's future before the Nazis swept across Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The man had just cemented the treasure below a kitchen tile in  
his apartment when he and his wife were arrested by the Nazis. The 
couple ended up in a concentration camp; she died there. After the 
war, the husband found their hidden treasure intact. 
</P>
<P>
	The man died last year. In keeping with his final wishes, the  
proceeds from the auction will go to an Israeli hospital's wing for 
the elderly.

<HEADLINE> Three Mile Island To Be Sold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Another hurdle has been cleared in the  
sale of the Unit 1 reactor at Three Mile Island, a deal that would 
create the first foreign ownership of a nuclear power plant in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nuclear Regulatory Commission's approval of the sale leaves  
four more governmental approvals to be won. 
</P>
<P>
	GPU Nuclear Corp. wants to sell the 870-megawatt generating  
station near Middletown to the British-American partnership AmerGen 
for $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
	AmerGen was formed by PECO Energy Co. of Philadelphia and  
British Energy, the largest electricity generator in the United 
Kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as lock, stock and barrel, this is the first plant to  
change hands outright,'' NRC spokesman Neil Sheehan said of the 
deal that the commission approved Monday. Portions of ownership at 
nuclear plants have changed hands in the past, Sheehan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale still requires the blessing of the Internal Revenue  
Service and state utility commissions in Pennsylvania, New York and 
New Jersey. GPU is based in New Jersey and operates in the other 
two states. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS will review the tax status of about $320 million GPU has  
set aside for a safe shutdown of the plant when its operational 
life runs out. AmerGen wants funds to be transferred essentially 
tax-free, said PECO spokesman Bill Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  
approved the deal this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale does not include Three Mile Island's dormant Unit 2  
reactor, which was mothballed after America's worst commercial 
nuclear accident in March 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Unit 1 and Unit 2 are expected to be decommissioned at the  
same time. Unit 1's license is set to expire in 2014, although 
AmerGen can ask the NRC for an extension.

<HEADLINE> Starr Denounces Counsel Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr rebuffed  
allegations that he abused his office as ``completely bogus'' on 
Wednesday but stunned some of his harshest detractors by adopting 
their disdain for the law that empowered him to investigate the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid a polite but steady stream of criticism from Democratic  
senators, the controversial prosecutor mixed a legalistic defense 
of his staff's tactics with reflective and conciliatory statements. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there are ways in which I do search my memory and  
conscience and could we have done something in a less public way 
... and I despair,'' Starr testified -- at that point discussing the 
public battle last year to force Secret Service agents to testify 
about the relationship between President Clinton and Monica 
Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``We tried any number of ways. But that is certainly one example  
that comes to my mind,'' Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked at another point whether he would do some things  
differently in his five-year inquiry, Starr paused, then said he 
regretted the way the House treated the salacious report he sent 
alleging Clinton had committed impeachable offenses in concealing 
his affair with Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be much more emphatic with the House of  
Representatives in saying, 'Treat the material cautiously in light 
of the nature of this material,''' he told senators. ``I don't 
think I did enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats on the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, who had  
waited for months for the opportunity to grill Starr, were caught 
off guard when Starr sent in his testimony calling for abolition of 
the Independent Counsel Act. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you live long enough, you'll experience everything. I never  
expected to be sharing that judgment with you,'' said Sen. Robert 
Torricelli, D-N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	At the White House, press secretary Joe Lockhart said it was  
``difficult to see how you reconcile'' Starr's investigation with 
his objections. But, Lockhart added, ``we'll leave it to more 
objective commentators and historians to draw their own 
conclusions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said Starr's reasoning that the  
independent counsel law was flawed because the process had become 
too politicized was like ``Jack the Ripper calling for more 
neighborhood patrols because of the surge in crime victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr reiterated that he believes he has the power to indict  
Clinton after the president leaves office, and he said his 
criticism of the 1978 law wouldn't interfere with his continuing 
duties as independent counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	The law expires June 30, and Starr recommended to the Senate  
panel reviewing its future that it not be renewed because it was 
``constitutionally dubious'' and ``structurally unsound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's $40 million investigation and the impeachment trial it  
prompted was so emotionally charged that some senators have 
suggested a cooling-off period before a final decision is made on 
whether to reauthorize the law. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am going to take some time for my part,'' committee chairman  
Fred Thompson, R-Tenn. said. ``Feelings are high and emotions are 
high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No consensus exists for how to fix what critics say are the  
statute's flaws -- chiefly the lack of a way to hold independent 
counsels accountable for their tactics and the money they spend. 
Starr said the law violates the constitutional separation of powers 
between the branches of government and leaves the investigator 
vulnerable to political attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	But he bristled when senators raised what he called ``completely  
bogus allegations that continue to be bandied about'' that his 
staff used abusive and unfair tactics with witnesses, particularly 
Ms. Lewinsky, and pressed the investigation into areas outside his 
jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not apologize for trying to gather the facts consistent''  
with FBI methods, Starr said. 
</P>
<P>
	Torricelli, one of Starr's harshest critics, refused to accept  
Starr's assertion that politically motivated attacks and a 
``carnivallike'' media atmosphere tarnished his public image. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is true that you were under merciless attack, but it was  
not necessary to pin a target to your chest on all occasions 
either,'' said Torricelli. ``To be fair, you were a contributor to 
some of your own public demise in the eyes of the American 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the hearing, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., revived a  
controversy over Starr's selection by a panel of three judges. He 
asked the panel's chief, U.S. Appeals Judge David Sentelle, whether 
he discussed who should be appointed independent counsel during his 
lunch with conservative North Carolina Sens. Lauch Faircloth and 
Jesse Helms in 1994, just before Starr was named. 
</P>
<P>
	If the subject came up, it was only in passing, Sentelle said..  
</P>
<P>
	``There is no vast right wing conspiracy,'' he said. ``And if  
there was, we would not have met in the Senate dining room.''

<HEADLINE> Boxing To Try New Judging Format </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	When a boxing doubleheader is held April 24 in Washington, knee  
jerks will be in evidence in the wake of the controversial draw 
between Lennox Lewis and Evander Holyfield for the undisputed world 
heavyweight championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis clearly won the fight, but only one judge scored it for  
him. One scored it for Holyfield and the third called it even. 
</P>
<P>
	With politicians screaming about what they see as the dirty,  
suspect sport of boxing, the WBA and the WBC are going to make sure 
the public knows how the judges are scoring. The two organizations, 
naturally, are going about it in different ways. 
</P>
<P>
	When Sharmba Mitchell defends the WBA super lightweight title  
against Reggie Green April 24, the WBA will have the judges' 
scoring announced after every round. 
</P>
<P>
	When Hassine Cherifi of France defends the WBC middleweight  
title against Keith Holmes on the same card, the judges scores will 
be revealed publicly after four rounds and again after eight. 
</P>
<P>
	Revealing the scores before a fight is over will pertain only to  
championship bouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The intent of open scoring is to let the public and the boxers  
know how the judges are scoring each round as the fight 
progresses,'' said York Van Nixon, WBA vice president. ``It will 
allow parties to know how the fight is going and remove doubt at 
the same time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It will allow fighters to stay away, to play it safe. If a boxer  
is three rounds ahead with two rounds to go, his object will be to 
play it as safe as possible. Boxing is a risk sport, and a boxer 
not knowing exactly where he stands in the scoring adds to the risk 
and to the excitement for the paying customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Say the hometown fighter is behind by a round on at least two  
cards with two rounds remaining. What will be the hometown fans' 
reactions? Judges have ears, you know, and they can feel pressure 
from a hostile crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people are in favor of that system, of announcing the  
points at the (end of the) fourth and eighth rounds and the final 
score at the end, especially after what happened last time 
(Lewis-Holyfield),'' said Eduardo Lamason, WBC executive secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, everybody favors announcing the final score, but more than  
a few members of the boxing press never knew the revelation of 
scores after the fourth and eighth rounds was even being discussed 
until it was announced April 8. 
</P>
<P>
	The WBC's idea makes more sense than the WBA's. It reduces the  
pressure on the judges that might be generated by the crowd. It 
also in many cases keeps the fighters in the dark about the 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Suspense about the outcome, of course, adds flavor to a fight.  
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps, to maintain this suspense and also reach a fair  
outcome, what is really needed is not the public revelation of 
scores, but competent judges. 
</P>
<P>
	So why not have a pool of judges, tried and true, to draw from  
by all the sanctioning bodies instead of each organization being in 
the position of appointing judges from various member commissions 
as a means of doing favors and keeping them happy? 
</P>
<P>
	A pool might not work for championship fights outside the United  
States, but such a concept could work in the United States through 
federal legislation. Such legislation would not rule out foreign 
judges, if they met certain standards. 
</P>
<P>
	If three American judges score a fight involving an American and  
a foreign boxer, so what if they are competent.

<HEADLINE> NFL Analyst Dierdorf Hired at CBS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It didn't take long for Dan Dierdorf to find  
another job. Two months after being forced out of ABC's ``Monday 
Night Football'' booth, he has returned to CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierdorf comes back to the network he left in 1987 for ``MNF''  
because of a loophole in his contract: He never signed it. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS will team Dierdorf with Verne Lundquist as its No. 2 NFL  
broadcasting team. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49-year-old Dierdorf was prepared to sit out next season,  
but CBS executives were able to change his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``ABC was a less-than-happy time for me and I didn't think  
anything would make me feel good about going back to television,'' 
Dierdorf said. ``But CBS really went out of their way to convince 
me that it was a good move for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dierdorf's contract wasn't renewed after 12 years as an analyst  
with ``Monday Night Football.'' The former NFL offensive lineman 
and Hall of Famer called his final game with ABC at this year's Pro 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	He is expected to make about $1 million a year at CBS, a  
significant pay cut from the $1.75 million he earned each year with 
ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	Although his new position will have a much lower profile than  
``Monday Night Football,'' it will have its advantages. 
</P>
<P>
	The always vocal Dierdorf will return to a two-man booth, which  
will allow him more air time than while working with two other 
people on Mondays. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierdorf also will be able to focus more on the game, rather  
than trying to find a balance of entertainment and football for the 
many casual Monday night viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a different way of doing football on Sunday afternoons,''  
Dierdorf said. ``Monday night is unique. There's much less Xs and 
Os. Certainly I'll be getting back to more football basics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CBS Sports president Sean McManus said the decision was made  
last month but the announcement was delayed because the network has 
been preoccupied with the NCAA tournament and the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of Dierdorf allows CBS to move No. 2 analyst Randy  
Cross into the studio. Cross will team with a revamped cast that 
includes former Fox analyst Jerry Glanville, Craig James and host 
Jim Nantz. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole deal with Dan coming in makes the division  
stronger,'' Cross said. ``I wasn't surprised that Dan came back, 
because it's tough to get away from this game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ABC Sports president Howard Katz is in the process of deciding  
whether to bring in a replacement for Dierdorf or go with a two-man 
booth. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they decide to go with Monday night is up to them,''  
Dierdorf said. ``I work at CBS.''

<HEADLINE> Dan Dierdorf Hired by CBS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After being pushed out of ABC's ``Monday Night  
Football'' booth two months ago, Dan Dierdorf has returned to CBS 
as its No. 2 NFL analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS will announce later today that Dierdorf will join Verne  
Lundquist as the network's No. 2 NFL broadcasting team. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierdorf's contract wasn't renewed after 12 years as an analyst  
with ``MNF'' and the 49-year-old recently said he would take a year 
off from broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
	However, he has had a change of heart and has returned to the  
network where he began his broadcasting career back in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierdorf did not sign his contract in 1985, and after working  
one season, left the network for more money and a higher profile 
with ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	Dierdorf will likely take a pay cut from his ``MNF'' salary of  
$1.75 million a year. He is expected to make about $1 million a 
year at CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of Dierdorf allows CBS to move current No. 2  
analyst Randy Cross into the studio. Cross will team with a 
revamped cast that includes former Fox analyst Jerry Glanville, 
Craig James and veteran host Jim Nantz.

<HEADLINE> Hughes' Earnings Down 25 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- Hughes Electronics Corp. reported a 25  
percent drop in first-quarter earnings due to lower interest income 
and higher depreciation costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The satellite and telecommunications company reported Wednesday  
that excluding one-time items, it earned $40.1 million, or 10 cents 
per share, down from $53.7 million, or 13 cents per share during 
the first quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	One-time items in the first quarter included a $94.3 million  
after-tax gain related to settlement of a patent infringement case 
and a $56.1 million after-tax charge related to the termination of 
a $450 million Asia-Pacific Mobile Telecommunications contract. 
</P>
<P>
	In infringement case, Hughes sued the federal government  
alleging it used pioneering Hughes technology to position 
satellites in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	When the one-time items are included, Hughes had earnings of  
$78.3 million, or 20 cents per share, compared to $44.5 million, or 
11 cents a share, for the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the period rose 12.5 percent to $1.45 billion,  
compared to $1.3 billion for the same period last year. Hughes said 
subscriber growth in its DirecTV business accounted for the revenue 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
	While each Hughes unit -- direct-to-home broadcast, satellite  
services, satellite systems and network systems -- increased 
business, the company said depreciation, amortization and a 
decrease in interest income led to its earnings drop. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes Electronics stock closed down 37 1/2 cents to $54.62 1/2 in  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The company's results 
exceeded analyst expectations of 9 cents a share, according to 
First Call Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes Electronics Corp. is a unit of General Motors Corp.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Privatizes Gas Distributor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- An Anglo-Dutch consortium outbid three  
rivals Wednesday and acquired control of Brazil's largest natural 
gas distributor, Companhia de Gas de Sao Paulo, for about $1 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale represented the first privatization since Brazil  
devalued its currency earlier this year and was seen as a vote of 
confidence in the prospects for Latin America's largest economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In an auction held at the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, the group  
formed by Royal Dutch Shell and British Gas topped three other 
bidders for control of the distributor also known as Comgas. 
</P>
<P>
	The other bidders were identified as the U.S. energy company  
Enron Corp., a group led by Italy's AGip and a consortium made up 
of Argentina's YPF and Spain's Iberdrola. 
</P>
<P>
	Comgas serves some 300,000 customers in Brazil's in Sao Paulo,  
Brazil's wealthiest and most populous and industrialized state. 
</P>
<P>
	Shell already owned a 16 percent stake in Comgas, and like  
British Gas has a stake in the Brazil-Bolivia natural gas pipeline, 
which by 2010 will transport up to 30 million cubic meters of gas 
from Bolivia to Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, Dioclecio Araujo, president of British Gas  
South America, said the company will have a 70 percent stake in 
Comgas, while Shell's Brazilian unit will have 26 percent. 
Companhia Paulista de Forca e Luz, a Sao Paulo energy distributing 
company, will have the remainder. 
</P>
<P>
	``Comgas clearly has a brilliant future,'' Araujo said, citing  
the potential for increased use of natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
	He said natural gas currently comprises 2 percent of the energy  
consumed in the state, a figure he hopes will rise to 12 percent 
within eight to 10 years. The terms of the concession specify that 
Comgas must increase its consumer base by 200,000 in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Araujo said British Gas will pay for its stake in Comgas using  
its own cash flow and that it should invest about $200 million in 
Comgas through the year 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Sao Paulo Deputy Governor, Geraldo Alckmin said the state was  
``more than 100 percent satisfied'' with the result. 
</P>
<P>
	``This shows a huge amount of international confidence in Sao  
Paulo and in the country,'' he said, citing the economic 
uncertainty that has plagued the country over the past several 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Economic panic started sweeping Brazil on Jan. 13 when the  
currency plunged 46 percent. However, over the past several weeks 
the economy has rebounded. The currency is stronger, inflation is 
lessening and investors are slowly returning. 
</P>
<P>
	The Comgas concession contract is for a 30-year term, renewable  
for another 20 years. The auction winners will have distribution 
exclusivity for the duration of the contract, and on sales for 12 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	British Gas officials said the Comgas investment was one of the  
company's largest ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a major step, but one we are happy to take,'' said  
Barry Adams, president of British Gas in Brazil. ``We believe the 
investment is realistic given the market potential.'' said .

<HEADLINE> Site of Real Rose Theater Is Opened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- In the Academy Award-winning film ``Shakespeare in  
Love,'' the Rose Theater gleams, a three-tiered wooden structure 
that teems with avid playgoers. 
</P>
<P>
	The site of the real Rose Theater, which opened anew to paying  
customers Wednesday, could best be summed up as a dark, damp 
basement under an 11-story office building. 
</P>
<P>
	It's left to a state-of-the art light and sound show, narrated  
by actor Sir Ian McKellen, to fill in the gaps. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmaker Simon Hughes calls the Rose ``the holy of holies of  
English theater.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes was among the campaigners who linked arms 10 years ago  
with the elite of Britain's acting profession to stop bulldozers 
from clearing away the theater's foundations after they were 
discovered during construction work. 
</P>
<P>
	The office building went up, but only after the public uproar  
forced the government to cough up $1.6 million for the developers 
to suspend the structure on girders. That gave the Rose relics a 
space where they could be preserved and monitored. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, they must wait until the office building ends its  
commercial life and is pulled down -- expected in less than 10 years 
-- to allow full excavation and restoration of the site. 
</P>
<P>
	The open-air Rose was built in 1587 and demolished after 1606  
when the Shakespeare's Globe theater surpassed it in popularity. 
The height of its commercial success came in the 1590s, with a 
repertory of plays by Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe and Thomas 
Kyd. 
</P>
<P>
	A replica of the Globe, which puts on a slate of plays, was  
opened in 1997 at the initiative of the late American actor Sam 
Wanamaker. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, visitors to the Rose will merely be able to stand on a  
viewing platform, built where the galleries lay on the theater's 
east side. 
</P>
<P>
	In front of the platform is a 2-foot-deep pond, covering a  
concrete cap. Under the cap is a network of irrigation pipes and a 
foot of sand smothering the Rose foundations, kept moist and 
monitored with instruments. 
</P>
<P>
	Other remains indicate the position of walls and the stage.  
</P>
<P>
	``The remains, which had been buried in soggy Thames mud for 400  
years, would have turned to dust if they had been left exposed to 
the air,'' said Jon Greenfield, an architect who worked on the 
reconstructed Globe. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors to the site -- which charges $4.80 per adult and $3.20  
per child -- are shown a video of the site's history, with scenes 
from ``Shakespeare in Love'' projected onto glass screens suspended 
over the water. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the movie's stars, Geoffrey Rush, sent a message for the  
opening saying, ``I applaud this venture. If I was able to stand in 
front of you and it today, I'd be wearing rose-colored glasses.''

<HEADLINE> Shirley Jones Asked To Leave PTC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Howard Stern's badgering may have won him  
some unexpected results. 
</P>
<P>
	Shirley Jones and her husband, Marty Ingels, have parted ways  
with a conservative media watchdog group, citing an encounter with 
the shock jock. 
</P>
<P>
	The former star of ``The Partridge Family'' resigned as honorary  
co-chairman of the Parents Television Council this week, and Ingels 
was asked to resign as a member of the advisory board, Ingels said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still agree with the aims of the PTC,'' Ingels said, but  
they had reservations about the group's approach to reducing sex, 
violence and profanity on television. 
</P>
<P>
	Stern, whose late-night CBS-TV show has been a particular target  
of the PTC, confronted Ms. Jones and Ingels on his radio show last 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He kept asking ``Why would you want me thrown off the air?'''  
Ingels recalled. ``He said we were going along with McCarthy 
tactics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Ingels said, his wife re-examined the shows given a  
negative appraisal by the PTC and found she disagreed with the 
group in many cases.

<HEADLINE> Global Group To Study Hedge Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hedge funds for speculating in interest rate  
fluctuations will come under scrutiny from a new international 
group of financial regulators created to try to prevent future 
financial crises. 
</P>
<P>
	The Financial Stability Forum decided at its organizational  
meeting Wednesday to set up working groups to study hedge funds, 
offshore financial centers and short-term capital flows. 
</P>
<P>
	All have been labeled contributing causes of a global financial  
crisis that seriously disrupted the economies of a number of 
countries in Asia, Latin America and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The forum is composed of finance officials from the world's  
seven richest industrial countries and officials from a number of 
international agencies. Among them are the International Monetary 
Fund, the World Bank and the Bank for International Settlements, 
the Basel, Switzerland, organization that serves as a central bank 
for the world's central banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Hans Tietmeyer, president of Germany's central bank, told  
reporters after Wednesday's organizational meeting, that the new 
group would make recommend changes in financial regulations at 
their next session, expected to occur in September in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Creation of the new forum was the principal recommendation by  
the G-7 countries at a meeting of their finance ministers and 
central bank presidents in in Bonn, Germany, in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Tietmeyer said officials from the G-7 countries and the various  
international agencies agreed that a key aim of the forum will be 
to warn regulators of developing problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to focus on hedge funds reflects a widespread view  
that the near collapse last September of Long-Term Capital 
Management, a Connecticut hedge fund, had threatened to destabilize 
the entire global financial system. 
</P>
<P>
	Hedge funds are highly leveraged investment devices often used  
to speculate on relative difference in interest rates among 
different types of securities. The securities are often purchased 
with less than 5 percent of actual investor capital and banks 
putting up the balance. The securities then have been used to make 
bets more than 100 times their value on interest rate moves. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve orchestrated a private bailout of Long-Term  
Capital in order to avert the possibility its failure could bring 
down other hedge funds and major banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial forum decided to look at offshore investments  
because many hedge funds and other investment vehicles choose to 
set up operations outside the United States and other major 
countries to escape stringent financial regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	The working group said it would also examine what role the rapid  
withdrawal of short-term investments played in triggering the 
collapse of currencies and stock markets in some countries and 
whether controls on them would be workable. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Crockett, general manager of the Bank for International  
Settlements, was chosen as chairman of the new forum. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Tietmyer said that the participants in Wednesday's  
meeting decided to expand the group's membership to include other 
major developing countries but that no decisions on which ones to 
invite had been made. 
</P>
<P>
	Both men stressed that the forum did not intend to take over the  
role of the IMF in managing financial crises once they occur. 
</P>
<P>
	``This forum does not have a crisis management goal,'' Crockett  
said. ``Its purpose is to look ahead and try to correct problems.''

<HEADLINE> JP Morgan Profits' Soar 153 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- J.P. Morgan reported a 153 percent jump in  
first-quarter profits Wednesday, continuing the industry's torrid 
financial performance that reflects the unbounded strength of the 
financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	J.P. Morgan earned $600 million, or $3.01 a share, for the first  
three months of the year, outdistancing Wall Street's estimate of 
$1.73 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first quarter last year, the firm earned $237 million or  
$1.15 a share. That quarter, however, included a one-time 
restructuring charge, without which J.P. Morgan reported operating 
profits of $366 million, or $1.80 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were a blowout,'' said Carla D'Arista, an analyst with  
Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &AMP; Co. In addition to solid earnings, 
J.P. Morgan ``reported a $65 million year-over-year decline in 
expenses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	J.P. Morgan generated $2.49 billion in revenues, up 25 percent  
from nearly $2 billion in the first quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The surprisingly positive results follow yesterday's 18 percent  
first-quarter gain from Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., and a 33 percent jump 
at Paine Webber Group Inc. Both firms also beat analysts' 
expectations on record trading commissions and renewed strength in 
the global bond business. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the industry may have humbled Wall Street with their  
first-quarter performance, ``The question is how long can they 
sustain it?,'' D'Arista asked. ``These companies tend to reflect 
the tone of the market, and the market tends to self-correct'' from 
overvalued highs. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors nonetheless seemed focused on Wednesday's numbers, and  
sent J.P. Morgan's shares up $3.56 1/4 to $132.87 1/2 on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest boost to the bottom line came from bond trading.  
Corporate America returned to the fixed-income markets en force as 
interest rates fell to attractive levels. J.P. Morgan made $696 
million from its bond business, up 91 percent from the first 
quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks, however, were also very strong as companies jumped to  
issue shares on the coattails of the Dow Jones industrial average's 
flight into record territory. Investors also paid J.P. Morgan 
millions in commissions to buy and sell stocks. J.P. Morgan 
reported revenues of $288 million from its equities business, more 
than double the year-ago period.

<HEADLINE> Young Record Producer Basks in Pop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PLEASANTVILLE, N.J. (AP) -- Rodney Jerkins learned about music  
production the hard way -- sneaking into his older brother's 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was 10 years old. Freddie had a drum machine and a Yamaha  
keyboard. I knew those machines inside and out. I wasn't allowed to 
touch his equipment, but when he would leave the room, he didn't 
know it but I would just push buttons until I learned it,'' Jerkins 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	Then one day, 17-year-old Fred Jerkins III caught his little  
brother in the act. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he heard how it was sounding, he said it was pretty good.  
... After that, I told my father, 'I need some equipment,''' 
Jerkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven years later, Rodney Jerkins doesn't have to borrow  
equipment anymore. His skills as a songwriter and record producer 
have made him a millionaire and propelled him to the top of the 
charts. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 21, Jerkins has produced records for Whitney Houston, Mary  
J. Blige, Brandy and others. He was nominated for four Grammy 
Awards this year, and he wrote ``The Boy Is Mine,'' which won best 
rhythm and blues vocal for Brandy and Monica. 
</P>
<P>
	In the process, he has fashioned a reputation as a studio wizard  
with a great ear and a Midas touch for selling records. 
</P>
<P>
	He's now in the studio with Michael Jackson, who hasn't released  
a record since 1995's ``HIStory.'' The record will be released next 
year, Jerkins says. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jerkins has no illusions about success. He uses self-doubt  
to motivate himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I worry all the time that tomorrow I'm not going to be able to  
create a song, or that no one will know who Rodney Jerkins is in 
six months. But right now, I'm a magnet. I'm so creative. ... If I 
can maintain it `til I'm 30, I'll have a longer run,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Not long ago Jerkins was another teen-ager dreaming of pop  
stardom. 
</P>
<P>
	The son of piano-playing parents, he began taking lessons at 5  
and later sang in the choir at the Evangelical Fellowship Church in 
Pleasantville, just outside Atlantic City, where his father is 
pastor. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was 6 and 7, I was singing in church and tap-dancing at  
parties. Wherever there was a crowd, I was entertaining. I just 
felt I had to put on a show. It grew out of that. When I turned 13, 
I got more into production and not being in front of everybody,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Why producing instead of performing?  
</P>
<P>
	``It gives you the chance to express yourself more. I get to do  
what I want to do. I get to make songs I believe in, whereas 
artists have to do what people tell them to do,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At 15, he recorded a Christian rap album. At 17, he signed a  
worldwide publishing deal with EMI Music Publishing and remixed 
Vanessa Williams' 1995 hit, ``The Way That You Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then he produced the 1996 debut of singer Gina Thompson. A year  
later, he produced Blige's ``I Can Love You,'' which hit No. 2 on 
the rhythm and blues charts. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he's an expert at sound, Jerkins says today's music  
makers focus too much on technology and not enough on substance. He 
wants to replicate the influence of legendary producers and 
songwriters like Quincy Jones and Gamble &AMP; Huff. 
</P>
<P>
	In the studio, he uses string-heavy orchestration and what he  
calls ``pretty sounds'' to set the mood. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to bring it back to emotion. I want people to say,  
`I wanted to cry when I heard this song.' Everybody wants to hear a 
beat and a bass line, but I want to bring this back,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerkins recently signed a multimillion-dollar deal with Sony  
Music Entertainment Corp. and established his own company, 
Darkchild Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Rodney is one of the most gifted and sought-after young  
producers working today,'' said Sony Music Entertainment chairman 
Thomas Mottola. ``This is just the beginning for Rodney. His 
creative horizons are unlimited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jerkins has spread his wealth. When he was 18, he bought his  
parents a new house. He owns nine cars and bought cars for brother 
Fred and his two sisters. But he still lives with his parents when 
he's not working in New York or Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	He hasn't forgotten his roots, either. After returning from the  
Grammy Awards in Los Angeles earlier this month, he threw a bash 
for about 250 friends and family members at Trump Marina Hotel 
Casino in Atlantic City. Then it was back to California to work 
with the King of Pop. 
</P>
<P>
	``People say, `What are you going to do after Michael Jackson?'  
Everything's a challenge. If I can take a kid nobody knows about 
and make a record that sells 20 million records, then I've done 
something just as big as (working with) Michael Jackson,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every project is a challenge in some way. Michael Jackson, as  
big as he is, is still a challenge for me. I'm trying to deliver 
something new that nobody's heard in a while or that nobody's ever 
heard. I gotta give everything I got in me.''

<HEADLINE> Brazil Central Bank Lowers Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The Central Bank lowered its  
benchmark interest rate from 39.5 percent to 34 percent Wednesday 
amid optimism Brazil is emerging from its economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Falling inflation figures and a ``slow but consistent'' return  
of foreign investment prompted the cut, said Central Bank monetary 
policy director Luiz Fernando Figueiredo. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the third time the bank has lowered rates in three weeks.  
It had raised the benchmark to 45 percent in early March to ward of 
the threat of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Many said Brazil's currency devaluation in January would spark  
massive inflation. But last week the University of Sao Paulo 
research unit said it should be under 10 percent in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The economy is also seeing other positive signs, including the  
strengthening of the currency, the real, and bullish stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil has targeted a yearend interest rate of 29 percent to  
stimulate economic growth and generate jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	It made the target in conjunction with the International  
Monetary Fund, which has put together a $41.5 billion financial aid 
package for Brazil with other lenders.

<HEADLINE> 1980s Stamps: Video Games, Berlin Wall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- From the deadly seriousness of the Berlin Wall  
and Vietnam Veterans Memorial to the fun of figure skating and 
frivolity of video games, Americans have picked their favorite 
topics of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15 topics selected by voters across the country will appear  
on a set of stamps to be released in January, the Postal Service 
said. It's the fourth set of stamps to be chosen by public ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten sets of stamps will be issued, one for each decade of this  
century. 
</P>
<P>
	A post office committee picked subjects for the first five  
decades and the public has now voted on subjects for the 1950s, 
1960s, 1970s and 1980s. Subjects for the 1990s will be selected 
during nationwide balloting scheduled for May. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Celebrate the Century program continues to give the  
American public a voice in how the 20th century will be remembered 
in years to come,'' Postmaster General William Henderson said in a 
statement. ``Once this one-of-a-kind collection of stamps is 
completed next year, it will serve as a unique chronicle of 
American history, providing decade-by-decade glimpses of our past, 
as we head into the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1980s voting, video games collected 268,746 votes to  
become first choice. 
</P>
<P>
	The end of the Berlin Wall earned 265,147 votes and Washington's  
Vietnam Veterans Memorial was third with 258,515. Fourth was the 
movie ``E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial,'' with 239,189 votes, and 
Cabbage Patch Kids were fifth at 207,505. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the 1980s stamps will be personal computers, 205,527  
votes; compact discs, 199,925; figure skating, 198,841; ``The Cosby 
Show,'' 194,517; cable TV, 190,533; the National Football League's 
San Francisco 49ers, 188,845; American hostages freed in Iran, 
182,784; Space Shuttle program, 177,138; the Broadway show, 
``Cats,'' 169,357 and hip-hop culture, 158,509. 
</P>
<P>
	In September, the public voted on which subjects would best  
commemorate the 1970s. The yellow smiley face topped that voting, 
followed closely by ``Sesame Street,'' disco music and Earth Day. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1960s stamps were voted on last May. Winners included the  
first Moon walk, the integrated circuit, lasers and Martin Luther 
King's ``I Have a Dream'' speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Stamp subjects for the 1950s were determined by popular vote in  
February 1998. The public's top choices were drive-in movies, teen 
fashions, cars with tail fins and chrome and 3-D movies.

<HEADLINE> Skating Coach Accused of Misconduct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Two days after a former student and colleague accused Richard  
Callaghan of sexual misconduct and exploitation, complaints arrived 
by overnight mail at the U.S. Figure Skating Association and 
Professional Skaters Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The next step is likely to take much, much longer.  
</P>
<P>
	Craig Maurizi's grievances, filed Tuesday, were forwarded to a  
member of each organization's grievance committee. The PSA now has 
20 days and the USFSA 30 days to evaluate the complaints and decide 
what to do with them. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need an incredible amount of legal documentation ... and  
that's why our rules are very clear there are 30 days of review to 
make sure our direction is the proper one,'' said USFSA president 
Jim Disbrow, who hasn't yet seen the complaint. ``There will be an 
answer, a definite answer, to where we will be moving at that 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a story first published Sunday in The New York Times, Maurizi  
said Callaghan, who coached Tara Lipinski to the gold medal at the 
Nagano Olympics last year, made improper advances to him when he 
was 15. Maurizi, now 36, said Callaghan abused his authority three 
years later to initiate a full sexual relationship, which continued 
for four years. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times story also contained allegations from two other former  
students, who claim Callaghan made inappropriate remarks or 
gestures to them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've decided I'm not going to be granting any further  
interviews for the indefinite future,'' Maurizi said. ``This story 
is getting a little bit out of hand for me, and I haven't been 
spending a whole heck of a lot of time with my family in the last 
few days. I want to slow things down for myself and my family, and 
get a little normalcy back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Callaghan, who also coached Todd Eldredge to five national  
titles and a world championship, has denied all of the allegations. 
He was not notified the complaints were filed, nor does he expect 
to be before a decision is made, said Dean Groulx, his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are confident that when the chair of the grievance  
committee reviews the allegations, it will find the grievance lacks 
merit and will take the appropriate action,'' Groulx said. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaints are now in the hands of a grievance committee  
chairperson, who will decide whether any rule was violated and 
evaluate the timeliness of the complaint. If the chair decides 
there is merit, a panel will be formed to investigate and make a 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	In the USFSA, the panel would consist of three to nine people  
who represent the organization, including athletes, coaches and 
judges, USFSA spokesman Bob Dunlop said. In the PSA, it's a 
three-person panel, PSA president Jerry Lane said. 
</P>
<P>
	The grievance panel would also be responsible for deciding what,  
if any, punishment is warranted. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's way too early to even jump to any conclusions,'' Dunlop  
said. ``It just came in a couple of hours ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first time anyone -- including Maurizi -- has filed a  
formal complaint against Callaghan. Maurizi continued working with 
him after their alleged relationship ended, coaching with him in 
San Diego and Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Maurizi was Callaghan's assistant at the Detroit Skating Club  
until last year, when they split after Lipinski turned pro, left 
Callaghan and decided to train with Maurizi. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, it's kind of put a cloud over the club at this  
point,'' said Jo Anne Berry, a board member at the Detroit Skating 
Club. ``You can kind of walk through the lobby and you can feel the 
tenseness, but we are trying to deal with it the best way we can.''

<HEADLINE> Makeover Coming to Home of Whopper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The home of the Whopper is getting some high-tech  
renovations designed to draw in more hungry kids and their parents. 
</P>
<P>
	A prototype restaurant opening this week in Reno, Nev., has a  
cobalt blue decor, a video screen for ordering at the 
drive-through, computer-controlled broilers and interactive games. 
If the new image proves popular, the No. 2 burger chain hopes it 
will help it topple industry leader McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the most sweeping change in our history,'' Dennis  
Malamatinas, the Burger King Corp. chief executive, said Wednesday. 
``It's taking place at a time when the chain is doing extremely 
well. What we're trying to do is further accelerate our rate of 
growth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest test will come in and around Orlando, Fla., where 43  
company-owned restaurants of Burger King's more than 10,200 stores 
worldwide are next to be redesigned. The Orlando restaurants should 
only take a few months to complete. The worldwide project is 
expected to take up to three years. 
</P>
<P>
	The main goal is to remove the hassle from buying fast food,  
said spokesman Robert Doughty. 
</P>
<P>
	Food will not be cooked until the customer orders it,  
eliminating the need for heating bins. Customers who complained 
about hard-to-read display menus will see menus that reflect only 
the food currently being served. 
</P>
<P>
	The doors of the prototype restaurant are automatic, making it  
easier for people carrying bags of food or with young children in 
tow. 
</P>
<P>
	Takeout food will be placed in transparent bags, lessening the  
opportunity of a customer leaving with a wrong order. If a mistake 
is made at the drive-through window, the customer can correct the 
order at a speaker just past the delivery window. 
</P>
<P>
	The new broilers will allow Burger King to expand its menu with  
products like the tentatively named Great American, a half-pound 
burger currently being tested. As of yet, however, the menu will 
remain the same. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the new flexible broiler allows a variety of  
products with different cooking times to be flame-broiled 
simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to added convenience, company officials hope the  
makeover helps attract new customers or lure back those who left 
for (did somebody say ...) McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
	The outside design uses curves and angles and looks like an  
old-fashioned drive-in. Cobalt blue, called Burger King Blue, 
replaces the old tan-and-brick colors. 
</P>
<P>
	The dining room provides lots of windows and features high  
ceilings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to create a look that harkened back to the heritage  
of Burger King,'' Doughty said. 
</P>
<P>
	To update the playground, Burger King plans to add a Virtual Fun  
Center of interactive computer games. The machines, which have 
video-conferencing capability, eventually will allow a person at 
one restaurant to communicate with someone at a similarly equipped 
Burger King on the other side of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's Corp. in Oak Brook, Ill., has not yet reviewed Burger  
King's new concept and could not comment, said spokeswoman Lisa 
Howard. 
</P>
<P>
	Burger King, a unit of Britain's Diageo PLC, has grown since  
1993. The company's share of the fast food hamburger market has 
jumped from 17.2 percent in 1993 to 21.9 percent in 1998, 
Malamatinas said. He expects the changes to launch the chain to No. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonald's market share is nearly 43 percent, according to  
Technomic Inc., a restaurant consulting firm in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Malamatinas predicts the changes could boost average franchise  
sales to $1.6 million annually from $1.15 million, which would 
surpass the $1.5 million average of a McDonald's Corp. restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	``By far, we would be No. 1,'' he said. ``That is my objective  
over the next five years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even with Burger King's new logo -- larger tilted letters set  
within burger buns with a blue crescent surrounding the halves -- 
some analysts say the image of McDonald's golden arches is too 
well-known to immediately surpass. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have viewed Burger King as having the signature  
sandwich in the industry. They've done a great job establishing the 
Whopper,'' said Ron Steger, a partner at KPMG, an accounting, tax 
and consulting firm in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``But people look at the golden arches as a classic timeless  
symbol.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Paul, president of Technomic, said, ``It's going to take  
more than one store to prove a concept. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a constant burger battle going on. Ultimately the loyalty  
to the product may have more to do with where customers go.''

<HEADLINE> Implant Finding Called Tainted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Breast implant recipients have asked a  
judge to invalidate an influential report that found no links 
between silicone implants and illnesses, claiming there is a 
conflict of interest involving one of the authors. 
</P>
<P>
	The request filed Tuesday in federal court contends that Dr.  
Peter Tugwell, director of medicine at the University of Ottawa, 
received money from implant manufacturer Bristol-Myers Squibb while 
serving on the panel that drew up the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for women with implants asked U.S. District Judge Sam  
Pointer Jr. to invalidate the report released last December and 
disband the four-person panel he appointed to evaluate silicone 
implants and any potential dangers. Pointer oversees 8,600 implant 
cases nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel's findings, used in courts nationwide, were a major  
blow to women seeking damages for illnesses they claimed were 
caused by defective silicone implants. According to the women's 
attorneys, thousands already have settled or withdrawn their 
lawsuits based on the panel's conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a terrible breakdown of trust. I don't know where the  
women are going to go for answers now,'' said Sybil Niden Goldrich, 
a former implant recipient who founded an organization to provide 
information to women with implants. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel's attorney, John Kobayashi, declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Bristol-Myers' director of public policy, Jane Kramer, said the  
contacts between Tugwell and the company were not significant 
enough to have influenced the panel's findings. She said Tugwell 
made appropriate disclosures of his contacts with the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Robert Gordon of New York, who represents women with  
implants, said Tugwell never disclosed his receipt of a $750 
honorarium from Bristol-Myers for participating in a company 
seminar in November 1998. He also failed to reveal that he signed a 
letter asking the company for up to $10,000 in August 1997 to fund 
a professional meeting he co-chaired, Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of women blame implants for such ailments as lupus,  
rheumatoid arthritis, body aches, fatigue, memory loss and 
hardening of the breasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Manufacturers deny their products are dangerous and point to  
studies that found no links between implants and health problems.

<HEADLINE> Coolio Accused of Carrying Handgun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORRANCE, Calif. (AP) -- Grammy Award-winning rapper Coolio,  
accused of carrying a concealed handgun in his vehicle, has changed 
his legal tune again. 
</P>
<P>
	Coolio, whose real name is Artis Leon Ivey Jr., originally  
pleaded innocent to the charge and then changed it to no-contest. 
On Tuesday, the rapper's lawyer withdrew the no-contest plea. 
</P>
<P>
	No explanation was given. A preliminary hearing was set for  
April 28 to determine if there is enough evidence for the rapper to 
stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Coolio was in his military-style Hummer when a sheriff's deputy  
stopped him in September for allegedly driving on the wrong side of 
a street in suburban Lawndale. 
</P>
<P>
	The rapper told the deputy that he had a gun in a door pouch,  
prosecutors said. The deputy allegedly seized a 9mm semiautomatic 
pistol. 
</P>
<P>
	Coolio was convicted of a similar offense in 1994. He won a  
Grammy for best rap solo in 1996 for ``Gangsta's Paradise.''

<HEADLINE> House Democrats Raise Record $6.8M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democrats reported raising a record $6.8  
million in the first quarter of the year and trumpeted it Wednesday 
as fresh evidence of a strong drive to recapture control of the 
House of Representatives in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Patrick Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the campaign  
committee, said the total was more than Democrats raised in the 
first six months of 1997, in the wake of the 1996 elections. The 
total for the first three months then was $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``This obviously is the result of a very favorable political  
environment where Republicans were reeling from their impeachment 
debacle and the fact that they came off as out of touch and 
extremist,'' Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said they had used some of their money to begin paying  
off $2.3 million in bank loans they arranged just before the 1998 
elections. They now owe $1.1 million, according to spokesman Erik 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans aren't scheduled to disclose their fund-raising  
figures until after June 30. But Scott Hatch, executive director of 
the GOP campaign committee, said the group raised $4.2 million at 
one fund-raising dinner in Washington alone last month, and spoke 
dismissively of the Democratic claims. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not surprising since the president is committed to  
paying off his impeachment debt to the Gephardt establishment,'' 
Hatch said in a reference to Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, the 
House Democratic leader. ``After all, this is the same party that 
sold the Lincoln bedroom and is now selling the Kennedy compound,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Politicking is coming to the desktop.  
</P>
<P>
	Steve Forbes, seeking the GOP presidential nomination, has  
arranged to air a couple of New Hampshire campaign speeches over 
his campaign's Internet site as they occur, an example of the 
expanding role of cyberspace in political campaigns. Forbes was 
scheduled to appear Wednesday evening in Manchester, N.H., and on 
Thursday in Portsmouth, N.H., at 11:30 a.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	An announcement from his campaign said the Website --  
Forbes2000.com. -- would ``relay the remarks in realtime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Juleanna Glover Weiss, a spokeswoman for Forbes, said the  
appearances mark the first such use of the Internet by a candidate. 
``Voters can anticipate seeing a significant number of simulcasts'' 
from Forbes in the future, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt is about to become an author.  
</P>
<P>
	``An Even Better Place,'' a volume originally planned to  
coincide with a planned run for the White House, is due to be 
published next month by Public Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The book is touted as providing a vision for the next century.  
The message is that ``the new economy isn't fundamentally improving 
the quality of our lives, that we are neglecting our children and 
that we need to rethink out relationship with our own government,'' 
according to Public Affairs' publication catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
	It was updated after President Clinton's impeachment by the  
House. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt will embark on a book-signing tour to several cities  
beginning the first weekend in May. The Missouri Democrat had been 
poised to run for the White House, but switched plans after 
Democrats gained seats in the November elections. Now he's decided 
to stay in the House and try to lead his party into the majority.

<HEADLINE> iMac Sales Spur Apple Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Apple Computer Inc. more than doubled  
its quarterly profit and beat Wall Street expectations in a strong 
recovery fueled by demand for the company's new iMac personal 
computer. It was the company's sixth straight quarterly profit. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple Computer, which had suffered nearly two years of red ink,  
reported late Wednesday it earned $135 million, or 84 cents a share 
in its fiscal second quarter, which ended March 27. That was up 
from a profit of $55 million, or 38 cents a share, in the same 
quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding one-time gains, Apple would have earned 60 cents a  
share, beating the 57 cents a share predicted by analysts surveyed 
by First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of the hugely popular iMac computers for home users, as  
well as the speedy G3 business computers, gave Apple $1.53 billion 
in revenues in the January-March quarter, typically a slow one for 
computer companies. That was up 9 percent from the same period in 
1998 when revenues reached $1.41 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street investors bid up the company's stock in anticipation  
of the results, released after the close of financial markets. The 
stock price rose 3 percent, or 91 cents a share to $35.53 on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market. But in after-hours activity, traders bid 
shares back down to $33.75. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple's co-founder and interim CEO Steve Jobs said Wednesday  
that he is ``delighted that Apple grew faster than the industry in 
its sixth consecutive profitable quarter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the positive report marks the end of Apple's  
recovery after losing nearly $2 billion between 1995 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apple is clearly back on track,'' said analyst Tim Bajarin,  
president of Creative Strategies in Campbell, Calif. ``I don't see 
any reason they won't be able to keep this momentum going, at least 
through the end of this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company pioneered the commercial personal computer in the  
1970s, and made it easy to use in the 1980s with the Macintosh. But 
it fell on hard times in the 1990s as rival machines using 
Microsoft Corp. software largely erased the Mac's ease-of-use 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Shrinking sales and market share led to management shakeups. The  
company began to regain market share after Jobs replaced ousted 
chief executive Gil Amelio in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Apple introduced the colorful and easy-to-use iMac  
desktop personal computer for home users, and the speedy G3 
Macintosh computers aimed at businesses. Apple is also building 
computers to order over the Internet, and has stopping making its 
Newton hand-held devices. Later this year, Apple is planning to 
release a new laptop. 
</P>
<P>
	While all the new products have been successful, it's the iMac  
that took the market by surprise, rapidly becoming a favorite with 
individual computer buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The iMac was the top-selling personal computer in retail stores  
during the fourth quarter of 1998, and sales of the iMac pushed 
Apple past IBM into third place in retail sales market share in 
February, according to the research firm PC Data.

<HEADLINE> Canseco Hits 400th Home Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Jose Canseco became the 28th player in major  
league history to reach the 400 home run plateau Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tampa Bay Devil Rays designated hitter also became the first  
player born outside the United States to accomplish the feat when 
he lined a Kelvim Escobar pitch 368 feet over the left-field wall 
in the third inning. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans gave him a loud ovation, but he seemed emotionless as  
he rounded the bases. After hitting his 399th, Canseco said he was 
more focused on 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Cuba, Canseco is in his 15th major league season.  
</P>
<P>
	The last two major leaguers to reach 400 were Mark McGwire,  
Canseco's former teammate with the Oakland Athletics, and Barry 
Bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Devil Rays project Canseco, who has averaged 121 games per  
season and a home run every 4 games, to reach 500 in June of 2002 
at the age of 37. 
</P>
<P>
	The home run was Canseco's third of the season and gave the  
Devil Rays a 4-1 lead.

	NATO, Serbs Dispute Civilian Dead  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslavia accused NATO jets of  
blasting apart a convoy of refugees under Serb police escort today. 
The alliance said its pilots fired on military vehicles only, and 
the Pentagon suggested that Serbs may have been responsible for the 
carnage. The civilian bloodshed came as NATO warplanes zeroed in on 
Serb targets throughout Kosovo in an effort to force Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic to accept a peace deal for the 
province. Earlier today, Germany called for a 24-hour halt in 
bombings to allow Serb and Yugoslav forces to withdraw from the 
province. NATO said it would study the German plan, but it did not 
endorse it, and there was no sign that Yugoslavia was interested.

battle. The warning came as Afghanistan's opposition alliance 
claimed in a letter to Annan that the Taliban militia, which

<HEADLINE> Intel Profits Rise 57 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Intel Corp. shares fell sharply this morning  
after the computer chip maker reported that first-quarter sales 
were slightly below forecasts and warned that future revenues could 
drop. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors focused on the sales figures instead of Intel's  
better-than-expected profit, which rose 57 percent in the quarter 
amid cost-cutting. The financial results, announced late Tuesday, 
had reassured some analysts that problems in the personal computer 
business may be mostly confined to its biggest chip customer, 
Compaq Computer Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	But Intel, whose chips supply the brainpower for 90 percent of  
the world's personal computers, expects second-quarter revenue to 
stay the same or fall slightly from its first-quarter revenue of 
$7.1 billion, citing ``seasonal factors'' in the microprocessor 
business. Some analysts had expected a slight increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel's stock price was down 6 percent in early trading,  
dropping $3.75 a share at $56.75. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, by beating profit expectations, Intel -- a bellwether for  
the rest of the PC industry -- apparently suggested Compaq's woes 
were confined to its own business. 
</P>
<P>
	The results ``suggest to me the rest of the industry is fine,''  
said David Wu, an analyst with ABN Amro in San Francisco. ``The 
news here really is there is no news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said it earned $2.0  
billion, or 57 cents a share, in the three months ended March 27. 
That was up from a profit of $1.27 billion, or 36 cents a share, in 
the year-ago quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel's per-share profit beat the expectations of analysts  
surveyed by First Call, who had been projecting 55 cents a share 
after accounting for a 2-for-1 stock split this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel also was helped by higher interest income and a lower tax  
rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 18 percent to $7.1 billion from $6.0 billion in the  
year-ago quarter, a slightly less-than-expected increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel said first-quarter revenues were down 7 percent from the  
final quarter of 1998 due to a seasonal slowdown in PC sales. But 
year over year, the company was helped by strong demand for its 
range of new microprocessors, which supply the primary brainpower 
for computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel introduced its latest Pentium chips for personal computers  
and more powerful business machines this quarter. It also launched 
a faster Celeron chip for the fast-growing category of PCs costing 
less than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel officials said the Celeron chips are starting to help the  
company take back some business from rival makers of chips for 
inexpensive PCs, such as Advanced Micro Devices. Reports show that 
consumers bought more computers at retail stores in the first two 
months of the year from AMD than Intel -- knocking the chip giant 
from the No. 1 spot for the first time.

<HEADLINE> Study: Pacific Traps Carbon Dioxide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	El Nino prevents the Pacific Ocean from releasing as much carbon  
dioxide into the atmosphere as usual, a phenomenon that may help 
slow global warming, scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  
Administration found that from 1991 to 1994 -- years when El Nino 
warmed the Pacific -- the ocean released 30 percent to 80 percent 
less carbon dioxide, a gas that is believed to trap heat in the 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	The finding was published in Thursday's issue of the journal  
Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists commonly estimate how much carbon dioxide should be  
in the atmosphere by calculating how much fossil fuel is burned. 
But some 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide go unaccounted for each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the NOAA research, reduced carbon dioxide releases  
in the Pacific Ocean during El Nino could account for about 16 
percent to 36 percent of this ``missing'' CO2. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, we are very, very interested in where the CO2,  
which we are releasing every year during fossil fuel burning, ends 
up,'' said Rik Wanninkhof, an NOAA oceanographer. 
</P>
<P>
	Understanding the year-to-year changes in CO2 levels is key to  
explaining how the oceans, the land and the atmosphere regulate 
Earth's climate. 
</P>
<P>
	Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have been rising for  
decades, a phenomenon blamed on increased burning of fossil fuels 
and deforestation. Some scientists say this has contributed to this 
century's global warming trend. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, episodes of El Nino -- the naturally occurring,  
cyclical warming of the Pacific Ocean -- were shown to spur more 
plant growth, which in turn sucks carbon dioxide out of the 
atmosphere. The NOAA research shows yet another way El Nino helps 
reduce CO2 levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Usually, the equatorial waters of the Pacific are the source of  
three-quarters of the carbon dioxide released by the world's 
tropical oceans. The northern Pacific sucks up all of that carbon 
and more each year, making it one of the biggest ``carbon sinks,'' 
or areas that absorb carbon dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
	El Nino intensifies that process: The trade winds along the  
equator die down, so the upwelling of cold, carbon-rich waters 
decreases and less CO2 is sent into the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the NOAA study, the equatorial Pacific released 900  
million tons of carbon in 1996, a normal year. The same seas 
released 300 million tons in 1992, 600 million tons in 1993 and 700 
million tons in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Doney, an oceanographer with the National Center for  
Atmospheric Research, said what is different about this study is 
the wealth of data the researchers were able to gather. The 
scientists put their equipment on NOAA ships servicing 80 weather 
stations all over the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got good snapshots for six or seven different areas  
through a pretty major period,'' he said. ``This study is very 
important in terms of diagnosing what happened to the carbon 
dioxide.''

<HEADLINE> Team To Search for Mercury Capsule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- An underwater salvage expert who has  
spent 14 years trying to find Gus Grissom's sunken Mercury capsule 
heads out to sea this weekend in his most extensive search for the 
spacecraft yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Curt Newport is teaming up with the Discovery Channel for the  
two-week hunt in 3-mile-deep water about 300 miles offshore. 
</P>
<P>
	The crew plans to set sail Sunday with the latest in side-scan  
sonar in hopes of finding Liberty Bell 7, lost at sea 38 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a pretty good idea where to look for it,'' Newport  
said Wednesday. ``To say I'm cautiously optimistic is probably the 
right term.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty Bell 7 sank to the bottom of the Atlantic after  
splashing down with the Mercury astronaut on July 21, 1961. The 
explosive bolts that blow open the hatch detonated prematurely. To 
this day, there is debate over whether the hatch malfunctioned or 
Grissom panicked and blew it open. 
</P>
<P>
	The capsule is the only U.S. manned spacecraft lost after a  
successful mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport tried to find the capsule in 1992 and again in 1993  
after years of poring over NASA charts and photographs and 
interviewing those who were there when Liberty Bell 7 went down. 
Those two attempts were tacked on to other missions, however, and 
were conducted hastily. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, this is a full-fledged, dedicated mission to go out and  
locate and recover this thing,'' Newport said. ``We have a lot more 
time, we have a better sonar, we can examine a much larger area of 
the ocean at one time. Consequently, our chances are better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery Channel is paying for the expedition as well as  
filming it for a documentary to be broadcast this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``The story of the Liberty Bell 7 is a fascinating one that, to  
my knowledge, really hasn't been told except for a segment in `The 
Right Stuff,''' said Karen Baratz, a Discovery Channel spokeswoman. 
She declined to give the cost of the expedition, except to say it 
was in the seven figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The capsule, made of aluminum, titanium, magnesium and other  
metals, sank after a 15-minute suborbital flight that was America's 
second manned space shot. Helicopter rescuers could not lift the 
water-filled capsule, and the line was cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Grissom, who nearly drowned, insisted until his death in a 1967  
Apollo launch pad fire that he did nothing to cause the hatch to 
blow. NASA exonerated Grissom after the Mercury accident and he 
went on to fly on Gemini 3, although some accounts, including Tom 
Wolfe's 1979 book ``The Right Stuff,'' suggested Grissom panicked. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the greatest mysteries in the history of American  
spaceflight is locked onto that hatch door and that is, `Did Gus 
blow the hatch or was it a mechanical malfunction?''' said Max Ary, 
president of the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center, which will 
restore the capsule if it's found. ``It could be answered if we're 
able to recover the hatch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If finding the 7-foot capsule is like looking for a pencil in a  
haystack, as Ary put it, finding the 3-foot hatch is like looking 
for the proverbial needle. It's believed to be anywhere from 
several hundred feet to a quarter-mile from the capsule. 
</P>
<P>
	Two cameras and a tape recorder that sank with the capsule could  
shed light on what happened, but it's doubtful the film and tape 
could be salvaged after so long underwater. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport, 47, a former space station worker who left Oceaneering  
International in January to found his own company, Liberty Bell 7 
Inc., said: ``Outside of Challenger, this is the only one we 
haven't gotten back. It's the right thing to do. It's patriotic. It 
was one of ours.''

<HEADLINE> AMD's First-Quarter Loss Doubles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Advanced Micro Devices Inc.'s first-quarter loss  
more than doubled as the computer chip maker struggled with 
previously disclosed production problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of $128.4 million was smaller than expected, however,  
as AMD joined Intel Corp. and Motorola Corp. as the third 
semiconductor producer in two days to beat Wall Street forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	On a per-share basis, AMD's loss for the three months ended  
March 28 amounted to 88 cents, less than the 92 cents predicted by 
industry analysts surveyed by First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first quarter of 1998, AMD lost $62.7 million, or 44  
cents per share. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the just-ended quarter totaled $631.6 million, an  
increase of 17 percent from year-ago levels, but down 20 percent 
from the final three months of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In early March, AMD warned that it would suffer a significant  
first-quarter loss because production problems with its most 
popular microprocessor, the AMD-K6, would crimp sales. 
</P>

	``The best thing that can be said about the first quarter is  
that it's over,'' said W.J. Sanders III, chairman and chief 
executive officer of AMD, asserting that production yields -- the 
percentage of chips without flaws -- improved in March. 
</P>
<P>
	AMD's stock slipped 25 cents per share to $14.75 in advance of  
the report, which was released after the close of Wednesday's 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, rival chipmakers Intel and Motorola both topped  
analyst expectations for their quarterly earnings reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Those results eased some jitters following Compaq Computer  
Corp.'s last-minute warning on Friday that its first-quarter profit 
would amount to just half of what most Wall Street analysts were 
forecasting. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq, the biggest manufacturer of personal computers, is  
Intel's biggest customer. 
</P>
<P>
	Notably, Intel's shares sank nearly 6 percent in Wednesday's  
Nasdaq trading, falling $3.50 to $57, amid disappointment over the 
latest sales figures and the company's discouraging outlook for the 
current quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola's shares rose 18 3/4 cents to $83.12 1/2 in NYSE trading on  
Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Blaze Doubles in Size </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FARGO, Ga. (AP) -- A Georgia wildfire more than doubled in size  
on Wednesday while crews in other parts of the Southeast gained the 
upper hand on blazes that had scorched the region for days. 
</P>
<P>
	The swamp blaze in Georgia's Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge  
grew from 700 acres on Tuesday to an estimated 1,700 acres, refuge 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Southeast winds pushed the flames to the north and northwest,  
into the 400,000-acre refuge's interior and away from populated 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
	By Tuesday, Georgia had 73 wildfires that damaged nearly 600  
acres, down from 131 fires covering 5,400 acres Monday, the Georgia 
Forestry Commission reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tennessee, brush fires that burned more than 4,000 acres in  
the state since the weekend were still being watched. Rain was 
expected to help put out the blazes. 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina Firefighters began leaving scorched areas in the  
western part of the state while other crews mopped up more than a 
dozen wildfires that burned 1,700 acres.

<HEADLINE> US: $1.2B Needed for Indian Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Interior Department soon will propose a  
$1.2 billion plan to replace or repair 170 federal Indian schools, 
agency officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, which was requested by Congress, will recommend  
replacing 60 of the schools in the worst condition, Bureau of 
Indian Affairs officials told a Senate appropriations subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our schools no longer represent, in many cases, an effective  
learning environment,'' said Kevin Gover, assistant secretary for 
Indian affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The BIA operates 187 schools in 23 states serving 50,000  
students on the nation's poorest reservations. The backlog to 
repair schools now tops $800 millions, the BIA estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's five-year plan would require nearly $250  
million annually on school buildings, four times what the BIA is 
spending this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration wants to spend $108 million in 2000.  
But $30 million of that total would go toward underwriting tribal 
bond issues, a controversial idea among Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	The budget request would replace as many as six schools if  
Congress approved the bonding authority. 
</P>
<P>
	It is uncertain whether the building program will receive White  
House or congressional support. The issue has limited political 
appeal because the BIA's schools are concentrated in a handful of 
states: Arizona, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota and 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Gover himself expressed frustration with the lack of attention  
paid to the schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would love to have a conversation with the president about  
this, because I know he wouldn't stand for it,'' Gover said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said the administration was more  
concerned about aiding inner-city public schools, which are the 
responsibility of local governments, than making sure federal 
facilities are adequate. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., said Congress deserves criticism for  
putting defense programs ahead of the Indian school system.

<HEADLINE> Soybean, Grain Futures Close Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices settled higher  
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the day, soybean and wheat for May delivery shot higher  
but settled at 4 cents and 2 3/4 cents a bushel, respectively. 
Analysts attributed the jump to continued reports of cold weather 
in Argentina and the Plains states. 
</P>
<P>
	There also are predictions of more-than-average rainfall in the  
Plains states, making planting difficult. The foul weather could 
damage winter wheat crops -- particularly hard red wheat -- though 
crops in Texas and Oklahoma are considered mature enough to avoid 
permanent damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures also were up, though not as much, in what some said  
was a residual effect of the soybean and wheat rally, as well as 
Tuesday's reports of steady export business from the U.S. 
Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Wednesday, wheat for May delivery was up 2 3/4 cents to  
$2.58 3/4 a bushel; May corn rose 1 1/2 cents to $2.17 1/2 a bushel; May 
oats rose 2 cents to $1.16 3/4 a bushel; and May soybeans were up 4 
cents to $4.89 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Livestock futures were lower and pork belly futures were mixed  
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle fell .72 cent to 63.60 cents a pound; May  
feeder cattle fell 1.02 cents to 71.90 cents a pound; June lean 
hogs fell 1.43 cents to 53.92 cents a pound; and May pork bellies 
fell .55 cent to 51.97 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Black Artists Have Works Restored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- One painting was covered with soot, the artist's  
name invisible. Restored, the image of a black butler working as a 
rare free man before the emancipation of slaves now shines from the 
canvas. 
</P>
<P>
	A mural of blacks who changed history had been rolled up for  
decades, creased and cracked. The huge 1940 canvas by Charles 
White, ``Progress of the American Negro,'' now has a new life at 
the entrance to The Studio Museum in Harlem. 
</P>
<P>
	The paintings are part of ``To Conserve a Legacy,'' a 200-work  
exhibit from six historically black American colleges -- art 
repositories for generations of black Americans who had been 
excluded from the cultural mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
	The show is part of a $1.3 million project that resulted in the  
restoration and documentation of 1,400 works belonging to the half 
dozen schools. As a result, students learned conservation 
techniques to which few had been exposed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wondered why there were so few minorities in conservation,''  
said Jock Reynolds, director of the Yale University Art Gallery, 
co-curator of the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit's other main curator, Richard Powell, said the art  
reflects the modern American experience, ``but it's not the story 
of American art you will get from a museum like the Whitney,'' the 
New York City museum specializing in American works. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are colleges founded after emancipation, and their  
concept was that of freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The show documents the price of that freedom.  
</P>
<P>
	A section titled ``American Expressionism'' shows the naked body  
of a black man who was lynched, his head twisted to one side, a 
noose around the broken neck. The 1936 wooden sculpture by Nat 
Werner hasn't been exhibited very much because the image is so 
graphic. 
</P>
<P>
	Another in-your-face painting, John Biggers' ``Old Coffee  
Drinker'' from 1945, depicts a man in tattered clothes with his 
toes sticking out of huge ragged shoes. He clutches his cup with 
world-weary stoicism. 
</P>
<P>
	Biggers' ``wasn't interested in things pretty, but in the guts  
and grime,'' Powell said of the canvas that had been rolled up for 
years in the artist's Texas garage. 
</P>
<P>
	Other artists fascinated with the education of a newly freed  
people -- in everything from agriculture to traditional academics -- 
are exhibited in a section called ``Training the Head, the Hand, 
and the Heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A series of photographs by Frances Benjamin Johnston, believed  
to be the first female press photographer, shows students at 
Hampton College, where blacks and Native Americans were both trying 
to enter American society. 
</P>
<P>
	Another pioneer educational institution for blacks was Tuskegee  
University in Alabama, established in 1881 by Booker T. Washington. 
The fine art collection he contributed to the school is part of the 
exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the artists tapped into European traditions, while  
telling a quintessentially American story. ``Young African-American 
artists began looking at their world using European techniques,'' 
Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
	He pointed to a marble sculpture in neoclassical style,  
``Forever Free,'' whose heady liberationist spirit is very American 
-- a woman kneeling by a standing man, his broken shackles raised 
above his head. The sculptor was Edmonia Lewis, who was half black 
and half Indian. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are canonical pieces in African-American history,''  
Powell says of the art that is part of a section titled ``Forever 
Free: Emancipation Visualized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the exhibition highlights black artists like Jacob  
Lawrence, Romare Bearden, Horace Pippin and Henry Tanner, but the 
schools' holdings also include work by artists of other ethnic 
backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
	From Fisk University come paintings donated by Georgia O'Keeffe,  
who also gave to Fisk some photographs taken by her husband, Alfred 
Stieglitz. 
</P>
<P>
	And the avant-garde work of the late Josef Albers is displayed  
along with a geometric painting by William T. Williams, a prolific 
contemporary artist still working in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibition that started at the Williamstown Art Conservation  
Center in Massachusetts was organized by the Addison Gallery of 
American Art in Andover, Mass., and The Studio Museum, which is 
celebrating its 30th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the pain of history, the exhibit offers much visual  
pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1934 night street scene by Archibald Motley, ``Black Belt,''  
is a palate of vivid colors depicting a festive crowd, and Motley's 
``The Liar'' features a group of carefree men smoke, drink and play 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Fisk, Hampton and Tuskegee, the art comes from  
Howard University, Clark Atlanta University and North Carolina 
Central University. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the project, funded by sponsors including AT&AMP;T  
and the Ford Motor Company, students helped revive works such as 
Elizabeth Catlett's ``Negro Woman,'' whose wooden face had fallen 
off. The subject's high cheekbones are now again illuminated by 
eyes made of onyx. 
</P>
<P>
	And the students breathed new life into the 1858 portrait of the  
Baltimore butler by Thomas Waterman Wood from the Howard 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was covered in soot, the frame was green. And we only saw  
the artist's signature after cleaning,'' said Powell, chairman of 
the art history department at Duke University. 
</P>
<P>
	The show remains at the Studio Museum until July 11, then  
travels to five of the universities as well as the Corcoran Gallery 
of Art in Washington, D.C., and the Art Institute of Chicago.

<HEADLINE> DuPont Announces Polyester Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- DuPont Co. is creating a joint venture  
with companies from Mexico and Japan to make and sell polyester 
filament yarn in the Americas, generating estimated annual revenues 
of $600 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the joint venture with Alpek S.A. de C.V., based in  
Monterrey, Mexico, and Teijin Limited, based in Tokyo, were not 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont said it would own 50 percent of the joint venture, which  
is expected to begin operations by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement would include all of the polymer, filament and  
textured yarn facilities in Monterrey, Mexico, of an Alpek and 
Teijin joint venture. DuPont's Dacron polyester textile filament 
facilities at its Cape Fear and Kinston production sites in North 
Carolina would also be included. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont officials said the joint venture will allow the companies  
to combine their marketing, manufacturing and product development 
strengths. 
</P>
<P>
	Teijin is an international company making fibers, chemicals,  
plastics, pharmaceuticals and medical products and recently 
announced a global joint venture with DuPont to make and sell 
polyester films. 
</P>
<P>
	Alpek is a subsidiary of Alfa, one of the largest private  
petrochemical concerns in Latin America, with sales in excess of 
$1.3 billion, and is a leader in producing raw materials for 
polyester and nylon fibers. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, DuPont-Akra Polyester, LLC, a newly formed company  
based in Charlotte, N.C., began producing polyester staple fiber 
for markets primarily in the Americas as part of a separate joint 
venture between DuPont and Alpek.

	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Sharon Stone and her husband are fighting a  
neighbor's construction plans, which they say will block their view 
of Golden Gate Bridge -- a disagreement with hints of an old 
publishing rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
	Stone's husband, Phil Bronstein, is executive editor of the San  
Francisco Examiner. The neighbor, Candyce Martin, is a 
great-granddaughter of San Francisco Chronicle founder Michael de 
Young. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin is planning a 1,300-square-foot addition to her home in  
the posh Sea Cliff neighborhood. Through architect Michael Rex, 
Bronstein and Stone asked the city Planning Commission either to 
reject Martin's project or require that it be redesigned. 
</P>
<P>
	Rex said Martin's extension would ``forever obstruct important  
views enjoyed by the Bronsteins and their neighbors, as well as 
seriously compromise the Bronsteins' privacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue is to be heard May 6.

<HEADLINE> West Texas Recovers From Tornadoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIDLAND, Texas (AP) -- Tornadoes destroyed at least 20 homes in  
west Texas, leaving dozens of people walking through muddy fields 
Wednesday to salvage what they could of their belongings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tuesday night storms also brought baseball-size hail and 70  
mph wind gusts, but there were no serious injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a powerful force of nature, and anyone driving  
through here would have a hard time believing no one was killed,'' 
said Midland County Commissioner Mike Bradford. ``Sometimes you 
just get lucky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hail was piled like snow Wednesday around one trailer home  
that had its roof twisted off. Splinters of its wooden frame 
pointed toward the sky. Rescuers who waded through the snow found a 
little girl alone, sitting in the bathroom with a teddy bear. 
</P>
<P>
	Her parents were not home when the tornado hit.  
</P>
<P>
	Mike Patterson, whose home was heavily damaged by the tornadoes  
and hail, said he and his family just barely escaped being sucked 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wind blew plywood right through our house, in one wall and  
out the other,'' Patterson said. ``We had to run into the bathroom 
and jump in the tub and wait the storm out. When we came out of the 
bathroom, our living room was gone.''

<HEADLINE> Fleet's Profits Jump 36 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Fleet Financial Corp.'s reported a 36 percent jump  
in first-quarter profits, beating expectations, as the bank's 
acquisitions of the Quick &AMP; Reilly brokerage and the credit card 
businesses of Advanta and Sanwa Credit started paying off. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleet, which is continuing its buying spree with a planned  
takeover of BankBoston, earned $438 million, or 72 cents a share, 
in the January-March period, compared with $323 million, or 53 
cents a share, in the first quarter of last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street had expected the bank to earn 69 cents a share in  
the most recent quarter. Investors reacted to the pleasant surprise 
by bidding up Fleet's stock price 37 1/2 cents to $44.43 3/4 in trading 
on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``The business momentum we felt in 1998 has accelerated in the  
early part of 1999,'' Terrence Murray, chairman and chief executive 
of Fleet, said in a statement. ``This momentum provides a solid 
foundation for the recently announced merger with BankBoston.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue grew 23 percent to $2 billion from $1.63 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	With its acquisition of BankBoston, Fleet will become the  
nation's eighth-largest bank and a dominant bank of the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
	Net interest income totaled $1.04 billion during the first  
quarter of 1999, up 11 percent from the first quarter last year, 
thanks in part to the strong credit card business which has grown 
rapidly with the addition of the Sanwa Business Credit and Advanta 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The money Fleet makes from charging fees to customers, known as  
non-interest income, was up 38 percent in the first quarter to $959 
million, and now accounts for almost half of the bank's total 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Investment services revenue increased 23 percent to $248 million  
driven by a strong stock market, which benefited the brokerage 
business of Quick &AMP; Reilly, and increased sales of mutual fund and 
annuity products. 
</P>
<P>
	Quick &AMP; Reilly's earnings almost doubled to $47 million from the  
first quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleet ended the quarter on March 31 with total assets of $106.2  
billion, up less than $2 billion since the end of last year.

can range from trivia about former President Millard Fillmore to 
questions about what guest appeared on a specific Larry King Live 
episode. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday is the last day to register for the competition, which  
organizers hope will attract about 2,500 students. 
</P>
<P>
	The university has received applications from residents of 45  
states and Washington, D.C., but last year's winner was a Floridian 
-- Jason Wallace of Crawfordville. 
</P>

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- To listen to a military briefing these days is

</P>
<P>
	TERMS:   	
</P>
<P>
	Autonomy: NATO's prewar goal for Kosovo, meaning Kosovars would  
practice substantial self-rule while remaining a part of Serbia. 
Kosovar separatists grudgingly accepted a three-year provisional 
agreement along those terms but Serbs would not go along. 
</P>
<P>
	Collateral damage: Unintended killing of civilians or  
destruction of non-strategic targets. Ten people were reported 
killed when NATO hit a passenger train Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Crimes against humanity: A range of internationally defined  
acts, including murder, deportation, enslavement and rape, 
committed during wartime and subject to prosecution by a war crimes 
tribunal. Nine Serb commanders have been linked by Washington to 
atrocities that could bring prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
	De-conflict: To pause or stop attacks. NATO ``de-conflicted the  
airspace'' over Belgrade to allow safe passage for a Cypriot envoy 
who tried to win the release of three U.S. soldiers still held 
captive. 
</P>
<P>
	Degrade: NATO's vague verb of choice and primary military goal.  
It means to attack Serb military forces until their ability to 
repress Kosovars is reduced. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic cleansing: NATO's description of what Serbs are doing to  
the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo, generally meaning driving out, 
killing or otherwise nullifying the influence or presence of an 
ethnic group. It apparently was coined during ethnic struggles in 
former Soviet republics. 
</P>
<P>
	Genocide: Defined by the Geneva Convention as acts ``committed  
with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, 
racial or religious group.'' U.S. and NATO officials generally have 
avoided calling the atrocities in Kosovo a case of genocide. They 
have noted ``indicators'' of genocide. 
</P>
<P>
	Permissive environment: The stated condition under which allied  
ground troops would go into Kosovo to protect Kosovars, if Serb 
forces accept a settlement or otherwise don't pose a threat. 
</P>
<P>
	Rambouillet: The site near Paris where negotiations failed in  
February. Talks were held in a turreted 14th century chateau that 
Marie Antoinette (French queen, beheaded in 1793) called a ``den of 
toads.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Repatriation: The eventual return of the ethnic Albanians who  
fled or were driven out of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Tactical maneuverability: Allies say they have achieved this  
after so many attacks on Yugoslavia's air defenses. ``This allows 
us to fly where we want and when we want with acceptable risk,'' 
says Defense Secretary William Cohen. Not as commanding as air 
superiority. 
</P>
<P>
	War: A word avoided by NATO to describe its campaign.

<HEADLINE> Vikings Try To `Corner' Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) -- Heading into last year's draft, the  
Vikings needed a cornerback, but used their first-round pick on 
Randy Moss, who had a troubled background but ended up leading the 
NFL in touchdown catches and making the Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	This year the Vikings once again need a cornerback, and they  
have two first-round draft picks and 10 total picks to find one. 
They have Washington's 11th overall pick, which they received in 
the trade for quarterback Brad Johnson, and their own pick, the 
29th overall. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Dennis Green knows the Vikings won't find a player of  
Moss' caliber every year and vice president of player personnel 
Frank Gilliam insists there's no added pressure to do so, even 
after last year's success. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people in the football business know you don't have  
impact players like that every year,'' Gilliam said. 
</P>
<P>
	The majority of Vikings draft picks this year should be on  
defense. With all 11 starters returning from an offense that scored 
an NFL-record 541 points last season, there are few weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can, we'd like to build back up the depth in our  
defense,'' said Gilliam. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings most pressing need entering this weekend's draft is  
to find a cornerback to replace Corey Fuller, who signed with the 
Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia cornerback Champ Bailey is likely to be gone by the time  
the Vikings pick, so look for Minnesota to take Arizona's Chris 
McAlister if he's still available. 
</P>
<P>
	McAlister is a 6-foot-1, 200-pound cornerback with speed, a rare  
combination at a position where the fastest players are usually 
several inches shorter than McAlister. He was also a dangerous 
return man with the Wildcats. 
</P>
<P>
	Other top cornerback prospects include Antoine Winfield of Ohio  
State, Fernando Bryant of Alabama and Daylon McCutcheon of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings also need a defensive lineman who can step in and  
contribute immediately. Nose tackle Jerry Ball and defensive end 
Derrick Alexander are unrestricted free agents who will likely not 
be re-signed and tackle Jason Fisk signed with Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida defensive end Jevon Kearse is a possible choice if pick  
No. 11 comes up and McAlister and Bailey are gone. But he's likely 
to be gone, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Another defensive end possibility is Lamar King, a 6-foot-3, 291  
pound prospect from Division II Saginaw Valley State. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilliam said King should have little trouble adjusting from  
Division II to the NFL. ``What happens is generally you look at a 
guy like that and one thing you want to see him do is dominate his 
competition. And I think he did that,'' Gilliam said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings also need a tight end. They might use their second  
first-round pick to take Jimmy Kleinsasser, from Division II North 
Dakota. Kleinsasser is a 6-foot-2 1/2, 274 pound consensus All-America 
who is a powerful blocker and a solid receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Glover, last year's starter, and Carlester Crumpler, a  
free agent from Seattle, are the only tight ends on the roster. 
Hunter Goodwin (Miami), Greg DeLong (Baltimore) and Ryan Collins 
(Cleveland) all left via free agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Vikings feel they have an ideal backup quarterback  
in Jeff George, who signed a one-year deal last week, it's still 
possible the Vikings could draft a passer. 
</P>
<P>
	Tulane's Shaun King is a likely candidate if the Vikings choose  
a quarterback with their second first-round pick. King is 
considered a bit small at 6-foot, 220 pounds, but he has extreme 
accuracy and is also strong runner. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vikings might even trade to move up to take Bailey, which  
likely wouldn't happen until draft day.

<HEADLINE> Cicero Seeks To Deport Gang Members </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CICERO, Ill. (AP) -- The one-time home of Al Capone's bootlegging  
operation may soon become the least gang-friendly town in America, 
a place where miscreants will be marched across the town limits 
with orders to get lost and stay lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Cicero's proposal to deport gang members won 95 percent of the  
vote in city elections this week. But civil libertarians suggest 
folks with this kind of get-tough mentality might need their heads 
examined. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some ordinances are unconstitutional, but this one is  
unconstitutional as hell,'' said Dan Polsby, Northwestern 
University law professor. ``They would be declaring that a human 
being is contraband because of something they claim to be and then 
punishing them with exile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cicero's targets are ``known'' gang members with criminal  
records, town president Betty Loren-Maltese said Wednesday. She 
said police already have compiled a list of 600 members. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're talking hard-core gang members,'' she said. ``We have  
shooters on the streets. The list continues to be added to on a 
regular basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cicero -- a community of 70,000 -- is named for a Roman orator,  
but the town's reputation was made during Prohibition. When a 
reforming mayor kicked Capone out of Chicago, the gangster moved 
the headquarters of his bootlegging empire across the city's 
western border to Cicero. 
</P>
<P>
	Speakeasies flourished in the shadow of huge factory sheds and  
neat brick bungalows occupied by thrifty Czech immigrants. When 
Prohibition ended, strip joints moved in. 
</P>
<P>
	The community of factories and semi-trailers is perhaps best  
known for its official corruption, though police say gangs are a 
bigger problem these days. Just last month, two detectives were 
indicted on charges involving payoffs to fix police investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	Loren-Maltese's late husband, Frank Maltese, a town assessor,  
pleaded guilty to federal gambling charges. Prosecutors claimed he 
was a bookie and fixer for the mob. He died before going to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Loren-Maltese has said she knew little about her late husband's  
friendship with mob figures and that he only pleaded guilty because 
he was ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if mobsters would be subject to her anti-gang measure,  
Loren-Maltese replied: ``Only if they're doing drive-bys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After growing up on Chicago's West Side, Loren-Maltese moved to  
Cicero as a reporter and later went into real estate. Since 
becoming town president in 1993, she claims to have shut down most 
of Cicero's once-abundant strip joints and driven out prostitutes 
who worked the city. 
</P>
<P>
	The anti-gang proposal is her latest initiative. Town board  
members are set to pass a follow-up ordinance April 27 that would 
give gang members 60 days to get out of town. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Pechter, chief attorney for Cicero, is still drafting the  
ordinance. He said it probably would allow a reputed gang member a 
hearing before the person is booted out. Once banned, a gang member 
would be subject to arrest upon return and would be restricted even 
from visiting relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The ordinance also would apply to minors, Loren-Maltese said.  
</P>
<P>
	``The parents are going to have to do what I call tough love,''  
she said. ``They should not be living at home with their mommies 
and daddies anyway.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gang ban would be enforced in conjunction with the town's  
nuisance ordinance, which fines owners of property where known gang 
members live $500 a day until the individual has left the premises. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics like Polsby say even gang members have a constitutional  
right to free association. 
</P>
<P>
	Jay Miller, executive director of the American Civil Liberties  
Union's Chicago office, said his organization plans to represent 
the first person ousted from Cicero under the new ordinance. He 
called the measure a public relations ploy. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're playing games and wasting taxpayer's money,'' Miller  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Loren-Maltese said she's simply trying to fulfill the wishes  
of her constituents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I welcome the ACLU's challenge,'' she said. ``I understand the  
Constitution as far as respecting people's rights. But what about 
the rights of the good people?''

<HEADLINE> Teen Who Killed Lover Gets 10 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LYONS, N.Y. (AP) -- A teen-ager wept quietly as she was sentenced  
to 10 to 20 years in prison for killing a romantic rival with her 
car. 
</P>
<P>
	Polly Smith, 18, ran over Amanda Leoni, also 18, after they had  
vied all summer for the affections of the same young man. She hit 
the brake, turned the steering wheel and drove over Leonie, three 
teen-age witnesses testified. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith apologized to the victim's parents before her sentencing  
Tuesday but insisted she never meant to kill her. ``I'd give 
anything to bring back Amanda,'' she said, choking back tears. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Smith was acquitted of second-degree murder but  
convicted of manslaughter, which carries a maximum sentence of 12 
1/2 to 25 years in prison and a minimum sentence of three to six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge also sentenced her to time already served for reckless  
driving, a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim's father, James Leoni, asked for the maximum sentence  
to send a message ``that violence is not a way to solve a 
problem.'' He said he and his wife cry every day for a daughter 
killed ``in a fit of jealous rage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith had been dating Justin Smith, 20, on and off for over a  
year when Leoni, returning home from her first year in college, 
began seeing him as well. Smith tried to scare her off, allegedly 
kicking and punching her on one occasion, then forced a showdown 
the night of Aug. 24, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The women had an argument during which Justin Smith told Leoni  
he was finished with her. As Leoni walked away, Smith hit the 
accelerator and struck her from behind. 
</P>
<P>
	The circumstances of Leoni's death bore haunting similarities to  
another lethal love affair involving her 15 months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	In May 1997, her boyfriend, Christopher Heise, 18, died of a  
knife wound to the heart during a fight with a 16-year-old high 
school buddy who was courting her. Deciding Gavin Dinneen acted in 
fearful self-defense, a jury acquitted him of homicide.

<HEADLINE> Yoko Ono Sues Lennon's Ex-Assistant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In the latest episode in a long feud, Yoko Ono  
has sued a former assistant to John Lennon, claiming he stole 
priceless personal items after the ex-Beatle was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	In a federal lawsuit, Ono contends that the former aide, Fred  
Seaman, agreed in 1983 to return boxes of Lennon's personal items 
but has held on to hundreds of photographs. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was prompted by Seaman's claim in a February letter  
to Capitol Records that a photograph of Lennon with his son Sean, 
overlooking a beach in Bermuda, was improperly included in a 
recently released compact disc box set. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaman said he shot the photograph and calls Capitol's use of it  
``an egregious'' copyright infringement. 
</P>
<P>
	Capitol sued Seaman separately on Tuesday, seeking a declaration  
that the photograph does not infringe on any copyright rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaman did not return a telephone message left at his Brooklyn  
residence. A lawyer for Ono did not return a telephone message. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaman provided extensive material for celebrity biographer  
Albert Goldman's unflattering portrayal of Lennon and in 1991 
published his own book. Although it was kinder in its descriptions 
of Lennon, Seaman's book portrayed Ono as an adulterous heroin 
addict. 
</P>
<P>
	Ono's lawsuit, which seeks unspecified damages, said that after  
Lennon was shot to death in 1980 outside his Manhattan apartment, 
Seaman routinely took shopping bags full of documents and personal 
items. 
</P>
<P>
	The items included unreleased recordings, paintings, love  
letters, a novella by Lennon titled ``Skywriting by Word of 
Mouth,'' and Lennon's journals from 1975 until he was killed, it 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seaman pleaded guilty in 1983 to stealing four journals and was  
sentenced to five years' probation. He promised to return all items 
that he wrongfully took, the lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Seaman returned several boxes of personal items,  
including family pictures, Lennon's journals and many of his 
private letters, Ono contends Seaman is now showing off hundreds of 
other Lennon family photographs, even in a recent television 
special and in several books.

<HEADLINE> GM's Saturn Not Giving Up in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- General Motors Corp.'s Saturn unit remains  
committed to the Japanese market despite disappointing sales made 
worse by a persistent recession, Saturn's new president said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's worst recession in decades has hurt all automakers;  
Saturn sold just 1,400 cars here last year, less than 1 percent of 
the 250,000 it sold in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturn has been struggling in the United States, as well.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year the GM subsidiary posted its first loss since 1993 as  
U.S. demand for subcompacts continued to weaken. Saturn plans to 
put its first midsize car, the L-series, on sale in the summer. 
Saturn also has plans to produce a compact sport utility vehicle 
starting in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	Cynthia Trudell, in Japan for the first time since assuming the  
top post at Saturn in January, said boosting Saturn exports to 
Japan was a key part of her strategy. She said Saturn must do well 
in Japan because back home it competes against Japanese imports. 
</P>
<P>
	She cited sales of the three-door SC coupe, which went on sale  
here in January, as a reason for optimism. Those sales, including 
back orders, total about 250 so far, nearly three times what Saturn 
officials had expected. The coupe also has done well in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall Saturn sales in Japan for the first three months of this  
year are up by 16 percent from the same period last year to 365 
cars. Saturn Japan's general director, Keith Wicks, said time was 
needed to sell more cars in Japan, given the credit crunch and 
lagging consumer sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to be patient in time of a recession,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Saturn, which debuted in Japan two years ago, is being sold  
through a dealer network that only sells Saturns. There are only 20 
such dealers so far, although a couple more are planned. GM 
officials say the exclusive sales network makes Saturn 
strategically important for GM's future growth in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturn, compared with other American automakers, also has  
invested heavily in advertising to build brand recognition in a 
market that is deeply suspicious of U.S. cars. And it has kept its 
no-haggle pricing policy that was one of the main reasons for its 
success in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the environment over the past two years, I would say we  
are fairly -- not pleased -- but satisfied we've taken the right 
approach,'' Wicks said.

<HEADLINE>  China Premier: Don't Fear China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji today told  
Americans not to fear economic competition with China as he pushes 
for inclusion in the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu also downplayed the size of the U.S. trade deficit with  
China. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't make such a big deal out of this trade deficit,'' Zhu  
said in a speech at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
``This is not such a serious problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the last stop on his nine-day, six-city tour, Zhu said  
Chinese estimates place the trade deficit at $21 billion, 
significantly less than U.S. estimates of $57 billion. He added 
that independent academic analysts have it at about $35 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu argued that the apparently large deficit belies the fact  
that many of the products exported from China are made from 
imported raw materials. 
</P>
<P>
	During a question-and-answer period following the speech, Zhu  
sidestepped a query about prominent dissident Xu Wenli. 
</P>
<P>
	A Chinese court sentenced him in December to 13 years  
imprisonment for trying to set up an opposition party -- the longest 
sentence given to a dissident in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``When will you cease this dictatorial rule?'' asked a man in  
the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	The premier said human rights have been improving in China, but  
he acknowledged some shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wish to establish a nation which is ruled in accordance  
with law,'' he said. ``As for any individual case, I don't think 
this is the appropriate time to go into details.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu's speech came as demonstrators clashed outside.  
</P>
<P>
	A flag-waving pro-Chinese demonstrator was knocked down after he  
got close to a group of about 100 pro-Tibet protesters who were 
chanting ``Shame on China.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters opposed to Chinese involvement in Tibet grabbed  
the flag from the man and burned it. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other demonstrations have occurred during Zhu's nine-day  
tour of the United States because of China's record on human 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu flew to Boston from New York City, where he talked trade on  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu characterized his U.S. visit as a crucial step toward  
opening Chinese markets to more foreign investment. He said he was 
undeterred by bumps in trade negotiations last week, telling the 
U.S.-China Business Council and The Economic Club of New York that 
``in the broad history of China-U.S. relations, these are small 
matters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, the U.S. and Chinese governments agreed to  
``move intensively'' toward resolving sticking points in the trade 
agreement that would lead to WTO membership for China. Both sides 
predicted an agreement by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Membership in the WTO, which regulates world trade, would give  
China a say in global trade rules and help open the country to 
foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
	China, whose doctrinaire communism kept its markets tightly  
state-controlled until the early 1980s, has been embracing 
capitalism guardedly while simultaneously trying to retain 
government control over its economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu's tour comes at a time when tensions between China and the  
United States are high on other fronts as well, including charges 
of spying by Beijing. Zhu said he doubted the espionage charges and 
had asked President Jiang Zemin and military leaders about them. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said they knew nothing about this,'' he told CNN in an  
interview Tuesday. ``If you want to investigate, we will be willing 
to assist it.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that are moving substantially or trading  
heavily today on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock 
Market. 

</P>
<P>
                               *NYSE    	

</P>
<P>
 *Lucent Technologies, up 3 9/16 at 60 1/2.    	
</P>
<P>
	The telephone network equipment company plans to build a  
research lab in North Carolina and staff it with 500 employees. The 
lab will research advances in optical networking, which uses 
ultra-thin strands of glass fiber, or fiber optics, to transmit 
computer data and telephone conversations. On Tuesday, the Murray 
Hill, N.J. company said its second-quarter earnings would meet or 
exceed analysts' expectations, and that it should post a 30-percent 
increase in first-quarter revenues. 

</P>
<P>
 *Fleet Financial Corp. rose 3/8 to 43 7/16.    	
</P>
<P>
	Fleet reported a 36 percent jump in first-quarter profits,  
beating expectations, as the bank's acquisitions of the Quick &AMP; 
Reilly brokerage firm and the Advanta credit card business started 
to pay off. Fleet earned 72 cents a share, up from 53 cents last 
year and beating analysts' expected 69 cents. 

</P>
<P>
 *Health Management Association rose 1 3/4 at 14 5/8.    	
</P>
<P>
	Warburg Dillon Read restarted coverage with a ``buy'' rating.  

</P>
<P>
 *Quinenco SA's American depositary receipts rose 15/16 to 10.  
</P>
<P>
 *BCH SA's American depositary receipts rose 7/16 to 13 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Chile's Quinenco said Tuesday it will accept a $600 million  
offer made by Spain's BCH for its 50 percent interest in the two 
companies' O'Higgins Central Hispanoamericano SA joint venture. 

</P>
<P>
 *Indymac Mortgage Holdings Inc. rose 2 1/16 to 13 7/8.    	
</P>
<P>
	The company said it expects to report somewhat higher near-term  
earnings as a result of originating loans online through 
LoanWorks.com and LoanWorks, and by closing its Atlanta office. A 
First Call survey of seven analysts estimated Indymac would earn 30 
cents a share in the first quarter. 

</P>
<P>
 *NASDAQ   	

</P>
<P>
 *Sovereign Bank fell 2 13/16 to 14 11/16.    	
</P>
<P>
	The stock gave up early gains after the company announced late  
Tuesday it will launch Internet operations in the third or fourth 
quarter and open 700 online accounts a week. 

</P>
<P>
 *Florida Banks Inc. fell 14 1/4 to 17.    	
</P>
<P>
	The shares came down to earth after skyrocketing Tuesday, on  
news that the bank will launch an Internet banking service this 
year aimed at small- to mid-size business customers. 

</P>
<P>
 *Oxford Health rose 2 3/4 to 16 3/4.    	
</P>
<P>
	Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities made the stock its ``top  
pick,'' upgrading it from ``buy.'' 

</P>
<P>
 *Infoseek Corp. fell 19 1/8 to 60 3/8.  
</P>
<P>
 *Disney rose 5/16 to 35 1/16 in NYSE trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's fiscal second-quarter results, released late  
Tuesday, showed a slight decrease in revenue from the first 
quarter. This raised concerns among analysts that, despite solid 
traffic to the company's new GO Internet network, a joint venture 
recently launched by Infoseek and Walt Disney Co., Infoseek is 
having trouble turning this traffic into revenue. 

</P>
<P>
 *Net.Bank fell 63 1/16 to 172.    	
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Internet-related banks fell sharply on profit-taking.  
Net.Bank shares soared Tuesday after the company, which does 
business solely on the Internet, announced a 3-for-1 stock split. 

</P>
<P>
 *Aegis Communications Group Inc. rose 1 5/8 to 2 3/8.    	
</P>
<P>
	The marketing services company's Elrick &AMP; Lavidge Marketing  
Research unit entered an alliance with America Online to offer its 
clients access to America Online's member base. Aegis said the deal 
will enable it to gather responses to questions on concept and 
product testing, segmentation, print advertising and brand image 
and awareness.

<HEADLINE>  Gretzky To Decide Future by Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RYE, N.Y. (AP) -- Everyone, it seems, has an opinion on whether  
hockey's greatest goal-scorer should retire. Everyone, that is, 
except Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not trying to be an idiot about this,'' the New York  
Rangers center said Wednesday. ``It's just a lifetime decision. 
Once it's done, it's done, 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, Rangers coach John  
Muckler, hockey fans and even his wife Janet -- whose opinion he 
values most -- have said they would like the Great One to play one 
more year. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said, ``Right now what I'm thinking about, what I'm  
going through is just totally about myself. I need to do what's 
best for myself. ... Nobody else has any bearing on this at this 
point in time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, 38, promised he won't keep everyone hanging. He said  
he'll decide by Sunday -- but ``not today or tomorrow'' -- whether to 
end his 20-year National Hockey League career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love this game,'' Gretzky said. ``The practice, sitting in  
the back of the bus with the pizza and the guys ... the camaraderie 
and what goes on between the guys ... coming in the next morning 
after a big win. I mean I love everything about it. ... No matter 
what happens, I'm going to miss it more than anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Gretzky does decide to leave, tonight's game in Ottawa would  
be his last in his native land. The game against the Senators will 
be broadcast nationally in Canada and as many as 200 journalists 
are expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to enjoy tomorrow,'' he said on Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky said Muckler talked to him about ``my importance to the  
organization as far as my presence, what I bring to the hockey 
club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers are 33-37-10 this season and failed to make the  
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said to him, `I think this team will be a better team next  
year than it is this year' and he said that it would be a better 
team next year if I'm back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He seemed to vacillate even during the news conference about  
whether he wanted to come back, but he said he was ``leaning 
somewhat more one way than the other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1,483 games, Gretzky has scored 894 goals and has 1,961  
assists. He was named the league's most valuable player nine times 
and led the league in scoring 10 times. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody I've talked to says, `You've got to play next year,'  
and that part's been really difficult,'' Gretzky said. ``The 
response has been overwhelming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he didn't want to ``let down'' his coach or teammates or  
fans, ``But I know eventually I'll make the right decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky said he's confident he can still play well, though he  
complained of a neck injury that cost him 12 games this season and 
said, ``I'm not going to play at the level I did 10 years ago.'' He 
also said the game is still fun for him. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky expressed disappointment about the Rangers' missing the  
playoffs and said, ``Everybody wants to go out like Michael Jordan 
did, but it's not a perfect world. ... It's not going to happen 
that way, not this year, but it is nice to be able to say people do 
want me to play more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordie Howe, who held many of hockey's scoring records before  
Gretzky came along, had some advice for his friend: Wait until 
training camp in September to make a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``The show he put on at the all-star game, that last shift, my  
God, it looked like he could play until he was 60,'' said Howe, who 
recalled last month's chat with Gretzky. ``He mentioned something 
about `This may be my last year.' I told him `Don't talk that way. 
Come training camp you're going to really get the itch again.' He's 
so talented he could get by on one skate.''

<HEADLINE> 5 Kids Die When Car Sinks in Wash. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EPHRATA, Wash. (AP) -- A car carrying two women and five children  
plunged into a swift-flowing irrigation canal, trapping them 
inside. The women managed to crawl through a window and float to 
safety, but the boys -- ages 2 to 11 -- never made it out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Five children is a traumatic thing,'' Grant County  
Undersheriff Mike Shay said after the bodies were recovered. ``You 
look at those five kids, and you think of your own children and 
grandchildren.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators were trying to determine what caused Tuesday  
night's accident about a mile north of this central Washington farm 
town. Police said the car slipped off the road when the driver 
Rosio Curiel, 24, mother of two of the victims, tried to turn 
around. There was no indication alcohol was a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	The car plunged into the cold waters of a V-shaped,  
concrete-lined canal that carries water from Grand Coulee Dam and 
nourishes tracts of fruit tree orchards, hay fields and row crops. 
</P>
<P>
	The women escaped through an open driver's side window and  
floated several hundred yards downstream before being pulled from 
the canal near Terry Catlin's home. 
</P>
<P>
	Catlin, an irrigation district employee and reserve sheriff's  
deputy, raced to the scene after telling his mother to call 911. 
The car was resting upside down under 20 feet of water on the floor 
of the canal. 
</P>
<P>
	The water was too swift for divers to try to remove the bodies,  
so they hooked up cables to the 1987 Chevrolet Spectrum and lifted 
it out nearly 90 minutes after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Shay found the bodies of the five boys in the back seat.  
</P>
<P>
	They were identified as Alexis Curiel, 2; Jose Curiel Jr., 4;  
Jose Chavez, 3; Martin Chavez, Jr., 2; and Victor Eduardo Chavez, 
11. 
</P>
<P>
	Their mothers -- Ms. Curiel and Maria Chavez, 32 -- were treated  
at a hospital and released.

<HEADLINE>  Gretzky To Decide Future by Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RYE, N.Y. (AP) -- Everyone, it seems, has an opinion on whether  
hockey's greatest goal-scorer should retire. Everyone, that is, 
except Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not trying to be an idiot about this,'' the New York  
Rangers center said Wednesday. ``It's just a lifetime decision. 
Once it's done, it's done, 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, Rangers coach John  
Muckler, hockey fans and even his wife Janet -- whose opinion he 
values most -- have said they would like the Great One to play one 
more year. 
</P>
<P>
	But, he said, ``Right now what I'm thinking about, what I'm  
going through is just totally about myself. I need to do what's 
best for myself. ... Nobody else has any bearing on this at this 
point in time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, 38, promised he won't keep everyone hanging. He said  
he'll decide by Sunday -- but ``not today or tomorrow'' -- whether to 
end his 20-year National Hockey League career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love this game,'' Gretzky said. ``The practice, sitting in  
the back of the bus with the pizza and the guys ... the camaraderie 
and what goes on between the guys ... coming in the next morning 
after a big win. I mean I love everything about it. ... No matter 
what happens, I'm going to miss it more than anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If Gretzky does decide to leave, tonight's game in Ottawa would  
be his last in his native land. The game against the Senators will 
be broadcast nationally in Canada and as many as 200 journalists 
are expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to enjoy tomorrow,'' he said on Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky said Muckler talked to him about ``my importance to the  
organization as far as my presence, what I bring to the hockey

<HEADLINE>  China Premier: Don't Fear China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji today told  
Americans not to fear economic competition with China as he pushes 
for inclusion in the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu also downplayed the size of the U.S. trade deficit with  
China. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't make such a big deal out of this trade deficit,'' Zhu  
said in a speech at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
``This is not such a serious problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the last stop on his nine-day, six-city tour, Zhu said  
Chinese estimates place the trade deficit at $21 billion, 
significantly less than U.S. estimates of $57 billion. He added 
that independent academic analysts have it at about $35 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu argued that the apparently large deficit belies the fact  
that many of the products exported from China are made from 
imported raw materials. 
</P>
<P>
	During a question-and-answer period following the speech, Zhu  
sidestepped a query about prominent dissident Xu Wenli. 
</P>
<P>
	A Chinese court sentenced him in December to 13 years  
imprisonment for trying to set up an opposition party -- the longest 
sentence given to a dissident in three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``When will you cease this dictatorial rule?'' asked a man in  
the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	The premier said human rights have been improving in China, but  
he acknowledged some shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wish to establish a nation which is ruled in accordance  
with law,'' he said. ``As for any individual case, I don't think 
this is the appropriate time to go into details.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu's speech came as demonstrators clashed outside.  
</P>
<P>
	A flag-waving pro-Chinese demonstrator was knocked down after he  
got close to a group of about 100 pro-Tibet protesters who were 
chanting ``Shame on China.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters opposed to Chinese involvement in Tibet grabbed  
the flag from the man and burned it. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other demonstrations have occurred during Zhu's nine-day  
tour of the United States because of China's record on human 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu flew to Boston from New York City, where he talked trade on  
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu characterized his U.S. visit as a crucial step toward  
opening Chinese markets to more foreign investment. He said he was 
undeterred by bumps in trade negotiations last week, telling the 
U.S.-China Business Council and The Economic Club of New York that 
``in the broad history of China-U.S. relations, these are small 
matters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, the U.S. and Chinese governments agreed to  
``move intensively'' toward resolving sticking points in the trade 
agreement that would lead to WTO membership for China. Both sides 
predicted an agreement by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Membership in the WTO, which regulates world trade, would give  
China a say in global trade rules and help open the country to 
foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
	China, whose doctrinaire communism kept its markets tightly  
state-controlled until the early 1980s, has been embracing 
capitalism guardedly while simultaneously trying to retain 
government control over its economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu's tour comes at a time when tensions between China and the  
United States are high on other fronts as well, including charges 
of spying by Beijing. Zhu said he doubted the espionage charges and 
had asked President Jiang Zemin and military leaders about them. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said they knew nothing about this,'' he told CNN in an  
interview Tuesday. ``If you want to investigate, we will be willing 
to assist it.''

<HEADLINE> Brand's NBA Decision a `No-Brainer' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Even his coach knew it was time to go.  
</P>
<P>
	Elton Brand, who won just about every individual honor a player  
can, left Duke on Wednesday and headed to the NBA. The 6-foot-8 
sophomore center became the first Blue Devils player to quit school 
early for pro ball. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing his decision to give up his last two years of  
eligibility, Brand was joined at Cameron Indoor Stadium by his 
mother, Daisy, and a half-dozen teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Krzyzewski, recovering from hip surgery at home,  
joined in by telephone and called the decision by the player of the 
year a ``no-brainer.''. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand was persuaded to leave school last weekend by Krzyzewski  
and associate head coach Johnny Dawkins, a former Duke star and NBA 
player. They are certain Brand will be a top 10 pick in the June 30 
NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way college basketball has played me last year with the  
double teams and zones, coach felt I would only improve in practice 
and wouldn't get a chance to develop in the games,'' Brand said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand averaged 17.8 points and 9.8 rebounds a game in carrying  
the Blue Devils to a 37-2 record. But he fell short of his goal of 
leading the Blue Devils to the national title, with a 77-74 loss to 
Connecticut in the NCAA championship game last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's somewhat of a sad time to be leaving friends, teammates  
and coaches,'' Brand said. ``But it's also a joyous time because I 
get to go into new adventures and new things and just live a 
lifetime dream of mine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is the fourth player to come out early for the NBA draft,  
joining Ron Artest (St. John's), Steve Francis (Maryland) and 
Albert White (Missouri). Underclassmen have until May 15 to 
declare. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand was the first sophomore to win the John R. Wooden Award,  
presented by the Los Angeles Athletic Club to college basketball's 
top player. He also was honored this season by The Associated 
Press, the Atlanta Tipoff Club and the United States Basketball 
Writers Association as national player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand's announcement could lead two other Duke underclassmen --  
sophomore Will Avery and freshman Corey Maggette -- to jump to the 
pros. Neither attended Wednesday's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, wearing a light gray suit, received an ovation from about  
50 fans when he entered Cameron, bringing a smile to his face. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited financial security and an opportunity to improve his  
game as reasons for his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very important to be able to take care of my mom and my  
family and have them live comfortably,'' said Brand, who grew up in 
a low-income area in Peekskill, N.Y., without a father. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, who was benched for two games by Krzyzewski in early  
December for being out of shape, is realistic about his next step. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still not ready physically to go out there and play with  
those guys, but in a month or two from now I'll be more prepared,'' 
said Brand, who will begin a workout regimen with Dawkins 
immediately. ``I don't think anyone coming out of college is 
actually ready to play in the NBA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Brand will be gone next season, the Blue Devils have  
signed four prep All-Americans for next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are going to see players who are coming out of high school  
who probably wouldn't choose Duke because they didn't think Coach K 
let his players leave early now say, `I can go to Duke because 
Elton Brand is leaving,''' junior Chris Carrawell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Times are changing,'' he added. ``It was one of those things  
where Elton Brand got the player of the year award. He swept every 
major award. What are you going to come back for, to sweep it 
again? The only thing he had to accomplish on the college level was 
to win a national championship. That was it basically.''

<HEADLINE> AOL Volunteers Claim Exploitation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- They patrol the Internet like old-fashioned  
neighborhood watchmen, keeping the peace and helping lost souls. 
</P>
<P>
	But now a handful of former America Online volunteer ``community  
leaders'' are challenging the company, saying they should be paid 
for their work. 
</P>
<P>
	``You do not treat volunteers like this. You treat them with  
respect,'' said Kelly Hallissey, one of seven who have complained 
to the U.S. Department of Labor, which is looking into the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Their numbers are tiny, yet a successful challenge could shake  
the Internet world, forcing Web companies that rely heavily on such 
volunteers to begin paying for their services. For instance, AOL, 
which employs 12,000 workers, uses 10,000 volunteers to lead chat 
rooms, report violations of Internet rules and answer questions 
from puzzled surfers. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a significant issue,'' New York-based employment  
lawyer Eve Rachel Markewich said in an interview Wednesday. 
``Whatever determination is made with AOL is going to have an 
impact on how these companies run their business in the future, and 
whether or not they continue to employ these volunteers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The participation of volunteers -- from tech-smitten teen-agers  
to Nobel Prize laureates -- has been integral to the phenomenal 
growth of the Web. A notable example is the computer operating 
system software called Linux that is now posing a threat to the 
dominance of Microsoft's Windows. Linux grew out of the tinkerings 
of scientists and amateurs worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL and many other Internet companies have gone a step further,  
enlisting volunteers in a structured fashion to help control the 
traffic that can verge on chaos in the virtual world. The question 
raised now is whether such companies are riding to profitability on 
the backs of unpaid workers. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL defends the system, saying it's part of the culture of the  
Web. 
</P>
<P>
	``This whole volunteerism community and the participants are  
what makes the Internet,'' said AOL spokeswoman Ann Brackbill. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for their services, AOL community leaders get a free  
account, which costs $21.95 a month. During the years that AOL 
charged hourly rates, volunteers potentially were even better 
compensated. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Brackbill refused to give details, but said the company  
contacted the Department of Labor after it found out about 
Observers.net, a Web site started in September by the volunteers 
with grievances. 
</P>
<P>
	A Department of Labor spokesman refused to confirm or deny  
whether AOL was being investigated. An April 9 letter sent to a 
complainant and shared with The Associated Press said the 
department's Employment Standards Division was looking into the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
	What constitutes employed work is key to any governmental  
inquiry into the matter, said employment lawyer Michael Karpeles. 
</P>
<P>
	He said such investigations typically look into whether  
individuals work according to a schedule, do work similar to that 
of employees, are supervised by employees' bosses, and receive 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hallissey, who volunteered from 1994 to 1997 for AOL, said  
in her letter to the government that volunteers were required to 
check in for their work, which was scheduled by AOL. 
</P>
<P>
	She added in an interview from her home in Greensboro, N.C.,  
that when she posted a criticism of AOL management on a company 
online bulletin board, she was dismissed as a volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The heart of the issue is that AOL didn't care,'' said Eric  
Wilson, a Cleveland, Miss.-based writer who is also one of the 
seven complainants. ``Some of us did think that the work that we 
did should have been done by employees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Brackbill said volunteer work is coordinated by the company,  
since the company manages ``tens of thousands of chat rooms'' and 
needs to organize the services of its many volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	But she said the tasks performed by the volunteers ``are very  
different from AOL employees, and we would make sure of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ivillage.com, an Internet company where 1,100 volunteers  
outnumber staffers by more than five to one, issued a brief 
statement Wednesday defending its use of volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
	``IVillage.com community leaders are true volunteers and not  
employees,'' the statement said. ``Our hope is that the Internet's 
participatory nature is not what's at issue here.''

<HEADLINE> Michelle Kwan Heading to UCLA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Michelle Kwan will enter UCLA this fall and  
intends to keep skating. 
</P>
<P>
	The figure skating champion said today she was accepted by the  
school, plans to live in the dormitories or off campus and will 
take a full course load. 
</P>
<P>
	``For me, education is important,'' said Kwan, who will turn 19  
in July. ``I can't put skating on hold, nor do I want to be a 
26-year-old freshman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two-time world champion and 1998 Olympic silver medalist  
isn't sure how heavy a skating schedule she will carry next season. 
She plans to compete and the national championships in Cleveland 
next February and ``hopefully worlds'' next March in Brisbane, 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan will consult longtime coach Frank Carroll before making  
plans for the 1999-2000 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll probably decide as soon as I get off of the John Hancock  
Champions on Ice tour,'' she said. ``These are huge decisions for 
me. There are other decisions than just I am going to college. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see my sister in Boston University and my brother at  
UC-Irvine and I envy them and want to be a student. We talk all the 
time about their college experience and how much they love it and 
the time has come for me to go.''

<HEADLINE> Trial Begins in Sting Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Mexican bank officials charged in the United  
States' largest money laundering probe were naive, terrified or 
simply asleep when they were told the funds were for a drug cartel, 
their attorneys argued. 
</P>
<P>
	The first of four trials in the Operation Casablanca case opened  
Tuesday in federal court, with some defense lawyers arguing their 
clients were coerced or entrapped into helping launder tens of 
millions of dollars for U.S. Customs agents posing as drug 
traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
	Stockbroker Fernando Barragan Reyes ``was asleep'' during the  
meeting in which he allegedly was told of the drug connection, said 
his lawyer, Manuel Araujo. 
</P>
<P>
	But prosecutor Duane Lyons told jurors that the six defendants  
``went out of their way'' to cooperate with a government informant 
posing as a recruiter for the Cali cartel. 
</P>
<P>
	``The goal ... was to get as much money as they could, deposit  
it into bank accounts, then get it to the traffickers in 
Colombia,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities seized $100 million from 14 banks and dozens of  
individuals during the three-year investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The operation raised tension between the United States and  
Mexico when agents arrested 167 people, including top Mexican 
bankers and executives. Mexico accused the United States of 
intruding on Mexican sovereignty by conducting a sting operation 
without its involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, two Mexican banks pleaded guilty to money laundering  
charges. They agreed to pay $500,000 each in fines and forfeit a 
combined $13.6 million seized by authorities.

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybean Futures Up / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices were higher  
today in early dealings on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	May wheat and soybean futures were both up more than 4 cents a  
bushel -- a jump mostly attributed to reports of continued cold 
weather in Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	There also are predictions of a continued cold and possibly wet  
weather in the Plains states, which some think may cause permanent 
damage to hard red wheat. Crops in Texas and Oklahoma are, however, 
considered mature enough to avoid much damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures also were up, in part still riding the high of news  
from the U.S. Agriculture Department, which on Tuesday released 
reports of steady export business. 
</P>
<P>
	In early trading today, wheat for May delivery was up 4 1/2 cents  
to $2.60 1/2 a bushel; May corn rose 2 cents to $2.18 a bushel; May 
oats rose 1 1/4 cents to $1.16 a bushel; and May soybeans were up 4 1/4 5 
cents to $4.89 1/2 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Livestock and pork belly futures were mixed in early trading on  
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle fell .22 cent to 64.10 cents a pound; May  
feeder cattle fell .15 cent to 72.77 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
fell .40 cent to 54.95 cents a pound; and July pork bellies fell 
.67 cent to 51.85 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Decision Against Pinochet Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADRID, Spain (AP) -- A lawyer associated with Spanish efforts to  
try Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet for crimes against 
humanity said Wednesday that he expects British Interior Minister 
Jack Straw to allow extradition procedures to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be scandalous if he did not,'' Carlos Slepoy said  
ahead of Straw's expected decision Thursday on whether Pinochet 
will have to defend himself against the Spanish extradition request 
or be allowed to go home. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet has been under police guard in Britain since Oct. 16  
when he was detained on a warrant from Spanish Judge Baltasar 
Garzon, who is spearheading attempts to bring the former dictator 
to trial for human rights abuses committed during his 1973-1990 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
	Straw's deliberations follow last month's ruling by Britain's  
House of Lords, which drastically reduced the charges for which the 
83-year-old ex-military chief could be extradited to Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lords threw out all but those involving torture allegedly  
committed after 1988 -- when an international torture convention was 
incorporated into British law. Most of the atrocities blamed on the 
Pinochet regime occurred in its early years. 
</P>
<P>
	But Slepoy said the ruling ``also made it clear that Pinochet  
must be tried for torture,'' as the torture convention obliges 
signatories to aid efforts to bring accused torturers to justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Straw does not allow extradition, then a trial would have  
to take place in London, and we don't think that he would want to 
get himself into that mess,'' Slepoy added. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the British ruling, Garzon has sent London evidence from  
51 additional cases, bringing to 59 the total number of torture 
cases after September 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking to strengthen the extradition case, Garzon send 31 extra  
cases March 26 to the eight contained in the original petition. A 
week later, he added nine other cases in a separate document, and 
on April 7 he sent an additional eleven. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet's regime began with a 1973 coup to overthrow the  
elected Marxist government of Salvador Allende. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Garzon's key sources has been Martin Almada, a lawyer who  
uncovered the existence in Paraguay in 1992 of five tons of hidden 
documents on a region-wide crackdown on leftists known as Operation 
Condor coordinated by Pinochet and other South American dictators. 
</P>
<P>
	Almada handed over several related documents to Garzon on  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Slepoy, who has worked closely with Garzon, the  
Pinochet case will almost certainly lead to charges against other 
former South American dictators. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case goes far beyond the issues of the nationality,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks $300 Tax Credits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today unveiled his  
long-awaited plan to distribute $300 tax credits to millions of 
working Americans so they can set up new personal investment 
accounts for retirement. ``It is the kind of tax cut America 
needs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said the plan would provide the annual  
tax credit for workers to invest in personal savings accounts 
similar to 401(k) plans that many businesses now offer their 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Clinton would provide up to $700 for a couple  
filing a joint return as a government match to money they save on 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe Americans who work hard their entire lives, and  
raise their children, should not have their retirements poised 
precariously on the edge of poverty,'' Clinton said. ``I believe 
that Americans, however, have to do more to save for their own 
future. But Americans deserve the chance to do that. '' 
</P>
<P>
	Under an example provided by the administration, a low- or  
moderate-income couple eligible for the maximum benefits could 
qualify for an upfront tax credit of $300 per person, for a maximum 
of $600 for the family. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, if husband and wife each put $350 of income into a  
savings plan, they could qualify for the government to match those 
savings, dollar for dollar. So, the $700 put in by the couple would 
be matched by $700 from the government, for total government 
contribution of $1,300. 
</P>
<P>
	This $1,300 maximum would apply generally to families earning  
under $40,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton first proposed the accounts in his State of the Union  
speech in January, as part of his overall plan for using $4.8 
trillion in projected government surpluses expected over the next 
15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But the administration has struggled since that time to come up  
with details of its savings program, which Clinton has dubbed 
Universal Savings Accounts. Clinton and other administration 
officials were scheduled to unveil the proposal at a White House 
ceremony today. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton sees the plan as a way to blunt a Republican drive in  
Congress for much broader income tax relief. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and  
Means Committee, said Clinton's overall budget ``raises taxes on 
some Americans to give tax cuts to others, which divides our 
country and isn't fair.'' Nevertheless, Archer applauded the idea 
of using private accounts to boost retirement savings. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's plan is targeted to low- and middle-income workers:  
The government matching money for a worker's own savings would 
begin to phase out at household incomes around $40,000. Workers 
earning more than $100,000 would, for the most part, not be 
eligible for the program unless they don't have any retirement plan 
through work. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration estimates that about 124 million American  
workers would qualify for some benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget projects that the accounts would cost $96  
billion through 2004 and $536 billion through 2014 -- using up about 
12 percent of the surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has proposed that the bulk of the long-term surplus --  
about 77 percent -- go to bolster Social Security and Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's framework for rescuing the federal retirement  
programs, however, has come under heavy Republic criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	By unveiling the details of the targeted tax relief today, one  
day before Americans must file their tax returns, the 
administration hopes to generate new support for its plan to save 
Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The new USA program would be in addition to Social Security  
retirement benefits, designed to most help low and moderate income 
workers and those who don't have pension plans on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans support a more radical plan that would divert  
money Social Security now collects from workers' paychecks into 
personal investment accounts that would ultimately replace some 
Social Security benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Democratic critics claim that the Republican proposal  
for Social Security money to be diverted into personal retirement 
accounts would weaken the government's largest benefit program. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's retirement accounts, however, are similar in some  
respects to proposals by the Senate Finance Committee chairman, 
Sen. William Roth, R-Del., and the House Budget Committee chairman, 
Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	To be eligible for Clinton's accounts, workers would have to  
earn at least $5,000 a year. The maximum $300 annual tax credit 
would be available to those earning under $40,000 a year. After 
that, it would phase out and households with over $80,000 in income 
would not be eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	Government matching contributions to the accounts would be based  
on what a worker saves on his or her own. The lowest earners would 
be entitled to a dollar-for-dollar match of their savings. That 
government match would phase down to 50 cents on the dollar for 
households with incomes of $80,000 a year and would be eliminated 
entirely at $100,000 for workers who get retirement benefits from 
their employers.

<HEADLINE> Pesek Leads at US Diving Nationals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Defending platform diving champion Kathy  
Pesek of the University of Tennessee paced the field in the 
10-meter event in the U.S. Spring National Diving Championships on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Pesek qualified ahead of Erica Sorgi, 16, of Mission Viejo,  
Calif., besting her semifinal score of 458.58 with a 466.53. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was worried about my opening dive, but once that was out of  
the way I was able to relax and everything went well,'' said Pesek, 
22, of Houston, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Pesek had good reason to worry about the opening dive, a forward  
3 1/2 somersault in a pike position. She had never performed it in a 
meet before, and the last two times she had tried it in practice, 
she nicked the board and bruised her leg. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prior to that dive was probably the most nervous I have been  
for Kathy in a long, long time,'' said her coach, Dave Parrington. 
``Just because it's been such a huge hurdle for her to get over. 
Once she got that out of the way, I knew things would go well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Also gaining a berth on the national team were Lindsay Long of  
Southern Methodist; Laura Wilkinson of Texas; Ashley Culpepper, who 
was unattached; Kim Powers, unattached; Kristen Link of Southern 
Methodist; and 16-year-old Nicole Pohorenec of Team Orlando Diving. 
</P>
<P>
	Pohorenec edged Natalia Diea of Texas by .48 for the final spot.  
</P>
<P>
	In the men's 3-meter event, the U.S. national team was  
determined as David Pichler led a group of eight qualifiers with a 
final score of 609.78. Pichler, a Fort Lauderdale native swimming 
for the Atlantic Dive Team, placed first in the quarterfinals and 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	P.J. Bogart of the Minnesota Diving Club qualified second in  
both. The other U.S. team qualifiers were Ventura, Calif., brothers 
Troy and Justin Dumais; Mark Ruiz of Team Orlando Diving; Austin, 
Texas' Mark Naftanel, unattached; John Eisler of Texas; and Mike 
Collier of Indiana. The eight national team members face off in the 
3-meter finals Saturday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Claims $197M Lottery Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRAINTREE, Mass. (AP) -- A 54-year old Chilean immigrant and  
live-in baby sitter came forward today to claim the $197 million 
Big Game jackpot, the largest individual lottery prize in U.S. 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Maria Grasso takes care of four children for Chris Gabrieli, a  
millionaire venture capitalist who made an unsuccessful bid for 
Congress last year. 
</P>
<P>
	One of six siblings, Grasso was born in Chile and came to Boston  
in 1996. She is a U.S. citizen. Her family still lives in Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	The prize, claimed by Grasso alone, makes it the largest ever  
won by an individual in the United States, according to lottery 
officials. The country's biggest jackpot was won by a group of 13 
Ohio machinists who pooled their ticket purchases and split a $295 
million Powerball jackpot in July. 
</P>
<P>
	The winning Big Game ticket was sold April 6 at a Star Market in  
Boston near Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's announcement finally put to rest rumors that the winner  
was a Nigerian immigrant cab driver. 
</P>
<P>
	The rumor mill started with Town Taxi, where drivers were  
reporting that cabbie Patrick Okusanya had won the huge jackpot. 
The speculation was further fueled when the driver didn't return to 
work after the Tuesday drawing. 
</P>
<P>
	Okusanya sought the help of an attorney to deny he was the  
winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting in February, 328 million tickets were sold in the six  
Big Game states -- Massachusetts, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, 
Michigan and Virginia, with no one winning the twice-a-week drawing 
until April 6.

<HEADLINE> Flyers' Recchi May Have Concussion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Flyers right wing Mark Recchi  
will miss at least one week of action after suffering a concussion 
in Tuesday night's game against Buffalo, doctors said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Recchi was examined Wednesday by Dr. Mark Kotapka, chief  
neurosurgeon at Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia. The Flyers' 
right wing also underwent an MRI test on his head and neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests done on Recchi for possible neurological damage were  
negative. But doctors did conclude that Recchi suffered a mild 
concussion, his second since March 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors say they will proceed with caution.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our task now is to find what's the safest thing for Mark,''  
team internist Dr. Jeff Hartzell said Wednesday night. Asked for a 
time estimate for Recchi's return, Hartzell said, ``a week at a 
minimum but that's probably too generous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recchi suffered a concussion March 22 when he missed a check and  
went head-first into the glass in a game at Toronto. Recchi missed 
three games, came back and experienced some post-concussion 
symptoms after an April 1 game against Nashville -- although the 
Flyers claimed it was only a migraine headache. 
</P>
<P>
	Recchi was hospitalized for one night in Nashville after  
complaining of nausea and dizziness. 
</P>
<P>
	He was sidelined for two more games before returning to the  
lineup last Thursday night against Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Against Buffalo, Recchi was hit twice in the head and afterward  
complained of tingling in his right hand and foot. Hartzell 
described the symptoms as ``paraseizures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not near as bad as after Nashville,'' Recchi told the  
Philadelphia Daily News on Wednesday. ``Everything is a bit less 
magnified. It's frustrating more than anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recchi said he was hit in the first period but continued to  
play. He was hit again in the second period and called it a night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously you're worried,'' he said. ``That's why we're  
getting tests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Roger Neilson said Wednesday that no time frame had been  
set for a possible return by Recchi. 
</P>
<P>
	Goalie John Vanbiesbrouck said the Flyers are doing their best  
not to think about all their injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes these injuries happen and maybe they're a stepping  
stone for something good,'' he said. ``The playoffs make players 
out of people. We've got a good core group here with good depth. 
We're hoping that somebody fills in, does well and you never know 
who could be jumping up to grab the reins.''

<HEADLINE> Minority Hires at Papers Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Little progress has been made in recent  
years to increase the number of minority journalists at daily 
newspapers, according to a study presented at the annual convention 
of the American Society of Newspaper Editors. 
</P>
<P>
	The percentage of Asian-American, black, Hispanic and American  
Indian newsroom employees increased from 11.46 in 1997 to 11.55 in 
1998, based on figures released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't sell newspapers to people if you don't reflect their  
communities,'' said N. Christian Anderson, publisher of the Orange 
County Register and incoming ASNE president. ``It's a simple 
business equation, as well as the right thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, the survey also counted female journalists,  
finding they represent about 37 percent of news staffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still think there are a lot of editors who don't understand  
the importance of diversity,'' said Nancy Baca, president of the 
National Association of Hispanic Journalists and an assistant 
features editor at the Albuquerque Journal in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also showed declines for members of minority groups  
receiving internships and getting a first full-time journalism job. 
</P>
<P>
	Catalina Camia, president of Unity: Journalists of Color, an  
alliance of Asian-American, Hispanic, black and American Indian 
journalists, found one unchanged statistic particularly troubling -- 
9 percent of newsroom supervisors are minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are the positions of real decision-making,'' said Camia,  
a Washington correspondent for the Dallas Morning News. ``Looking 
at the big picture, these numbers tell us that incredible efforts 
need to be taken if we are going to get young people of color 
interested in journalism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Tuesday session, ASNE announced a series of initiatives,  
including creation of a national talent bank listing minority 
students looking for internships or their first jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	The board of the Associated Press Managing Editors ratified the  
list of initiatives, many of which were the result of joint efforts 
by the two editors' organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	ASNE's goal is for newsrooms to reflect the racial and ethnic  
makeup of the general population by 2025.

<HEADLINE>  Starr Opposes Counsel Act Renewal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Kenneth Starr called today for abolition of  
the law that gives him authority to investigate President Clinton, 
surprising some Democratic and Republican senators who have watched 
him pursue the president aggressively for five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you live long enough, you'll experience everything,'' Sen.  
Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., said after listening to Starr defend his 
own probe but condemn the Watergate-era independent counsel law as 
flawed beyond repair. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking sometimes harsh questions from senators on the  
Governmental Affairs Committee, Starr blamed public outrage over 
his tactics on the structure of the 1978 law and a ``carnivallike 
atmosphere'' in the media. 
</P>
<P>
	``The assaults took a toll,'' Starr said, speaking in a  
detached, scholarly tone of the criticism he has endured. 
</P>
<P>
	``A duly authorized federal law-enforcement investigation came  
to be characterized as yet another political game. Law became 
politics by other means,'' Starr said. ``The impact on public 
attitudes was unmistakable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., asked whether Starr had not  
undermined his own credibility and ability to continue as 
independent counsel by issuing such a strong denunciation of the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr insisted there was no conflict in his questioning the  
wisdom of the law. And he reiterated that he retains the power to 
prosecute Clinton after the president leaves office, if warranted. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to enforce the law,'' Starr said. ``That's our  
duty. That's our obligation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Starr was testifying, White House press secretary Joe  
Lockhart told reporters, ``It will be interesting to see how he 
squares his constitutional views with the performance over the last 
five years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other Democrats also suggested it was Starr's probe, not the  
law, that was flawed. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sharp rebuke, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., an architect of the  
independent counsel law, said Starr ``managed to exceed'' the 
limits the existing law places on independent counsel 
investigations. He listed grievances including prosecutors talking 
to Monica Lewinsky about an immunity deal without her lawyer 
present, wiring Linda Tripp before receiving authorization to 
expand his investigation into the Lewinsky matter, and issuing 
subpoenas to Secret Service officers in conflict with Justice 
Department practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr said his office had legitimate reasons for each of those  
steps and was not bound by all Department of Justice decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Could you imagine a DOJ policy that there would be no  
subpoenaing of presidential tapes in Watergate?'' Starr asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who is not a Governmental Affairs  
member, issued a statement declaring Starr's remarks ``like Jack 
the Ripper calling for more neighborhood patrols because of the 
surge in victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., who chairs the committee, opened  
the hearing by praising Starr's record, noting that he collected a 
dozen guilty pleas and convictions of former Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy 
Tucker and President and Mrs. Clinton's Whitewater business 
partners, James and Susan McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr ``has weathered withering attacks, some of which were  
exceedingly personal and vituperative,'' Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The circuslike atmosphere, combined with inherent weaknesses in  
the law, Starr said, undermines the statute's intent to instill 
confidence in investigations of high-ranking government officials. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the law violates the constitutional separation of powers  
between the executive and judicial branches. And he raised concerns 
about the costs and delays incurred by many independent counsel 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The statute should not be reauthorized,'' Starr during about  
30 minutes of opening remarks. ``Jurisdiction and authority over 
these cases ought to be returned to the Justice Department.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The declaration, Starr's first on the subject, brings him into  
line with Attorney General Janet Reno and some Republicans and 
Democrats who oppose extending the statute beyond its June 30 
expiration because of spiraling costs of investigations, the 
problem of balancing the prosecutor's independence with 
accountability and the toll such inquiries wreak on witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., said he was disappointed  
that Starr supported killing the law instead of trying to fix its 
flaws to ensure that ``no government official, not even the 
president, is above the law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's 4 1/2-year inquiry of the Clintons' Whitewater real estate  
dealings and other matters has cost nearly $40 million, according 
to the congressional General Accounting Office. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's predecessor in the Clinton investigation, special  
prosecutor Robert Fiske, spent an additional $6 million. The most 
expensive independent counsel investigation to date was Lawrence 
Walsh's $48.5 million, six-year probe of the Reagan administration 
regarding its arms and money deals with Iran and its secret war 
against the communist-led government of Nicaragua. Starr is on 
track to exceed that total. 
</P>
<P>
	In 30 pages of scholarly and legalistic testimony submitted  
before his appearance, Starr said that repeated expansions of his 
probe may have contributed to the public's perception of him. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said, ``Indeed, I am as proud of our decisions not to  
bring several indictments as I am of anything else we have done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without describing them, Starr twice made apparent references to  
``now-public, gravely serious allegations'' that Clinton assaulted 
a woman 20 years ago. Clinton denies the charge.

	The move threw the nationwide vote set for Thursday into chaos,  
leaving only the favored candidate, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, in the 
running. Bouteflika is widely believed to have the support of the 
powerful military. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate reaction from the government or from  
Bouteflika. Constitutional experts said that according to the law, 
the vote would go on as planned -- with only one candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	The six candidates made their announcement in a joint statement  
after President Liamine Zeroual, a retired general, refused to meet 
them to discuss their grievances and suggested they file an 
official complaint about the alleged fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Zeroual, who is stepping down 18 months before the end of his  
five-year term, had personally guaranteed fair elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was meant to give Algeria its first civilian president  
and reconcile a nation reeling from a bloody Islamic insurgency 
that has killed 75,000 people in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	But those hopes appeared dashed after the candidates met today  
and decided not to go forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Promises for a fair election ``have not been respected on the  
ground, and so we decide on a collective withdrawal from the 
presidential election,'' they said in a statement. ``We will not 
recognize the legitimacy of this election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their complaints centered on early voting in mobile stations set  
up in the vast Sahara Desert and in special precincts set up for 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bouteflika, 63, is a former foreign minister who catapulted onto  
the campaign trail after an absence of nearly two decades, 
promising to return ``strength and dignity'' to Algeria. 
</P>
<P>
	He is widely seen as the choice of at least part of the powerful  
military establishment, the real source of power since Algeria's 
independence from France in 1962.

<HEADLINE> Bengals Likely To Try Again for QB </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Boomer Esiason. Erik Wilhelm. Todd Philcox.  
Don Hollas. David Klingler. Jay Schroeder. Jeff Blake. Neil 
O'Donnell. Paul Justin. Eric Kresser. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cincinnati Bengals have gone through 10 quarterbacks during  
their decade of misery, looking for someone to lead them to that 
elusive winning record. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they must hope No. 11 is finally the answer.  
</P>
<P>
	One of the NFL's most downtrodden teams of the '90s is ready to  
give it another try in this weekend's draft. General manager Mike 
Brown thinks his team's dismal decade -- 48-97, no winning record 
since 1990 -- can be traced to the lack of a franchise quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been a long while trying to get that spot resolved,''  
Brown said. ``This is a chance to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no sure shot here. We could pick a guy and it might  
not pan out. That's actually a high possibility, maybe even a 
probability. Nevertheless, you have to take your shot when you have 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the third overall pick on Saturday, the Bengals have a shot  
to get one of the top passing prospects: Tim Couch, Akili Smith or 
Donovan McNabb. Cleveland and Philadelphia pick ahead of them and 
will decide who's left for Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals figure they can't go wrong with any of the three.  
</P>
<P>
	``We think all are worthy picks,'' Brown said. ``No one knows  
how well they'll do, but they all have earned the chance to be 
picked highly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals have plenty of glaring needs -- a cornerback,  
offensive linemen, defensive linemen -- but Brown is convinced the 
quarterback makes the difference. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you have a good quarterback, a team can ride on him for  
years,'' Brown said. ``If you look at the standings, almost always 
the teams with productive quarterbacks win; those whose 
quarterbacks are not productive don't win. 
</P>
<P>
	``So while you want to have good players at every position, you  
can have that, but if you don't have a quarterback, you won't get 
there. And you can have a quarterback and not have the other (good 
players), and still get there. But you have to have that guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals thought Klingler was that guy when they made him the  
sixth overall choice in 1992 even though they had Esiason, who led 
them to the Super Bowl in the 1988 season. Klingler didn't work 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	Thrown in behind a weak offensive line, Klingler was sacked a  
team-record 10 times by Pittsburgh in his debut as a rookie. He got 
worn down by all the losing and never figured out how to make the 
offense work. 
</P>
<P>
	He wasn't alone, as the long list of quarterbacks in the '90s  
demonstrates. Blake, acquired off waivers from the New York Jets in 
1994, succeeded Klingler and played in the Pro Bowl after the 1995 
season, but couldn't hold the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year alone, the Bengals went through four quarterbacks --  
O'Donnell, Blake, Justin and Kresser. All four are under contract 
for 1999, but the Bengals are leaning toward keeping Blake as the 
starter while the newcomer develops. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a chance to get one who could really be our bell cow  
player for the next decade,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Or, he could be the next Klingler, because the current offensive  
line isn't that much better at protecting the passer. 
</P>
<P>
	A frightening fact for the next quarterback: O'Donnell, Blake  
and Kresser all broke their passing hands last season and Justin 
severely bruised his hand. 
</P>
<P>
	When Paul Brown founded the Bengals, he made an offensive  
lineman, center Bob Johnson, the team's first-ever draft pick. 
During the 1990s, the line has been overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati has had 40 draft picks from the first through the  
fourth rounds in the '90s, and only five of them have been 
offensive linemen. Tackle Willie Anderson was a first-round pick in 
1996, and the other four came in the third or fourth rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The second round could be a good time to go after an offensive  
lineman, but the Bengals also desperately need a cornerback. 
They've been fairly successful in the second round -- Carl Pickens, 
Darnay Scott and Corey Dillon all were drafted there -- because they 
haven't necessarily targeted a position. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've always had really good luck in taking the best player  
around. There always seems to be somebody who slips to the second 
round,'' said Jim Lippincott, director of pro/college personnel. 
``So I don't look for us to lock ourselves into anything in the 
second round, unless there's a cornerback who's attractive to us.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks $300 Tax Credits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today unveiled his  
long-awaited plan to distribute $300 tax credits to millions of 
working Americans so they can set up new personal investment 
accounts for retirement. ``It is the kind of tax cut America 
needs,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials said the plan would provide the annual  
tax credit for workers to invest in personal savings accounts 
similar to 401(k) plans that many businesses now offer their 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Clinton would provide up to $700 for a couple  
filing a joint return as a government match to money they save on 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe Americans who work hard their entire lives, and  
raise their children, should not have their retirements poised 
precariously on the edge of poverty,'' Clinton said. ``I believe 
that Americans, however, have to do more to save for their own 
future. But Americans deserve the chance to do that. '' 
</P>
<P>
	Under an example provided by the administration, a low- or  
moderate-income couple eligible for the maximum benefits could 
qualify for an upfront tax credit of $300 per person, for a maximum 
of $600 for the family. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, if husband and wife each put $350 of income into a  
savings plan, they could qualify for the government to match those 
savings, dollar for dollar. So, the $700 put in by the couple would 
be matched by $700 from the government, for total government 
contribution of $1,300. 
</P>
<P>
	This $1,300 maximum would apply generally to families earning  
under $40,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton first proposed the accounts in his State of the Union  
speech in January, as part of his overall plan for using $4.8 
trillion in projected government surpluses expected over the next 
15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But the administration has struggled since that time to come up  
with details of its savings program, which Clinton has dubbed 
Universal Savings Accounts. Clinton and other administration 
officials were scheduled to unveil the proposal at a White House 
ceremony today. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton sees the plan as a way to blunt a Republican drive in  
Congress for much broader income tax relief. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and  
Means Committee, said Clinton's overall budget ``raises taxes on 
some Americans to give tax cuts to others, which divides our 
country and isn't fair.'' Nevertheless, Archer applauded the idea 
of using private accounts to boost retirement savings. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's plan is targeted to low- and middle-income workers:  
The government matching money for a worker's own savings would 
begin to phase out at household incomes around $40,000. Workers 
earning more than $100,000 would, for the most part, not be 
eligible for the program unless they don't have any retirement plan 
through work. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration estimates that about 124 million American  
workers would qualify for some benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's budget projects that the accounts would cost $96  
billion through 2004 and $536 billion through 2014 -- using up about 
12 percent of the surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has proposed that the bulk of the long-term surplus --  
about 77 percent -- go to bolster Social Security and Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's framework for rescuing the federal retirement  
programs, however, has come under heavy Republic criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	By unveiling the details of the targeted tax relief today, one  
day before Americans must file their tax returns, the 
administration hopes to generate new support for its plan to save 
Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The new USA program would be in addition to Social Security  
retirement benefits, designed to most help low and moderate income 
workers and those who don't have pension plans on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans support a more radical plan that would divert  
money Social Security now collects from workers' paychecks into 
personal investment accounts that would ultimately replace some 
Social Security benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Democratic critics claim that the Republican proposal  
for Social Security money to be diverted into personal retirement 
accounts would weaken the government's largest benefit program. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's retirement accounts, however, are similar in some  
respects to proposals by the Senate Finance Committee chairman, 
Sen. William Roth, R-Del., and the House Budget Committee chairman, 
Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	To be eligible for Clinton's accounts, workers would have to  
earn at least $5,000 a year. The maximum $300 annual tax credit 
would be available to those earning under $40,000 a year. After 
that, it would phase out and households with over $80,000 in income 
would not be eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	Government matching contributions to the accounts would be based  
on what a worker saves on his or her own. The lowest earners would 
be entitled to a dollar-for-dollar match of their savings. That 
government match would phase down to 50 cents on the dollar for 
households with incomes of $80,000 a year and would be eliminated 
entirely at $100,000 for workers who get retirement benefits from 
their employers.

<HEADLINE> Study: Tobacco Ads Influence Teens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three heavily advertised cigarette brands --  
Marlboro, Newport and Camel -- are the most popular choice among 
teen-agers who smoked last year, according to a study released 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, commissioned by the Department of Health and Human  
Services, found that 88 percent of 12th-grade smokers puffed on 
those three brands in 1998. Among 10th- and eighth-graders, the 
figures were 86 percent and 82 percent, respectively. It is illegal 
for anyone under 18 to buy tobacco products. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore was unveiling the study today at a ``Kick  
Butts Day'' anti-smoking rally at Roswell Kent Middle School in 
Akron, Ohio. He said the figures underscore the need to require 
tobacco companies to bear the cost of teaching young people not to 
develop a smoking habit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our children are targets of a massive media campaign to hook  
them on cigarettes,'' Gore said. ``This study shows why Congress 
should stand with our kids and stand up to the tobacco companies. 
Let's act now to make sure tobacco settlement funds are used to 
reduce teen smoking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco industry spokesman Scott Williams said tobacco companies  
have not targeted young people, for doing so would violate the 
settlement they reached with the states in 1997, which requires the 
industry to devote $1.45 billion over five years to tobacco 
education. He said young people are attracted to popular cigarettes 
just as they are drawn to any other popular product. 
</P>
<P>
	``You look at the most heavily advertised car, the most heavily  
advertised sneaker, the most heavily advertised gum, and they would 
lead the list,'' Williams said. ``The industry's position is that 
kids should not smoke, and they're doing what they can. These kinds 
of attacks don't address the problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the teen smokers surveyed, Marlboro was the most popular  
of the three favorite brands. It was the cigarette of choice among 
60 percent of smokers at all three grade levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventy percent of white 12th-grade smokers said they preferred  
Marlboro, while about 80 percent of black 12th-grade smokers chose 
Newport, a brand heavily marketed to black Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was conducted among 2,048 eight-graders, 2,708  
10th-graders and 2,335 12th-graders. A date for the study and 
margin of error were not provided. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore also highlighted a study by the Campaign for Tobacco Free  
Kids that showed 75 percent of children and 31 percent of adults 
indicated they had seen tobacco advertising in the previous two 
weeks. Of those, 69 percent of children said they recalled seeing 
ads for Marlboro cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign's study was conducted April 7-11 with 514  
teen-agers and 1,008 adults, with margins of error of 4.4 
percentage points and 3.1 percentage points, respectively.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Up 47.73 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices were mixed Wednesday as investors,  
sensing an improvement in overseas economies, picked up 
manufacturing issues and sold off consumer products shares. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
47.73 at 10,442.74. On Tuesday, the Dow hit its second straight 
closing high, rising 55.50 to 10,395.01. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mixed. The technology-heavy Nasdaq

points in earlier trading. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 
2.19 at 1,347.63. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer stocks were among the big losers today as investors  
seemed to be favoring economically sensitive issues such as 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	Procter &AMP; Gamble was down 3 at 99 7/8, and Johnson &AMP; Johnson fell  
1 5/8 at 97. Both are Dow components.

<P>
	But International Paper, another Dow stock, was up 4 1/8 at 52 3/4.

	Investors are returning to manufacturing stocks amid the growing  
belief that the world economy is recovering, said Peter Canelo, 
U.S. investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. Threats 
of a world-wide recession had ``really (been) the killer for these 
export-sensitive industrial based companies,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings continued to affect individual stocks.  
</P>
<P>
	J.P. Morgan soared 7 1/4 to 136 9/16, after the bank holding  
company's first-quarter earnings were nearly double what analysts 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel was down 2 1/16 at 58 7/16. The computer chip maker  
reported first-quarter net earnings 2 cents above analysts' 
expectations late Tuesday, but said second-quarter sales might be 
soft. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola was up 1 3/8 at 84 5/16 on the Big Board after the company  
reported late Tuesday it had beaten analysts' earnings expectations 
by 4 cents a share.

<P>
	And shares of Seagate Technology Inc. were up 2 1/4 at 28 7/8 after  
topping third-quarter estimates by 3 cents a share.

<HEADLINE> Kevorkian Starts Hunger Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Dr. Jack Kevorkian says he will refuse to eat  
while imprisoned on his murder conviction, and a new jail policy 
prevents him from being force-fed. 
</P>
<P>
	The assisted-suicide advocate, sentenced Tuesday to 10 to 25  
years in prison, said he would begin a hunger strike immediately, 
The Oakland Press reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know they are going to force-feed me, but my captivity is  
still enslavement, and I am not going to go along with it,'' 
Kevorkian said. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not known Wednesday whether he followed through.  
</P>
<P>
	State prison officials said they reversed their policy on  
force-feeding Tuesday, the same day the 70-year-old retired 
pathologist was sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
	The change came after state lawyers realized the previous policy  
requiring force-feeding of an inmate was contrary to a 1996 state 
court order that banned a prison from feeding a man against his 
will. 
</P>
<P>
	Michigan Department of Corrections spokesman Matt Davis said the  
policy change had nothing to do with Kevorkian. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian attorney Mayer Morganroth questioned the timing of the  
policy change. 
</P>
<P>
	``Isn't that assisted suicide?'' he asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``That certainly appears to be a knee-jerk reaction to our  
client or they would have done it before,'' Morganroth said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian was convicted of second degree murder for injecting  
Thomas Youk, 52, with a lethal dose of chemicals on in September at 
Youk's request. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian, who says he has helped 130 people kill themselves  
since 1990, sent a videotape of the death of the Lou Gehrig's 
patient to ``60 Minutes,'' hoping to force the issue of assisted 
suicide into the limelight. 
</P>
<P>
	The tape and the show's interview with Kevorkian were the  
prosecution's main evidence. Kevorkian has been tried in the past, 
but the trials ended in acquittals and one mistrial.

<HEADLINE> Teams Wonder: Is Collins Worth Risk? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Cecil Collins is so good at running the  
football that he could be a first-round draft pick Saturday, 
although he played in just six college games. 
</P>
<P>
	Instinct and a muscle-packed body that seems almost designed for  
the game make it look easy for him to punch through defenses, 
sprint downfield, score touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	He's so good that teams may even be willing to overlook his  
off-field problems: failed drug tests, two felony convictions and 
the four years of probation he's currently serving. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got first-round ability,'' New Orleans Saints director of  
college scouting Bruce Lemmerman said. ``You can't deny his 
talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nobody denies Collins' ability. What worries them is when he  
leaves the football field. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins played three games for LSU in 1997 that electrified  
football fans, rushing for 583 yards on 69 carries. But he made 
just three carries in his fourth game against Vanderbilt before 
breaking his right leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins never suited up for the Tigers again.  
</P>
<P>
	He was kicked off the team last June 25 after he was arrested  
and charged with barging into an apartment and fondling a young 
woman. He was arrested again July 8 on similar charges. 
</P>
<P>
	As talented as he was, Collins had trouble finding another  
college team to play for. McNeese State finally took a chance, but 
kicked him out Sept. 15 after Collins failed a court-ordered drug 
test. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins spent a month in jail and two months in a halfway house.  
His college career was over, but maybe not his football career. 
</P>
<P>
	In a deal worked out with prosecutors, Collins plead guilty to  
two misdemeanors and two felonies and was given probation, 
reassuring NFL teams he won't be in jail instead of on the practice 
field. 
</P>
<P>
	But will Collins stay out of trouble from now on? With the  
memory of Lawrence Phillips, the sixth overall pick in 1996 and a 
washout as a pro, so fresh, will pro teams gamble on Collins? 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an interesting player,'' said Miami's Jimmy Johnson, one  
of the coaches reportedly interested in Collins. ``He has as much 
risk as any high-profile guy that has come around in a long time. 
But if you're picking late in the first round, there's going to be 
risk with every player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was one of the people willing to take a look at Phillips  
after he flopped with St. Louis. But Phillips didn't stay out of 
trouble as a Dolphin, either, and was released. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, 5-foot-10, 208 pounds, worked with a personal trainer  
when he got out of jail in January. At the NFL Combine in 
Indianapolis, he clocked a 4.41 in the 40-yard dash after only six 
weeks of training. 
</P>
<P>
	Three weeks later, Collins was doing private auditions for a  
dozen NFL teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just thank the Lord and the NFL for giving me another  
chance,'' said Collins, who said he spent his jail time reading the 
Bible. ``I plan to show everyone what I can do, the kind of athlete 
I am. I'm going to work hard and do things right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins, with his ready smile and bubbling sense of humor, is a  
likable person with exceptional talent and a solid work ethic on 
the field, according to those who know him. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he hit the practice field, he had only one speed, and  
that was full speed,'' said McNeese running backs coach John Nagle. 
</P>
<P>
	Off the field, Collins had long flouted rules.  
</P>
<P>
	``He probably always got a little extra leeway,'' said Danny  
Smith, Collins' high school coach who used to drive Collins to 
school every morning. ``You have a player like that, you're going 
to take care of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins follows in the footsteps of other players with talent  
and troubles. Randy Moss wasn't taken until the 21st pick of last 
year's draft because teams couldn't ignore his problems as a 
teen-ager. He went on to be selected an All-Pro and Offensive 
Rookie of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Randy Moss, you knew he was a heck of a player,'' Johnson  
said. ``With Cecil, you've got to be concerned with everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collins has proclaimed himself a changed man. The attorneys who  
represented him on criminal charges agree. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cecil has been drug-tested every week since October and has  
been clean every time,'' said Rodney Baum, one of Collins' 
attorneys. ``He's done everything we asked him. He's acknowledged 
his wrongdoing and he's ready to move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the weekly drug-testing, Collins must remain in  
counseling and refrain from using drugs and alcohol for the four 
years he's on probation. Smith said he thought if an older player 
would take Collins under his wing, it would keep him out of 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Collins is counting on a jail-house conversion and lessons  
learned from the past year to keep him straight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I intend to do the right thing,'' Collins said after his court  
date. ``I'm glad to have another chance, and I'm going to make the 
most of it.''

<HEADLINE>  Quayle Declares for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Former Vice President Dan Quayle,  
calling the 1990s ``the dishonest decade of Bill Clinton and Al 
Gore,'' launched his presidential campaign today by pledging to 
restore integrity and responsibility to the White House in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prosperity without values is no prosperity at all,'' Quayle  
told a cheering crowd of more than 5,000 at his former high school. 
Fireworks, rock music and bellows of ``Q2K!'' made his the most 
festive presidential announcement speech so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first bid for elective office since President Clinton  
toppled the Bush-Quayle ticket six years ago, the former Indiana 
senator sought to both attack Gore -- the potential Democratic 
nominee who succeeded Quayle as vice president -- and acquit himself 
for casting a white-hot spotlight on the family-values debate in 
the 1992 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle was criticized by Democrats and mocked by late-night  
comics for questioning the morality of a TV sitcom character in May 
1992. ``Murphy Brown is gone,'' Quayle now says, ``and I'm still 
here fighting for the American family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Working only from notes, Quayle varied frequently from a  
prepared text given to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	He derided Gore for being the president's chief defender during  
the impeachment saga, accusing the pair of showing ``contempt for 
the values parents try to teach their children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are coming to the end of the dishonest decade of Bill  
Clinton and Al Gore, and America needs a fresh start,'' Quayle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle promoted his proposed 30 percent across-the-board tax  
cut, billing it as a boon to middle-income families. 
</P>
<P>
	And he portrayed himself as the best qualified potential  
commander-in-chief, recalling his participation in White House war 
councils and his service on foreign policy committees in the House 
and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't learn foreign policy from briefing books or crash  
courses,'' Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
	He accused Clinton and Gore of compromising U.S. sovereignty,  
starving the armed forces' budgets and using the military ``as a 
laboratory for their social experiments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the sting of Quayle's remarks went beyond the  
administration. Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the early favorite for 
the GOP nomination, is getting scores of private briefings to bone 
up on foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
	And aides would not say whether Quayle was targeting Bush or  
Gore when he declared: ``A presidential nomination is not something 
that is inherited. It must be earned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their silence suggested that the line was written with both in  
mind; Gore is Clinton's choice to win in 2000, and Bush is the son 
of the former president. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle, 52, is a longshot for the nomination despite his  
popularity among grassroots activists. 
</P>
<P>
	He joins a crowded field of social conservative candidates  
wrestling over the same votes. His campaign team has come together 
slowly. And he raised about $2 million in the first quarter of 1999 
-- $1 million less than projected. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's largest obstacle is what one supporter calls the  
``potato factor'' -- a reference to the day he misspelled the word 
in a classroom full of school children. That and other gaffes 
turned the vice president into a punchline for countless jokes, 
cementing for many Americans the perception that Quayle was 
ill-suited for the job. 
</P>
<P>
	His supporters argue that Quayle will easily exceed those low  
expectations to sneak up on Bush, who they say can't live up to his 
early billing. If the former vice president can emerge from Iowa 
and New Hampshire as the choice of social conservatives, his 
miscues would fade from memory in the showdown against Bush, 
supporters say. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Americans will begin to see a rejuvenated Dan Quayle  
with great campaign skills,'' said Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind. 
``George Bush has done a good job of building interest, but now he 
has the tough job of rising to those expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle has lost key supporters to Bush, including former aides  
David Beckwith and Al Hubbard. Hubbard, how helping Bush recruit 
policy experts, subscribes to a widespread belief that Quayle would 
be in better position today if he had run for Indiana governor in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would have been a great governor and could have shown  
people that he can be a great chief executive officer,'' Hubbard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbard is not the only Indiana Republican with doubts about  
Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
	State GOP chairman Mike McDaniel has yet to endorse a GOP  
presidential candidate, which is not a good sign for favorite son 
Quayle, a 1965 graduate of Huntington High School who now lives in 
Phoenix. Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith is a top Bush 
adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	``People in our party are hungry to win this presidential  
election, and I think some of them, even though they probably agree 
with 98 percent of everything Dan Quayle says, wonder if he can win 
or not because of the image that he portrays,'' McDaniel said. 
</P>
<P>
	In their recent retreat, some Republican state chairmen used the  
term ``Quayle-ized'' to describe the fate facing Gore if jokes 
persist about his political miscues. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle believes he has found a way to deal with the perception  
problem: Portray the ridicule as a trial by fire, an example of how 
he could withstand the pressures of the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know the term (the GOP chairmen) used,'' Quayle told  
The Associated Press before today's address. ``But my advice to 
Gore is to lighten up and enjoy it. If he shows this is really 
getting to him, if he can't handle this, he won't even come close 
to handling the presidency.''

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Tests Nuke-Capable Missile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistan test fired its newest  
ballistic missile that is capable of carrying a nuclear warhead and 
hitting deep inside its neighbor and rival India. 
</P>
<P>
	The eight-minute test flight of the Ghauri II took place in  
Dina, 37 miles east of the Pakistani capital of Islamabad, 
government officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ghauri II, an advanced version of a previously tested  
ballistic missile, has a range of 1,240 miles, making it the 
longest-range missile in Pakistan's arsenal, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	It can carry a payload of 2,200 pounds of either conventional or  
nuclear explosives. 
</P>
<P>
	The governments of both Pakistan and India tried to ease  
concerns of an escalating arms races in South Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pakistan does not want a nuclear and missile race in South  
Asia,'' said a statement issued by Pakistan's Foreign Ministry 
after the test. 
</P>
<P>
	India's Foreign Minister Jaswant Singh, reacting to the  
Pakistani test, said, ``There is no arms race in South Asia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif congratulated the  
country's scientists on today's ``successful'' test. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole nation has reason to be proud,'' said Sharif, who  
spoke to reporters at a Pakistani naval base in southwestern 
Baluchistan Province on the Arabian Sea Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ghauri II was launched from a mobile launcher and is an  
advanced version of a previously tested ballistic missile, Sharif 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents of the Pakistani capital handed out sweets, a  
traditional means of celebrating, and offered each other 
congratulations as news spread of the missile test. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a better missile than India and we can fire it  
whenever we want,'' said Ghulam Chaudhry, head of a local 
businessman's association in the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	In other countries, however, the testing was greeted with  
concern. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement issued by the Japanese foreign ministry bemoaned the  
testing by both Pakistan and India saying ``the missile testing 
could be detrimental to peace and stability in the region.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow also expressed concern about Pakistan's missile test  
saying it could ``trigger a race of nuclear missile armaments in 
Asia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The test was not a surprise, with analysts anticipating Pakistan  
would respond to the test of the Agni II missile conducted Sunday 
by India. The Agni II has about the same range and payload capacity 
as Pakistan's Ghauri II. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government had been under  
considerable pressure, including from his own army chief, to answer 
India's missile test with a test of its own. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the back-to-back missile tests by the South Asian  
neighbors were likely to fuel an arms race on the subcontinent. 
</P>
<P>
	But a foreign ministry statement following the test said  
``Pakistan does not want a nuclear and missile race in South 
Asia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were unconfirmed reports that Pakistan was preparing to  
test its Shaheen missile in the next two days. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan has two versions of the missile waiting to be tested:  
the Shaheen, with a range of 465 miles; and the Shaheen II, an 
advanced version, with a range of 1,430 miles. Both are capable of 
carrying a 2,200-pound payload of nuclear or conventional warheads. 
</P>
<P>
	According to newspaper reports, India was notified Tuesday of  
Pakistan's plans to test fire the missile. This was in line with an 
agreement Sharif and Indian Prime Minister Atal Vihari Vajpayee 
signed in February to give prior warning of missile tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement was signed as part of a package to reduce tensions  
between the South Asian neighbors, both of whom exploded 
underground nuclear devices last year. 
</P>
<P>
	With the underground tests, India and Pakistan declared  
themselves nuclear powers -- generating fears that the next step 
would be the development of a nuclear weapons arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan says it doesn't want to embark on an arms race, but  
won't be left behind if India begins developing nuclear arms. 
</P>
<P>
	The two countries have fought three wars in the past 51 years  
and their new nuclear status has caused many world leaders to 
express a fear that another confrontation between Pakistan and 
India could escalate into a nuclear war.

<HEADLINE> Pedestrians Unhurt After Car Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A car smashed through a metal barrier at a  
parking garage Wednesday and fell seven stories, narrowly missing 
people on a crowded sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was injured and the car's driver -- 30-year-old Ami Lynn  
Johnson from Steubenville, Ohio -- was in stable condition at an 
area hospital after being treated for eye and bone injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think people were pretty much amazed that she survived, let  
alone didn't have severe injuries,'' Police Cmdr. William Valenta 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident happened at noon in a parking garage where  
sidewalks were bustling with workers on their lunch breaks. Johnson 
told investigators she was pulling into a parking space when the 
brakes on her 1980 Buick Century failed, Valenta said. 
</P>
<P>
	A motorist who was nearby told officers that the Buick appeared  
to slow down before it suddenly accelerated and plunged through the 
barrier. 
</P>
<P>
	The car hit a traffic light as it fell and landed on the  
sidewalk on the driver's side, collapsing the roof. Witnesses said 
it narrowly missed a man walking past, along with a bus and a car 
entering the garage. 
</P>
<P>
	Charges are not expected to be brought against Johnson, Valenta  
said.

<HEADLINE> Supply News Sinks Gasoline Futures  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Gasoline and other energy futures took a dive Wednesday on the  
New York Mercantile Exchange in large part due to reports that 
supplies are much larger than expected. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, live hog futures retreated, while soybean and  
grain futures advanced. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say the energy market -- particularly traders of  
gasoline futures -- was reacting to the American Petroleum 
Institute's release late Tuesday of its weekly inventory figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants had been betting gasoline supplies would  
fall as much as 2 million barrels. But the API report showed that 
U.S. crude oil stocks rose 1.039 million barrels last week to 
343.191 million barrels. Gasoline stocks rose 3.066 million barrels 
to 218.506 million barrels. Refineries operated at 96.8 percent 
capacity, up from 94.8 the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overall, we had roughly an 8 million barrel increase in the  
inventory of our liquids that burn,'' said Tim Evans, an energy 
analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Tallies by the Department of Energy confirmed the  
larger-than-anticipated supplies -- a blow to the market as trading 
began Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans said there have been signs that those who buy gasoline  
from wholesalers bought up big when prices started to rise last 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	``Distributors, retailers decided it was really a good time to  
fill up the tanks,'' Evans said. ``Now they're in the position to 
live off the inventory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also noted that demand from consumers appears to be lagging a  
bit. 
</P>
<P>
	``This absence of demand probably doesn't represent an actual  
shift in miles driven,'' he said, adding that some folks with sport 
utility vehicles and other gas guzzlers may be opting to driver 
smaller cars, if they have them. 
</P>
<P>
	While crude and heating oil futures finished down, Evans said  
technical factors softened their drop. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil for May delivery fell 25 cents to $16.47 a barrel; May  
unleaded gasoline dropped 1.40 cents to 50.84 cents a gallon; May 
heating oil fell .65 cent to 42.15 cents a gallon; May natural gas 
fell .4 cent to $2.096 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Some analysts had expected hog futures to settle higher since  
packers have been willing to pay more for hogs amid good profit 
margins. But traders proved to be jittery Wednesday as live hogs 
finished the day lower -- with some contracts down more than a cent 
on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``Demand for pork loins is usually higher in the spring and hog  
slaughter tends to be at its lowest levels,'' said Dan Vaught, a 
livestock analyst for AG Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``So you usually get a rally. But everyone's trying to figure  
out just how big that rally will be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said there are fears that the summer hog contracts are  
trading at too high a premium, compared with the cash market. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Wednesday, June live cattle fell .72 cent to 63.60  
cents a pound; May feeder cattle fell 1.02 cents to 71.90 cents a 
pound; June lean hogs fell 1.43 cents to 53.92 cents a pound; and 
May pork bellies fell .55 cent to 51.97 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, grain and soybean futures prices settled higher on  
the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in the day, soybean and wheat for May delivery shot higher  
than 4 cents a bushel but settled at 4 cents and 2 3/4 cents, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts attributed the jump to continued reports of cold  
weather in Argentina and the Plains states. 
</P>
<P>
	There also are predictions of more-than-average rainfall in the  
Plains states, making planting difficult. The foul weather could 
damage winter wheat crops -- particularly hard red wheat -- though 
crops in Texas and Oklahoma are considered mature enough to avoid 
permanent damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn futures also were up, though not as much, in what some said  
was a residual effect of the soybean and wheat rally, as well as 
Tuesday's reports of steady export business from the U.S. 
Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading Wednesday, wheat for May delivery was up 2 3/4 cents to  
$2.58 3/4 a bushel; May corn rose 1 1/2 cents to $2.17 1/2 a bushel; May 
oats rose 2 cents to $1.16 3/4 a bushel; and May soybeans were up 4 
cents to $4.89 1/4 a bushel.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets closed mostly higher  
Wednesday, with some bourses making impressive gains on the back of 
Wall Street's latest record finish, but a few fell as their recent 
rallies ran out of steam. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, prices rose moderately. Shares fell early on worries  
over earnings at high-technology companies but rebounded amid 
speculation that public pension fund money will flow into the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 49.52  
points, or 0.87 percent, closing at 16,764.68. On Tuesday, the 
index rose 207.76 points, or 1.26 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	On currency dealings, the U.S. dollar fell against the Japanese  
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In late trading, the dollar bought 119.19 yen, down 1.17 yen  
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level 
of 119.83 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong shares fell, reversing gains from the previous day  
amid concerns that Wall Street's recent rally had about run its 
course. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue-chip Hang Seng Index closed down 0.5 percent, or 65.56  
points, at 11,834.13. The Hang Seng had risen 1.3 percent Tuesday 
and is up by more than 8 percent this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders had been motivated by lower local interest rates and  
rallies on other major stock markets, including New York and Tokyo, 
but by Wednesday they found no news to motivate any buying. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average in New York had  
gained 55.50 points to close at 10,395.01, yet another record. 
</P>
<P>
	Australia's key index chimed in by closing at its own record  
high, led by strong gains in shares in the country's four largest 
banks. The All Ordinaries index closed up 0.4 percent, or 11.9 
points, at 3,088.2 points, the day's high. 
</P>
<P>
	In Singapore, the key index surged above the key 1,700-point  
support level to an 18-month high on Wall Street's strength and 
heavy institutional buying. 
</P>
<P>
	The Straits Times Index rose 22.75 points, or 1.4 percent, to  
1,702.73. 
</P>
<P>
	In Manila, strong gains in bank and property shares also lifted  
the key index to its highest close since May, as interest rate cuts 
announced Monday spurred hopes of a quick turnaround in the 
economy. The PSE index rose 10.77 points, or 0.5 percent, closing 
at 2,168.41. 
</P>
<P>
	Taipei's key index also reached a 20-week high, spurred by  
strong buying in financial shares on expectations of more banks 
mergers as the government tries to ease competition and boost bank 
earnings. The Weighted Price Index gained 60.80 points, or 0.8 
percent, to 7,398.65. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kuala Lumpur, shares fell after a seesaw trading session amid  
jitters over the sentencing of former Finance Minister Anwar 
Ibrahim to six years in prison on corruption charges, which 
prompted sporadic street riots. The 100-company Composite index 
fell 6.52 points, or 1.12 percent, to 578.11. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said government funds were seen supporting the market,  
probably in an effort to keep the index steady in such a 
politically charged atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	A guilty verdict was widely anticipated, but many stock market  
dealers said they were surprised by the severity of the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  Judge Sentences Kevorkian to Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Dr. Jack Kevorkian's crusade for assisted  
suicide began nine years ago in the back of his rusted Volkswagen 
van. There, an Alzheimer's patient from Oregon pushed a button on 
the retired pathologist's ``suicide machine'' and lethal drugs 
flowed into her veins. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian has skirted the law and taunted its enforcers ever  
since, helping 130 people take their own lives. He left bodies in 
the middle of the night at motels, others at hospital emergency 
rooms. He burned state orders against him, showed up at court in 
costume and challenged authorities to do something about it. On 
Tuesday, they finally did. 
</P>
<P>
	``You had the audacity to go on national television, show the  
world what you did and dare the legal system to stop you,'' said 
Judge Jessica Cooper. ``Well, sir, consider yourself stopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper sentenced Kevorkian to 10 to 25 years in prison for the  
second-degree murder of Thomas Youk, a Lou Gehrig's patient whom 
Kevorkian videotaped as he injected him with a lethal cocktail of 
chemicals on Sept. 17. The videotape was later broadcast on CBS's 
``60 Minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My husband had come to the end of his life as he chose to,''  
Melody Youk said as she pleaded for a lenient sentence. ``He was 
not depressed. He was not a victim. He requested Dr. Kevorkian's 
help and was grateful for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper also sentenced Kevorkian to three to seven years for  
delivery of a controlled substance. The sentences will run 
concurrently, and Kevorkian will be eligible for parole after six 
years and eight months, a prosecutor said. Kevorkian, who turns 71 
next month, could have gotten life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian's supporters said the sentence would intensify the  
debate over euthanasia and assisted suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to spark more debate and discussion on the  
end of life issue,'' said Nicholle McClelland, spokeswoman for the 
Oregon-based Hemlock Society. ``This was not murder, this was a 
very compassionate act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian told The Oakland Press of Pontiac that he will begin a  
hunger strike immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know they are going to force-feed me, but my captivity is  
still enslavement, and I am not going to go along with it,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The state on Monday changed its policy regarding force-feeding  
of prisoners, saying it is prohibited by court order from doing so. 
Kevorkian attorney Mayer Morganroth refused today to confirm 
whether his client was eating, and Corrections Department spokesman 
Matt Davis said prison officials ``don't pay attention to the 
eating habits of any particular prisoner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. McClelland said laws against assisted suicide should be on  
trial, not Kevorkian. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is another example ... that the law needs to change to  
allow for physician-assisted dying,'' she said. ``Dr. Jack 
Kevorkian is one of those responsible for making the movement so 
strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But opponents said the sentence was long overdue. Members of Not  
Dead Yet, a disabled rights group, celebrated the end of what one 
called Kevorkian's ``killing spree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Jack Kevorkian has been killing members of the disabled  
community for years and has been getting away with it,'' said Cal 
Montgomery. ``I hope this is the end of the euthanasia movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Archdiocese of Detroit issued a statement, saying  
Kevorkian's ```final solution' approach to pain management has been 
an unconscionable exploitation of the natural ambivalence to death 
and suffering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence, said archdiocese spokesman Ned McGrath, leaves  
``no doubt that society will neither authorize physicians to kill 
nor look the other way if they do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Cooper offered her take on the impact of the sentence,  
telling Kevorkian the debate over assisted suicide will continue 
``long after this trial and your activities fade from public 
memory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his death, Youk, 52, was confined to a  
wheelchair, had a feeding tube installed in his stomach and was 
afraid of choking on his own saliva. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical examiners considered the death suspicious. But they had  
little to go on -- until Kevorkian sent the videotape to ``60 
Minutes.'' The tape and the show's interview with Kevorkian were 
the prosecution's main evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first murder trial for Kevorkian, who says he has  
been involved in 130 deaths since 1990, and the first time he was 
found guilty of taking part in a death. His previous trials, all on 
assisted-suicide charges, resulted in three acquittals and a 
mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	In past cases, Kevorkian said his patients used his homemade  
devices to start the flow of carbon monoxide or intravenous 
chemicals that caused their death. In Youk's case, Kevorkian 
administered the injection. 
</P>
<P>
	Geoffrey Fieger, Kevorkian's brash legal bulldog for much of the  
past nine years, refused to defend him, claiming Kevorkian had 
turned a corner to self-destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian insisted on representing himself at his short trial,  
where he gave an impassioned but ineffective defense interrupted 
often by prosecutors' objections. 
</P>
<P>
	``Honestly now, do you see a criminal? Do you see a murderer?''  
Kevorkian asked the jury. ``If you do, then you must convict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian was taken to the state prison at Jackson, where  
officials will evaluate him and determine whether to send him to a 
minimum-, medium- or maximum-security prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Morganroth predicted the conviction will be reversed on appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think as far as he's concerned he thinks that what he did  
was proper,'' he said. ``He knew the risks, and in order to move 
the process he took the risks.''

<HEADLINE> Clemens Seeks Share of AL Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Mike Mussina has been in this situation before.  
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Mussina stopped Randy Johnson's 16-game winning  
streak one short of the American League record. Tonight, Mussina 
faces the Yankees' Roger Clemens as he shoots for No. 17 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I'm pitching against the Yankees, in Yankee Stadium,  
against Roger Clemens going for the AL record, but I still have to 
pitch my game,'' Mussina said. ``If I get too juiced up, I won't be 
able to do what I have to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rocket, who has gone nearly 11 months without a loss, can  
tie the AL record held by Johnny Allen of Cleveland and Dave 
McNally of Baltimore. Carl Hubbell of the New York Giants holds the 
major league record of 24 straight wins. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing to talk about,'' Clemens said. ``It is what it  
is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What it is an amazing run by one of baseball's best pitchers.  
After beginning last season 5-6 for Toronto, Clemens hasn't lost 
since last May 29, a span of 24 starts. At the age of 36, he 
continues to overpower hitters, posting a 2.26 ERA during the 
streak and winning his fifth Cy Young award after last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't remember a power pitcher other than Nolan Ryan who  
could throw so hard for so long,'' said Orioles bullpen coach Elrod 
Hendricks, who caught McNally during his streak in 1968-69. ``Even 
(Tom) Seaver had to learn how to conserve energy as he got older. 
Clemens doesn't give a damn about that. He still rears back, throws 
hard and has high pitch counts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Clemens' success is triggered on his hard fastball,  
McNally was more of a junkball lefty. McNally not only wasn't the 
dominant pitcher in the league, he wasn't even the ace of his own 
staff, which included Jim Palmer and Mike Cuellar. 
</P>
<P>
	McNally's streak, which ended on Rich Reese's grand slam for  
Minnesota, was in jeopardy many times before the Orioles bailed him 
out with late rallies. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why we called him McLucky,'' Hendricks said. ``Every  
time he would leave a game losing, we seemed to either tie it or 
take the lead. But most of the time he pitched great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens has pitched great nearly all the time. His streak  
includes three shutouts, an 18-strikeout game and three wins 
against Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes it more impressive is that many people felt Clemens'  
career was on the downside after he went 40-39 in his last four 
seasons in Boston. But after arriving in Toronto in 1997, Clemens 
regained the dominant form from early in his career and has won 
consecutive Cy Youngs. 
</P>
<P>
	``His velocity is back up a little,'' Baltimore's B.J. Surhoff  
said. ``He is able to locate his pitches, which is something most 
power pitchers don't do. He has refined his splitter to give him a 
second out pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's on a different plane than his fastball and slider. You  
have to lay off it to have any chance against him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens and Mussina -- the active leaders in winning percentage  
(minimum 75 wins) -- have been two of the most consistent starters 
in the AL this decade. They have met five times since Mussina came 
up in 1991, with only one pitchers' duel, which Mussina won 3-2 in 
1994. Overall, Clemens is 2-1 with two no decisions against 
Mussina. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not pitching against him,'' Clemens said. ``Our hitters  
will work on him and I will work on getting their hitters out.''

	Air Alerts Heard in Yugoslavia  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Rare daytime air-raid alerts sounded  
in Belgrade, Novi Said and the Montenegrin capital of Podgorica as 
NATO warplanes also hammered Serb targets in Kosovo, Yugoslav media 
said. In the new airstrikes, NATO hit the Bistrica hydroelectric 
power plant and a major food-processing factory in Valjevo. In a 
sign the raids were starting to affect basic supplies, the first 
known report of food rationing surfaced. And a U.N. agency warned 
today that Kosovo faces a long-term food shortage because most 
fields have been destroyed, crops have not been harvested, and a 
huge number of livestock have died due to the violence and 
abandonment. 

</P>
<P>
	Germany Offers Kosovo Peace Plan  
</P>
<P>
	STRASBOURG, France (AP) -- Germany today unveiled a Kosovo peace  
plan calling for a one-day suspension of airstrikes if Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic begins withdrawing troops from the 
province. German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, in a speech to the 
European Parliament, said the EU could help build lasting peace in 
the Balkans by introducing ``something along the lines of the 
Marshall Plan'' in the region. NATO welcomed the plan as a 
``food-for-thought paper'' but would not immediately endorse it 
because it opens the way to a suspension of airstrikes. Spokesman 
Jamie Shea said the idea must be studied by other alliance members.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even as he defended his investigation of  
President Clinton, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr said today the 
Watergate-era law that gives him the power to probe actions of 
executive branch officials is flawed and should be abolished. 
``Jurisdiction and authority over these cases ought to be returned 
to the Justice Department,'' Starr recommended in testimony to the 
Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. The declaration brings Starr 
into line with Attorney General Janet Reno and some Republicans and 
Democrats who oppose extending the statute beyond its June 30 
expiration.

carrying a nuclear warhead and hitting deep inside its neighbor and 
rival India. The test was not a surprise, with analysts 
anticipating Pakistan would respond to the test of the Agni II 
missile conducted Sunday by India. Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz 
Sharif's government had been under considerable pressure to respond 
with a test of its own.

<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Tornadoes, baseball-size hail and heavy rain  
pounded West Texas, ripping roofs from houses and leaving dozens of 
families homeless. Only minor injuries were reported. Families 
forced from their homes were put up at Midland motels that donated 
space, said Doug Belcher, coordinator of a shelter set up at Cotton 
Flat Baptist Church. The National Weather Service said twisters 
touched down near Rotan, McCamey, Upton and Greenwood, where up to 
3 1/2 inches of rain fell.

	Clinton Seeks $300 Tax Credits  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Millions of working Americans would be  
eligible for $300 tax credits to encourage savings in new personal 
investment accounts for retirement, under a Clinton administration 
plan being unveiled today. The plan would be similar to the 401(k) 
plans many businesses offer. The government also would provide up 
to $700 for a couple filing a joint return as a government match to 
money they save on their own. Clinton sees the plan as a way to 
blunt a Republican drive for much broader income tax relief.

Big Game jackpot, the largest individual lottery prize in U.S. 
history. Maria Grasso came to Boston in 1996. The country's biggest

<HEADLINE> JP Morgan Profits Soar 153 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- J.P. Morgan reported a 153 percent jump in  
first-quarter profits Wednesday, continuing the industry's torrid 
financial performance that reflects the unbounded strength of the 
financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	J.P. Morgan earned $600 million, or $3.01 a share, for the first  
three months of the year, outdistancing Wall Street's estimate of 
$1.73 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first quarter last year, the firm earned $237 million or  
$1.15 a share. That quarter, however, included a one-time 
restructuring charge, without which J.P. Morgan reported operating 
profits of $366 million, or $1.80 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were a blowout,'' said Carla D'Arista, an analyst with  
Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &AMP; Co. In addition to solid earnings, 
J.P. Morgan ``reported a $65 million year-over-year decline in 
expenses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	J.P. Morgan generated $2.49 billion in revenues, up 25 percent  
from nearly $2 billion in the first quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The surprisingly positive results follow yesterday's 18 percent  
first-quarter gain from Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., and a 33 percent jump 
at Paine Webber Group Inc. Both firms also beat analysts' 
expectations on record trading commissions and renewed strength in 
the global bond business. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the industry may have humbled Wall Street with their  
first-quarter performance, ``The question is how long can they 
sustain it?,'' D'Arista asked. ``These companies tend to reflect 
the tone of the market, and the market tends to self-correct'' from 
overvalued highs. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors nonetheless seemed focused on Wednesday's numbers, and  
sent J.P. Morgan's shares up $4.37 1/2 to $133.68 3/4 on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest boost to the bottom line came from bond trading.  
Corporate America returned to the fixed-income markets en force as 
interest rates fell to attractive levels. J.P. Morgan made $696 
million from its bond business, up 91 percent from the first 
quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks, however, were also very strong as companies jumped to  
issue shares on the coattails of the Dow Jones industrial average's 
flight into record territory. Investors also paid J.P. Morgan 
millions in commissions to buy and sell stocks. J.P. Morgan 
reported revenues of $288 million from its equities business, more 
than double the year-ago period.

<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Wisconsin's attorney general says the use  
of a fictitious man in letters promoting Publishers Clearing House 
shows the kind of deceptive practices used by the company.

	But the folks who run the company implied the state's top crime  
fighter needs to enroll in Advertising 101.

	``Shhhhhh! ... Don't tell, but Betty Crocker, Uncle Sam and  
Josephine the Plumber aren't real people either,'' read a news 
release from the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Wisconsin is suing Publishers Clearing House, accusing it of  
fraudulent representations to state consumers and preying on the 
elderly, disabled and retired through letters from a Robert 
Treller. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal of the letters is to draw customers into a relationship  
that feels personal, even though the character is fictional, 
Attorney General James Doyle said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a further piece of evidence, and quite a dramatic piece  
of evidence, about the kind of deceptive practices that are going 
on,'' he said ``Not only is (Robert Treller) telling lies, he is a 
lie. He does not exist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The letters urge people to buy Publishers Clearing House  
products and sometimes include parts of Treller's personal history. 
The company admits it's all made up. 
</P>
<P>
	``The name Robert Treller is a name that Publishers Clearing  
House has used for many, many years. In terms of using a fictitious 
name, that's standard business practice followed by many, many, 
many companies,'' said Christopher Irving, director of consumer 
affairs at Publishers Clearing House. 
</P>
<P>
	In one letter promoting a video collection on aerial combat,  
Treller writes: ``I've flown combat in the Air Force and I know 
what it's like to have flak popping all around you. ... And thanks 
to this video, once again I can see these giant creatures settling 
down to land with their fuselage almost dragging on the air strip, 
battle-weary but alive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sweepstakes companies are under new scrutiny on several fronts,  
including Senate legislation that would set fines up to $2 million 
for deceptive sales tactics and provide the first federal 
regulation of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Wisconsin and 13 other states obtained an out-of-court  
settlement with Publishers Clearing House over alleged 
misrepresentations. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, American Family Publishers agreed to pay Wisconsin  
and 24 other states $50,000 each to settle allegations of deceptive 
sweepstakes advertising.

<HEADLINE> Brand 1st To Step Out on Coach K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Duke's Mike Krzyzewski is about to join the short list of  
coaches whose star leaves early to join the NBA. It's a sign of the 
times that instead of asking whether the move is good for the kid 
any more, most people will ask how Coach K kept the talent drain 
plugged for so long. 
</P>
<P>
	Sophomore Elton Brand, the consensus college basketball player  
of the year, is expected to announce today that he will forego his 
last two years of eligibility to try his luck in the pros. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski, who is recovering from hip surgery, has avoided  
comment on the matter. But when he finally does, expect him to be 
gracious in thanking Brand, sincere in wishing him well, and 
letting it go at that. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the NBA's new rookie salary scale, the last pick in the  
first round makes almost $2 million in his first three years and up 
to $1 million a year in his fourth. Considering the dollars 
involved, the move is almost always too tempting to pass up. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Lon Babby's client list argues just the opposite. It  
includes former Duke stars Grant Hill, Christian Laettner and 
Cherokee Parks, as well as Tim Duncan, who played four years at 
Wake Forest. But the only thing Babby says he's learned is that 
there is no right answer for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``For Tim and Grant, it was right to stay in school. Some kids  
benefit greatly, not just in terms of their game, but what they 
need to learn about life,'' Babby said. ``The other side is that 
there are lots of kids who don't want to stay or can't afford to. 
As long as the decision is based on good information and support 
from coaches and parents, you respect it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During Krzyzewski's tenure, Duke's principal rival, North  
Carolina, has practically become a finishing school for NBA-bound 
underclassmen. The Tar Heels lost a jug-eared, senior-to-be named 
Michael Jordan not long after Coach K first set foot in Durham, 
N.C., and they lost Antawn Jamison and rookie-of-the-year candidate 
Vince Carter to the pros only last season. And they've still had 
enough talent on hand to make Krzyzewski's life miserable year-in 
and year-out. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand will be hard to replace -- he averaged 18 points and 10  
rebounds, and at 6-foot-8 and 270 pounds, he occupied opposing 
defenses like few players in the college game can. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite rumors that William Avery and freshman Corey  
Maggette are considering following Brand's career path, they will 
almost certainly return along with Shane Battier and Chris 
Carrawell. And Krzyzewski has signed letters of intent from four 
McDonald's All-America high school stars. 
</P>
<P>
	The uninterrupted flow of high school talent is why the top  
college coaches no longer get worked up when a teen-ager tells them 
he'll be opting for a seven-figure paycheck next fall rather than 
fifth-semester math. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also why those same coaches like to turn the question,  
``How will college basketball survive without these kids?'' on its 
head. What they ask instead is ``How will the NBA survive with 
them?'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year's draft, thankfully, will be thin on knuckleheads.  
Unfortunately, though, it will be even thinner on talent. Besides 
Brand, the only underclassmen whose announcements have merited any 
attention are Maryland's Steve Francis, St. John's Ron Artest and 
Missouri's Albert White. They could be joined by Connecticut's 
Richard Hamilton, Michigan State's Mateen Cleaves, UCLA's Baron 
Davis, Rhode Island's Lamar Odom and Auburn's Chris Porter in any 
combination. Then again, none of them may elect to come out. 
</P>
<P>
	That leaves seniors Wally Szczerbiak of Miami of Ohio, Duke's  
Trajan Langdon, Arizona's Jason Terry and a host of no-names and 
foreign names that even dedicated draftniks will be struggling to 
identify by the time the second round rolls around. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem the last couple of years,'' chief NBA scout Marty  
Blake said, ``is that every kid who has one good game hears from 
somebody that he ought to come out. Usually, the exact opposite is 
true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Had everybody who could have stayed in school for all or even  
part of their four years, these are some of the names that would 
have been in this year's draft as well: Kevin Garnett and Kobe 
Bryant (both went to the NBA from high school), Allen Iverson 
(Georgetown), Stephon Marbury (Georgia Tecg), Jamison and Carter 
(North Carolina), Robert Traylor (Michigan), Jason Williams 
(Florida), Paul Pierce (Kansas), Larry Hughes (St. Louis) and Mike 
Bibby (Arizona). 
</P>
<P>
	Think Brand would have left Duke and taken his chances with that  
crowd? 
</P>
<P>
	Think again.

	COMPUTER LITERACY: Many children can perform some simple  
computer functions as early as age 3, according to FamilyPC 
magazine. At 3, a child may be able to point and click with a 
mouse, and use the mouse to carry out some very easy operations in 
software designed for preschoolers. At 4, a child may be able to do 
tasks such as starting a program from the computer desktop, 
clicking and dragging objects on the screen and finding their way 
through a simple program. Children may also be able to insert a CD 
into the CD-ROM drive. At age 5, a child may be able to start up 
the computer, use sign-in options such as typing in a names, use 
the print function and exit a program. A year later, at 6, a child 
is likely to be trying out arrow keys and other parts of the 
keyboard, saving documents to the hard drive and exploring a CD-ROM 
encyclopedia.

	FAST SALARY TRACK: Some students expecting to soon receive their  
MBAs think consulting will be a lucrative line of work. Kennedy 
Information Research Group surveyed MBA candidates at 30 business 
schools, and found that they expect an average total compensation 
package for consulting of $139,000 for their first year on the job. 
Students at Stanford University expected to receive $165,000 during 
the first year of consulting. Kennedy said the packages include an 
average $19,000 in signing bonuses and many also provide tuition 
reimbursement.

	EXECUTIVE COACHING: If your boss wants you to see an executive  
coach, chances are he or she thinks you're a valued employee who 
needs some fine-tuning. Debra Benton, who works as an executive 
coach, says bosses often send her employees who need to improve 
their presence, or the impact they make on other people. They also 
need to improve what she calls executive maturity, the political 
savvy and diplomacy needed inside and outside a company. Other 
hoped-for changes include improved leadership and social abilities.

<HEADLINE> Rangers' Rodriguez Gets Nine RBIs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Ivan Rodriguez drove in nine runs, setting a  
Texas Rangers record, in just the first three innings of Tuesday 
night's game against Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez hit a three-run homer in the first, a two-run single  
in the second and his first career grand slam in the third as Texas 
took a 13-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The All-Star catcher came up again with two runners on base in  
the fifth inning. But with a chance to tie the major league record 
for RBIs in a game, he flied out. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez singled with none on in the seventh.  
</P>
<P>
	Jim Bottomley of the St. Louis Cardinals set the big league mark  
of 12 RBIs on Sept. 16, 1924. Mark Whiten of the Cardinals tied 
that record when he hit four home runs on Sept. 7, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The AL record is 11 by Tony Lazzeri of the New York Yankees on  
May 24, 1936. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez broke the Texas record of eight RBIs set by Juan  
Gonzalez on June 17, 1993, and tied by Jose Canseco on June 13, 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez's previous RBI high was five, which he accomplished  
twice. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first inning, Rodriguez capped a five-run burst with a  
425-foot drive to left field off Ken Cloude. Rodriguez became the 
12th player to hit a ball into the second deck at the Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez's single in the second made it 7-0 and finished  
Cloude. In the third, he connected for a slam off Mac Suzuki to cap 
a six-run inning.

<HEADLINE>  St. John's Artest Enters NBA Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Ron Artest went home to leave school.  
</P>
<P>
	The third-team All-America announced Tuesday he is forgoing his  
final two years of eligibility at St. John's to enter the NBA 
draft. He held the news conference at the Jacob Riis Community 
Center in Queensbridge, the neighborhood in which he grew up. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke for 30 minutes, thanking everybody he could remember  
who had affected his life, from relatives and friends to coaches 
and teachers. At one point he apologized for ``making this like the 
Academy Awards,'' but no one seemed to mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``I showed it's not hard to make it out of Queensbridge, or any  
project,'' Artest said, looking directly at a group of kids 
standing just behind the eight TV cameras set up on the court where 
Artest learned to play basketball. ``I'm on my way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also found a new way to describe leaving school early for the  
possible riches of pro basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to get a job,'' he said. ``I'm not leaving college.  
I'm just not playing basketball there. I'll never leave St. John's. 
I'm always going to be there. I love the place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his two seasons at St. John's, the Red Storm went 50-19 and  
twice played in the NCAA tournament. The 6-foot-6 swingman averaged 
13.1 points, 6.3 rebounds, 3.2 assists and 1.9 rebounds in his 
two-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Storm fell one game shy of the Final Four this season,  
losing to Ohio State in the South Regional final. Not bad for a 
team that was unranked when the season began and finished ninth in 
the final poll with a 28-9 record. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a very special year with one of the closest teams I  
ever played for. There were no individuals,'' Artest said. ``I had 
a pretty decent year and it would have been great to get to the 
Final Four. Once the season was over, I made the decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The range of comments about when Artest's name will be called in  
the June 30 draft go from a sure lottery pick to a suspect shooter 
who may not be picked until the late teens. 
</P>
<P>
	St. John's coach Mike Jarvis is sure Artest handled the  
situation correctly. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a right way to make a decision and a wrong way, and  
Ronnie talked to the people who mattered and did it the right 
way,'' Jarvis said. ``I can tell you we never talked about this at 
all during the season. The team was always first. I can't be more 
supportive than I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senior forward Tyrone Grant is the only other player not  
returning to St. John's next season. So the outlook is bright, even 
with Artest gone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was selfish and told him he should stay, but he didn't  
listen,'' said sophomore forward Reggie Jessie, who grew up in the 
same neighborhood and has known Artest since they were children. 
``He's a hero around here whether he plays in the NBA or not. Just 
what he's done coming from here is special, and now he has the 
opportunity to play basketball with the best players there are.''

<HEADLINE> Time Warner Earns $138M in Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Time Warner Inc. bounced back from a loss a year  
ago to post a net profit of $138 million in the first quarter. The 
improved results reflected strong growth across the company's media 
holdings and a one-time gain from ending a video distribution 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner's earnings translated to 10 cents per share for the  
three months ending March 31. That compared to a net loss of $62 
million, or 12 cents a share, in the same period a year ago, when 
its earnings were dragged down by slumping music sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 2.4 percent to $6.20 billion from $6.05 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The figures include results from Time Warner Entertainment Co.,  
a partnership with the Colorado cable operator MediaOne Group Inc. 
which holds most of Time Warner's cable systems, the Warner Bros. 
film studio and the HBO premium cable channel. Time Warner owns 
about 75 percent of the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner also posted hefty gains in cash flow, a common  
measure for performance among large media companies with heavy debt 
burdens. Cash flow excludes interest costs and other non-operating 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner's total cash flow jumped 47 percent to $1.25  
billion, which includes a one-time gain of $215 million from the 
early termination of a video distribution agreement with MGM/UA. 
Without the gain, cash flow rose 22 percent to $1.04 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Performance was strong across the company's media holdings.  
</P>
<P>
	Publishing operations, which includes the magazines Time,  
Fortune, People and Entertainment Weekly, had an 11 percent rise in 
cash flow thanks to strong advertising sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's music holdings, which had been slumping in recent  
years, continued a comeback with a 10 percent rise in cash flow. 
The group's artists won 24 Grammys in February, including Madonna, 
Alanis Morissette and Eric Clapton. 
</P>
<P>
	The film division also posted gains of 10 percent, excluding the  
one-time gain from the video contract, thanks to hits like ``You've 
Got Mail'' and ``Analyze This.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner's WB Network, in which Chicago-based Tribune Co.  
owns a minority interest, continued to post losses as it expands 
its national operations, which include the drama series 
``Felicity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Time Warner fell $3.50 to $73.50 in trading Wednesday  
on the New York Stock Exchange

<HEADLINE> Gov't To Test Gulf War Treatments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The U.S. government will start testing an  
antibiotic this month as a possible cure for the thousands of 
veterans who say they suffer from Gulf War syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty military and veterans clinics in the country will offer  
the antibiotic, based on the theory that the symptoms may be caused 
by an airborne bacteria and might be contagious. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not dealing with a black plague,'' said Dr. Charles  
Engel, director of the Gulf War health center at Walter Reed Army 
Medical Center in Washington D.C. ``Most people feel relatively 
comfortable. It is not infectious in the way that would result in 
some sort of catastrophic epidemic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $8 million study is one of two sponsored by the Defense  
Department and the Veterans Affairs Department. A $12 million study 
will test exercise and behavior changes as a possible cure. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 100,000 of the 700,000 Gulf War troops report  
suffering from the illness, characterized by extreme fatigue, joint 
and muscle pain, concentration and memory problems, rashes, fever, 
diarrhea and other symptoms that last six months or more. 
</P>
<P>
	There are currently about 120 projects by the U.S. government  
investigating the cause, characteristics and prevalence of the 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
	In the antibiotic study, researchers will look for strains of  
myscoplasma, a bacteria known to cause some plant and animal 
diseases. If the bacteria is found to be the cause, that means the 
illness can be treated, but is likely mildly contagious.

<HEADLINE> Delany Sisters' Story Comes to TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GASTONIA, N.C. (AP) -- One was a sharp-tongued spitfire who  
became a dentist at a time when women huddled at home with husband 
and children; the other was a mild-mannered school teacher who 
served as inspiration to legions of young women. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth ``Bessie'' Delany and Sarah ``Sadie'' Delany were best  
friends from birth, two exceptional sisters who each lived well 
past a century and whose observations about growing up black in 
America were shared in the 1993 best-selling book ``Having Our Say: 
The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the book was translated to the Broadway stage, veteran  
actresses clamored to play two intelligent, independent, successful 
older women. Such roles are a rarity -- especially in film and 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a new kind of woman on the horizon,'' says actress  
Ruby Dee. ``She's older, independent and she's got all her 
faculties. There's a whole life ahead after 65.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dee, 74, portrays Bessie, and Diahann Carroll plays Sadie in the  
made-for-television movie ``Having Our Say,'' which airs April 18 
on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delany sisters lived another lifetime after their 65th  
birthdays. 
</P>
<P>
	Sadie Delany died Jan. 25 at the age of 109. Bessie Delany died  
in 1995 at the age of 104. 
</P>
<P>
	They became best-selling authors in 1994 with the publication of  
their book, written in collaboration with Amy Hill Hearth, who was 
more than 65 years their junior. The sisters and Hearth followed up 
with ``The Delany Sisters' Book of Everyday Wisdom,'' which was 
released in 1994. After her sister's death, Sadie Delany wrote a 
third book: ``On My Own at 107: Reflections on Life Without 
Bessie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were matter-of-fact references in their best seller to the  
lynchings and ``Jim Crow'' segregation laws. of the post-slavery 
years that the sisters lived through. But there were also quiet 
triumphs -- their own impressive family saga, their pride in the 
1960s civil rights movement and their professional success in an 
age when most women stayed home. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, television doesn't often present the lives of  
blacks and women like the Delanys, says director Lynne Littman. 
</P>
<P>
	``You realize how images like this are not on television,'' she  
said in an interview while the movie was being filmed in the 
Gastonia and Charlotte areas, about 200 miles southwest of Raleigh. 
``They are dignified, educated, well-dressed, respectful and 
respectable African-American people who were around 100 years 
ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bessie was the more stubborn, confrontational sister who was  
almost lynched as a young woman after a run-in with a white at a 
railroad station. Sadie was the quieter sister who often got her 
way by smiling and agreeing, then doing what she wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	The sisters and their eight brothers and sisters grew up on the  
campus of St. Augustine's School (now college) in Raleigh, where 
their father, a former slave, was vice principal. All 10 children 
went to college. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delany sisters, neither of whom ever married, moved to New  
York City after they graduated from St. Augustine's. Sadie Delany 
earned a master's degree in education from Columbia University and 
became the first black domestic-science teacher in New York City's 
public schools. Bessie Delany also graduated from Columbia and 
became a dentist. 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll wanted the part of Sadie so badly that she finished her  
singing tour on a Sunday night and was in Charlotte for a reading 
Monday morning. ``I incredibly desired it with all my being,'' she 
said. ``I really wanted very seriously to make my desires known.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like most older women, Carroll and Dee have difficulty finding  
well-written parts. Throw black into the mix and ``it is 
impossible,'' Carroll says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here I am in my 60s and I am finding a part that expects you  
to use every part of your craft, every part of your being, every 
part of your physicality,'' she says. ``It's a gift.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Getting these two women together wasn't easy. In addition to  
Carroll's tour, the producers had to work with Dee, who spent at 
least one weekend in Dallas, doing a play with her husband, Ossie 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Dee was so anxious about filming on this day that she woke up at  
2:30 a.m., 90 minutes before her alarm call. On the set, she 
munches half a turkey sandwich and a cup of cranberry juice between 
takes, rarely getting more than a bite down each time. 
</P>
<P>
	Of playing Bessie, she says: ``I feel right doing it, with the  
blessings, I hope, of all the other people who have played her, as 
well as Bessie herself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One reason it seems right is that when Dee walked to school each  
day as a child growing up in Harlem, she'd walk past 135th Street, 
where Bessie Delany had her dental office. 
</P>
<P>
	``People would tell me a black woman was up there who was a  
dentist,'' Dee says. ``I remember being impressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Carroll had a grandmother who had something of Bessie's  
attitude. Each summer as a child, the actress would spend several 
weeks in North Carolina on ``Miss Rebecca's'' farm, where her 
grandmother raised chicken and hogs and grew tobacco and cotton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was such a snobby little thing, running around, telling  
everyone I was from New York,'' Carroll says. ``But there were 
certain traditions of which my mother and father had spoken of with 
great affection, and trips to the South allowed me to experience 
some of those traditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The movie also stars Della Reese, Richard Roundtree, Mykelti  
Williamson, Lonette McKee and Amy Madigan as the sisters' 
collaborator. 
</P>
<P>
	Littman, who won an Academy Award for ``Number Our Days,'' a  
documentary about the lives of older people, says she decided 
against doing ``Having Our Say'' in flashbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I learned about old people is that the past and the  
present aren't necessarily differentiated,'' she says. ``The past 
and the present happen in the same dimension.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the movie takes viewers back through what Littman calls  
``sense memory.'' For example, in one scene Bessie is shaking a 
branch at her sister and their collaborator and she remembers the 
switching they got as children. ``I'm still mad at you,'' she says 
to her sister. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a device that works in movies,'' she says. ``Whether it's  
an acceptable TV device, we'll find out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Littman will compete against herself Sunday night: At the same  
time as ``Having Our Say,'' Showtime will air ``Freak City,'' a 
film Littman also directed, starring Marlee Matlin and Natalie 
Cole.

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- James D. McCawley, an internationally renowned  
linguist who spent more than 30 years at the University of Chicago, 
died Saturday of a heart attack. He was 61. 
</P>
<P>
	McCawley joined the first doctoral class in linguistics at the  
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	One of his teachers was Noam Chomsky, who defined a theory on  
generative grammar that focused almost entirely on the rules of 
sentence formation. 
</P>
<P>
	Already on staff at Chicago at the time of his 1965 graduation,  
McCawley shook up the world of linguistics in the late 1960s when 
he refuted this ideology with the new theory of generative 
semantics, which focuses on the relation between sentence structure 
and meaning. 
</P>
<P>
	McCawley wrote four books and knew at least 12 languages. He was  
president of the Linguistic Society of America in 1996 and was 
elected to the Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1983.

died Wednesday of cancer. He was 67. 
</P>
<P>
	The actor, playwright, author, composer, lyricist and singer was  
first diagnosed in 1985 with renal cell cancer and had one kidney 
removed. After years of good health, the cancer returned in 1997.

	Newley had lived in Surrey, England, about 35 miles outside of  
London, for years and moved to Florida permanently in December. 
</P>
<P>
	The former husband of actress Joan Collins, Newley shot to fame  
as the Artful Dodger in the 1948 film version of ``Oliver Twist.''

Swiss bank to recover her family's money, died Tuesday of cardiac 
arrest. She was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Sapir was the lead plaintiff in a class action lawsuit  
involving thousands of other Holocaust survivors until Credit 
Suisse settled her case one year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount of the settlement was not disclosed, but estimates  
ranged from $300,000 to $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1946 she asked Credit Suisse for the money but was repeatedly  
refused on the ground that she had no death certificate for her 
father, which she said was impossible to obtain since he had died 
in a concentration camp. Finally the bank acknowledged his death on 
the basis of other documents and settled her claim.

<HEADLINE> MLS' Wizards' Newman Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Ron Newman resigned as coach of the  
Kansas City Wizards on Wednesday after an 0-4 start. Assistant 
coach Ken Fogarty was appointed interim coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a mutual understanding,'' said Clark Hunt, one of the  
Wizards' investors-operators. ``Ron knew that there needed to be a 
change to turn around the fortunes of this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We've gotten into a rut where we had been losing, and losing  
had become a habit. Ron understood that and knew a change had to be 
made,'' Hunt said at a news conference today. 
</P>
<P>
	Newman and injured goalkeeper Tony Meola had traded accusations  
in newspapers after a loss to San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	Meola, sidelined at least four months after March 31  
arthroscopic knee surgery March 31, criticized Newman for lack of 
preparation. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to question when players are being moved around out  
of position, when there's no discussion of an opponent leading up 
to a game,'' Meola said. ``We didn't talk at all about San Jose 
before the game. That's not the way to prepare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newman said the next day that he was shocked that a player who  
was new to the team would criticize the coach publicly. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has no qualifications,'' Newman said. ``Not only does he  
not know the game well enough, but he hasn't been here.''

<HEADLINE> Two Earnings Estimates for Web Cos. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The company that tracks analysts' estimates of  
corporate earnings intends to publish two sets of 
earnings-per-share estimates for Internet companies in response to 
Wall Street demands and accounting-rule changes, The Wall Street 
Journal reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	First Call Corp. will add a cash-flow earnings per share  
estimate for 20 Internet companies, including Yahoo! Inc., Avid 
Technology Inc. and MindSpring Enterprises Inc. The list may be 
expanded beyond the 20, depending on the response, said Chuck Hill, 
First Call's research director. 
</P>
<P>
	The Boston-based company defines cash EPS as a company's  
earnings before merger-related costs for goodwill, the premium paid 
for acquired assets. 
</P>
<P>
	First Call will continue to provide the traditional regular  
earnings per share estimate, which represents a company's net 
income including goodwill and other charges. In most cases, a 
company's cash EPS will be higher than regular EPS. 
</P>
<P>
	Accounting-rule changes, expected to take effect by Jan. 1,  
2001, are likely to increase goodwill charges at many Internet 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts and company executives are worried that if the changes  
take effect as expected, ``the market will have to deal with a more 
depressed reported-earnings number, thus lower stock prices,'' 
Robert Willens, a managing director at Lehman Brothers Inc., told 
the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone is now beating the drum to get the market focused on  
cash EPS,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, some analysts believe the cash EPS figure is unreliable  
and often confusing, the Journal said. Most companies define cash 
EPS as earnings before such costs as interest, taxes, depreciation 
and amortization, while First Call uses the different definition. 
In addition, no accounting rules exist to govern the proper 
calculation of cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
	As an example of how cash EPS can significantly change a  
company's results, First Call estimates MindSpring, an Internet 
company in Atlanta, posted a 93-cent loss in regular EPS for fiscal 
1999; MindSpring's cash EPS for that same period came to a 94-cent 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
	MindSpring President Michael McQuary said the company's regular  
EPS is being hurt by goodwill charges from two acquisition that 
took place during the last year.

<HEADLINE> Gretzky Still Deciding on Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RYE, N.Y. (AP) -- Wayne Gretzky said today he had not made up his  
mind about whether to retire when his New York Rangers end their 
season Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am leaning somewhat more one way than another,'' he said  
after a Rangers' drill at their practice facility, but he declined 
to say which option he favored. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL's all-time leading scorer and one of the sport's  
greatest players has acknowledged that at 38 he was considering 
ending his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Rangers coach John Muckler today tried to talk Gretzky into  
playing at least one more year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll sit back and weigh the pros and cons,'' Gretzky said  
after his conversation with Muckler. 
</P>
<P>
	He was scheduled to meet with general manager Neil Smith later  
today after the Rangers fly to Ottawa for a game with the Senators 
on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not something that will drag on,'' Gretzky said, but  
he explained he was taking a long time to make up his mind because, 
``This is a lifetime decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has received plenty of advice.  
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone wants me to come back for a year, but this is  
something I need to do for myself,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if there was one person whose advice he would consider  
more than others, he replied: ``My wife. She's been through me 
through thick and thin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She wants me to come back for one more year,'' Gretzky said.  
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky has invited his family to come to New York on Sunday for  
the Rangers' regular-season finale against Pittsburgh, an end to a 
second straight non-playoff season for the Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	His father, Walter Gretzky believed his son's mind was made up.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would strongly suspect that Sunday will be his final game,''  
the elder Gretzky told radio station CKGL in Kitchener, Ontario. 
``I haven't talked to him personally. He's talked with his mom, but 
most likely he will announce a retirement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he asked his son last summer when he would retire, and  
he replied, ``The day that I stop enjoying it is the day I'm 
finished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Messier, who won four Stanley Cups with Gretzky while  
playing for Edmonton in the 1980s, reserved judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone else is insinuating that he's retiring -- but  
everybody except the most important person, and that's himself. So 
we'll just wait and see the way things turn out and what Wayne 
himself has to say,'' Messier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking Tuesday via satellite from New York to a conference on  
the state of hockey in Canada, Gretzky sounded much like a man 
ready to hang up his skates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hockey has been a part of my life as long as I can remember,''  
he said. ``I lived it and I breathed it as a kid and as an adult. 
It's the only job I've ever had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If this is the end, Gretzky will leave with statistics and  
awards that are staggering by any standard. 
</P>
<P>
	He had 894 goals and 1,961 assists in 1,483 regular season  
games, including nine goals and 51 assists in 66 games with the 
Rangers this season. In the playoffs, the Great One had 122 goals 
and 260 assists in 208 games. 
</P>
<P>
	For his career, he was a nine-time winner of the Hart Trophy as  
league's most valuable player (1980, '81, '82, '83, '84, '85, '86, 
'87, '89); 10 times the league's leading scorer (1981, '82, '83, 
'84, '85, '86, '87, '90, '91, '94); a four-time Lady Byng winner as 
the most gentlemanly player (1980, '91, '92, '94); a five-time 
winner of the Lester Pearson award as NHL's outstanding player 
(1982, '82, '84, '85, '87), and twice the winner of the Conn Smythe 
Trophy as most valuable player in playoffs (1985, '88). 
</P>
<P>
	This hasn't been a typical season for Gretzky, who missed 11  
games with a neck injury. He had played in 223 straight games since 
signing with the Rangers as a free agent in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury was the second in Gretzky's career involving a disc.  
In 1992-93, he missed most of the season with a lower back injury 
before coming back to lead the Los Angeles Kings to the Stanley Cup 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998-99 season has included at least one milestone for the  
NHL's leading career scorer. His ninth goal of the year gave him 
1,072 as a professional, moving him past boyhood hero Gordie Howe. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith insisted that Gretzky is an emotional player who has ups  
and downs and that missing the playoffs for a second straight year 
and being sidelined with a neck injury might have made him consider 
retirement a little more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he is going to play,'' Smith said optimistically.  
</P>
<P>
	Muckler, a longtime associate, also felt Gretzky would be back  
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no reason to say that, really. I guess because it would  
be a sad day if he does elect to retire,' Muckler told TSN's 
``That's Hockey.'' ``I think Wayne still has the passion for the 
game. He still plays the game hard, he likes the people associated 
with the game. I think he would miss it terribly. And he can still 
contribute to the game.''

<HEADLINE>  Brand's NBA Decision a `No-Brainer' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Duke's first underclassman to head to the  
NBA apparently couldn't pass up what his coach called a sure thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Elton Brand is not just an (NBA) lottery pick, he's a high  
lottery pick,'' Mike Krzyzewski said Wednesday during a news 
conference in which the 6-foot-8, 270-pound center said he would 
skip his final two years of college eligibility to turn pro. ``It 
was inevitable it was going to happen in our program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, who helped lead the Blue Devils to a 37-2 record and NCAA  
runnerup finish this past season, showed little emotion at his news 
conference held in Cameron Indoor Stadium attended by his mother, 
Daisy, and a half-dozen teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski, still recovering from hip surgery at home, joined in  
by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	``(The NBA) has been a lifelong dream of mine, and this just  
makes me one step closer to accomplishing it,'' said Brand, who 
received an ovation from about 50 fans as he entered Cameron. ``I 
am going to miss my teammates and my friends I've made, and the 
staff, but coach felt it was the right decision and the right 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brand is the fourth player to come out early for the NBA draft,  
joining Ron Artest (St. John's), Steve Francis (Maryland) and 
Albert White (Missouri). Underclassmen have until May 15 to 
declare. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand admitted being Duke's first player to quit school for the  
NBA weighed on him some, but said Krzyzewski's support made his 
decision easier. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a different situation for the Grant Hills and the  
Christian Laettners,'' Brand said. ``(Going pro) wasn't as much of 
an option as it is now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brand will likely be picked in the top five of the June 30 NBA  
draft and become an instant millionaire. Krzyzewski called Brand's 
decision to leave the Blue Devils a ``no-brainer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We talked to Elton when he first came to Duke that at the end  
of his time here he would have decisions to make. Going to Duke 
provides you with great decisions to make, and because of how well 
he has done, the decision-making process has been moved up,'' 
Krzyzewski said. ``I'm 100 percent in support of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The consensus national college player of the year averaged 17.8  
points and 9.8 rebounds this past season and was the main cog in 
the middle for the talented Blue Devils. But he fell short of his 
goal of leading the Blue Devils to the national title 2 1/2 weeks ago 
in a 77-74 loss to Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand was the first sophomore to win the John R. Wooden Award,  
presented by the Los Angeles Athletic Club to college basketball's 
top player. Brand also was honored this season by The Associated 
Press, the Atlanta Tipoff Club and the United States Basketball 
Writers Association as national player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand cited financial security and an opportunity to improve his  
game at the next level as reasons for leaving the Blue Devils. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very important to be able to take care of my mom and my  
family and have them live comfortably. That has always been a dream 
of mine,'' said Brand, who grew up in a low-income area in 
Peekskill, N.Y., without a father. 
</P>
<P>
	The hulking sophomore said he would continue on a path toward  
his degree, which means summer school this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said no matter what happens in the NBA his biggest joy is  
going to be the day he gets his degree, and that says a lot,'' said 
Duke associate head coach Johnny Dawkins. ``We are very proud to be 
associated people like that.''

<HEADLINE> Gretzky To Decide Future by Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RYE, N.Y. (AP) -- His coach, his teammates, his fans and even his  
wife have urged him to extend his glorious hockey career one more 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wayne Gretzky alone understands what must be done, and his  
decision on retirement will come by the time the New York Rangers 
end their season Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need to do what's best for myself. ... Nobody else has any  
bearing on this at this point in time,'' he said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking after practice in a chilly room of whitewashed concrete  
block above the practice rink, the 38-year-old hockey great said he 
will decide by Sunday -- ``not today or tomorrow'' -- whether to end 
his 20-year career in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not trying to be an idiot about this,'' he said. ``It's  
just a lifetime decision. Once it's done, it's done, 100 percent, 
whether I come back or I don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, who smiled and seemed relaxed on the ice but seemed  
somewhat emotional afterward, said he spoke with coach John Muckler 
and planned to meet with general manager Neil Smith after the team 
got to Ottawa for Thursday night's game with the Senators. 
</P>
<P>
	It could be Gretzky's last game in his homeland, and he said  
``I'm going to enjoy tomorrow.'' In Ottawa, Prime Minister Jean 
Chretien said the Great One should keep playing and a Canadian TV 
network switched plans so it could cover the game. As many as 200 
reporters were expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky said Muckler talked about ``my importance to the  
organization as far as my presence, what I bring to the hockey 
club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I said to him, `I think this team will be a better team next  
year than it is this year,' and he said that it would be a better 
team next year if I'm back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky seemed to vacillate even during the news conference  
about whether he wanted to come back, but he said he was ``leaning 
somewhat more one way than the other.'' He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky said his wife Janet -- whose opinion he values most, he  
said -- ``would like me to play one more year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She knows I love to play and probably she agrees with John and  
Neil that we came a long ways this year and next year we'll be 
better. She wants me to be part of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody I've talked to says, `You've got to play next year'  
and that part's been really difficult,'' Gretzky said. ``The 
response has been overwhelming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he didn't want to ``let down'' his coach or teammates or  
fans, ``But I know eventually I'll make the right decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, who led the league in scoring 10 times, said he's  
confident he can still play well, though he complained of a neck 
injury that cost him 11 games this season and said, ``I'm not going 
to play at the level I did 10 years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke of a call from the great Gordie Howe, who still plays  
hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's 70 years old, and he said, `I love it,''' Gretzky said.  
``I think I'll have the same feeling 30 years from now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I love this game,'' Gretzky added. ``The practice, sitting in  
the back of the bus with the pizza and the guys ... the camaraderie 
and what goes on between the guys ... coming in the next morning 
after a big win. I mean I love everything about it. ... No matter 
what happens, I'm going to miss it more than anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky expressed disappointment about the Rangers' missing the  
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants to go out like Michael Jordan did, but it's  
not a perfect world. ... It's not going to happen that way, not 
this year, but it is nice to be able to say people do want me to 
play more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Near the end of his remarks, Gretzky said his 6-year-old son is  
scheduled to play a baseball game Sunday, the same day as the 
Rangers' last game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `Are you going to come to my hockey game?' And he  
said, `No, I've got a baseball game.' And I said, `Well, I don't 
know about next year,' and he said, `Well, I don't care. I've got a 
ball game.' 
</P>
<P>
	``He seems to have everything in perspective,'' Gretzky said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-1st Lady Nancy Reagan Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Former first lady Nancy Reagan honored an  
unlikely ally across party lines, though not without a little 
partisan ribbing. 
</P>
<P>
	She told a black-tie audience Tuesday that she and Rep. Charles  
Rangel, a New York Democrat, had worked closely to fight illegal 
drugs while she and President Reagan were in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	She also jokingly rebuked Rangel for urging first lady Hillary  
Rodham Clinton to run for the Senate being vacated by Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charlie, come to think of it, you never asked me to run for  
anything,'' she said while giving Rangel the National Center on 
Addiction and Substance Abuse's Distinguished Service Award at the 
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	She added: ``I know a lot of you are thinking that we're the odd  
couple, but our friendship was forged during our stay in 
Washington. I found out I could always count on Charlie's 
support.''

<HEADLINE>  Brand's NBA Decision a `No-Brainer' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Duke's first underclassman to head to the  
NBA apparently couldn't pass up what his coach called a sure thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Elton Brand is not just an (NBA) lottery pick, he's a high  
lottery pick,'' Mike Krzyzewski said Wednesday during a news 
conference in which the 6-foot-8, 270-pound center said he would 
skip his final two years of college eligibility to turn pro. ``It 
was inevitable it was going to happen in our program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, who helped lead the Blue Devils to a 37-2 record and NCAA  
runnerup finish this past season, showed little emotion at his news 
conference held in Cameron Indoor Stadium attended by his mother, 
Daisy, and a half-dozen teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski, still recovering from hip surgery at home, joined in  
by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	``(The NBA) has been a lifelong dream of mine, and this just  
makes me one step closer to accomplishing it,'' said Brand, who 
received an ovation from about 50 fans as he entered Cameron. ``I 
am going to miss my teammates and my friends I've made, and the 
staff, but coach felt it was the right decision and the right

<HEADLINE> NFL Said To Pick L.A. Coliseum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A Carson councilman who led the city's  
attempt to land an NFL franchise believes the league instead has 
decided to try to make a deal with the Los Angeles Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	Councilman Daryl Sweeney said Wednesday he anticipates an  
announcement next week when the NFL expansion committee visits Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a decision is going to be made on Tuesday, and I think  
that decision is to go to the Coliseum, and to give them some time 
to get their act together,'' Sweeney said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it is anticipated that Carson will be waiting in the  
wings if the Coliseum-Dodger stadium deal doesn't go through. 
They're probably thinking we'll be there saying, `Come back to us.' 
But that's not the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL has approached Fox Group, which owns the Los Angeles  
Dodgers, about the possibility of building a new baseball stadium 
next to the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeney's reaction to the possibility of the Dodgers' moving to  
Exposition Park: ``That's never going to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bid to return pro football to a remodeled Coliseum appeared  
to gain momentum with a report that Michael Ovitz, the Hollywood 
dealmaker who proposed building a new stadium on a former Carson 
landfill, had given up on that idea and was going to endorse the 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz said in a statement Wednesday that his position is  
unchanged from last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``A couple of weeks ago, I met with commissioner Tagliabue after  
the NFL owners' meeting in Phoenix,'' Ovitz said. ``I told him that 
my partners and I were committed to doing whatever was in the best 
interest of bringing NFL football back to Los Angeles, even if that 
meant voluntarily withdrawing our Carson stadium proposal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz said the league had encouraged his group to continue to  
pursue the Carson proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Next Tuesday, we expect that the NFL will select a stadium  
plan on which to focus its efforts over the coming months,'' Ovitz 
said. ``As I told commissioner Tagliabue, we will support the NFL 
in whatever decision is made and we will continue to pursue our 
goal of owning and operating a successful NFL franchise in Los 
Angeles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the March meetings in Phoenix, the NFL owners voted  
conditional approval to give the Los Angeles area the league's 32nd 
franchise, but did not choose between Carson and the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer carried a Sept. 15 deadline for whichever group was  
picked to present a stadium and financing plan that meets the 
owners' approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeney said that, if Ovitz indeed endorses the Coliseum  
proposal, officials from suburban Carson won't feel like they've 
been shortchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we've gained a lot of positive press and publicity out  
of it,'' Sweeney said. ``Now we're going to plan to go ahead (with 
the site), possibly with the building of a mall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If NFL owners are unable to work out a deal in Los Angeles,  
Houston, which also made a bid for the 32nd franchise, likely will 
get the team.

<HEADLINE> News Execs Get High-Tech Advice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The news industry faces a dramatic shift in  
coming years and more and more readers turn to the Internet to get 
their information, technology leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know anybody who picks up the newspaper anymore to get  
a stock price or to see which team won a game,'' Lawrence Kramer, 
founder of Internet news provider MarketWatch.com, told the 
American Society of Newspaper Editors on Tuesday at the 1999 
convention in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	News content will always be an important commodity, but the way  
stories are delivered is going to change dramatically, agreed Intel 
Corp. chairman Andy Grove. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three years from now, traditional newspapers are going to face  
an obvious profit squeeze,'' Grove said. 
</P>
<P>
	New York-based research firm Jupiter Communications found last  
year that 16 percent of online users had reduced their newspaper 
reading time to use the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	High-tech leaders told editors they have to move their content  
onto the Internet, make those stories interactive, and improve 
in-depth coverage in their print versions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you have to realize that the Internet is a whole new  
medium, not an extension of what you have been doing,'' said Cox 
Interactive Media vice president Hilary Goodall. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodall said Internet users like to respond to news stories,  
participate in virtual discussion groups and personalize news to 
their interests. 
</P>
<P>
	San Jose Mercury News executive editor Jerome Ceppos, whose  
Silicon Valley-based newspaper has invested heavily in a widely 
used, interactive Web site, said newspaper leaders are trying to 
keep up with ``the collision of newspapers and technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, these changes won't be cheap, said Christian Hendricks,  
president of Nando Media, an Internet news provider. 
</P>
<P>
	``Publishers simply need to allocate more money to cover the  
news,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The majority of the more than 500 newspaper executives attending  
the conference agreed, in a show of hands, that they can't afford 
not to prepare for the massive changes taking place as a result of 
the Internet.

<HEADLINE> Barrymore Studied for Film Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Drew Barrymore might be a Hollywood veteran,  
but she still did her movie homework before producing her first 
film. 
</P>
<P>
	After teaming up with 31-year-old Nancy Juvonen, Barrymore  
rolled up her sleeves and spent two years deconstructing the film 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	The duo converted a room in Barrymore's home into an office,  
formed a production company, pored over scripts and met with agents 
and studio executives. 
</P>
<P>
	They also dissected and analyzed their own tastes in movies to  
try to determine what young audiences want to see. Then they made 
their first movie -- ``Never Been Kissed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We wouldn't have the wholeness without each other,''  
Barrymore, 24, said. ``Everyone wants that producer plaque on their 
door, but it takes an extraordinary amount of work to get there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gambit seems to have worked. ``Never Been Kissed'' opened in  
second place behind ``The Matrix'' last weekend, bringing in about 
$12 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrymore, who is John Barrymore's granddaughter, grew up in  
Hollywood and starred in ``E.T.: The Extraterrestrial'' at age 6. 
She has more than two dozen film credits to her name.

<HEADLINE> Being a `Ya-Ya' Is Inspiring Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The term ``ya-ya,'' for those unfamiliar with  
Louisiana, comes from the Creole term ``gumbo ya-ya,'' which means 
everybody talking at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, since Rebecca Wells' book ``Divine Secrets of the  
Ya-Ya Sisterhood'' hit the best-seller lists, ``ya-ya'' also refers 
to a certain kind of woman. 
</P>
<P>
	``A person who is afraid and still drinks of life very deeply,  
who climbs on the back of the elephant and rides,'' Wells says. ``A 
ya-ya is perfectly imperfect and their biggest secret is their 
sense of humor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A ya-ya is also a little bit mischievous and a very supportive  
friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've quit holding in their stomachs and realized that life  
itself is a big banquet. They know that you can be happy while 
going through the sufferings that are an inseparable part of 
life,'' Wells said in an interview at her Seattle home overlooking 
Puget Sound. 
</P>
<P>
	Her book, drawing heavily on her Louisiana upbringing, has  
inspired women around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Someone asked me once what a ya-ya was, and all I could answer  
was ... if you are one or know one, you wouldn't need to ask,'' 
says Liz Jackson of Puyallup, who, like many others, started her 
own ``ya-ya sisterhood'' after reading Wells' book. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you meet one, you know you've met her,'' Jackson says.  
</P>
<P>
	The book's central theme is bonding and the support friends give  
to each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that I was very lonely for sisterhood when I was  
writing this book,'' says the elfin, auburn-haired Wells, who is in 
her 40s. ``I wrote it because I wanted a group like the ya-yas. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes a really conscious decision to make friendship a  
priority. You have to say, `This is important to me. I'm going to 
give it time and love.' The book really taught me that, and my 
ya-yas began to emerge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Divine Secrets,'' a tale of love and laughter set in Wells'  
native Louisiana turf, was published in 1996 to so-so reviews and 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon, though, there was a groundswell of interest.  
</P>
<P>
	The book has sold 2 million copies and has sat on the New York  
Times best-seller list for 56 weeks as word about it passes from 
mother to daughter, from girlfriend to girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's what it's all about,'' Wells says as she moves from one  
plush sofa to another with seemingly boundless energy in a living 
room filled with photos by her husband, photographer Tom Schworer. 
``It's really girlfriends. It's girlfriends telling girlfriends.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book is about four friends who met as 6-year-olds when they  
are kicked out of a 1932 Shirley Temple look-alike contest for 
unladylike behavior. We follow them into their 60s as they live, 
learn, love and give birth to a new generation -- the petite ya-yas. 
</P>
<P>
	They give themselves nicknames -- Vivi, Teensy, Caro and Neecie --  
and look out for each other, sharing good times and bad. Their 
motto -- ``Smoke, drink, never think'' -- is taken from a Billie 
Holiday song. 
</P>
<P>
	While she denies the book is autobiographical, Wells concedes  
some parts do reflect her upbringing on a plantation in Rapides 
Parish, population 17,000, where her family has lived since 1795. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells doesn't share the vices of her four ya-yas, she notes in  
her Southern drawl. She drinks tea, not coffee, doesn't smoke and 
only drinks the occasional microbrew. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I were to write my personal memoir it would be totally  
different,'' Wells says. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to write fiction because it's like a country you can  
open and step into. When you are writing a personal memoir you have 
to be factually true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson, her fan, prefers to believe Wells' ya-yas are based on  
real people. 
</P>
<P>
	``I understand Rebecca says this is a work of fiction, but  
having lived in the deep South, I tend to believe she met the true 
tribe of ya-yas and formed her own composite of them,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Movie rights to the book have been snapped up by Bette Midler's  
All Girl Productions. Wells, who is not writing the screenplay, is 
open-minded about casting. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all have our own pictures of these characters in our mind.  
The reader might have one picture while I might have a totally 
different one,'' she said. ``I write, but it's really your 
imagination meeting mine on the page that creates the picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells' first book, ``Little Altars Everywhere,'' has enjoyed  
increased readership as a result of the success of ``Divine 
Secret.'' Originally published in 1996 with 20,000 sales, the 
reissued paperback of ``Little Altars Everywhere'' has sold 800,000 
copies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Little Altars Everywhere,'' which won the 1992 Western States  
Book Award for fiction, focuses on ya-ya Siddalee Walker's 1960s 
effort to figure out the mysteries of Catholicism and the cult of 
popularity in Louisiana. Wells considers it a companion book to 
``Divine Secrets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Both teach that even if we don't necessarily understand each  
other we do have to love and accept each other,'' she says. ``We 
have to learn to forgive the tiny murders of the soul that occur in 
every family. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, Vivi hit her kids a couple of times, but she also  
instilled in them a sense of rapture and a joy for life,'' she says 
of one of the petite ya-yas, Walker's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to replace blame for what our parents didn't do with  
gratitude for what they did do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells has been commuting between Seattle and the town on which  
fictional Thornton, La., is based, gathering information for her 
third book -- which is not about ya-yas, though she promises more on 
that theme. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the same world but a different culture in that world,''  
Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's easier to write about the culture when you're living in  
that world -- eating that gumbo, listening to swamp pop on the 
radio, hearing that little Cajun sound in people's voices. 
Louisiana is just not like any other place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wells graduated from Louisiana State University in the 1970s  
with an English degree and then spent years in New York City 
performing in off-Broadway plays and writing her own. 
</P>
<P>
	She visited Seattle in 1982 to start a chapter of Performing  
Artists for Nuclear Disarmament and, deciding this was her kind of 
place, moved here the next year. 
</P>
<P>
	She opened her own one-woman show, ``Splittin' Hairs,'' at the  
Seattle Repertory Theater in 1984, playing a Louisiana hairdresser 
obsessed with the effects of nuclear radiation on the human body -- 
and also portraying 10 other characters. She went on to tour with 
the play in 50 cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells also wrote and starred in ``Gloria Duplex,'' which debuted  
at Seattle's Empty Space Theater in 1987. The play concerns a New 
Orleans stripper who sees God's face in a mirror ball of the Kitten 
Paradise Temple and Lounge.

<HEADLINE> 2 Charged in Death of Boy Witness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- Two brothers were charged today with  
the murders of an 8-year-old boy and his mother. The boy was 
scheduled to testify against one of the brothers in another murder 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Peeler, 27, and Adrian Peeler, 22, were each charged  
with murder, conspiracy to commit murder and two counts of capital 
felony in the slayings of Leroy ``B.J.'' Brown Jr., 8, and his 
mother, Karen Clarke, 29, said Bridgeport State's Attorney Jonathan 
Benedict. 
</P>
<P>
	Leroy and his mother were ``apparently murdered for living up to  
their civic duty,'' U.S. Attorney Stephen Robinson said today. 
``Even the most jaded among us was moved by the littlest hero.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The capital felony charges could result in the death penalty.  
</P>
<P>
	The Peeler brothers, both of whom had been in police custody on  
unrelated charges, were denied bond at their arraignment this 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Preston Tisdale, their public defender, said he wanted to hire a  
private attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, this is a very unfortunate circumstance,'' Tisdale  
told the judge. ``It's my understanding that both individuals 
strongly assert their innocence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clarke and her son were shot to death in their Bridgeport home  
on Jan. 7 as they returned from grocery shopping. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy had been scheduled to testify against Russell Peeler in  
the May 1998 shooting death of Rudolph Snead Jr., Karen Clarke's 
fiance. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's witness protection program came under sharp  
criticism after the slayings of Leroy and his mother. Clarke had 
received police protection for a short time after the Snead 
slaying, but found the officers' presence intrusive.

	BRANDON, Fla. (AP) -- A man out on bail on charges of striking

<HEADLINE> Clintons Pay $89,951 in U.S. Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, paid  
a smaller part of their 1998 income in federal taxes than the 
average person in their bracket, giving the government 17 percent 
of the $504,109 they earned. 
</P>
<P>
	Tax returns released Tuesday by the White House showed the  
Clintons earned $65,402 less than they did in 1997 and paid $89,951 
in federal taxes this year. They overpaid their taxes by $4,267, 
which will be applied to next year's tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, paid $52,951 in  
federal taxes for 1998, or 23 percent of $224,132 in adjusted gross 
income. After being criticized for giving only $353 to charity the 
year before, the Gores opened their wallets wide in 1998 with 
$15,197 in gifts to causes including religious institutions, 
education organizations, groups that aid the homeless and mentally 
ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons' 1998 return closely mirrored that from the  
previous year, when they reported $569,511 in adjusted gross income 
and paid $91,964, or 16 percent, in federal taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Among recent presidents at similar points in their White House  
years, the Bushes paid 15 percent of their incomes in federal taxes 
in 1991 and 22 percent in 1990, the Reagans 27.5 percent and 25 
percent in 1986 and 1987, the Carters 34 percent and 33 percent in 
1978 and 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent Internal Revenue Service statistics say  
taxpayers earning between $200,000 and $500,000 from 1994 to 1996 
paid in taxes an average of 25.5 percent of adjusted gross income. 
For incomes between $500,000 and $1 million, the average was 30 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, 1.2 million taxpayers had adjusted gross incomes  
between $200,000 and $500,000, and 200,000 incomes between $500,000 
and $1 million. That's out of 120.4 million tax returns filed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons reported $509,345 in total income, reduced to  
$504,109 after deduction of self-employment taxes. Income sources 
included $200,000 from Clinton's salary as president, $16,665 in 
interest, $16,736 in dividends, $1,329 in taxable refunds or 
credits, $74,289 in business income, $200,318 in capital gains and 
$8 in other income from two small investments. 
</P>
<P>
	The dividend and interest income included $12,000 from the Henry  
G. Freeman Jr. Pin Money Fund, a trust fund established in 1912 for 
the spouse of the president. As in previous years, the first lady 
will contribute that money to charity, the White House said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons took a $161,938 deduction for charitable gifts,  
including $99,220 for gifts in 1998 and $62,718 in gifts carried 
over from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	The $74,289 in business income came from profits generated by a  
book written several years ago by Mrs. Clinton about child rearing, 
``It Takes a Village.'' Proceeds from another book she wrote, about 
the family cat, Socks, and dog, Buddy, go directly to the National 
Park Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said all book income is  
donated to charity, minus taxes and administrative expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The first family received $53,462 in short-term capital gains  
and $146,856 in long-term capital gains -- both from the Pell Rudman 
Trust Co., holder of a private trust for the Clintons. The 
arrangement shields the Clintons from involvement with their 
investments and prevents public disclosure of their income sources.

<HEADLINE> WTO Delays Naming New Leader </HEADLINE>

<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Members of the World Trade Organization on  
Wednesday put off a decision on naming a new leader, likely 
delaying a choice until the current one leaves. 
</P>
<P>
	The 134 nations have been deadlocked over a successor for Renato  
Ruggiero, an Italian trade official who announced last year he 
would step down as director-general on April 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The nations were not expected to meet again until Ruggiero's  
final day in office. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining candidates are Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai  
Panitchpakdi and former New Zealand Premier Mike Moore. Supachai is 
believed to have the backing of slightly more nations than Moore. 
Moore, though, is supported by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruggiero has said he will not stay on beyond the end of the  
month.

<HEADLINE> Japan Has Record Bankruptcy Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Bankrupt Japanese companies left behind $127  
billion (15.2 trillion yen) in debts in fiscal year 1998 -- the most 
since World War II, a private credit research firm said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo-based Teikoku Databank Ltd. said that the debt load of  
failed companies was 0.4 percent higher than the previous fiscal 
year. The total number of bankruptcies rose 0.3 percent to 17,497 
for fiscal 1998, which ended March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	In March alone, the number of corporate bankruptcies fell by 30  
percent from the year earlier to 1,269 cases. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency said this reflected the impact of recent government  
steps to ease the credit crunch at small- and medium-sized 
companies and pull the economy out of its worst recession in 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, debt left behind by insolvent companies jumped 43 percent  
over last March to $26.6 billion -- the highest amount ever for a 
single month, Teikoku said.

<HEADLINE> Court Won't OK Bible-Based Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DECATUR, Ala. (AP) -- Residents seeking to form a town whose only  
law would be the Ten Commandments and the teachings of Jesus were 
thwarted by conventional legal channels. 
</P>
<P>
	Probate Judge Bobby Day ruled Tuesday that those who supported  
forming the new community of Brooksville had failed to lay the 
groundwork required by state law for an incorporation vote. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does not even begin to meet the minimum standards,'' said  
Day, who refused a last-minute request by backers to delay the 
hearing. He was not asked to address the question of whether a town 
could use the Bible for its laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Morris, an attorney for backers of the proposed town, said  
they would try again to incorporate, as allowed under Day's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of Brooksville, an unincorporated community in northern  
Alabama, is already in the city of Priceville. It consists of 
little more than a few dozen houses and mobile homes situated 
around a two-lane blacktop. 
</P>
<P>
	Evangelist James R. Henderson and others wanted to form a new  
town that would use the Ten Commandments and Jesus' teachings as 
laws, with citizens providing their own protection through a 
community watch. 
</P>
<P>
	The only officeholder would be a volunteer mayor, and each of  
the town's 600 residents would serve on the City Council. The plan 
called for the King James Bible to become the town's charter and 
the Ten Commandments its ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
	While 160 people signed a petition in favor of forming the town,  
380 signed petitions against it. The judge ruled the proposal 
invalid because the petition included too few signatures and lacked 
maps showing exactly where the community would be located. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the four men who were at the heart of the incorporation  
effort attended Tuesday's hearing and could not be located for 
comment at their homes or businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Bible rules are great, but you can't live by them alone,''  
said Dot Brinkley, one of about 20 opponents who attended the 
hearing. ``They're just telling us to get a gun and protect 
ourselves. We've got to have other things and sewer mains.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge ruled that Henderson's group could try again to hold a  
vote on forming a new town, but there was no indication on whether 
such an attempt would be made.

<HEADLINE> Dems Seek Campaign Funding Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democrats began a signature drive  
Wednesday aimed at forcing Republican leaders to allow a vote on 
legislation to overhaul campaign financing law. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Marty Meehan, D-Mass., said Democrats were resorting to the  
signature drive because ``it has become painfully clear that 
whoever is calling the shots for the Republican leadership has no 
intention of scheduling a vote'' this session. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the rarely used ``discharge petition'' procedure,  
supporters of a bill can force its consideration on the floor if 
they can come up with the signatures of a majority 218 members. 
</P>
<P>
	As of late-afternoon Wednesday, the petition, started by a group  
of moderate Democrats called the ``Blue Dogs,'' had 176 signatures. 
All were Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Meehan and Republican Rep. Christopher Shays of Connecticut are  
the chief sponsors of a campaign finance overhaul bill that last 
year overcame stiff resistance from the GOP leadership and passed 
252-179. Then-Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., agreed to allow a vote 
after a petition drive neared the 218 mark. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar Senate bill, sponsored by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz.,  
and Russell Feingold, D-Wis., had 52 supporters but, with little 
time left in the session, couldn't get the 60 votes needed to break 
a filibuster and bring it to a final vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Shays' office said new Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has  
promised to give them a vote this year but has not set a date. 
Hastert spokesman John Feehery said the speaker was thinking about 
holding the vote this fall after the House finishes work on the 
year 2000 spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's now or never,'' said House Democratic leader Dick  
Gephardt of Missouri. ``'Wait until August' is just another excuse 
for why the House won't pass campaign reform again this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ann McBride of Common Cause, a government finance watchdog, said  
Hastert knows the Shays-Meehan bill would pass if it gets a vote 
``and that is exactly what he is afraid of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shays has not signed the petition, but urged his party to take  
swift action on the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a colossal mistake for Republican members of  
Congress to allow themselves to be dragged to the altar kicking and 
screaming,'' Shays said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Shays-Meehan bill would ban federal ``soft money'' --  
unlimited and unregulated donations to political parties -- and 
would expand disclosure requirements. It also would restrict issue 
ads, which seek to influence elections under the guise of educating 
voters.

<HEADLINE> Hubble Finds Most Distant Galaxy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	It is the oldest, most distant object ever detected -- a galaxy  
full of new stars, 13 billion light-years from Earth. Its 
discoverers have dubbed it ``Sharon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The galaxy found by astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope  
lies near the edge of the universe. Its presence was detected by 
its faint ultraviolet light, which is invisible to conventional 
telescopes. 
</P>
<P>
	Paradoxically, the oldest known galaxy -- named after the sister  
of one of its discoverers -- appears young to us. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because the deeper astronomers look into space, the  
further back in time they are looking. It takes so long for light 
traveling through space to reach Earth that astronomers scanning 
the edges of the universe are seeing objects as they were billions 
of years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	By some estimates, we are seeing the galaxy as it existed 1  
billion years after the Big Bang, the colossal explosion believed 
to have created the universe. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery by researchers at the State University of New York  
at Stony Brook was reported in today's issue of the journal Nature. 
It is the third time in the past year that astronomers have found 
what were thought to be the most distant objects yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Other astronomers said the finding can help them determine when  
galaxies formed and developed, and learn more about the origins of 
the chemical elements that make life possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finding the most distant galaxies is akin to finding the  
oldest fossils on Earth,'' said Patrick McCarthy of the Carnegie 
Institution Observatories in Pasadena, Calif. ``They give you a 
handle on the timing and processes by which the first recognizable 
galaxies coalesced from the primordial sea of light elements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galaxies appear to come in two basic designs -- disc-shaped  
spiral galaxies like the Milky Way, and more massive, elliptical 
galaxies. But the SUNY researchers said their target is much too 
far away even for the Hubble to see clearly, so they can't say what 
type it might be. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really not interesting to look at,'' said Kenneth  
Lanzetta, co-author of the Nature study. ``There is no detail to be 
seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the new galaxy is so faint that some astronomers said  
they might have to wait until better instruments are developed to 
learn something from it. Richard Green of the Kitt Peak National 
Observatory in Tucson, Ariz., said the discovery is ``at the limit 
of our grasp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, records for the most distant objects in space  
stood for years. But sensitive detectors on the Hubble and large 
ground-based telescopes are capturing the faintest light from the 
most distant neighborhoods of the cosmos, and the record books are 
being rewritten every few months. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, Princeton University researchers detected the most  
distant quasar known. But the distance given, about 13 billion 
light-years away, was only a rough estimate and not as precise as 
the SUNY finding, which has been accepted by other astronomers as 
the most distant so far. Last May, a University of Hawaii team 
using the Keck telescope discovered a galaxy 12.3 billion 
light-years away. 
</P>
<P>
	The SUNY team examined a deep and narrow wedge of space in 1997,  
using a spectrograph and other instruments on the Hubble. They used 
computers to separate out 400 overlapping objects and uncover the 
distant galaxy. 
</P>
<P>
	The SUNY astronomers whimsically nicknamed their find after the  
sister of researcher Sebastian Pascarelle. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon Pascarelle is a 32-year-old New York investment baker and  
``total liberal arts major'' who avoided science and math at 
Skidmore College. She became fascinated by her brother's dinnertime 
chat about the universe and pestered him to name something in the 
heavens after her. 
</P>
<P>
	She was flattered when he did so -- until she saw the galaxy's  
image and a blurted, ``It's just a dot!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted a planet named after me,'' she said. ``I guess I'll  
have to settle for a galaxy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon's fame may be fleeting -- both for the galaxy and the  
banker. Lanzetta said the SUNY team will soon publish another study 
showing a half-dozen galaxies even deeper in space and closer to 
the dawn of time. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot more out there,'' Lanzetta said.

<HEADLINE> Barrymore Studied for Film Venture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Drew Barrymore might be a Hollywood veteran,  
but she still did her movie homework before producing her first 
film. 
</P>
<P>
	After teaming up with 31-year-old Nancy Juvonen, Barrymore  
rolled up her sleeves and spent two years deconstructing the film 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	The duo converted a room in Barrymore's home into an office,  
formed a production company, pored over scripts and met with agents 
and studio executives. 
</P>
<P>
	They also dissected and analyzed their own tastes in movies to  
try to determine what young audiences want to see. Then they made 
their first movie -- ``Never Been Kissed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We wouldn't have the wholeness without each other,''  
Barrymore, 24, said. ``Everyone wants that producer plaque on their 
door, but it takes an extraordinary amount of work to get there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gambit seems to have worked. ``Never Been Kissed'' opened in  
second place behind ``The Matrix'' last weekend, bringing in about 
$12 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Barrymore, who is John Barrymore's granddaughter, grew up in  
Hollywood and starred in ``E.T.: The Extraterrestrial'' at age 6. 
She has more than two dozen film credits to her name.

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes at Record 10,411.66 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors anxious about earnings dumped  
technology shares once again today, nearly spoiling a rally in blue 
chip stocks that sent the Dow Jones industrials to another closing 
high -- up 16.65 to 10,411.66. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index, which is heavily weighted with  
technology issues, fell sharply in what was expected to be 
record-high volume. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index also retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	The S&AMP;P 500 fell 21.32 to 1,328.50, and the Nasdaq composite  
fell 76.01 to 2,507.49. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 11-to-7 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,769 up, 1,282 down and 532 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 949.68 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
808.03 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 6.00 to 625.67, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index declined 1.68 to 736.12. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.15 to 417.39.  
</P>
<P>
	But as investors sold tech shares for a second day, they  
replaced them with manufacturing, transportation and 
basic-materials stocks that have been out of favor for some time. 
That buying sent the Dow past 10,500 for the first time, but the 
index gave up ground before closing up 16.65 at 10,411.66, its 
third straight record high close. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are returning to manufacturing stocks amid the growing  
belief that the world economy is recovering, said Peter Canelo, 
U.S. investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. Threats 
of a world-wide recession had ``really (been) the killer for these 
export-sensitive industrial based companies,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ciaran O'Kelly, a stock trader at Salomon Smith Barney had a  
simpler explanation. Spooked by a warning late Tuesday from Intel 
that revenues from chip sales might soften in the second quarter, 
investors yanked money while they could out of risky high-tech 
issues, particularly Internet-related stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors who have had large profits in tech names, and in  
Internet technology in particular, are losing their nerves a 
little,'' O'Kelly said. ``It's almost a defensive strategy to sell 
Internet stocks, cash in and put the money to work and go 
bottom-fishing'' in cheaper names. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders among the 30 Dow component were studded by stocks  
that are sensitive to changes in the global economy, including 
Alcoa, up more than 6 points; Caterpillar, up nearly 6; Boeing, up 
more than 4; and International Paper, up nearly 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation stocks also climbed, most notably airline shares,  
pushing the Dow Transportation average higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow component J.P. Morgan soared, after the bank holding  
company's first-quarter earnings were nearly double what analysts 
expected. Fleet Financial was up 7/8 at 43 15/16 after the 
Boston-based bank also beat estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	But those two stocks failed to carry the entire financial  
services sector higher, an illustration, O'Kelly said, that they 
are too expensive for the bargain hunters who held sway. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Intel fell sharply, fueling a sell-off in computer  
related issues. The computer chip maker reported first-quarter net 
earnings 2 cents a share above analysts' expectations late Tuesday, 
but said second-quarter sales might be soft. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer stocks were also big losers. Dow components Procter &AMP;  
Gamble and Johnson &AMP; Johnson were sharply lower.

<HEADLINE> Minn. Faculty Accused in Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- The former head of Minnesota's academic  
counseling unit says some faculty members pressured by the 
basketball program were willing to help keep players eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	In documents provided to the Saint Paul Pioneer Press, Elayne  
Donahue said faculty members gave players final grades before their 
course work was completed and that grades sometimes were changed 
years after players enrolled in courses. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the new accusations:  
</P>
<P>
	--Academic counselor Alonzo Newby engineered last-minute switches  
in the grading method for two of Antoine Broxsie's fall 1997 
courses, ensuring Broxsie would remain academically eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	--Academic counselors reported concerns that one professor was  
told to give player Kevin Clark a ``B-'' in a course so he could 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	--Coach Clem Haskins visited instructors on behalf of at least  
two players and gave one teacher free tickets to a basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
	--An administrator expressed concern that he was being pressured  
to accept an athlete who did not meet requirements into the 
self-designed study program. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark said Tuesday night he doesn't remember taking the class  
and can't comment because ``the school won't let us.'' Athletic 
director Mark Dienhart said Tuesday night that Schoemann 
``investigated the allegation and was unable to find substantiation 
to justify the claim.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two law firms hired by the university continue to investigate  
charges of academic fraud after allegations by former university 
employee Jan Gangelhoff. She said she did more than 400 pieces of 
course work for 20 players from 1993 to 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents include four memos describing last-minute changes  
that gave Broxsie nonletter grades in algebra and climatology 
courses in the fall of 1997, guaranteeing he would remain eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	Newby allegedly contacted Broxsie's academic adviser, Mary Ellen  
Shaw, seeking a petition to change from letter grades, according to 
an account written by Jennifer Franko, executive secretary in the 
General College Academic Support Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Shaw nor Franko returned repeated telephone calls. Newby  
declined to comment through his attorney. Broxsie's attorney, Phil 
Resnick, said he could not comment until he has reviewed the memos.

<HEADLINE> Food, Parties Mark Taxation Ritual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Folks who wait until the last day to trudge to  
the post office with their income tax payments have a lot of 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Postal Service estimated 40 million tax forms will be mailed  
Thursday, and in many communities there will be a party to mark the 
event. Many are sponsored by local radio stations and merchants 
offer free candy and other goodies. 
</P>
<P>
	Postal officials say free food will be available at dozens of  
offices across the country, with donations being provided by local 
outlets of Pizza Hut, Chick-fil-A, Kentucky Fried Chicken, 
McDonald's and Bruegger's bagels. 
</P>
<P>
	Music will be provided in various locations by barbershop  
quartets, local collage bands and school students. 
</P>
<P>
	Some folks may even find a second job waiting.  
</P>
<P>
	In Laguna Beach, Calif., for example, producers of the ``Got  
Milk'' advertising campaign will offer screen tests to late filers 
who think they have star quality. 
</P>
<P>
	For those more trusting in luck, state lottery officials will  
give out free scratch-off tickets in the ``Instant Refund'' game in 
Norfolk and Charlottesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	For dedicated baseball fans, a mobile post office will be set up  
outside the ballpark in Phoenix, so they can drop off their taxes 
on the way to the game between the Dodgers and Diamondbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Angry taxpayers who want to exercise their throwing arm can go  
to Harrisburg, Pa., or Sacramento, Calif., where tax agents will be 
present in dunking tanks. 
</P>
<P>
	The patriotic or historically minded may want to mail their tax  
forms in Hartford, New Haven or Putnam, Conn.; Gainesville, Fla,; 
Greenville, Pa.; Bryan, Texas or Clarksburg, W. Va. -- all of which 
claim that Uncle Sam will be present. 
</P>
<P>
	A radio station in Bridgman, Mich. will offer aspirin to tax  
filers in that community, while in Pittsburgh a local drug store 
chain is providing samples of Mylanta. 
</P>
<P>
	And taxpayers in Harrisburg who aren't completely tapped out  
will also have the opportunity to donate to the Central 
Pennsylvania Blood Bank.

<HEADLINE> Editorial Roundup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Here are excerpts from editorials in newspapers in the United  
States and abroad: 

</P>
<P>
	April 7  
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle Times, on Medicare and Social Security reforms:  
</P>
<P>
	Estimates now show Medicare and Social Security will remain  
solvent longer than previously expected. Whoop-de-doo. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong economy pushed Medicare just seven years further from  
the brink of bankruptcy to 2015, and the day of reckoning for 
Social Security moves two years, to 2034. 
</P>
<P>
	But when the market cools, the same structural flaws to Medicare  
and Social Security will remain. Young workers and baby boomers 
face the same bad choices -- higher payroll taxes or fewer benefits 
-- unless Congress and the White House cooperate on permanent fixes 
for the government's healthcare and retirement programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Setting aside some of the projected budget surplus, as Clinton  
proposes, is a small step toward solvency of Social Security. But 
it is not real reform and it does nothing to address the growing 
demand by young workers for a better, lasting return on their 
compulsory investments. 
</P>
<P>
	The surplus gambit also leaves Medicare's skyrocketing costs  
unabated. Instead of adopting necessary belt-tightening measures 
and elements of private competition recommended by the defunct 
bipartisan Medicare commission, the White House wants -- you guessed 
it -- a diversion of the budget surplus to shore up the program and 
expand benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Faint-hearted policymakers are misusing the new report to  
rationalize inaction. 

</P>
<P>
	April 10  
</P>
<P>
	The Orlando Sentinel, on Kosovo crisis:  
</P>
<P>
	One of the key voices in the Kosovo crisis that's not receiving  
enough attention is Russia's. The United States and its North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization buddies should listen up. ... 
</P>
<P>
	NATO's attack on Yugoslavia represents much more than a passing  
interest for Russia. Moscow's ethnic and political ties with the 
Serbs go way back. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians ... are furious that their attempts to prevent NATO  
intervention failed. Ditto for their efforts to shift the emphasis 
in that crisis back to a diplomatic course. 
</P>
<P>
	And ... NATO's behavior in Yugoslavia is validating the worst  
fears of Russians who have seen NATO expansion as aggression. ... 
</P>
<P>
	The Russians are right: It's time to negotiate again.  
Yugoslavia, while holding its ground, has been beat up pretty 
badly. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Russian President Boris Yeltsin is said to be readying a new  
peace initiative. The United States and its NATO allies should 
consider it carefully. 

</P>
<P>
	April 9  
</P>
<P>
	The Facts, Brazoria County, Texas, on assisted suicide:  
</P>
<P>
	Jack Kevorkian, the so-called Dr. Death because he has assisted  
in 130 suicides this decade, served as a poor advocate for an 
individual's right to choose a graceful death. In the end, 
Kevorkian's crusade was egotistical, his methods sadistic and his 
compassion absent. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian had hoped his recent trial would intensify the debate  
over whether physicians should be allowed to end the lives of 
suffering people. It did not. Kevorkian, found guilty of 
second-degree murder for a videotaped incident broadcast on 60 
Minutes, will likely be sent to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	His prison sentence, however, should not end the national  
discussion of euthanasia. The question remains: If a person 
suffering from a terminal illness prefers to end their life rather 
than continue until their body finally gives up, does the state 
have a right to deny them their wish? 
</P>
<P>
	It's a question that crosses the boundaries of religion, medical  
ethics and an individual's rights. Granted, most Americans do not 
want to talk about death. But there is no denying that medical 
technology is artificially prolonging life, and in some 
circumstances, lives that are too often painful and humiliating. 
...
</P>
<P>
	Assisted suicide is an issue Americans must come to grips with.  
Medical ethicists, religious leaders, health care providers must 
join the debate and keep it the forefront of American dialogue. ... 

</P>
<P>
	April 7  
</P>
<P>
	The Blade, Toledo, Ohio, on censorship and schools:  
</P>
<P>
	When a book of acknowledged literary merit is banned by a higher  
authority, whether an agency of central government or law 
enforcement, it's called censorship. When books are banned from the 
classroom because of pressure from parents or advocacy groups, it's 
called being sensitive to the standards of the community. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact is that self-appointed censors in tandem with parents  
who have no faith in the judgment of teachers are mounting 
successful campaigns to remove books from the curricula at schools 
around the state. 
</P>
<P>
	School boards must stand up to those who believe the only good  
book is a bland book. They must oppose political correctness in the 
selection of texts, and support teachers who want a well-rounded 
literature curriculum. 

</P>
<P>
	April 12  
</P>
<P>
	San Jose Mercury News, on IBM and Internet privacy:  
</P>
<P>
	IBM announced last week it will use its clout as a $60 million  
advertiser to promote privacy on the Internet. Many in high tech 
are hoping its plan to buy ads only on Web sites that post privacy 
policies will be the ripple that forestalls a wave of government 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM is acting out of self-interest and in the interest of an  
industry that's under pressure to show that self-regulation works. 
The Federal Trade Commission is threatening to step in with 
controls if it doesn't see encouraging evidence soon. Congress, 
with a slew of bills before it, may be tempted as well. 
</P>
<P>
	An FTC survey last year showed that only 14 percent of Internet  
sites had privacy policies. IBM said that only 30 percent of the 
780 sites on which it advertises had them. Those that didn't will 
have until June 1 to adopt them -- or lose Big Blue's business. 
</P>
<P>
	While the ability to profile customers by collecting personal  
information is part of the appeal of Internet commerce, it also may 
be dampening growth. People cite fear of a loss of privacy as the 
number one reason they're reluctant to do business on the Web. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Like many observers, we haven't yet decided the extent to which  
we think online privacy needs government regulation. Congress 
already has made it unlawful for Web sites to solicit personal 
information from minors. It should take action to protect the 
confidentiality of people's health and medical histories and 
perhaps financial records as well. 

</P>
<P>
	April 7  
</P>
<P>
	Charleston (W.Va.) Daily Mail, on violence laws:  
</P>
<P>
	Bill Clinton wants to put political correctness in the criminal  
code. Last week he asked Congress to make violence against 
homosexuals a special crime. 
</P>
<P>
	As President Reagan once said, there he goes again.  
</P>
<P>
	Such a law is neither necessary nor desirable. Singling out a  
specific group of citizens for special treatment is the antithesis 
of the American experiment in democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course violence against homosexuals is horrible. So is  
violence against heterosexuals. The sexual orientation of the 
victim doesn't matter. All acts of violence are hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	That homosexuals occasionally are targeted for violence simply  
because of whom they love is reprehensible. 
</P>
<P>
	It is also criminal. Much was made of the murder of Matthew  
Shepard in Wyoming, and rightly so. Shepard was singled out for 
torture and murder by thugs simply because of his sexual 
orientation. 
</P>
<P>
	But no special law was needed to bring justice in Wyoming.  
</P>
<P>
	One of the men accused of killing Shepard pleaded guilty and was  
sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison -- one for 
kidnapping Shepard, the other for his murder. 
</P>
<P>
	How would a special hate crimes law punish him further? ...  

</P>
<P>
	April 11  
</P>
<P>
	The Sunday Oregonian, Portland, on Medicare and prescription  
drugs: 
</P>
<P>
	Pharmacies are not only the center of the latest Medicare  
debate. According to U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., pharmacies are 
the vanguard in the next wave of preventive care. Existing and new 
drugs are helping the elderly avoid hospitalizations, surgeries and 
long-term disabilities. Drugs can forestall such conditions as 
strokes, osteoporosis and Alzheimer's disease, resulting in 
significant cost savings. 
</P>
<P>
	So it makes both short- and long-term sense to try to offer drug  
coverage -- at least to the more needy of the nation's seniors. 
</P>
<P>
	Wyden wants to make prescription drugs a Medicare benefit. To  
pay for his plan, Wyden is looking at an increase in the federal 
tobacco tax and at savings from reducing the estimated 10 percent 
of Medicare money that is wasted. That scheme may or may not work, 
but it's better than anything coming out of the White House right 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	It would still be best if prescription drug coverage could be  
considered as part of a complete overhaul of Medicare this year. 
But it that's not possible, it's right to try to do something so 
that low-income seniors aren't abandoned at ground zero. 

</P>
<P>
	April 9.  
</P>
<P>
	The State, Columbia, S.C., on the nation's economy:  
</P>
<P>
	Despite trouble in Kosovo, despite worries that the soaring Dow  
Jones is a bubble that might burst, our economy keeps humming right 
along. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, the unemployment rate fell to a 29-year low of 4.2  
percent, and inflation shows no signs of accelerating. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Negative news is being shrugged off. In the past month, jet fuel  
prices rose almost 40 percent, but few at the airlines are 
complaining. ``No big deal,'' said one top executive. After all, 
the prices are still rock-bottom compared with the cost of jet fuel 
for most of the past 10 years. And the same goes for gasoline. Its 
price has risen a dime or so in the past month. But American 
motorists are still paying near-record lows to gas up. ... 
</P>
<P>
	No one knows what the future holds, but economically, the  
present is pretty good. 

</P>
<P>
	April 14  
</P>
<P>
	The Sun, London, on Yugoslavia:  
</P>
<P>
	There are some people who don't believe we should be waging war  
on the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Let them read the horrific reports of rape camps and the murder  
of a pregnant woman and see if they feel the same way. 
</P>
<P>
	If they do, they should hang their heads in shame.  
</P>
<P>
	Serbian soldiers are behaving like barbarians. They deserve to  
be shot like wild dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the NATO pilot who bombed a passenger train by mistake,  
the Serbs know exactly what they are doing. 
</P>
<P>
	They mean to rape and kill innocent civilians. Their despicable  
actions are no accident. 
</P>
<P>
	The sooner NATO wins this wholly justified war, the better.  
</P>
<P>
	Slobba's animals are an affront to humanity.  

</P>
<P>
	April 14  
</P>
<P>
	The Daily Telegraph, London, on Yugoslvaia:  
</P>
<P>
	Three weeks after the onset of war against Serbia, the Prime  
Minister has at last deigned to explain the government's bellicose 
policy to the House of Commons. It was a perfunctory performance, 
one that restated the moral purpose of military action in the 
Balkans but failed to offer evidence that the campaign is achieving 
worthwhile results. 
</P>
<P>
	As the leader of a supporting power, Mr. Blair is in the  
difficult position of defending a policy that he does not control. 
It is the White House that is chiefly responsible for the planning 
and conduct of a war that has involved inadequate levels of force 
at every stage, uncannily reminiscent of the ill-fated 
incrementalism of the Vietnam war. ... It is now clear that NATO 
made a strategic error in threatening Mr. Milosevic before it had a 
credible level of military force in the region. ... 

</P>
<P>
	April 14  
</P>
<P>
	Il Foglio, Rome, on Yugoslavia:  
</P>
<P>
	If Yugoslavia has been able to survive as an autonomous  
political force in the postwar years, it was thanks to Josip Broz 
Tito. After freeing his country from German and Italian invasions, 
Tito resisted (Soviet dictator Josef) Stalin's pressure, thus 
preventing Yugoslavia from becoming a Russian satellite with a 
limited sovereignty -- like the other Eastern European countries. 
...
</P>
<P>
	With Tuesday's agreement of the Belgrade parliament to join the  
Slavic Union along with Russia and Belarus, (Slobodan) Milosevic 
betrayed Tito's political line as well as his brave defense of the 
Yugoslav independence. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Tito had built a federation based on the parity between the  
different ethnic groups, and on the renunciation to a Serb 
supremacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, if a multi-ethnic Balkan federation, which Tito longed for,  
will ever be discussed again, this will only happen under NATO's 
umbrella and after the defeat of any Serb claim of regional 
domination.

	Bild, Germany, on Kosovo peace accord:  
</P>
<P>
	The accord from Rambouillet contains passages in an appendix  
that concede NATO wide-ranging rights not only in Kosovo, but also 
in the rest of Yugoslavia. Freedom of movement, the use of all 
roads, air and waterways, the right to lodging everywhere, yes also 
to conduct maneuvers. Milosevic did not negotiate about the rights 
of NATO in case of a solution in Kosovo. He rejected the overall 
accord in its entirety. But everything must be negotiable when it 
has to do with peace. That's why these passages open an important 
chance. They could provide the core for negotiations. ...

	Le Figaro, Paris, on the Mont Blanc tunnel fire:  
</P>
<P>
	The tragedy of the Mont Blanc Tunnel opens, once again, the case  
of public irresponsibility. The first conclusions of the official 
investigation (into the fire) are indeed incriminating for the 
French and Italian companies in charge of the tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
	What's more, the dangers posed by the 2,000 trucks using the  
tunnel each day had already been studied. 
</P>
<P>
	On this level, the problem of irresponsibility comes up again:  
The two companies in charge of the tunnel knew of the potential 
dangers, but did not make the necessary arrangements to avoid them. 
</P>
<P>
	We can't ask for ``zero risk,'' which would be silly to expect  
in an overprotected society. However, the dangers born of public 
indifference have become unbearable. We must learn lessons from the 
Mont Blanc drama.

	The Jerusalem Post, on Israel-Russia relationship:  
</P>
<P>
	If there is anything that the team of Prime Minister Benjamin  
Netanyahu and Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon attempt to symbolize to 
the Israeli people, it is a commitment to security. Yet when it 
comes to the threat posed by Russia's ties with Iran, the 
Netanyahu-Sharon team has embraced a policy so fuzzy-headed that it 
resembles their caricature of leftists gone gaga over the peace 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly improving relations with Russia has become a priority.  
... The Netanyahu-Sharon approach is also naive in that it acts as 
if longstanding Russian policy predilections can be bought off with 
minor trade incentives. ... Israel's proper role is to continue to 
urge the United States to withhold lucrative space cooperation with 
Moscow until Russia ends its dangerous trade with Iran. Carrots can 
also be thrown into the mix, but only after the sticks are allowed 
to do their work. In the meantime, Israeli leaders should not play 
politics with the country's security.

	Japan Times, Tokyo, on World Trade Organization:  
</P>
<P>
	With total exports and imports of about $300 billion a year,  
China is too sizable a presence to remain outside the formal world 
trade system. For 13 years, Beijing has negotiated administering 
global trade, but has not yet been able to reach a final agreement 
on the terms of admission to the World Trade Organization or its 
predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	... In the supercharged atmosphere of Washington politics, the  
Republicans are using every possible weapon against the president. 
Even the clear benefits to U.S. businesses can be turned around and 
called bribes. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, Mr. Clinton's policy of strategic engagement, and the goal  
of bringing China into the WTO, is correct. It is far better for 
the U.S. and China to be talking and making mutual progress in 
their relationship. If the U.S. wants to see China change for the 
better, it is far better to engage it. ... Slamming the doors on 
China will only strengthen the hand of hard-liners there, as will 
delivering on Congress's threat to hold any WTO deal up to its own 
scrutiny. Responsible politicians will not use China policy to 
score points. ...

	The Nation, Bangkok, Thailand, on the water festival marking  
traditional New Year: 
</P>
<P>
	In a way, the celebration of Songkran is a reminder of Thailand  
of the distant past -- a bountiful agrarian society blessed with an 
abundance of water that has sustained food security for centuries, 
allowing Thais to take for granted their traditioinal carefree way 
of life. 
</P>
<P>
	Regrettably, this idyllic existence has long ago ceased to apply  
to the chaotic, badly run Third World country that modern Thailand 
has turned out to be. Rowdy water-throwing crowds have become the 
symbol of the Songkran celebration, which has itself become void of 
any meaningful observance of the true spirit of the traditional 
Thai New Year, a time for blessing and communal celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	For many people, particularly those living in drought-stricken  
areas in some parts of the country, Songkran will be a sad affair 
that only serves to heighten their painful day-to-day existence of 
having barely enough water for sustenance. 
</P>
<P>
	To turn a water-rich country like Thailand into a place with a  
chronic water crisis has required a long series of misguided 
policies, atrocious mismanagement of natural resources and 
debilitating inefficiency. All of this has been allowed to happen 
thanks to a widespread and sustained sense of complacency among the 
public.

<HEADLINE> Israelis Stake West Bank Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRACHA, West Bank (AP) -- Trailer houses were perched on one  
hilltop, a few tents on another, in a string of new Israeli 
mini-settlements across the West Bank landscape. They have angered 
the United States, but for settler Elhanan Ariel they are a vital 
foothold. 
</P>
<P>
	Jewish settlers have thrown up the ramshackle settlements in the  
past few months, cutting off Palestinian villages from one another, 
in a campaign that aims to cement Israel's hold on land that it 
captured in the 1967 Mideast war and that the Palestinians want for 
a future state. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to take control of as much land as we can now,'' Ariel  
said Wednesday, as he worked on temporary housing at a new site 
outside the settlement of Itamar. 
</P>
<P>
	He described the drive to seize land as a competition with the  
Palestinians. With a nod to the surrounding area, he added with a 
smile: ``Here, we are going to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Angry U.S. officials charge that Israel pledged not to expand  
settlements beyond their existing boundaries and say such moves 
hinder chances for Mideast peace that the United States has worked 
hard to broker. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Schwartz, the U.S. Embassy spokesman in Tel Aviv, said the  
current settlement drive raises the question of ``whether the 
government of Israel is serious about doing its part to create a 
proper environment for peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz could not confirm a report in the Israeli daily Haaretz  
that U.S. satellites are tracking settlement growth in the West 
Bank and recent photos have revealed at least 12 new settlements in 
the occupied territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Palestinians charge that the Israelis are sabotaging peace  
efforts by taking over West Bank land. The Israeli government 
insists interim peace agreements do not limit expansion of existing 
settlements. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the highway from the site where Ariel worked, another  
settler was breaking rocks with a pickax, improving a rough access 
road to a new mini-settlement on a hilltop about half a mile from 
the settlement of Bracha. 
</P>
<P>
	It isn't much to look at -- two tents, a water tank, a small blue  
tractor, a broken-down truck and a sleepy black and white dog. But 
it is a foothold for later growth. In October, settlers put up 
tents on another hilltop between this site and Bracha: Now it has 
trailer-style houses. 
</P>
<P>
	Didi Remez, coordinator of the settlement watch team for the  
Peace Now movement, which opposes settlement building, said the 
newest site was set up within the last ten days. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of these new settlements are illegal,'' he said, but the  
Israeli government has given settlers tacit approval to build on 
hilltops close to existing settlements. Remez's teams tracking 
settlement growth have found 18 new ones since Israel and the 
Palestinians signed a U.S.-brokered peace deal in October. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon said Tuesday that Israel views the  
construction as new neighborhoods rather than new settlements.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Arrests Bishop for Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- A Roman Catholic bishop was arrested  
Wednesday for his alleged participation in the country's 1994 
genocide. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Minister Jean de Dieu Mucyo said Bishop Augustin Misago  
was being held in ``preventive detention'' until authorities decide 
whether to try him in Kigali or in his diocese of Gikongoro in 
southern Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
	Mucyo refused to elaborate on the charges but said they were  
serious and related to Misago's alleged role in the genocide of 
more than 500,000 minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus. 
</P>
<P>
	President Pasteur Bizimungu and Tutsi survivors of the massacres  
in Gikongoro Prefecture said the bishop refused shelter to Tutsis 
trying to escape death from Hutu mobs and in one case, was 
responsible for sending to their death 19 schoolgirls he had 
ordered expelled from the Kibeho high school, 60 miles south of 
Kigali. 
</P>
<P>
	The private Rwanda News Agency said Misago, one of Rwanda's 11  
bishops, was detained at Kigali's Muhima prison after he apparently 
plotted an escape involving the papal nuncio and the French Embassy 
in Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
	The embassy denied the report, which apparently came following a  
meeting at the ambassador's residence with Misago and the new papal 
envoy. A secretary at the papal residence, contacted by telephone, 
said the nuncio would not answer any questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Misago's arrest appeared imminent after Bizimungu, speaking at  
the fifth anniversary of the genocide at Kibeho last week, called 
for the bishop to either explain himself publicly or wait for 
justice to take its course. Misago, who was present at the ceremony 
that honored 20,000 Tutsis slaughtered at the town's Roman Catholic 
church, did not answer accusations against him. 
</P>
<P>
	In previous interviews, he has denied any involvement in the  
killing. 
</P>
<P>
	African Rights, a human rights group, released a report last  
week calling for Pope John Paul II to facilitate an investigation 
into Misago's role in the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Misago is the highest-ranking church official to be arrested on  
genocide charges. So far, 19 Rwandan priests have been jailed on 
suspicion of aiding the killings, which ended in July 1994 when the 
Tutsi-led Rwandan Patriotic Front won power and ousted the 
extremist Hutu government. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 125,000 people have been jailed on suspicion of  
taking part in the genocide, and more than 1,000 have been tried. 
</P>
<P>
	Relations between the government and the Catholic church have  
been tense. Groups of genocide survivors have demanded a public 
apology from the Catholic clergy for the killings in churches and 
missionary-run schools, where thousands of Tutsis were hacked and 
burned to death by Hutu soldiers and militiamen, often with the 
complicity of the priests.

<HEADLINE> Airline Wants Quick End to Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Officials of United Airlines are telling  
government officials they oppose the gradual phaseout of landing 
rights at airports here and in New York and want the controls 
lifted immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration wants to end limits over three to  
five years on how many planes can land each hour at Chicago's 
O'Hare International and Kennedy International and La Guardia 
airports in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The change would make it easier for start-up airlines to compete  
with more established carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current regulations, the Transportation Department has  
created an advantage for ``incumbent'' carriers, and landing slots 
are bought and sold for as much as $3 million. Without access to 
the slots, airlines cannot land at the airports. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration's plans to phase out the landing rights would  
allow United's competitors time to expand their operations or shift 
their aircraft to provide additional flights to the three 
controlled airports. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, O'Hare is limited to 155 landings and takeoffs each  
hour between 6:45 a. m. and 9:15 p.m. LaGuardia is restricted to 68 
flights per hour between 6 a.m. and midnight, while Kennedy is 
restricted to 77 flights per hour between 3 p.m. and 8 p.m. in the 
winter and 93 flights per hour during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	A United official says the Elk Grove-based airline's preference  
is that the slots be lifted at once, pointing to the implementation 
of airline deregulation as an example. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelly Longmuir, a United vice president, declined to discuss  
the airline's position. But she said the airline supports ``a 
decision that allows market forces to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of Fort Worth, Texas-based American Airlines, the  
nation's second-largest carrier, say they oppose United's position. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some time period for a transition is warranted,'' said  
spokeswoman Mary Frances Fagan.

<HEADLINE> Appeals Court Rules for DiNardo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A federal appeals court on Wednesday threw out  
a lower court ruling that former Vanderbilt football coach Gerry 
DiNardo had to pay the school $281,886 in damages for quitting to 
become coach at LSU. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected U.S. District  
Judge Robert Echols' June 1997 ruling that DiNardo owed damages for 
resigning before his contract had expired. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue was whether a two-year contract extension that  
Vanderbilt gave DiNardo in August 1994 was valid and enforceable. 
That could affect the amount of damages that DiNardo may ultimately 
be required to pay Vanderbilt. 
</P>
<P>
	Appeals Judge John Gibson said it was unclear whether DiNardo's  
brother and attorney, Larry DiNardo, had to approve the contract 
extension before it became enforceable and whether Larry DiNardo's 
failure to object to the terms amounted to approval of the 
extension. 
</P>
<P>
	The case now goes back to Echols in Nashville, Tenn., to resolve  
those issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The original contract Gerry DiNardo signed with Vanderbilt in  
December 1990 included his agreement to reimburse the university if 
he left before his contract expired.

<HEADLINE>  Turkish Secularists Back Ecevit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Cheering supporters call Prime Minister  
Bulent Ecevit the country's only hope for maintaining unity, fixing 
the economy, and most of all, keeping the Islamic party from power. 
</P>
<P>
	Buoyed by the capture of a Kurdish rebel leader and favored by  
the military for his pro-secular stance, Ecevit's party is climbing 
in the polls and appears headed to edge out its rivals in Turkey's 
parliamentary elections this Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	A win would be a comeback for Ecevit, who led the country in the  
1970s but whose Democratic Left Party now has only 59 seats in the 
550-member parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspaper polls indicate that Ecevit's party is likely to take  
about 20 percent of the vote, a fraction of a percent higher than 
Virtue, an Islamic party that is the other top contender. If the 
polls prove correct, Ecevit would still have to form alliances with 
rival parties to rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say Ecevit's unwavering opposition to the Islamic  
movement is attracting voters who had previously divided their 
ballots among the secular parties. The scattered votes allowed the 
Islamic movement to wield far more influence than their numbers 
warranted. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is the only one who isn't exploiting religion,'' Mehmet  
Kubat, a hairdresser, said of Ecevit. ``If he says 'I will not make 
a coalition with Virtue,' you can be sure he won't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He will ... get votes from a lot of parties, even from the  
ultra-nationalists,'' said Oya Berberoglu, a columnist for the 
Hurriyet daily. 
</P>
<P>
	In his 40 years in Turkish politics, the frail-looking,  
unassuming Ecevit has kept a squeaky-clean image. That is 
attracting support away from the other main secular parties, which 
have been plagued by scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecevit frequently appears in a trademark navy blue cap, and has  
spurned fancy cars for cheaper, Turkish-made ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never voted for a leftist party, but this time I will''  
said Hayriye Cetin, a 41-year-old housewife. ``For one thing, 
Ecevit is honest. He is the best of the pack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The capture of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan by Turkish  
commandos in Kenya has further boosted the tough image of Ecevit, 
who ordered Turkish troops to invade Cyprus when he served as 
premier in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	At election rallies, supporters bearing the party's flag -- a  
white dove on a sky blue background -- chant ``Our hope is Ecevit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other backers greet him at rallies with banners reading  
``Welcome, the conqueror of Kenya.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He has used his time in government well, projecting the image  
of a trustworthy, responsible leader,'' said Ahmet Taner Kislali, a 
professor of political science ``And the Ocalan capture will be 
added to this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast to his unyielding image, Ecevit, a former  
journalist, poet and translator of Sanskrit literature, appears 
soft and fatherly at election rallies. 
</P>
<P>
	He addresses crowds in a quiet voice. He is known to be deeply  
devoted to his wife, Rahsan, his high-school sweetheart and deputy 
chairwoman of the party. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Turks, however, seem unmoved by what newspapers are calling  
the ``Ecevit wind'' that is sweeping the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``He cannot do anything against the rise of Virtue,'' said Soner  
Yalcin, a waiter. ``He wasn't even physically there when they 
caught (Ocalan.)''

<HEADLINE> Duke's Brand Steps Out on Coach K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Duke's Mike Krzyzewski joined the short list of coaches whose  
star leaves early to join the NBA. It's a sign of the times that 
instead of asking whether the move is good for the kid any more, 
most people will ask how Coach K kept the talent drain plugged for 
so long. 
</P>
<P>
	Sophomore Elton Brand, the consensus college basketball player  
of the year, announced today he will forgo his last two years of 
eligibility to try his luck in the pros. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski, who is recovering from hip surgery, was gracious in  
thanking Brand, sincere in wishing him well, and letting it go at 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the NBA's new rookie salary scale, the last pick in the  
first round makes almost $2 million in his first three years and up 
to $1 million a year in his fourth. Considering the dollars 
involved, the move is almost always too tempting to pass up. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Lon Babby's client list argues just the opposite. It  
includes former Duke stars Grant Hill, Christian Laettner and 
Cherokee Parks, as well as Tim Duncan, who played four years at 
Wake Forest. But the only thing Babby says he's learned is that 
there is no right answer for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``For Tim and Grant, it was right to stay in school. Some kids  
benefit greatly, not just in terms of their game, but what they 
need to learn about life,'' Babby said. ``The other side is that 
there are lots of kids who don't want to stay or can't afford to. 
As long as the decision is based on good information and support 
from coaches and parents, you respect it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During Krzyzewski's tenure, Duke's principal rival, North  
Carolina, has practically become a finishing school for NBA-bound 
underclassmen. The Tar Heels lost a jug-eared, senior-to-be named 
Michael Jordan not long after Coach K first set foot in Durham, 
N.C., and they lost Antawn Jamison and rookie-of-the-year candidate 
Vince Carter to the pros only last season. And they've still had 
enough talent on hand to make Krzyzewski's life miserable year-in 
and year-out. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand will be hard to replace -- he averaged 18 points and 10  
rebounds, and at 6-foot-8 and 270 pounds, he occupied opposing 
defenses like few players in the college game can. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite the possibility that William Avery and freshman  
Corey Maggette are considering following Brand's career path, they 
will almost certainly return along with Shane Battier and Chris 
Carrawell. And Krzyzewski has signed letters of intent from four 
McDonald's All-America high school stars. 
</P>
<P>
	The uninterrupted flow of high school talent is why the top  
college coaches no longer get worked up when a teen-ager tells them 
he'll be opting for a seven-figure paycheck next fall rather than 
fifth-semester math. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also why those same coaches like to turn the question,  
``How will college basketball survive without these kids?'' on its 
head. What they ask instead is ``How will the NBA survive with 
them?'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year's draft, thankfully, will be thin on knuckleheads.  
Unfortunately, though, it will be even thinner on talent. Besides 
Brand, the only underclassmen whose announcements have merited any 
attention are Maryland's Steve Francis, St. John's Ron Artest and 
Missouri's Albert White. They could be joined by Connecticut's 
Richard Hamilton, Michigan State's Mateen Cleaves, UCLA's Baron 
Davis, Rhode Island's Lamar Odom and Auburn's Chris Porter in any 
combination. Then again, none of them may elect to come out. 
</P>
<P>
	That leaves seniors Wally Szczerbiak of Miami of Ohio, Duke's  
Trajan Langdon, Arizona's Jason Terry and a host of no-names and 
foreign names that even dedicated draftniks will be struggling to 
identify by the time the second round rolls around. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem the last couple of years,'' chief NBA scout Marty  
Blake said, ``is that every kid who has one good game hears from 
somebody that he ought to come out. Usually, the exact opposite is 
true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Had everybody who could have stayed in school for all or even  
part of their four years, these are some of the names that would 
have been in this year's draft as well: Kevin Garnett and Kobe 
Bryant (both went to the NBA from high school), Allen Iverson 
(Georgetown), Stephon Marbury (Georgia Tech), Jamison and Carter 
(North Carolina), Robert Traylor (Michigan), Jason Williams 
(Florida), Paul Pierce (Kansas), Larry Hughes (St. Louis) and Mike 
Bibby (Arizona). 
</P>
<P>
	Think Brand would have left Duke and taken his chances with that  
crowd? 
</P>
<P>
	Think again.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Refugees Receiving Food Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Moving food to the hungry is a Herculean  
effort, a chain of people, wheels and wings connecting the American 
warehouse to the Balkan refugee tent. 
</P>
<P>
	Governments, international institutions and charities are  
rushing all manner of aid to the Kosovar refugees, from the 
emergency rations needed to sustain people staggering across the 
border to dry foodstuffs that can be made into heartier meals once 
people and equipment get more settled. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles Wald and other officials described  
one such chain, and how a shipment that landed this week by 
helicopter brought eight days of food for 10,000 people, or one 
day's worth for 80,000. It consisted of Humanitarian Daily Rations 
-- prepared vegetarian packages, each supplying about 2,100 
calories. 
</P>
<P>
	Each ration costs about $4.25, almost half the cost of the  
military's Meals Ready to Eat packet. Although MREs can be used in 
a pinch, they are designed for U.S. soldiers, contain a heating 
compound and come in four varieties, all with meat and one with 
pork. The refugees are mostly Muslims, prohibited from eating pork. 
</P>
<P>
	--Four tractor-trailers loaded some 80,000 packages at Tracy,  
Calif., about 50 miles from San Francisco, and took them 70 miles 
to Travis Air Force Base, where they were put on a 747. The plane 
flew 12 hours to Ancona, Italy, on the Adriatic Sea. 
</P>
<P>
	--The rations were unloaded at Ancona and put on eight C-130  
transport planes, which flew about 350 miles to Tirana, Albania's 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
	--At Tirana, the rations were loaded onto 24 helicopters and  
flown to their day's destination, the Albanian border town of 
Kukes, about 80 miles away, where makeshift tents house 10,000 
destitute Kosovar refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States is sending other aid to refugee camps, too,  
including 50 tons of high-protein biscuits. Flour, vegetable oil, 
beans and canned fish and meat are among the foodstuffs coming in 
from many countries and sources.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With John Lithgow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- John Lithgow, star of NBC's ``3rd Rock From the  
Sun,'' says -- with a big smile -- that if his acting career fails, 
he now has a backup profession as a singer. 
</P>
<P>
	Lithgow, 53, has made his first recording, ``Singin' in the  
Bathtub.'' The album is designed to please children -- and their 
parents. ``If you have kids, you're going to have to listen to an 
awful lot of their music,'' he said. ``It might as well be music 
you love to hear, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He won't have to perform at children's birthday parties any time  
soon. NBC has picked up ``3rd Rock'' for another season. On a 
recent visit to New York, Lithgow sat down to answer a few 
questions about the new album. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not really a singer's voice,'' Lithgow said, when asked  
to describe his warble. ``Reckless enthusiasm is my strong suit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For ``I Had a Rooster'' and ``From the Indies to the Andes in  
His Undies,'' Lithgow said his sound effects are better than his 
intonation. ``I think at least it sounds like I enjoy what I'm 
doing when I sing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lithgow, pronounced Lith GO, has sung for children since the  
oldest of his three children, now 27, was a baby. He taught himself 
to play the guitar because he loved the idea of playing and singing 
for his own child. Since then, he's sung for children in 
classrooms, at benefits and at music festivals. 
</P>
<P>
	When Sony Wonder suggested a children's CD, he and producer Jai  
Winding began by selecting songs that Lithgow loved when he was 
growing up in Yellow Springs, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once we picked the music, Jai and I played some concerts. I  
wanted the album to have the energy of performance. And it was very 
important to me that we knew these songs delighted kids. As we did 
these concerts, we dropped a couple of songs that weren't working. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jai began to think of riding the swing revival for children,  
which nobody else has thought to do. He contacted Bill Elliott, who 
has a swing orchestra in Los Angeles. I sang five songs with his 
band,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	1. Did anything worry you about making your first recording?  
</P>
<P>
	Lithgow: When I did the sessions singing with the big band, I  
was nervous I was going to wreck everything. Jai said, 'If you make 
a mistake, we can redo you later.' How liberating. Suddenly I 
started singing fantastically well. 
</P>
<P>
	2. Have you ever sung live with a big band?  
</P>
<P>
	Lithgow: I had a marvelous experience at my 25th Harvard  
reunion. The Boston Pops gives a concert every year, and if there's 
a performer from that class, they get to perform with the Pops. I 
was making a film in Italy at the time, 'Cliffhanger.' I loved 
coming back from duking it out with Sylvester Stallone in the belly 
of an upended helicopter to singing with the Boston Pops. It was 
right up there with the five or six most thrilling things I've ever 
done. 
</P>
<P>
	3. Were you thinking ``simple'' when you chose the songs?  
</P>
<P>
	Lithgow: No. Children love great rhymes. If they're a little  
above their heads, I think they like that. A song like 'Triplets' 
has all sorts of references and words a kid is not likely to know. 
That never stopped me when I was a kid. If you look at the song 
list, almost none of them was actually written for children. 'The 
Gnu Song' and 'The Hippopotamus Song' are by the wonderful Flanders 
and Swann. Jai plays piano for those. He's inside my voice. 
'Everybody Eats When They Come to My House' is a Cab Calloway song. 
Jo Stafford and Gordon MacRae sang 'A -- You're Adorable.' 
</P>
<P>
	4. What will you do during this year's break from shooting ``3rd  
Rock''? 
</P>
<P>
	Lithgow: I'm free from mid-April to mid-August. This year I'm  
going to play Don Quixote in a film for TNT cable. We're going to 
shoot in Spain. Bob Hoskins is playing Sancho Panza. 
</P>
<P>
	5. Do you want to do more work on the stage?  
</P>
<P>
	Lithgow: I've thought about that a lot. With only four months  
off from '3rd Rock,' I'd probably have to use every single day for 
it. That gives you no 'down' time. I still have a lot more theater 
to do in my life. When I come to New York, I always cram in several 
plays. I watch with delight and dismay, I'm so jealous of all those 
actors on stage.

<HEADLINE> China Trade Deal May Come in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, trying to placate  
business critics unhappy with its failure to strike a trade 
agreement last week with China, pledged to intensify negotiations 
with the goal of sending a completed deal to Congress in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Commerce Secretary William Daley said he believed U.S. and  
Chinese negotiators could fairly quickly resolve the differences 
that prevented agreement being reached during last week's meeting 
between President Clinton and Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji. 
</P>
<P>
	He disputed suggestions that once an agreement is reached, the  
administration will delay sending it to Congress for fear opponents 
of expanded trade with China have the upper hand because of new 
allegations about human rights abuses and charges that China stole 
U.S. nuclear secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	China is seeking to strike a trade agreement with the United  
States to lower its barriers to American manufactured goods, farm 
products and financial services in return for U.S. support for 
China's membership in the World Trade Organization, the 
Geneva-based body that sets the rules for global trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress must get involved because the United States will be  
required to eliminate its annual review of China's tariff 
privileges once China joins the WTO. The annual debate on renewing 
China's current trade privileges occurs in June each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley said the administration would push for permanent lower  
trade barriers as part of this year's debate if a trade agreement 
with China has been negotiated by June. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we get the deal, we are going with the deal. We have got to  
get China into the WTO,'' Daley said Wednesday. ``That is our goal 
if we get the right deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, China offered what many major U.S. industries  
considered extremely favorable concessions in hopes of reaching 
agreement during Zhu's visit to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton rejected China's package because it did not contain  
enough protections for U.S. steel and textile companies, prompting 
the Chinese to angrily threaten to withdraw the trade concessions 
they had offered in hopes of reaching agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton spoke for 20 minutes by telephone with Zhu on Tuesday  
night, however, and both leaders committed to restarting the talks. 
A joint statement said the two countries will resume negotiations 
in Beijing by the end of this month with an aim to ``move 
intensively'' to a final deal. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Robert Cassidy, the lead China  
negotiator, is expected to travel to Beijing soon to resume the 
talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley made his comments at the kickoff of a new campaign being  
launched with major U.S. companies to educate Americans about the 
advantages of global trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign, to be called ``Trade Globally, Prosper Locally:  
the National Trade Education Tour,'' will visit a number of 
American cities through the rest of the year with a goal of raising 
awareness about the benefits trade provides the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The tour will start in Boston and Providence, R.I., in early May  
and continue over the next eight months with stops also scheduled 
in Chicago, Louisville, Ky., and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``To continue to create high-wage, high-quality jobs in the  
United States, we must do more to expand trade,'' said U.S. Chamber 
of Commerce President Tom Donohue, one of the business sponsors of 
the initiative.

<HEADLINE> Pa. Offering Organ Donor Incentives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Families of Pennsylvania organ donors will  
be eligible for $300 state contributions for the donor's funeral 
expenses in what is believed to be the first incentive program of 
its kind. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is quite controversial,'' said Kevin Sparkman of the  
Delaware Valley Transplant Program, which oversees donations in 
southeastern Pennsylvania. ``Until now, we have always depended 
strictly on altruism to drive organ donation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three-year pilot program, to begin as early as September,  
will be funded with donations from Pennsylvanians renewing their 
driver's licenses, Sparkman said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan doesn't violate federal law barring payment for organs  
because no money goes directly to the donor, supporters say. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a Saudi sheik saying, `I'll give you a million  
dollars for your heart or liver,''' said Mike Dawida, a former 
state senator who sponsored the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	In Pennsylvania last year, 394 donors provided hearts, lungs,  
kidneys, livers, pancreases and colons. But transplants were needed 
by about 4,500 patients, 800 of whom died waiting, organization 
records show.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Trade Surplus Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's trade surplus with the world fell 32.2  
percent in February from the same month last year as a strong yen 
hurt Japanese exports, the government said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The current account surplus -- Japan's broadest measure of trade  
-- slipped to a non-seasonally adjusted $9.34 billion in the second 
month of the year, the Finance Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports in February fell 5.4 percent to $19.88 billion, but the  
overall surplus shrank as exports dropped 13 percent to $29.12 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said that the plunge in exports was a worrying sign of  
more economic troubles ahead for Japan, as strong overseas sales 
have been one of the few factors propping up the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The weakening in exports was a result of ``mostly the strength  
of the yen beginning at the end of last year and even up to now,'' 
said Matthew Poggi, an economist at Lehman Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong yen hurts Japan's exports by making the country's  
products more expensive abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in the surplus was the first fall in three months and  
only the second since April 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The surplus was slightly lower than the $10 billion estimate  
from Tokyo-based economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's huge trade surplus has been a constant source of  
friction with the United States and other trading partners. They 
have been urging Japan to boost its economy to stimulate imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington has also threatened punitive measures unless Tokyo  
opens up its markets to more foreign competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The current account, which measures trade in merchandise,  
services, tourism and investment, is calculated by determining the 
difference between Japan's income from foreign sources against 
payments on foreign obligations. It excludes net capital 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Japan announced that its current account  
surplus for all of 1998 surged 38.7 percent to an unprecedented 
$133.6 billion.

<HEADLINE> K.C. Wizards Coach Ron Newman Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Kansas City Wizards coach Ron Newman  
quit today after the team's 0-4 start. Assistant Ken Fogarty was 
appointed interim coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a mutual understanding,'' said Clark Hunt, one of the  
Wizards' owners/investors. ``Ron knew that there needed to be a 
change to turn around the fortunes of this team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wizards are last in the league in attendance, averaging  
9,546 fans a game. MLS commissioner Doug Logan said before the 
season the team might have to move if attendance did not improve. 
</P>
<P>
	``The player and coaching staff have worked tirelessly to turn  
our fortunes around,'' said Newman, who became coach in October 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pressure to win builds until performance suffers.  
Unfortunately, the release valve is often a change in the top. The 
problem was never the coaching staff or the quality of the 
players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the four-game loss, the Wizards had extended their MLS  
record scoreless streak to 637 minutes before rookie Chris Brown 
scored with three minutes left in regulation Saturday at San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wizards lost the game 2-1 to the Clash in a shootout.  
Injured goalkeeper Tony Meola criticized Newman for lack of 
preparation for the San Jose game. 
</P>
<P>
	Meola and defender Alexi Lalas were acquired in a big trade with  
the MetroStars before the season.

<HEADLINE> Mercedes Sales Up 17 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STUTTGART, Germany (AP) -- Worldwide sales of Mercedes-Benz  
vehicles rose 17 percent to 237,000 in the first quarter, 
German-American automaker DaimlerChrysler AG disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Management board member Dieter Zetsche said in a statement  
Wednesday that Mercedes increased sales from a year ago even in 
markets where the economy has been weak, such as Japan, for 
example, where sales rose 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, however, Mercedes-Benz sales were flat  
during the quarter, in large part because of lower sales of its 
M-class sport utility vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercedes is well on its way to the 1999 goal of selling around  
950,000 cars, he said.

<HEADLINE> Hubble Finds Most Distant Galaxy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope have peered 13  
billion years back into time, almost to the dawn of creation, to 
find the oldest, most distant object ever detected: a galaxy 
fizzing with new stars. 
</P>
<P>
	The galaxy lies near the edge of the universe, 13 billion  
light-years from Earth, where its presence was detected by its 
faint ultraviolet light, which is invisible to conventional 
telescopes. 
</P>
<P>
	Paradoxically, the oldest known galaxy -- dubbed ``Sharon'' after  
the sister of one of its discoverers -- appears young to us. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because the deeper astronomers look into space, the  
further back in time they are looking. It takes so long for light 
traveling through space to reach Earth that astronomers scanning 
the edges of the universe are seeing objects as they were billions 
of years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	By some estimates, we are seeing the galaxy as it existed 1  
billion years after the Big Bang, the colossal explosion believed 
to have created the universe. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery by researchers at the State University of New York  
at Stony Brook was reported in Thursday's issue of the journal 
Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	It marks the third time in the past year that astronomers have  
found what were thought to be the most distant objects yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Other astronomers said the finding can help them determine when  
galaxies formed and developed, and learn more about the origins of 
the chemical elements that make life possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finding the most distant galaxies is akin to finding the  
oldest fossils on Earth,'' said Patrick McCarthy of the Carnegie 
Institution Observatories in Pasadena, Calif. ``They give you a 
handle on the timing and processes by which the first recognizable 
galaxies coalesced from the primordial sea of light elements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galaxies appear to come in two basic designs -- disc-shaped  
spiral galaxies like the Milky Way, and more massive, elliptical 
galaxies. But the SUNY researchers said their target is much too 
far away even for the Hubble to see clearly, so they can't say what 
type it might be. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really not interesting to look at,'' said Kenneth  
Lanzetta, co-author of the Nature study. ``There is no detail to be 
seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the new galaxy is so faint that some astronomers said  
they might have to wait until better instruments are developed to 
learn something from it. Richard Green of the Kitt Peak National 
Observatory in Tucson, Ariz., said the discovery is ``at the limit 
of our grasp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, records for the most distant objects in space  
stood for years. But sensitive detectors on the Hubble and large 
ground-based telescopes are capturing the faintest light from the 
most distant neighborhoods of the cosmos, and the record books are 
being rewritten every few months. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, Princeton University researchers detected the most  
distant quasar known. But the distance given, about 13 billion 
light-years away, was only a rough estimate and not as precise as 
the SUNY finding, which has been accepted by other astronomers as 
the most distant so far. Last May, a University of Hawaii team 
using the Keck telescope discovered a galaxy 12.3 billion 
light-years away. 
</P>
<P>
	The SUNY team examined a deep and narrow wedge of space in 1997,  
using a spectrograph and other instruments on the Hubble. They used 
computers to separate out 400 overlapping objects and uncover the 
distant galaxy. 
</P>
<P>
	The SUNY astronomers whimsically nicknamed after the sister of  
researcher Sebastian Pascarelle. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon Pascarelle is a 32-year-old New York investment baker and  
``total liberal arts major'' who avoided science and math at 
Skidmore College. She became fascinated by her brother's dinnertime 
chat about the universe and pestered him to name something in the 
heavens after her. 
</P>
<P>
	She was flattered when he did so -- until she saw the galaxy's  
image and a blurted, ``It's just a dot!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted a planet named after me,'' she said. ``I guess I'll  
have to settle for a galaxy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sharon's fame may be fleeting -- both for the galaxy and the  
banker. Lanzetta said the SUNY team will soon publish another study 
showing a half-dozen galaxies even deeper in space and closer to 
the dawn of time. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot more out there,'' Lanzetta said.

<HEADLINE> Forest Employee Convicted of Arson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROSEBURG, Ore. (AP) -- A Forest Service fire prevention  
technician was convicted Tuesday in a string of forest fires she 
set so she could fight them and earn overtime 
</P>
<P>
	Tamara Meredith, 36, was convicted on two counts of first degree  
arson and acquitted of 31 other counts regarding fires set last 
summer in the Umpqua National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
	The case prosecutor said he would ask a judge to sentence  
Meredith to at least five years in prison because she had violated 
a public trust. 
</P>
<P>
	Meredith was accused of setting 34 fires last summer around the  
Tiller Ranger District in southwest Oregon. The fires burned fewer 
than 250 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators put a homing device on her truck and tracked her  
in a surveillance plane, watching her set one of the fires.

<HEADLINE> Leno Is Hollywood's No. 1 Motorhead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- So many jalopies, so little time.  
</P>
<P>
	``Tonight Show'' host Jay Leno, Hollywood's consummate  
motorhead, has a personal stash of more than 100 cars and 
motorcycles -- he's not sure of the exact count -- in a 
43,000-square-foot warehouse near Burbank Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never sell anything,'' Leno said, ``and now I'm at the point  
where I can spend more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each piece of his collection has a name -- like Duesenberg,  
Rolls-Royce, Bentley, Packard, Maserati or Harley-Davidson. Then 
there's a fleet of rare vehicles that includes a 1913 Mercer 
Raceabout, a couple of Stanley Steamers and a 1946 Morgan 
barrelback three-wheeler. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty cars and 55 or 60 motorcycles. And they all run,  
maintained by the anvil-jawed comic and three mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
	Leno is not afraid to get his hands dirty. ``I like to fool  
around,'' he said. His head is often under a hood, while he's 
twisting a wrench, after taping his show at the NBC-TV studios four 
miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of his cars are prewar. But Leno also has modern cars,  
including several Dodge Vipers. 
</P>
<P>
	Leno drives a different vehicle to work every day, parking his  
pride-and-joy ``du jour'' in his assigned parking space at NBC. The 
``Tonight Show'' Internet site describes the car he drives to work 
each day in a feature called Jay's Garage. 
</P>
<P>
	On a recent day it was a 1989 Ford Festiva (well, sort of). He  
bought a Festiva and a Ford Taurus 5-speed SHO and put the Taurus 
engine and transmission in the back seat of the Festiva and added a 
nitrous oxide (laughing gas) bottle to boost the horsepower. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just a bit of a hot rod,'' Leno smiled.  
</P>
<P>
	His favorite?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm enamored with the Duesenbergs,'' he said after thinking a  
minute. Hollywood's encyclopedia of motorcars then seemed to regret 
the answer as his car collection flashed through his memory bank. 
</P>
<P>
	He defended his passion for cars, one shared by Tim Allen, Jerry  
Seinfeld and Nicolas Cage, saying with a laugh: ``It's cheaper than 
crack and hookers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leno's wife Mavis puts up with his hobby.  
</P>
<P>
	``My wife collects English literature and I collect cars. They  
don't mesh, other than she learns a little about cars and I learn a 
little about literature,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He gets a kick out of Hollywood's reaction when he shows up  
behind the wheel for show business events or parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say, 'Gee, Jay Leno came here and he drove himself.' If  
you're well-known in Hollywood, they expect you to have a driver 
and a limousine. It's like saying, 'He ate the food himself!' 
They're just amazed. It's so stupid,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When he arrived in California, his only wheels were on a 1955  
Buick Roadmaster. It's in the warehouse, too. He doesn't have his 
first car, a 1934 Ford pickup, but he wishes he did. 
</P>
<P>
	Leno grew up when cars were a big deal. He paid $350 for the  
dented '34 Ford when he was 14, even though he wouldn't have a 
driver's license for two years. He sanded, painted and buffed it 
every day. His parents bought him new upholstery. 
</P>
<P>
	In his autobiography, ``Leading With My Chin,'' Leno remembers  
the day there was a rainstorm while he was in school and water was 
drenching his new upholstery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then suddenly through the window I saw my mom and dad tear  
into the parking lot. They screeched up next to my truck and 
dragged a huge piece of plastic out of their car. Then they covered 
the truck in the pouring rain. I watched them do this. And I just 
began crying right there in class. That memory has always stayed 
with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Leno won the Meguiar's Award that recognizes car buffs.  
He was praised by Barry Meguiar, whose company sells car-care 
products, as ``a pure hobbyist who has helped elevate the status of 
the collector car hobby to what it is today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Expanding his passion, the comic writes a monthly column for  
Popular Mechanics magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Leno has also established a scholarship at McPherson College in  
Kansas, the only college in the country that offers an associate 
degree in automobile restoration. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've lost sight in this country of people who can do things  
with their hands,'' Leno said. ``I think there are a lot of kids in 
this country who are good mechanics and their parents discourage 
them by saying there's no future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leno's frustration at finding a machinist inspired the  
scholarship. The old craftsmen in America have retired or died and 
no one is passing on these skills, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was a kid, if you weren't smart you went into shop,''  
he said. ``But there are people who have a natural affinity to that 
sort of thing. If you're a kid and interested in being a machinist, 
here's a scholarship that's there for them.''

<HEADLINE> Calhoun Says He'll Stand by El-Amin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun says he  
will stand by sophomore point guard Khalid El-Amin, who will be in 
court Thursday to answer a misdemeanor drug charge. 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin, 19, was arrested Tuesday in North Hartford after  
authorities stopped the late-model red Cadillac he was driving and 
found a small amount of marijuana in his possession. 
</P>
<P>
	Another UConn star, All-America junior forward Richard Hamilton,  
was with El-Amin when he was arrested but was not charged, said 
police spokesman Lt. Mike Manzi. 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin was charged with possession of less than four ounces of  
marijuana, a misdemeanor. He was also charged with a minor traffic 
infraction. 
</P>
<P>
	Calhoun, whose Huskies won their first national championship two  
weeks ago, issued a statement late Tuesday night saying he is 
disappointed. He said he would handle the matter internally. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in the business of educating and that is an ongoing  
process,'' he said. ``I'll stand by Khalid's side as this matter is 
resolved to help insure that he fully understands his position as a 
highly visible student-athlete and role model.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manzi said arresting officers found the marijuana when they  
patted down El-Amin after stopping the car when he failed to obey a 
traffic signal. El-Amin told officers the Cadillac belongs to a 
fellow student. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest came just one day after day after El-Amin returned  
from Minneapolis where he attended a ceremony at which North High 
School retired his jersey. El-Amin graduated from North in 1997 
after leading the Polar Bears to three consecutive state high 
</P>
<P>
	The arrest came just one day after day after El-Amin returned  
from Minneapolis where he attended a ceremony at which North High 
School retired his jersey. El-Amin graduated from North in 1997 
after leading the Polars to three consecutive state high school 
basketball championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Campus reaction to the arrest ranged from disappointment to  
indifference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was a letdown to the kids,'' said Jennifer Suozza,  
a senior, 
</P>
<P>
	Christa Veleas said she thinks El-Amin should take himself out  
of a victory parade scheduled in Hartford on Saturday. She said the 
arrest ``put a damper on everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a shame. I just think a lot of kids look up to these  
players,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, junior Scott Sturman said he sympathized with  
El-Amin. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to cause him some serious problems,'' said Sturman,  
who described the situation as someone having ``a little fun.'' 
school basketball championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Michael P. Peters has said he expects more than 200,000  
fans to line the streets when the Huskies are paraded down Main 
Street on Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no word on whether El-Amin, who is hugely popular with  
Huskies fans, would participate in the parade. 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin was arrested at 5:30 p.m. He hustled out of a North End  
police substation 30 minutes later and was taken to the main police 
station where he was booked and released on a written promise to 
appear in Hartford Superior Court on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Manzi said El-Amin was very polite and told police ``he has  
never been arrested before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If that is the case, he may face only a fine if convicted of the  
traffic violation. The misdemeanor possession charge would likely 
be referred to Hartford Community Court, where a conviction would 
call for community service. Such cases involving a first-time 
offense generally involve eight hours' community service, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	About a dozen teen-agers had gathered at the substation on news  
of the arrest. They cheered as El-Amin eluded reporters and dived 
into the back seat of the waiting cruiser. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5-foot-10 El-Amin helped the Huskies (36-2) to a 77-74  
victory over top-ranked Duke in the national championship game on 
March 29. It was the school's first trip to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	El-Amin announced last week that he would return to UConn for  
his junior season rather than make himself eligible for the NBA 
draft.

<HEADLINE> BMW OKs British Aid Offer for Rover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The management board of German car  
maker BMW has approved in principle an aid offer from the British 
government for its Rover unit's Longbridge plant. 
</P>
<P>
	A company spokesman said Wednesday that the government's  
proposal was discussed by the BMW board at Tuesday's meeting and 
confirmed in principle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nevertheless, BMW hasn't made an investment decision yet,''  
the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the company wants to await discussions with British  
unions and approval from the European Union Commission, or signs of 
it, before making a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``Still, we are optimistic we will be able to make that decision  
in the next few weeks,'' the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW requested the British government provide assistance to help  
revive the ailing Rover plant, near Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount of aid hasn't been officially disclosed, and BMW  
wouldn't confirm reports that it would get 155 million pounds, or 
$246.7 million, in subsidies.

<HEADLINE> IRS Reviews Handling of Taxpayers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite some high-profile horror stories,  
criminal investigators for the Internal Revenue Service are not 
guilty of widespread violation of taxpayer rights, an independent 
review has concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	But the law enforcement task force headed by William Webster -- a  
former director of both the FBI and CIA and a former federal judge 
-- did find that the IRS Criminal Investigation Division is straying 
from its main job of improving compliance with tax laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The review released Tuesday said that violations of taxpayer  
rights are ``isolated and individual'' and that most of the 3,000 
CID agents approached their jobs in a professional manner. The 
finding starkly contrasted with shocking tales of IRS abuses 
detailed in hearings last year by the Senate Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``No evidence was found of systemic abuses,'' Webster wrote. But  
he cautioned that agents must be aware ``that even isolated 
instances of abuse of authority can create impressions that 
undermine the public's confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report also found that the division properly uses search  
warrants, grand juries and raids and that deadly force was 
extremely limited. In fact, since 1995 only one case involved use 
of a firearm -- the shooting of a pit bulldog that charged an agent 
during a search. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no evidence in the use-of-force incidents to suggest  
that CI agents are overly aggressive, use force unnecessarily or 
are improperly trained,'' Webster wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, of 87 claims of rights violations filed against  
IRS agents from 1996 through 1998, none was successful. And 93 
percent of lawsuits against IRS enforcement agents during that 
period involved motor vehicle accidents. Only three cases involved 
IRS use of search warrants. 
</P>
<P>
	But the division, Webster wrote, has ``drifted from its primary  
mission,'' which is to ``investigate criminal violations of the 
internal revenue code.'' This has happened mainly because the 
division possesses ``sophisticated financial expertise'' needed by 
other law enforcement agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents spend 25 percent of their time on drug investigations and  
they are often under the control of a local U.S. attorney as part 
of a wider-ranging criminal probe. This does little to help collect 
an estimated $195 billion in annual unpaid taxes, Webster found. 
</P>
<P>
	Webster urged the division to rededicate itself to enforcing the  
tax laws and not get sidetracked on the tax aspects of crimes such 
as money laundering and drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS strategy, he added, should ``determine who is not paying  
their taxes and what remedies will most effectively bring them into 
compliance and deter others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del., said  
this conclusion ``raises the question of whether the whole division 
should be restructured'' to ensure it does the job right. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Webster, IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti agreed  
with Webster's conclusions and promised ``more considered 
decisions'' regarding use of criminal investigation agents for 
matters other than tax compliance. 
</P>
<P>
	Rossotti told reporters Tuesday he was pleased that the report  
recognized CID as ``an important part'' of the IRS mission and that 
the vast majority of its agents did their jobs well. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need this function,'' he said. ``This is the only  
operation in the government that can do this.''

<HEADLINE> DA Gets Holyfield-Lewis Evidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- A lawmaker turned over evidence of what he  
says is possible criminal conduct in the judging of the disputed 
bout between Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	State Sen. Roy Goodman said Wednesday he gave his evidence to  
Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau. 
</P>
<P>
	``We found some rather suspicious and peculiar developments of a  
potentially criminal nature,'' Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said testimony on March 18 before the Senate Investigations  
Committee, which Goodman chairs, has been forwarded to Morgenthau's 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	The district attorney has convened a grand jury to look into the  
March 13 heavyweight title fight at Madison Square Garden, which 
was declared a draw despite Lewis' apparent domination. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis is the WBC champion and Holyfield holds the WBA and IBF  
titles. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Senate hearing, one of the judges at the fight  
acknowledged she recently filed for bankruptcy. However, Eugenia 
Williams of Atlantic City, N.J., who scored the fight for 
Holyfield, denied there was any attempt to help her financially in 
exchange for influencing the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman said testimony also indicated that the mortgage of judge  
Larry O'Connell of England, who scored the fight a draw, was in 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``This raises a very important question: Should anybody be  
judging a big fight on which enormous amounts are wagered if they 
themselves have financial problems and could be subject to 
temptation?'' Goodman told Albany radio station WROW-AM on 
Wednesday. ``We are not accusing anyone of anything, but we do 
think that the criminal piece should be looked at by the DA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morgenthau's office can issue subpoenas across state lines,  
Goodman said. The Senate committee cannot do so. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Senate and district attorney's  
investigations, the state Athletic Commission and state Attorney 
General Eliot Spitzer are also reviewing the Holyfield-Lewis 
decision and boxing in general. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal grand jury in Newark, N.J., is also reportedly  
investigating whether the IBF sold rankings and arranged fights in 
return for kickbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	A Holyfield-Lewis rematch has been ordered by the three  
sanctioning bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate committee's hearing resumes Friday in Manhattan, with  
Holyfield to appear in person and Lewis by a videotape interview 
Goodman said he has already conducted. Goodman said they will 
testify about the fight and the state of boxing.

<HEADLINE> Patricia Neal Keeps Career Alive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``You can't give up,'' Patricia Neal says,  
quickly adding: ``You sure want to, sometimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In her case, it's understandable.  
</P>
<P>
	Neal, whose strong performances in such movies as ``Hud,'' ``A  
Face in the Crowd'' and ``The Fountainhead'' have made her one of 
the most respected actresses in film, has survived almost as much 
tragedy as Job. 
</P>
<P>
	The 73-year-old Academy Award- and Tony-winning actress has  
endured the death of a daughter, the near death of her baby boy, a 
nervous breakdown, a husband who had an affair with her best 
friend, and a series of massive strokes that paralyzed her, 
impaired her speech and nearly killed her. 
</P>
<P>
	Thoughts of suicide crept into her mind, she says, but whenever  
she voiced them, her then husband, Roald Dahl, would ask her if she 
wanted to use a gun or some other method. 
</P>
<P>
	Such tough love worked, but the main reason she didn't give up  
was simple: ``I'm a stubborn woman,'' she says, laughing with that 
distinctive contralto of hers. ``I don't think I'd kill myself in a 
million years. I really don't. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't lie down. ... I'm fightin' all the way.''  
</P>
<P>
	Now, in a life marked by disasters and comebacks, Neal has come  
back again, starring in her first feature film in 10 years, in the 
title role in Robert Altman's delightful ``Cookie's Fortune.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She plays a dotty, lonely old woman who misses her late husband  
so much that she decides to join him. Her suicide leads to a 
``murder'' investigation that brings out the eccentricities in 
everyone in her small Mississippi town. 
</P>
<P>
	Neal says she got the part because her daughter, Lucy, met  
Altman in Cannes. He mentioned that he was going to make ``Cookie's 
Fortune'' and still had to cast the title character. 
</P>
<P>
	``What about mom?'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Altman then saw Neal at a party Lucy threw for her and decided  
the part was hers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to see how I was all these years later,'' says Neal,  
who recalls meeting Altman shortly before her stroke in 1965, when 
she was pregnant with Lucy and doing Otto Preminger's ``In Harm's 
Way'' in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Neal, who won the Oscar as best actress for 1963's ``Hud,''  
admits she badly wanted this part and that jobs have been scarce in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't quite understand it, but nobody calls me and nobody  
wants me,'' she says in a singsong, almost coquettish way. ``But I 
love to act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She hopes this film reminds people that she's still alive and  
kicking -- and willing and able to act. 
</P>
<P>
	The film, which co-stars Charles S. Dutton, Glenn Close, Liv  
Tyler and Julianne Moore, has received mixed reviews, but all of 
the actors have won raves. One critic was moved to praise Neal for 
``lighting up the screen with a confident, stylish performance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While not working regularly, Neal has been busy taking cruises  
with friends around the world, resting up in Martha's Vineyard, and 
making a few trips a year to the 20-year-old rehabilitation center 
named after her in her hometown of Knoxville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	When she went into movies she was already an accomplished  
actress with the 1947 Tony for her performance in Lillian Hellman's 
``Another Part of the Forest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But her screen debut in 1949's ``John Loves Mary,'' a piece of  
fluff that also starred Jack Carson and Ronald Reagan, was panned 
by The New York Times. And critics dismissed her next two films -- 
including ``The Fountainhead,'' which co-starred her then lover, 
the much older and still married Gary Cooper -- as silly and 
pretentious. 
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't turn out very well,'' Neal concedes about her early  
days in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	So she went back to Broadway and played the teacher driven to  
suicide in Hellman's ``The Children's Hour.'' At Hellman's house 
Neal met Dahl, the writer who would become famous for his horror 
tales and children's stories. 
</P>
<P>
	They married in 1953 and had five children. The marriage lasted  
three decades until ending in a nasty divorce after Neal discovered 
Dahl and one her best friends were having an affair. Their marriage 
also was marked by tragedy. Her only son Theo was in a car accident 
as a baby, nearly died and needed many operations. Her daughter, 
Olivia, died of complications from measles in 1962 at age 7. Then 
she had a series of strokes. Dahl remained at her side through it 
all. He died in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Her struggle back to where she could walk and talk again is seen  
as epic in the annals of stroke rehabilitation. (A 1991 biopic 
about her travails starred Glenda Jackson as Neal and Dirk Bogarde 
as Dahl.) She made a grand return to the screen by 1968, winning an 
Oscar nomination for her performance in ``The Subject Was Roses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She still limps and has bad vision in one eye because of the  
stroke, but sitting at her dining room table in her Upper East Side 
high-rise apartment, she says: ``Sure look perfect now compared to 
then.'' 
</P>

	The actress, who wears a little Oscar pendant around her neck,  
notes her memory can be ``vague.'' But she is as sharp as a 
stiletto otherwise, and displays no self-pity in recounting her 
hard times. 
</P>

	``It's really extraordinary, what happens in one's life. Then

	Among her fondest memories is playing Olivia Walton in ``The  
Homecoming: A Christmas Story,'' the 1971 made-for-TV film that 
served as the pilot for the CBS series ``The Waltons.''

	She remembers it touched her heart to be playing someone with  
the same name as her late daughter and she became upset when Olivia 
temporarily was changed to Mary during the film's development. 
</P>
<P>
	These days she is planning her next couple of cruises, one of  
which may conflict with her mother's 100th birthday in September.

	When told that her mother's longevity should augurs well for her  
own prospects, she laughs and says, ``I ain't gonna make that. I've

<HEADLINE> T'wolves' Garnett Sits Out Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Minnesota Timberwolves forward Kevin Garnett  
sat out Wednesday night's game against the San Antonio Spurs after 
being treated for dehydration and flu-like symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	Garnett did not travel with the team to Texas, spokesman Dan  
Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``K.G.'s physically exhausted,'' coach Flip Saunders said  
Tuesday. ``With all the injuries we've had, other guys have been 
forced to step up, and they're getting beat up, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After Garnett played 41 minutes Monday in Minnesota's 95-90 loss  
to Houston, he was hooked to an IV to replenish his fluids. In the 
last five games, Garnett has averaged 38.8 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	After Sunday's game against Detroit, Garnett said the compressed  
season and his increased role for the Wolves were taking a toll. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm working on trying to get some rest,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Congress Moves on Flag Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After falling four votes short two years ago,  
members of Congress on Wednesday renewed their efforts to amend the 
Constitution to protect the American flag from desecration. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed constitutional amendment was approved by the House  
Judiciary Constitution subcommittee on a 7-4 party-line vote, with 
all Republicans in favor and Democrats opposed. A Senate panel is 
to consider the issue next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The flag of the United States represents values that bind  
America together,'' said Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., chairman of 
the House subcommittee. ``It warrants our respect and protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said laws banning flag desecration could infringe on  
First Amendment rights to freedom of expression. They also 
expressed doubt that desecration could be properly defined when 
images of the flag appear on clothing, commercial products and 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The flag is a symbol of inalienable rights such as freedom of  
speech, said Rep. Mel Watt, D-N.C., ranking Democrat on the panel. 
``I don't think we can pass a flag amendment that undermines any of 
those inalienable rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed amendment would not ban the physical desecration of  
the flag but would allow Congress to pass legislation to restrict 
conduct, but not expression, concerning the flag. 
</P>
<P>
	The drive grew out of Supreme Court rulings in 1989 and 1990.  
The first, by a 5-4 vote, invalidated the flag protection laws of 
48 states and Congress. The second struck down a new act of 
Congress passed in the wake of the first court decision. 
</P>
<P>
	If the proposed amendment were to pass both the House and Senate  
by two-thirds majorities, then three-fourths of the state 
legislatures would have to ratify it before the amendment would 
become part of the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	The flag amendment cleared the House by a 310-114 vote in 1995  
and again by 312-120 in 1997. But the Senate did not consider it in 
1995 and two years ago rejected it by 63-36, four short of the 
two-thirds majority needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters said 49 state legislatures -- all but Vermont -- have  
passed resolutions urging Congress to approve a flag amendment.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Coverage Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Media coverage of President Clinton's  
impeachment weakened the credibility of both the press and the 
presidency, according to a panel addressing a convention of the 
nation's newspaper editors. 
</P>
<P>
	Impeachment proceedings against Clinton ``weakened the basic  
institutions of government across the board'' from the presidency 
and Congress to the press and the public, former White House Chief 
of Staff Leon Panetta told the gathering Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Exhaustive coverage of the Clinton sex scandal brought  
controversial issues to the forefront at most newsrooms. Having it 
happen at a time when Web sites compete to get the latest 
information out quickly also brought its own set of challenges, 
panelists said. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers relied heavily on anonymous sources, according to a  
survey designed by the Committee of Concerned Journalists and 
conducted by Princeton Survey Research Associates last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the front-page impeachment-related stories appearing in The  
New York Times, Los Angeles Times, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, The 
Washington Post and The Washington Times between January 21 and 24, 
38 percent relied on anonymous sources. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were trying to do our job, but we didn't always do as well  
as we wanted,'' said Thomas Rosenstiel, director of the Project for 
Excellence in Journalism. 
</P>
<P>
	Coverage also prompted an increased combativeness between the  
president and the press, Panetta said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton ``lost the respect and confidence of the American  
people,'' said former Sen. Nancy Kassebaum Baker of Kansas. His 
image abroad also was severely damaged as the world viewed him with 
``bemusement or smirking'' as he tried to balance foreign policy 
issues with his own political and personal woes. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's domestic credibility was damaged as well, said David  
Broder, a Pulitzer Prize-winning political correspondent for The 
Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Broder said Clinton's leadership has weakened because he finds  
himself dealing with the minority Democrats in Congress rather than 
the Republican majority. 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal hurt the media's credibility, deepened cynicism  
about politics and government and ``added to the public perception 
that Washington is a snakepit,'' Broder said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, an instructor at the School of  
Politics and Economics at Claremont Graduate University and a 
contributing editor for the Los Angeles Times, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
	She said most of the nation already distrusted politicians.  
</P>
<P>
	There was ``not much hand-wringing over this,'' she said.  
``People couldn't be any more cynical about Washington than they 
were.''

<HEADLINE>  Gretzky To Decide Future by Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RYE, N.Y. (AP) -- His coach, his teammates, his fans and even his  
wife have urged him to extend his glorious hockey career one more 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wayne Gretzky alone understands what must be done, and his  
decision on retirement will come by the time the New York Rangers 
end their season Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I need to do what's best for myself. ... Nobody else has any  
bearing on this at this point in time,'' he said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking after practice in a chilly room of whitewashed concrete  
block above the practice rink, the 38-year-old hockey great said he 
will decide by Sunday -- ``not today or tomorrow'' -- whether to end 
his 20-year career in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not trying to be an idiot about this,'' he said. ``It's  
just a lifetime decision. Once it's done, it's done, 100 percent, 
whether I come back or I don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, who smiled and seemed relaxed on the ice but seemed  
somewhat emotional afterward, said he spoke with coach John Muckler 
and planned to meet with general manager Neil Smith after the team 
got to Ottawa for Thursday night's game with the Senators. 
</P>
<P>
	It could be Gretzky's last game in his homeland, and he said  
``I'm going to enjoy tomorrow.'' In Ottawa, Prime Minister Jean 
Chretien said the Great One should keep playing and a Canadian TV 
network switched plans so it could cover the game. As many as 200 
reporters were expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky said Muckler talked about ``my importance to the  
organization as far as my presence, what I bring to the hockey 
club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I said to him, `I think this team will be a better team next  
year than it is this year,' and he said that it would be a better 
team next year if I'm back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky seemed to vacillate even during the news conference  
about whether he wanted to come back, but he said he was ``leaning 
somewhat more one way than the other.'' He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky said his wife Janet -- whose opinion he values most, he  
said -- ``would like me to play one more year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She knows I love to play and probably she agrees with John and  
Neil that we came a long ways this year and next year we'll be 
better. She wants me to be part of that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody I've talked to says, `You've got to play next year'  
and that part's been really difficult,'' Gretzky said. ``The 
response has been overwhelming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he didn't want to ``let down'' his coach or teammates or  
fans, ``But I know eventually I'll make the right decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky, who led the league in scoring 10 times, said he's  
confident he can still play well, though he complained of a neck 
injury that cost him 11 games this season and said, ``I'm not going 
to play at the level I did 10 years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke of a call from the great Gordie Howe, who still plays  
hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's 70 years old, and he said, `I love it,''' Gretzky said.  
``I think I'll have the same feeling 30 years from now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I love this game,'' Gretzky added. ``The practice, sitting in  
the back of the bus with the pizza and the guys ... the camaraderie 
and what goes on between the guys ... coming in the next morning 
after a big win. I mean I love everything about it. ... No matter 
what happens, I'm going to miss it more than anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Howe had more advice for Gretzky: Wait until  
training camp in September to make a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``The show he put on at the all-star game, that last shift, my  
God, it looked like he could play until he was 60,'' said Howe, who 
recalled last month's chat with Gretzky. ``He mentioned something 
about `This may be my last year.' I told him `Don't talk that way. 
Come training camp you're going to really get the itch again.' He's 
so talented he could get by on one skate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky expressed disappointment about the Rangers' missing the  
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody wants to go out like Michael Jordan did, but it's  
not a perfect world. ... It's not going to happen that way, not 
this year, but it is nice to be able to say people do want me to 
play more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Near the end of his remarks, Gretzky said his 6-year-old son is  
scheduled to play a baseball game Sunday, the same day as the 
Rangers' last game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `Are you going to come to my hockey game?' And he  
said, `No, I've got a baseball game.' And I said, `Well, I don't 
know about next year,' and he said, `Well, I don't care. I've got a 
ball game.' 
</P>
<P>
	``He seems to have everything in perspective,'' Gretzky said.

<HEADLINE> Vessel Spills Diesel Fuel Off Kauai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KAPAA, Hawaii (AP) -- A grounded boat has broken up off the coast  
of Kauai, spilling 16,000 gallons of diesel fuel into waters 
inhabited by endangered seals and sea turtles. 
</P>
<P>
	After days of pounding by strong winds and heavy surf, the  
95-foot Van Loi broke apart Tuesday, spilling the fuel near popular 
tourist beaches. Kauai is about 100 miles west of the island of 
Oahu, home to Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard crews were searching for thousands of hooked fishing  
lines used by the vessel before it grounded on a reef Saturday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The waters are inhabited by endangered Hawaiian monk seals and  
sea turtles. The seals are the second-most endangered mammal in 
American waters after the northern right whale. About 1,300 seals 
remain in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of hooks, a lot of monofilament line that poses  
a risk to the wildlife there,'' said Coast Guard Capt. Frank 
Whipple. ``We have crews right now trying to come up with 
identifying where it may be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the Coast Guard has not found any evidence of diesel on  
beaches. But visitors in several hotels complained of nausea from 
the fumes. 
</P>
<P>
	Debris such as fishing equipment, floats, lumber, insulating  
foam and fishing nets have washed ashore, smelling of fuel. The 
ship's cargo of fish also spilled into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	The Honolulu-based vessel's six Vietnamese crewmen were taken  
off the boat Saturday. Authorities don't know the cause of the 
accident.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Troops Make Border Foray </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAJRAM CURRI, Albania (AP) -- At the beginning, the radio traffic  
from border police near the village of Kamenica sounded no 
different from how it had for three days. 
</P>
<P>
	The police had reported sporadic shelling of tiny hamlets along  
the mountainside. Sometimes, the bombardment reached as far as 
Tropoja, a few miles farther from the Albanian-Yugoslav border. 
</P>
<P>
	But 10 minutes after the explosions started Tuesday, the tone of  
the radio messages abruptly changed. Border police reported to 
their commander that Yugoslav light infantry had crossed into 
Albania from neighboring Kosovo and were advancing on their post. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were already firing their weapons at that time,'' said  
Pier Gonggrijp, a monitor for the Organization of Security and 
Cooperation in Europe who was listening to the radio traffic 7 
miles away in Bajram Curri. 
</P>
<P>
	Albanian border guards were describing the start of the first  
known Yugoslav ground incursion into Albania since NATO air attacks 
on Yugoslavia began three weeks ago -- an escalation in the 
14-month-old Kosovo crises that could be yet another step toward 
drawing southeastern Europe into widespread conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time Serb forces withdrew 75 minutes later, houses in  
Kamenica were on fire and Albanian troops had fired back with guns 
and artillery in what monitors described as the first response by a 
neighboring army to Yugoslav provocation. There were no reports of 
casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	The border area near Kamenica (kah-mah-NEE-tsah) in northeastern  
Albania has been a staging ground for Kosovo Liberation Army rebels 
fighting for independence in neighboring Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side of the border in Kosovo, there have been  
reports that Yugoslav forces in recent weeks have cleaned out 
villages, laid mines and carved out and have been laying mines and 
digging in positions in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
	And in the last three days, Gonggrijp said at least eight KLA  
fighters have been killed and seven wounded in clashes with 
Yugoslav forces on the Kosovo side of the border. 
</P>
<P>
	Gonggrijp said he believed the Serbs wanted to create a clear  
corridor on both sides of the border to prevent guerrilla 
incursions or a possible NATO ground assault from Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	Journalists could not reach Kamenica to examine the damage,  
blocked about a mile away by Albanian army Capt. Qamie Katoroshi 
who claimed that KLA fighters had taken over the border post at 
Kosare in recent fighting. Gonggrijp called that an unconfirmed 
rumor. 
</P>
<P>
	Hours after the clash was over, he described the urgent exchange  
between the panicked border guards and their commander. 
</P>
<P>
	With Serb forces advancing, the commander radioed to the guards:  
``We will support you.'' The guards replied that they were 
surrounded and would withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
	A radio message a short time later estimated the number of  
Yugoslav soldiers in Kamenica at 50 and said houses were burning. 
Gonggrijp saw flames on the mountain from the roof of the hotel the 
OSCE works out of Bajram Curri. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1:30 p.m., a half hour after the shelling had started, border  
guards reported the Yugoslav solders were starting to pull out, and 
the inspector urged them to try to take the high ground above the 
village. He again promised they would be backed by force. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1:55, low clouds and heavy drizzle moved in to obscure the  
OSCE observers' view from Bajram Curri. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting ended five minutes later, but the inspector warned  
his men to watch out for Yugoslav snipers and artillery. 
</P>
<P>
	By 2:15, the village was reported clear of all Yugoslav forces.  
</P>
<P>
	``Just briefly before that, the Albanian artillery had been  
firing I don't know how many rounds to support police in that 
area,'' Gonggrijp said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Belgrade, Yugoslav officials denied any incursions into  
Albania. The chief of its army information service, Col. Milivoje 
Novkovic, said on state television that Yugoslavia's defense of its 
own borders was ``being fabricated as an alleged invasion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albania, in turn, pledged to take necessary steps to defend  
itself.

<HEADLINE> Judge OKs Black Farmer Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge approved a multimillion-dollar  
settlement for black farmers Wednesday despite protests from some 
of them that the deal struck with the Agriculture Department over 
years of discrimination didn't go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman's approval comes four months  
after attorneys on both sides announced a settlement. At that time, 
Friedman gave preliminary approval to the deal but held a fairness 
hearing last month to get farmers' input. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge has worked with attorneys on both sides over the last  
few weeks to try to address some of farmers' concerns. No changes 
were made to the financial terms although some safeguards were 
added to ensure farmers' rights during the settlement process, 
attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers had complained that the deal lacked checks and balances  
to prevent them from being abused during the process. Many also 
wanted long-term safeguards against racism. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the first time ever in a racial discrimination case that  
serious money has been paid out,'' said Alexander Pires, lead 
attorney for the plaintiffs. ``I think it's going to encourage 
others to speak out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman issued a statement saying the  
settlement was ``fair and just both for the black farmers and for 
the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``With this approval, USDA can move forward, putting a painful  
chapter of our history behind us,'' Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Black farmers sued two years ago because they had been denied  
access to government loans and subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	Pires said more than 18,000 farmers have already signed up for  
the settlement and estimated that the settlement could be worth 
more than $2 billion eventually. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, farmers with less documented evidence of  
discrimination can take a $50,000 payment, as well as $12,500 to 
cover taxes, and have their government debts forgiven. Farmers with 
more evidence could opt to go before an independent arbitrator and 
seek larger damages. Farmers could also choose to opt out of the 
lawsuit and pursue their own cases. 
</P>
<P>
	At the judge's suggestion, attorneys added a provision that  
allows the judge to select a monitor who will oversee the 
settlement. Another provision adds a layer of retired judges to 
review decisions made by an adjudicator, who will decide whether 
many farmers qualify. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, leaders of two black farmer organizations had a lukewarm  
response to the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it still leaves a lot to be desired,'' said Gary  
Grant, president of the Black Farmers and Agriculturists 
Association. ``The membership mostly has been saying, 'Get rid of 
it, it's not any good.''

	Refugees Say Yugoslavs Attacked Convoy  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Refugees fleeing Kosovo told aid workers that  
Yugoslav helicopters and airplanes have been attacking refugee 
convoys in the Serbian province, a Pentagon official said today. 
The Pentagon, however, said it had ``no direct evidence'' that an 
attack on a convoy today, in which 64 civilians were killed, was 
committed by the Yugoslavs. The Serbs claimed that the convoy was 
hit by NATO bombs, but Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said NATO 
planes hit only military targets.

withdrawing troops from Kosovo. But a White House spokesman said 
NATO will not stop airstrikes against Serb troops until its goals

aggressively for five years. Starr raised concerns to the Senate 
Governmental Affairs Committee about the separation of powers, and 
the costs and delays of the investigations. Starr, however, 
insisted there was no conflict in his questioning the wisdom of the 
law. He reiterated that he retains the power to prosecute Clinton

jackpot ever won by an individual: $197 million. Maria Grasso, who 
became a U.S. citizen in 1984, said she has no clear plans for the 
money, but that she is not anxious about her huge windfall. She 
expects to net about $70 million after taxes, her lawyer said. The 
odds of winning the Big Game jackpot were 76 million-to-1.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope

Earth. Researchers say the collection of stars is the oldest, most 
distant object ever detected. By some estimates, we are seeing the 
galaxy, dubbed ``Sharon'' after one of the astronomers, as it 
existed 1 billion years after the Big Bang, the colossal explosion 
believed to have created the universe. The discovery by researchers 
at the State University of New York at Stony Brook was reported in

<P>
	CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) -- Symantec Corp., a top anti-virus  
software company, has hired a John W. Thompson, a top IBM 
executive, to be its new president, chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson, 49, has been general manager of IBM Americas, a $37

<HEADLINE> Clinton Likely To Pay Contempt Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is likely to pay a financial  
penalty rather than challenge a contempt-of-court ruling that he 
gave ``intentionally false'' testimony about his relationship with 
Monica Lewinsky, according to a top adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House declined to comment officially Tuesday on  
whether Clinton would appeal the ruling and referred questions to 
Robert Bennett, Clinton's private attorney. Bennett did not return 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was held in contempt of court Monday by U.S. District  
Judge Susan Webber Wright in Little Rock, who presided in the 
sexual harassment suit brought by Paula Jones. Wright found that 
Clinton gave ``false, misleading and evasive answers'' in a January 
1988 deposition in which he denied having sexual relations with Ms. 
Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright ordered Clinton to pay ``any reasonable expenses,''  
including legal fees incurred by Mrs. Jones as a result of 
Clinton's false testimony. The judge also directed Clinton to 
reimburse the court $1,202 for her travel to Washington to preside 
over taking the deposition. And she referred the matter to the 
Arkansas Supreme Court's Professional Conduct Committee, which has 
the power to revoke Clinton's law license or to impose other 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	A top adviser to Clinton, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said Tuesday the ``most likely course'' being discussed by the 
president's lawyers would have Clinton pay the penalty without 
contesting it, provided that Mrs. Jones' demand for reimbursement 
was reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
	But this adviser said Clinton was interested in keeping his law  
license and that his attorneys might contest any regulatory effort 
in Arkansas to revoke it. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart refused to answer  
questions about the case. Lockhart said he was not aware that the 
White House was considering its own appeal on the constitutional 
point of separation of powers. 
</P>
<P>
	In Little Rock, Mrs. Jones met with her attorneys, who were  
given 20 days to submit a statement of legal costs for possible 
reimbursement.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Market's Main Index Rises / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Tokyo stock market's main index finished higher  
today amid speculation that public pension fund money will flow 
into the market. The dollar slipped against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.19 yen in the late afternoon, down 1.17  
yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York 
level of 119.83 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 49.52  
points, or 0.87 percent, closing at 16,764.68. On Tuesday, the 
index rose 207.76 points, or 1.26 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo stocks were lower for much of today's trading on worries  
over earnings at high technology companies, but moved higher toward 
the closing bell. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said expectations that public pension funds will soon be  
allocating money to the market reversed the course. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was some anticipation of (public pension fund) buying,''  
said Dhia Amir, senior institutional sales trader at Nomura 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the overall rise in the market, high technology issues,  
including Sony Corp. and Toshiba Corp., were among today's losers. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors worried about earnings at high technology companies  
after Intel Corp. of the United States warned late Tuesday that its 
earnings may weaken in the second quarter, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was also hurt by a report in the Nihon Keizai  
business daily today that the Sony group's net profit is likely to 
fall below 100 billion yen ($840 million) for the fiscal year 
ending March 31, 2000, for the first time in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the Nikkei's gains, declines outnumbered advancers 638  
to 558, with 122 issues unchanged. Volume on the exchange's first 
section was estimated at 719 million shares, up from Tuesday's 692 
million shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
exchange's first section was up 11.61 points, or 0.87 percent, to 
1,343.35. The TOPIX gained 15.54 points, or 1.18 percent, the 
previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the yen gained ground against the dollar  
after the Nihon Keizai reported that Japan's major life insurers 
will decrease purchases of bonds denominated in foreign currency, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nihon Keizai said today that Japan's five major life  
insurers will sharply reduce or suspend altogether purchases of 
foreign currency denominated bonds in the current fiscal year as 
they shift their investment focus to domestic assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's fiscal year began on April 1.  
</P>
<P>
	Traders said U.S. hedge funds sold the dollar rather  
aggressively amid the reported move by the Japanese insurers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the dollar was supported on buying from Japanese trust  
banks in the low 119 yen range later in the session. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 128.74 yen, down  
from 130.10 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 211 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.645 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.600 percent, 
driving its price down to 101.35 yen from 101.74 yen.

<HEADLINE> Marlins Sign Pitch Hanson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Right-hander Erik Hanson signed a Triple-A  
contract Wednesday with the Florida Marlins on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanson, 33, was in the Kansas City Royals' spring training camp  
before being released. He was 0-3 with a 6.24 ERA last year in 11 
games with the Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanson has a career record of 89-84 and was an All-Star for the  
Boston Red Sox in 1995. He worked out with the Marlins on Wednesday 
at Shea Stadium before joining minor-league affiliate Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida also announced lefty knuckleballer Kirt Ojala will start  
Sunday at Philadelphia for Alex Fernandez, who was placed on the 
15-day disabled list Monday with inflammation in his pitching 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marlins are hoping that Fernandez can return during the home  
series against the Chicago Cubs on April 27-29.

<HEADLINE> Whooping Crane Lays Egg in The Wild </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Two whooping cranes have produced  
the first eggs laid in the U.S. wild in decades, raising hopes that 
the birds will make a comeback after nearly being wiped out. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4-year-old cranes are part of an experimental flock raised  
in captivity and placed in central Florida's Kissimmee Prairie. 
None had produced eggs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be happy if the eggs hatch, and we'll be really happy if  
they do raise these chicks,'' biologist Marty Folk said Monday. 
``But we don't really expect it to happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Biologist Kathy Sullivan said the eggs themselves were ``a big  
enough accomplishment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once, thousands of whooping cranes soared across the United  
States, their bugling calls audible for miles. But settlers drained 
marshes and plowed prairies, destroying the crane's habitat. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1938, only two small flocks remained: one that nested in  
Canada and wintered in Texas, and another that lived in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
	A storm wiped out most of the Louisiana birds, and none laid  
eggs again. The last survivor of that flock died in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers desperate to save the birds from extinction found  
the Canadian birds' nesting grounds and, beginning in the late 
1960s, started taking eggs to try to resurrect the species by 
raising birds in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1993, federal officials started sending whooping cranes  
raised in captivity in Maryland to Florida as an experiment. Over 
the last three years, biologists have seen six of the birds pair 
off. But none had laid eggs.

<HEADLINE> Clippers Put Smile on Coach's Face </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Chris Ford can smile a little easier these  
days. 
</P>
<P>
	For a while, it was uncertain if the Clippers would ever win a  
game. Now -- and this is no small thing -- they've won three of their 
last four. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just hasn't been a laugh for me,'' he said. ``I want to win  
every game, not just one. If I throw up my hands, what are the rest 
of the guys going to do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford was hired as coach of the Clippers three months ago. At  
times, it probably feels as if he's held the job for three years. 
</P>
<P>
	This is not a man who's used to losing. Ford was an NBA player  
for 10 years, and competed in the playoffs seven times, winning a 
championship with the Boston Celtics in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	He won two more championship rings as an assistant coach with  
the Celtics before becoming their head coach in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	In seven seasons as a head coach with Boston and Milwaukee, his  
teams were 291-283. Then, he was hired by the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question I face every day is, `How are you doing, you all  
right?' I'm fine,'' Ford said. ``I come to work every day, try to 
prepare the team the best I can. There's only so much you can do. 
It's been a whacky year, with a limited training camp and the 
condensed schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since 1972, I've been in the NBA. It's been a great period in  
my life. It's great to be one of the 29 coaches in the NBA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 50-year-old coach might not have made such a statement a  
month ago. His Clippers began the abbreviated season with 17 
straight losses to equal an NBA record for futility at the start of 
a season before finally beating Sacramento on March 11. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason I took this job is I wanted to help build (the  
team),'' he said. ``It's been a challenge, I've done a lot of 
coaching this year. It's been fun, we just haven't been able to win 
many games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's for sure, although they've managed some surprising wins  
in the last 3 1/2 weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Not only have they beaten Minnesota twice, they've also managed  
wins over Utah and Portland -- both with 29-8 records, best in the 
NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Their 89-83 victory at Portland last Sunday night was just the  
second loss at the Rose Garden for the Trail Blazers this season. 
The Blazers responded by hammering the visiting Los Angeles Lakers 
113-86 two nights later. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers, meanwhile, beat New Jersey 109-101 Tuesday night  
to give them a 6-31 record and their first two-game winning streak 
since they won three straight games between Dec. 27, 1997 and Jan. 
3, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford hopes it's a beginning, and he's already looking to next  
season. This one will end for his team in three weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing better than to be part of something and  
watching it grow,'' he said. ``We're moving into a beautiful new 
building next season (the Staples Center). We do have some young, 
talented players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to continue to do everything I can to help turn this  
organization around. Hopefully, we'll have some fun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Second-year forward Maurice Taylor, the Clippers' leading  
scorer, needed little prompting to express his respect for Ford. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a strong-minded coach,'' Taylor said. ``He came in  
believing he was going to turn it around, get the most out of us. I 
think he's done a great job, considering the circumstances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clippers will go for their third straight win against the  
Jazz on Thursday night at the Los Angeles Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	They'll be underdogs, for sure. But at least one person believes  
they can win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to win every game, going in,'' Ford said. ``That's the  
attitude I have. I love to compete.''

<HEADLINE> WNBA Labor Dispute Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Even though the sides in the WNBA labor dispute  
only spoke by telephone Tuesday, a union representative remained 
cautiously optimistic an agreement can soon be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've made some progress on some issues even though there was  
no formal meeting,'' said Pam Wheeler, the director of operations 
for the Women's National Basketball Association Players 
Association. ``But we can't characterize any of the negotiations as 
informal at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The WNBA pre-draft camp is scheduled to begin Thursday in  
Chicago. League officials said negotiations must wrap up by 
Wednesday if they want to start the camp on time. 
</P>
<P>
	The sides spoke on the telephone several times Tuesday to hammer  
out specifics for a new collective bargaining agreement, with the 
main points of dispute being salaries and benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	The union was asking for a minimum salary increase from $15,000  
to $45,000. The league was offering $20,000 for the three-month 
season that is scheduled to start June 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The union has contacted several players over the last two days  
for their feedback on specific proposals, said union spokesman Dan 
Wasserman. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be a vote once a deal is finalized,'' Wasserman  
said. ``We're getting player sentiment on the different issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A majority of the 120 WNBA players need to ratify the agreement.  
</P>
<P>
	No player representatives were involved in Tuesday's talks. Only  
league and union officials spoke on the phone, Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
	League spokesman Mark Pray said the negotiations are ongoing.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are several open issues, and we are hoping to resolve  
them,'' Pray said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another sticking point is the number of former ABL players  
eligible for the 11-player team rosters. The union wanted to 
protect current WNBA players from losing their jobs by allowing two 
players from the defunct league per team. 
</P>
<P>
	The WNBA has wanted to allow up to four ex-ABL players per team  
and six for each of the expansion teams, Orlando and Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	The WNBA's 12-team draft is scheduled for April 27.

<HEADLINE>  Judge Sentences Kevorkian to Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Dr. Jack Kevorkian's crusade for assisted  
suicide began nine years ago in the back of his rusted Volkswagen 
van. There, an Alzheimer's patient from Oregon pushed a button on 
the retired pathologist's ``suicide machine'' and lethal drugs 
flowed into her veins. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian has skirted the law and taunted its enforcers ever  
since, helping 130 people take their own lives He left bodies in 
the middle of the night at motels, others at hospital emergency 
rooms. He burned state orders against him, showed up at court in 
costume and challenged authorities to do something about it. On 
Tuesday, they finally did. 
</P>
<P>
	``You had the audacity to go on national television, show the  
world what you did and dare the legal system to stop you,'' said 
Judge Jessica Cooper. ``Well, sir, consider yourself stopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper sentenced the Kevorkian to 10 to 25 years in prison for  
the second-degree murder of Thomas Youk, a Lou Gehrig's patient 
whom Kevorkian videotaped as he injected him with a lethal cocktail 
of chemicals on Sept. 17. The videotape was later broadcast on 
CBS's ``60 Minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``My husband had come to the end of his life as he chose to,''  
Melody Youk said as she pleaded for a lenient sentence. ``He was 
not depressed. He was not a victim. He requested Dr. Kevorkian's 
help and was grateful for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cooper also sentenced Kevorkian to three to seven years for  
delivery of a controlled substance. The sentences will run 
concurrently, and Kevorkian will be eligible for parole after six 
years and eight months, a prosecutor said. Kevorkian, who turns 71 
next month, could have gotten life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian's supporters said the sentence would intensify the  
debate over euthanasia and assisted suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's going to spark more debate and discussion on the  
end of life issue,'' said Nicholle McClelland, spokeswoman for the 
Oregon-based Hemlock Society. ``This was not murder, this was a 
very compassionate act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. McClelland said laws against assisted suicide should be on  
trial, not Kevorkian. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is another example ... that the law needs to change to  
allow for physician-assisted dying,'' she said. ``Dr. Jack 
Kevorkian is one of those responsible for making the movement so 
strong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But opponents said the sentence was long overdue. Members of Not  
Dead Yet, a disabled rights group, celebrated the end of what one 
called Kevorkian's ``killing spree.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Jack Kevorkian has been killing members of the disabled  
community for years and has been getting away with it,'' said Cal 
Montgomery. ``I hope this is the end of the euthanasia movement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Archdiocese of Detroit issued a statement, saying  
Kevorkian's ```final solution' approach to pain management has been 
an unconscionable exploitation of the natural ambivalence to death 
and suffering.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence, said archdiocese spokesman Ned McGrath, leaves  
``no doubt that society will neither authorize physicians to kill 
nor look the other way if they do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even Judge Cooper offered her take on the impact of the  
sentence, telling Kevorkian the debate over assisted suicide will 
continue ``long after this trial and your activities fade from 
public memory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his death, Youk, 52, was confined to a  
wheelchair, had a feeding tube installed in his stomach and was 
afraid of choking on his own saliva. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical examiners considered the death suspicious. But they had  
little to go on -- until Kevorkian sent the videotape to ``60 
Minutes.'' The tape and the show's interview with Kevorkian were 
the prosecution's main evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first murder trial for Kevorkian, who says he has  
been involved in 130 deaths since 1990, and the first time he was 
found guilty of taking part in a death. His previous trials, all on 
assisted-suicide charges, resulted in three acquittals and a 
mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
	In past cases, Kevorkian said his patients used his homemade  
devices to start the flow of carbon monoxide or intravenous 
chemicals that caused their death. In Youk's case, Kevorkian 
administered the injection. 
</P>
<P>
	Geoffrey Fieger, Kevorkian's brash legal bulldog for much of the  
past nine years, refused to defend him, claiming Kevorkian had 
turned a corner to self-destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian insisted on representing himself at his short trial,  
where he gave an impassioned but ineffective defense interrupted 
often by prosecutors' objections. 
</P>
<P>
	``Honestly now, do you see a criminal? Do you see a murderer?''  
Kevorkian asked the jury. ``If you do, then you must convict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian was taken to the state prison at Jackson, where  
officials will evaluate him and determine whether to send him to a 
minimum-, medium- or maximum-security prison. 
</P>
<P>
	In his ``60 Minutes'' interview, Kevorkian threatened a hunger  
strike if sent to prison, a claim he has not repeated. If he does 
start a hunger strike, prison policy calls for forced feeding. He 
has staged two hunger strikes in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevorkian attorney Mayer Morganroth predicted the conviction  
will be reversed on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think as far as he's concerned he thinks that what he did  
was proper,'' he said. ``He knew the risks, and in order to move 
the process he took the risks.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Fall in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's trade surplus with the world fell 32.2  
percent in February from the same month last year as a strong yen 
hurt Japanese exports, the government said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The current account surplus -- Japan's broadest measure of trade  
-- slipped to a non-seasonally adjusted $9.34 billion in the second 
month of the year, the Finance Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports in February fell 5.4 percent to $19.88 billion, but the  
overall surplus shrank as exports dropped 13 percent to $29.12 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said that the plunge in exports was a worrying sign of  
more economic troubles ahead for Japan, as strong overseas sales 
have been one of the few factors propping up the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The weakening in exports was a result of ``mostly the strength  
of the yen beginning at the end of last year and even up to now,'' 
said Matthew Poggi, an economist at Lehman Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
	A strong yen hurts Japan's exports by making the country's  
products more expensive abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	The drop in the surplus was the first fall in three months and  
only the second since April 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The surplus was slightly lower than the $10 billion estimate  
from Tokyo-based economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's huge trade surplus has been a constant source of  
friction with the United States and other trading partners. They 
have been urging Japan to boost its economy to stimulate imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington has also threatened punitive measures unless Tokyo  
opens up its markets to more foreign competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The current account, which measures trade in merchandise,  
services, tourism and investment, is calculated by determining the 
difference between Japan's income from foreign sources against 
payments on foreign obligations. It excludes net capital 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Japan announced that its current account  
surplus for all of 1998 surged 38.7 percent to an unprecedented 
$133.6 billion.

<HEADLINE> Raiders Sue NFL Over Uniforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The state Supreme Court set aside a ruling  
allowing the Oakland Raiders to sue the NFL over the commercial use 
of their colors and insignia. 
</P>
<P>
	The court put the case on hold Wednesday until it resolves an  
arbitration dispute in another case. The Raiders also want to avoid 
arbitration and go to court with claims against the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven justices voted to review the league's appeal and hold  
the case until a ruling on the other arbitration issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The Raiders say their commercial rights over their pirate  
insignia and silver-and-black colors were violated when the NFL let 
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers use crossed swords in their insignia and 
approved ``ebony and pewter'' colors for the Carolina Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit also challenges a league requirement that coaches wear  
Nike clothing on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's 6th District Court of Appeal ruled in January that  
the Raiders could pursue those claims in court, rejecting the 
league's argument that arbitration was required. 
</P>
<P>
	The claims are part of a suit, filed in February 1996, accusing  
the NFL of mismanagement in its merchandise sales and of unfair 
treatment in retaliation for previous Raiders suits against the 
league over a move to Los Angeles in 1982. They returned to Oakland 
in 1995 and have a separate suit pending against the city and 
Alameda County over their lease. 
</P>
<P>
	The merchandise dispute involves the Raiders' claims that their  
colors and logo -- a man wearing an eye patch and a helmet with a 
backdrop of crossed swords -- had become so closely associated with 
the team over the years that they acquired trademark-type 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
	Their value was diluted when the league approved similar colors  
for the Panthers and a skull and crossed swords emblem for the 
Buccaneers, the suit said. 
</P>
<P>
	The league contended those claims must be arbitrated by  
commissioner Paul Tagliabue, under NFL bylaws that entitle the 
commissioner to resolve disputes involving two or more teams, 
including disputes over colors and helmet design. 
</P>
<P>
	The Raiders say they accounted for nearly 25 percent of the  
league's merchandise sales in 1991 and less than 5 percent today. 
Tagliabue became commissioner in 1989.

<HEADLINE> Gov't To Test Gulf War Treatments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The U.S. government will start testing an  
antibiotic this month as a possible cure for thousands of veterans 
who say they suffer from Gulf War syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty military and veterans' clinics across the country will  
offer the antibiotic, based on the theory that the unexplained 
symptoms are caused by an airborne bacteria and may be contagious. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not dealing with a black plague,'' said Dr. Charles  
Engel, director of the Gulf War health center at Walter Reed Army 
Medical Center in Washington D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people feel relatively comfortable,'' he said this week.  
``It is not infectious in the way that would result in some sort of 
catastrophic epidemic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $8 million study is one of two sponsored by the Defense  
Department and the Veterans Affairs Department. A $12 million study 
will test exercise and behavior changes as a possible cure. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 100,000 of the 700,000 Gulf War troops report  
suffering from extreme fatigue, joint and muscle pain, 
concentration and memory problems, rashes, fever, diarrhea and 
other symptoms that some call Gulf War Syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
	There are currently about 120 projects by the U.S. government  
investigating the cause, characteristics and prevalence of the 
illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	In the antibiotic study, researchers will look for strains of  
myscoplasma, a bacteria known to cause some plant and animal 
diseases. If the bacteria is found to be the cause, it means the 
conditions can be treated, but that they sufferers are likely 
mildly contagious.

<HEADLINE> Reputed Mobster Gets Probation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- The reputed boss of the New England mob  
has pleaded guilty to receiving stolen property -- a dishwasher and 
refrigerator he gave to his elderly mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Louis ``Baby Shacks'' Manocchio received a three-year suspended  
prison term and three years probation Tuesday from Superior Court 
Judge Joseph Rodgers in a deal reached with prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Manocchio pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of conspiracy  
and receiving stolen property. He was originally charged with 
receiving stolen goods worth more than $500, a felony, and could 
have gotten 10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	His lawyer, John Cicilline, said Manocchio wanted to shield his  
family from the negative publicity of a trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a 90-year-old mother who reads the newspapers and  
watches TV,'' Cicilline said. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Manocchio gave the appliances to his mother in  
1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant Attorney General William Ferland said prosecutors  
accepted an agreement because it would have been difficult to prove 
the used appliances were worth more than $500. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the guilty plea was a big win for the state because  
Manocchio now can be punished for almost any violation of his 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got to be looking over his shoulder,'' Ferland said.  
</P>
<P>
	The appliances were among $10 million in goods stolen by a  
mob-sanctioned gang in hundreds of robberies and break-ins at homes 
and businesses in Rhode Island, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine 
and Connecticut between 1989 and 1996, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	The stolen goods charge is the first criminal complaint  
Manocchio has faced since 1985, when he was convicted of a 1968 
gangland murder allegedly ordered by the late boss Raymond L.S. 
Patriarca. 
</P>
<P>
	His conviction was overturned by the Rhode Island Supreme Court,  
but he served two years in prison for conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say Manocchio became the gang's leader by default  
after Patriarca's son, Raymond J. ``Junior'' Patriarca, and other 
mobsters went to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Cicilline said he knows nothing about Manocchio having ties to  
the mob. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only time I've ever heard that is in the papers,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	His nickname originated with a relative, who was called  
``Shacks.'' Manocchio is also known to prosecutors as ``Baby 
Shanks.''

<HEADLINE> Teen-Ager Gets 70 Years for Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOMS RIVER, N.J. (AP) -- A teen-ager who strangled an 11-year-old  
boy after he came to his house selling items for the PTA was 
sentenced to 70 years in prison Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Manzie, 17, will have to serve at least 59 1/2 years of the  
sentence handed down for the 1997 murder of Eddie Werner. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Manzie killed the boy for rejecting his sexual  
advances. He later shot a photo of the boy's half-naked body, a 
necktie and alarm clock cord around his neck. 
</P>
<P>
	With his head bowed, Manzie calmly read a statement of apology,  
saying he was sorry ``for all of the suffering I've put so many 
people through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't the way things should work out. I still can't  
figure out why I did what I did,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The apology came during an emotional 2 1/2-hour courtroom drama in  
which Manzie's mother was ejected for an angry outburst and 
Werner's grieving parents urged a life prison term for the Sept. 
27, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The Manzies blamed psychiatrists and other mental health experts  
for not locking their son up before he killed the boy. His parents 
asked a judge to do so less than a week before the killing, but the 
judge released Manzie to his parents' custody. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were told over and over and over again that he wasn't  
violent, that he wouldn't hurt anybody,'' Dolores Manzie said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the judge ordered her removed from the courtroom later when  
a prosecutor said she had threatened to kill herself if doctors did 
not agree to commit her son to full-time care. 
</P>
<P>
	``Take him for a week and tell me you'd be able to handle it!''  
she screamed. ``I couldn't handle my child anymore. At least I 
admitted it,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Income Tax Deadline Day / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Americans generally accept the day for what it  
is, one of anxiety, haste, confusion and, in the end (which might 
be midnight) of relief. It is income tax deadline day. 
</P>
<P>
	In spite of this, Americans have a typically upbeat way of  
hiding their stress: sharing experiences and self-deprecatory jokes 
while in line where, for once, everyone is the ``typical 
American.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If you can't fight it, and you can't, then join it. Declare a  
holiday. Though unofficial, April 15 is nevertheless ``celebrated'' 
by more Americans than some of the lesser known official holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	Fast food outlets will offer food and drink in some post  
offices. Bands will play, quartets sing. Advertisers will hand out 
coupons, reporters will ask questions and pollsters will poll. 
</P>
<P>
	But there is much more to the story -- the other side, for  
instance. In their more reflective moments, most taxpayers express 
anger about a system they no longer comprehend. 
</P>
<P>
	That's understandable. The Internal Revenue Service itself often  
gives incorrect answers. Millions of the annual 35 million penalty 
notices can be challenged as inaccurate. Thousands of audits too. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps hard for you to believe, but many of those people in  
line are tax delinquents. There are 24 million in all. Each year, 3 
million claims are issued against wages and bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of these folks will never catch up, because penalties and  
interest relentlessly add to their problem. Many could get relief, 
if only they knew how. But they don't know, and nobody tells them. 
</P>
<P>
	And so the bill grows. As of last year, about $246 billion was  
owed in delinquent taxes, and there is little or no reason to 
believe it will shrink after the latest filings are computed. 
</P>
<P>
	Failing alternatives, weary taxpayers accept with resignation or  
unconcern such startling statistics as those from the Tax 
Foundation showing taxpayers work nearly three hours of every work 
day to pay local, state and federal taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Surveys show taxpayers would consider income tax alternatives if  
presented clearly, but clarity in taxing is a mission rarely 
accomplished. Alternatives are proposed, but they don't get far. 
</P>
<P>
	When the various alternative proposals -- a sales tax, the flat  
tax, for example -- are viewed in depth they seem to have logic on 
their side, but logic doesn't count for much. Fear of change does. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal income tax code is now so thoroughly confusing and  
often contradictory that few people, if any, have ever read it 
through, and probably none of them could explain it simply. 
</P>
<P>
	This confusion is one of the factors working against change.  
Since nobody can convincingly say what level of revenues would 
results from their alternatives, such proposals eventually die. 
</P>
<P>
	Not always do they die of their own internal weaknesses. Often  
they are hurried on their way by the tax establishment, including 
lawyers, tax preparers, accountants, tax researchers, et al. 
</P>
<P>
	April 15: Hardly a day to celebrate. Tax Freedom Day, marking  
the day on which Americans will have worked long enough to have 
paid their taxes for the year, will not occur until May 11.

<HEADLINE>  McGwire Homers Twice Against Bucs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- It's starting to look like 1998 all over again  
for Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	With flashbulbs popping on every at-bat just as a year ago,  
McGwire homered in two of his first three at-bats off Pirates 
starter Pete Schourek on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire jumped on left-hander Schourek's first pitch, a sinking  
fastball down around the knees, and lined it into the left-field 
seats in the first inning. 
</P>
<P>
	After being intentionally walked in the third, McGwire led off  
the fifth by hitting a 1-1 pitch over the 400-foot mark in center 
field and into the netting covering the hitters' background. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly a hundred fans sprinted for the seats, hoping to come up  
with a souvenir, before a fan reached under one of the covered 
seats and pulled out McGwire's fourth homer of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	It was 54th multiple-homer game of McGwire's career, tying him  
with Frank Robinson for fifth place all-time. 
</P>
<P>
	After homering only once in his first five games, McGwire has  
caught up to his pace of his 70-homer season. Last year, he homered 
four times in his first four games but didn't hit No. 5 until the 
St. Louis Cardinals' 13th game. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire also seems to have found his stroke in Three Rivers  
Stadium, where he went homerless on his first two visits there 
after joining the Cardinals in 1997. He now has four homers in his 
last three starts in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire hit homers No. 52 (Francisco Cordova) and No. 53  
(Ricardo Rincon) on consecutive games Aug. 22-23 in Pittsburgh, 
then sat out the final game of the three-game series on Aug. 24. He 
later hit No. 63 off reliever Jason Christiansen during the 
Pirates' final visit to St. Louis in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Even in Pittsburgh, McGwire Power upstages Cowher Power.  
</P>
<P>
	McGwire had a surprise visitor during batting practice:  
Pittsburgh Steelers coach Bill Cowher. But with the left-field 
stands filled even during batting practice as fans gathered for the 
chance to grab a McGwire long ball, Cowher's presence almost seemed 
to be ignored by most fans. 
</P>
<P>
	Cowher, wearing a Steelers windbreaker and coaching shorts,  
talked with Cardinals manager Tony La Russa for about 15 minutes. 
While they were talking, McGwire playfully sneaked up behind up 
Cowher and nearly put him into a bear hug. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire put on his usual power show during batting practice,  
though he did not repeatedly reach the upper deck as he did on his 
two visits to Three Rivers Stadium last year.

<HEADLINE> Congress Moves on Flag Amendment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After falling four votes short two years ago,  
members of Congress on Wednesday renewed their efforts to amend the 
Constitution to protect the American flag from desecration. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed constitutional amendment was approved by the House  
Judiciary Constitution subcommittee on a 7-4 party-line vote, with 
all Republicans in favor and Democrats opposed. A Senate panel is 
to consider the issue next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The flag of the United States represents values that bind  
America together,'' said Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., chairman of 
the House subcommittee. ``It warrants our respect and protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said laws banning flag desecration could infringe on  
First Amendment rights to freedom of expression. They also 
expressed doubt that desecration could be properly defined when 
images of the flag appear on clothing, commercial products and 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	The flag is a symbol of inalienable rights such as freedom of  
speech, said Rep. Mel Watt, D-N.C., ranking Democrat on the panel. 
``I don't think we can pass a flag amendment that undermines any of 
those inalienable rights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed amendment would not ban the physical desecration of  
the flag but would allow Congress to pass legislation to restrict 
conduct, but not expression, concerning the flag. 
</P>
<P>
	The drive grew out of Supreme Court rulings in 1989 and 1990.  
The first, by a 5-4 vote, invalidated the flag protection laws of 
48 states and Congress. The second struck down a new act of 
Congress passed in the wake of the first court decision. 
</P>
<P>
	If the proposed amendment were to pass both the House and Senate  
by two-thirds majorities, then three-fourths of the state 
legislatures would have to ratify it before the amendment would 
become part of the Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	The flag amendment cleared the House by a 310-114 vote in 1995  
and again by 312-120 in 1997. But the Senate did not consider it in 
1995 and two years ago rejected it by 63-36, four short of the 
two-thirds majority needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters said 49 state legislatures -- all but Vermont -- have  
passed resolutions urging Congress to approve a flag amendment.

<HEADLINE> Study: Pacific Traps Carbon Dioxide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	El Nino prevents the Pacific Ocean from releasing as much carbon  
dioxide into the atmosphere as usual, a phenomenon that may help 
slow global warming, scientists say. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  
Administration found that from 1991 to 1994 -- years when El Nino 
warmed the Pacific -- the ocean released 30 percent to 80 percent 
less carbon dioxide, a gas that is believed to trap heat in the 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	The finding was published in Thursday's issue of the journal  
Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists commonly estimate how much carbon dioxide should be  
in the atmosphere by calculating how much fossil fuel is burned. 
But some 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide go unaccounted for each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the NOAA research, reduced carbon dioxide releases  
in the Pacific Ocean during El Nino could account for about 16 
percent to 36 percent of this ``missing'' CO2. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, we are very, very interested in where the CO2,  
which we are releasing every year during fossil fuel burning, ends 
up,'' said Rik Wanninkhof, an NOAA oceanographer. 
</P>
<P>
	Understanding the year-to-year changes in CO2 levels is key to  
explaining how the oceans, the land and the atmosphere regulate 
Earth's climate. 
</P>
<P>
	Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have been rising for  
decades, a phenomenon blamed on increased burning of fossil fuels 
and deforestation. Some scientists say this has contributed to this 
century's global warming trend. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, episodes of El Nino -- the naturally occurring,  
cyclical warming of the Pacific Ocean -- were shown to spur more 
plant growth, which in turn sucks carbon dioxide out of the 
atmosphere. The NOAA research shows yet another way El Nino helps 
reduce CO2 levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Usually, the equatorial waters of the Pacific are the source of  
three-quarters of the carbon dioxide released by the world's 
tropical oceans. The northern Pacific sucks up all of that carbon 
and more each year, making it one of the biggest ``carbon sinks,'' 
or areas that absorb carbon dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
	El Nino intensifies that process: The trade winds along the  
equator die down, so the upwelling of cold, carbon-rich waters 
decreases and less CO2 is sent into the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the NOAA study, the equatorial Pacific released 900  
million tons of carbon in 1996, a normal year. The same seas 
released 300 million tons in 1992, 600 million tons in 1993 and 700 
million tons in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Doney, an oceanographer with the National Center for  
Atmospheric Research, said what is different about this study is 
the wealth of data the researchers were able to gather. The 
scientists put their equipment on NOAA ships servicing 80 weather 
stations all over the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got good snapshots for six or seven different areas  
through a pretty major period,'' he said. ``This study is very 
important in terms of diagnosing what happened to the carbon 
dioxide.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls Against Yen, Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen Wednesday as a  
Japanese newspaper reported that its country's major life insurers 
were moving away from buying U.S. Treasury bonds. The euro rose 
against the dollar in light trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0800, up  
from $1.0754 late Tuesday. The dollar was worth 118.68 Japanese 
yen, down from 119.83 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nihon Keizai newspaper reported Wednesday that Japan's five  
major life insurers were prepared to buy their country's assets 
rather than bonds from other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar fell nearly two yen during the Asian trading session,  
which traders blamed on the newspaper report. The dollar started 
falling late Tuesday on reports that the newspaper was about to 
carry the story. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need the Japanese to recirculate that money into our  
Treasury market,'' said Grant Wilson, foreign exchange vice 
president at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Moderate trading in the yen continued from Asia to Europe, where  
``the market's still reacting to the story on Japanese 
investment,'' said Paul Meggyesi, a currency economist at Deutsche 
Bank in London. 
</P>
<P>
	Also helping the yen were statements by Herwig Schloegl, the  
incoming deputy secretary-general of the Organization for Economic 
Cooperation and Development. He said the Japanese economy ``has 
bottomed out and is well prepared for a recovery.'' Japan has been 
fighting its worst recession since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading in the euro was quiet, with the new European currency  
hovering at $1.0800 from the European to the New York sessions. 
``The euro, you can throw a wet blanket over it and put it to 
sleep,'' Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was quoted at 1.4854 Swiss francs, down from 1.4905,  
and 1.4937 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4908. The British pound was 
quoted at $1.6129, down from $1.6158. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro no  
longer are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed 
rate. Based on Wednesday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8109 
German marks, down from 1.8188; 6.0753 French francs, down from 
6.1013; and 1,792.11 Italian lire, down from 1,801.80.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Chief Arrives in Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- The head of the World Bank arrived in Moscow on  
Wednesday to discuss Russia's social and economic reform efforts 
and iron out plans for a new loan. 
</P>
<P>
	World Bank President James Wolfensohn planned to meet with  
President Boris Yeltsin, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, and other 
officials, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Wolfensohn intended to review Russia's efforts to restructure  
the industrial sector, establish a social safety net, reform the 
coal industry and fulfill other projects agreed upon with the Bank, 
ITAR-Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
	Moscow hopes to obtain $1.85 billion in World Bank loans to  
carry out various structural reforms. The loans were part of a 
$22.6 billion international bailout package frozen in August when 
the Russian government defaulted on some debts and devalued the 
ruble in response to turmoil in world markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia badly needs new loans to avoid defaulting on its massive  
foreign debt and to help it get out of one of the worst depressions 
ever suffered by an industrial nation. 
</P>
<P>
	A team from the International Monetary Fund was also in Moscow  
on Wednesday to finalize plans for a new loan. Russia's lack of a 
loan accord with the IMF has held up the World Bank credit. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov, who leads negotiations  
with foreign lenders, said Tuesday that talks had been complicated 
by Russia's harsh criticism of NATO strikes in Yugoslavia and by 
other political disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF has said talks are difficult because of Russia's  
rejection of some economic measures demanded by the fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Primakov told banking officials Wednesday that the  
government would encourage the private depositors to put their 
money back in Russian banks to give the sector more resources for 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Russians have lost all faith in the country's banks, a  
number of which went belly up and barred depositors from 
withdrawing their money after the August crisis struck. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before August, far more Russians kept their money in hard  
currency at home than deposited it in bank accounts. Others took 
their money abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must create conditions in which keeping savings under the  
mattress or taking them out of the country would be inexpedient,'' 
Primakov said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government recently set a $5,000 limit on the amount of hard  
currency Russian citizens can take out of the country legally. 
</P>
<P>
	Primakov has estimated that before the regulation, when Russian  
citizens could take out virtually unlimited amounts of hard 
currency, about $20-25 billion annually was taken abroad.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan-US Jet Deal Seeks Suppliers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Officials from a Taiwan-U.S. aircraft  
joint venture met Wednesday with Taiwanese suppliers hoping to 
participate in a corporate jet project. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 Taiwanese manufacturers joined in the conference with  
officials of Sino Swearingen, which plans to begin producing the 
SJ30-2 corporate jet in West Virginia at the end of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Company president and CEO Jack Braly, who attended the  
conference, did not say if any deals had been struck. 
</P>
<P>
	Sino Swearingen was founded in 1995 by Taiwan's Sino-Aerospace  
Investment Corp. and Swearingen Aircraft Inc. of San Antonio, Texas 
to build the SJ30-2, an advanced version of the Swearingen SJ30 
six-seat pressurized business jet. 
</P>
<P>
	The company says it has received over 140 orders for the SJ30-2,  
and plans to begin delivering the $4 million jets starting in 
November 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	But it still has only one plane in the air, a pre-production  
prototype that flies test flights at corporate headquarters in 
Texas, as the type awaits a U.S. Federal Aviation Administration 
certification.

<HEADLINE> 5 Kids Die When Car Sinks in Wash. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EPHRATA, Wash. (AP) -- A car carrying two women and five children  
plunged into a swift-flowing irrigation canal, trapping them 
inside. The women managed to crawl through a window and float to 
safety, but the boys -- ages 2 to 11 -- never made it out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Five children is a traumatic thing,'' Grant County  
Undersheriff Mike Shay said after the bodies were recovered. ``You 
look at those five kids, and you think of your own children and 
grandchildren.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators were trying to determine what caused Tuesday  
night's accident about a mile north of this central Washington farm 
town. There was no indication alcohol was a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	The car plunged into the cold waters of a V-shaped,  
concrete-lined canal that carries water from Grand Coulee Dam and 
nourishes tracts of fruit tree orchards, hay fields and row crops. 
</P>
<P>
	The women escaped through an open driver's side window and  
floated several hundred yards downstream before being pulled from 
the canal near Terry Catlin's home. 
</P>
<P>
	Catlin, an irrigation district employee and reserve sheriff's  
deputy, raced to the scene after telling his mother to call 911. 
The car was resting upside down under 20 feet of water on the floor 
of the canal. 
</P>
<P>
	The water was too swift for divers to try to remove the bodies,  
so they hooked up cables to the 1987 Chevrolet Spectrum and lifted 
it out nearly 90 minutes after the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Shay found the bodies of the five boys in the back seat.  
</P>
<P>
	They were identified as Alexis Curiel, 2; Jose Curiel Jr., 4;  
Jose Chavez, 3; Martin Chavez, Jr., 2; and Victor Eduardo Chavez, 
11. 
</P>
<P>
	Their mothers -- the driver, Rosa Curiel, 24, and Maria Chavez,  
32 -- were treated at a hospital and released.

<HEADLINE> IOC To Introduce `Morals Clause' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The International Olympic Committee plans to  
include a ``morals clause'' in future Olympic sponsorship contracts 
allowing sponsors to walk out in the event of ethics scandals, 
according to the committee's marketing chief. 
</P>
<P>
	Marketing director Michael Payne said the IOC would make the  
changes as a result of the Salt Lake City vote-buying affair. 
</P>
<P>
	In a speech Tuesday at the UK National Sponsorship Conference in  
London, Payne said the IOC would ``look to introduce some form of 
morals clause that will in future give our partners an `out' if 
there is an ethical lapse and we don't move to fix it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC has come under intense pressure from its top corporate  
sponsors in the wake of the scandal over more than $1 million in 
improper inducements accepted by IOC members during Salt Lake's 
winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsors, who pay up to $50 million for exclusive Olympic  
marketing rights, have expressed concern that the scandal would 
tarnish their investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne said the scandal had ``threatened the very existence of  
the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If the IOC did not act decisively and quickly, then the  
institution was going to be in danger of collapsing,'' he said.

<P>
	But Payne said the action the IOC has since taken to clean house  
and initiate reforms has ensured that the committee would emerge a 
``much, much stronger and better organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six IOC members were expelled and four resigned in the Salt Lake  
case. In a bid to repair its image and restore public and corporate 
confidence, the IOC has also modified the Olympic bidding and 
selection process and set up ethics and reform panels. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not sure that today, people fully appreciate the  
magnitude of the steps that have been taken, and the change 
underway within the IOC,'' Payne said. ``But in time, people will 
look back and see this time as a defining moment in Olympic 
history, where, in the end, an awful lot of good will come out of a 
very difficult and ugly period.''

<HEADLINE> WNBA, Union Settle Labor Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The WNBA avoided a work stoppage Wednesday by  
agreeing to a four-year collective bargaining agreement with the 
newly formed women's players' union. 
</P>
<P>
	After several days of talks, an agreement came when both sides  
compromised on the most contentious issues -- salaries and benefits, 
insurgent ABL players and guaranteed contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	The preliminary agreement, which is expected to be ratified  
Monday, includes increases in minimum salaries, a retirement 
package and year-round health insurance. It increases the minimum 
salary from $15,000 to $30,000 for veterans and $25,000 for 
rookies. It also includes a pension and 401K plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The 10 pre-existing teams will be limited to three players from  
the defunct ABL, while the expansion teams in Orlando and Minnesota 
will each be allowed five ex-ABL players. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the league plans to add four new teams in 2000 with  
no limits on ABL players. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement calls for salary increases each year, with  
veterans receiving a $40,000 minimum in the fourth year of the 
contract. Players also will receive a royalty share on merchandise 
using their name or likeness. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the league and union spoke by telephone Wednesday  
to work on specifics. A majority of the 122 players, many of whom 
are playing overseas, are expected to ratify the agreement by 
conference call Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The turning point in the talks came when the league agreed to  
compromise on the minimum salary and make a distinction between 
rookie and veteran salaries. In addition, the league agreed that 
all contracts will become guaranteed at midseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations began in February, and the two sides risked  
delaying the start of the third WNBA season, scheduled to begin 
June 10. 
</P>
<P>
	The league's pre-draft camp is scheduled to begin Thursday in  
Chicago.

<HEADLINE> Zapata Has Internet Plans Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Fish products company Zapata Corp. plans to sell  
shares of its Zap.com Internet subsidiary to Zapata shareholders in 
an offering expected to raise $108.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The company on Tuesday filed plans with the Securities and  
Exchange Commission to sell shares of Zap.com for $8 each. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's stock has made large gains twice in the past year  
after Internet-related maneuvers were announced. Both times, Zapata 
has backed off the announcements. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 6, Zapata said it would buy or invest in 21 Web sites  
and would separate its Internet operations from those making fish 
meal and sausage casings. Stocks prices soared, reaching their 
highest level in more than a decade on July 16 at 22. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, Zapata announced it was forming an alliance with  
Amazon.com, boosting the stock price nearly 20 percent. It turned 
out the alliance with Amazon.com was no different from arrangements 
Amazon has with nearly 200,000 other Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	A class-action lawsuit by shareholders accuses two former board  
members and chief executive officer Avram Glazer of issuing 
fraudulent news releases to inflate the stock price, according to 
USA Today. The board members sold their 414,500 shares of Zapata 
stock, worth $8.5 million, after the July announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants say the suit should be dismissed because there is  
no evidence of fraud and no company insiders profited from the 
stock movement. 
</P>
<P>
	Zapata stock was unchanged trading this morning at 10 3/8.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Vows To Seal China Trade Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Signaling their commitment to reaching a trade  
deal, President Clinton and Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji agreed to 
``move intensively'' in talks on opening China's markets and 
allowing the world's most populous nation to join the World Trade 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Zhu made the announcement in a joint communique  
after a 20-minute telephone conversation Tuesday while Zhu was 
visiting New York. Zhu left Washington last week disappointed that 
talks hadn't yielded a deal in time for his official visit to the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``During the conversation, they agreed that both sides should  
move intensively on negotiations toward resolution of the remaining 
issues in their talks on China's accession to the WTO,'' the joint 
communique said. ``They have agreed to have negotiations continue 
by the end of the month in Beijing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came as the administration rebutted  
congressional criticism of its failure to complete a trade deal and 
open China's vast market to American exporters during Zhu's visit. 
</P>
<P>
	A White House official closely tracking the issue said that  
although major differences remained in a half-dozen areas -- 
including rules governing banking, auto financing and greater 
access for Hollywood movies to China's markets -- there was still 
hope for a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's clear from the conversation the president had with Zhu  
today is that both parties want to try intensively to move the ball 
forward,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
The official cautioned, ``It's hard to predict outcomes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several lawmakers have expressed concern that China would  
withdraw concessions it made if a deal wasn't struck before Zhu 
left the country today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to ensure that we work very hard on resolving the  
remaining differences,'' said White House spokesman Jake Siewert. 
``But we've said all along, and we'll say it again -- in the end, 
what will drive the deal is real progress on opening China's 
markets, not any artificial deadlines or visits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky told lawmakers  
earlier Tuesday that Clinton was committed to seeing that 
negotiations are finished in time to clear the way for China to 
join the WTO, which regulates world trade, this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will re-engage with the Chinese shortly ... and work on  
each of the issues that are open to bring this full agreement to 
closure,'' Barshefsky told members of the Senate Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Many senators expressed fear Tuesday that a number of major  
concessions China was willing to make last week in order to close a 
deal during Zhu's visit may now be withdrawn. 
</P>
<P>
	Several pointed to comments made by Zhu and other Chinese  
officials criticizing the administration for mischaracterizing 
commitments China has made, and the United States issued a detailed 
17-page fact sheet outlining the Chinese offers. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu complained last Friday the administration had ``made public  
many documents and said we had agreed to them, but in fact we have 
not agreed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, accused the administration of  
abandoning free-trade principles in an effort to force the Chinese 
to agree to blatantly protectionist provisions being pushed by U.S. 
textile and steel companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling the government's stance ``raw, rotten protectionism,''  
Gramm said the administration was trying to force China to extend 
U.S. textile quotas for five years longer than allowed under WTO 
rules. He said high U.S. barriers in this area already cost the 
average family of four $700 more in clothing bills each year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to lose more jobs by protecting noncompetitive  
American industries than we are going to possibly gain in those 
areas,'' Gramm said. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials have said that allegations about  
Chinese espionage and human rights abuses in China had made it even 
harder to win congressional approval for any trade deal short of an 
exceptional market-opening package. 
</P>
<P>
	According to one administration strategy being considered, U.S.  
and Chinese negotiators would wrap up a deal this year but delay a 
congressional vote on the matter until after the 2000 presidential 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	Under this approach, China would join the Geneva-based WTO, but  
the United States would ``reserve approval.'' That would mean U.S. 
business would not get the benefits of China's market-opening moves 
until Congress got around to passing legislation ending annual 
reviews of U.S. tariff rates for Chinese goods.

<HEADLINE>  Brand's NBA Decision a `No-Brainer' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Even his coach knew it was time to go.  
</P>
<P>
	Elton Brand, who won just about every individual honor a player  
can, left Duke on Wednesday and headed to the NBA. The 6-foot-8 
sophomore center became the first Blue Devils player to quit school 
early for pro ball. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing his decision to give up his last two years of  
eligibility, Brand was joined at Cameron Indoor Stadium by his 
mother, Daisy, and a half-dozen teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Krzyzewski, recovering from hip surgery at home,  
joined in by telephone and called the decision by the player of the 
year a ``no-brainer.''. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand was persuaded to leave school last weekend by Krzyzewski  
and associate head coach Johnny Dawkins, a former Duke star and NBA 
player. They are certain Brand will be a top 10 pick in the June 30 
NBA draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way college basketball has played me last year with the  
double teams and zones, coach felt I would only improve in practice 
and wouldn't get a chance to develop in the games,'' Brand said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand averaged 17.8 points and 9.8 rebounds a game in carrying  
the Blue Devils to a 37-2 record. But he fell short of his goal of 
leading the Blue Devils to the national title, with a 77-74 loss to 
Connecticut in the NCAA championship game last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's somewhat of a sad time to be leaving friends, teammates  
and coaches,'' Brand said. ``But it's also a joyous time because I 
get to go into new adventures and new things and just live a 
lifetime dream of mine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He is the fourth player to come out early for the NBA draft,  
joining Ron Artest (St. John's), Steve Francis (Maryland) and 
Albert White (Missouri). Underclassmen have until May 15 to 
declare. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand was the first sophomore to win the John R. Wooden Award,  
presented by the Los Angeles Athletic Club to college basketball's 
top player. He also was honored this season by The Associated 
Press, the Atlanta Tipoff Club and the United States Basketball 
Writers Association as national player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand's announcement could lead two other Duke underclassmen --  
sophomore Will Avery and freshman Corey Maggette -- to jump to the 
pros. Neither attended Wednesday's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, wearing a light gray suit, received an ovation from about  
50 fans when he entered Cameron, bringing a smile to his face. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited financial security and an opportunity to improve his  
game as reasons for his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very important to be able to take care of my mom and my  
family and have them live comfortably,'' said Brand, who grew up in 
a low-income area in Peekskill, N.Y., without a father. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand, who was benched for two games by Krzyzewski in early  
December for being out of shape, is realistic about his next step. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still not ready physically to go out there and play with  
those guys, but in a month or two from now I'll be more prepared,'' 
said Brand, who will begin a workout regimen with Dawkins 
immediately. ``I don't think anyone coming out of college is 
actually ready to play in the NBA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Brand will be gone next season, the Blue Devils have  
signed four prep All-Americans for next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``You are going to see players who are coming out of high school  
who probably wouldn't choose Duke because they didn't think Coach K 
let his players leave early now say, `I can go to Duke because 
Elton Brand is leaving,''' junior Chris Carrawell said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Times are changing,'' he added. ``It was one of those things  
where Elton Brand got the player of the year award. He swept every 
major award. What are you going to come back for, to sweep it 
again? The only thing he had to accomplish on the college level was 
to win a national championship. That was it basically.''

<HEADLINE> Cloud Hangs Over NATO Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Instead of a celebration, NATO's 50th  
anniversary summit in Washington next week is expected to become a 
somber working session dominated by the fighting in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Before NATO's air campaign began, President Clinton and other  
leaders saw the summit as a chance to trumpet the Cold War victory 
over the Soviet Union and to welcome the alliance's three newest 
members, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, with thousands of refugees stranded because of attacks by  
Serbians in Kosovo, and the possibility that NATO could commit 
ground troops to combat for the first time if the situation 
worsens, State Department officials said the atmosphere should be 
neither too upbeat nor too gloomy. 
</P>
<P>
	But 50 years of accomplishments can't be ignored, they say.  
</P>
<P>
	Besides heads of state and government and foreign and defense  
ministers from the 19 NATO members, top officials from NATO's 
Partnership for Peace members such as Austria and Uzbekistan also 
are due to attend the April 23-25 conference. That would make it 
the largest assembly of foreign leaders in Washington since 
President Kennedy's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
	There was supposed to be a session of the NATO-Russia Permanent  
Joint Council, but U.S. officials say the Russians have not said 
whether they will attend the summit or at what level. Russia has 
withdrawn its representative from NATO headquarters in Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	At their summit, the NATO leaders also plan to identify the  
purpose of NATO for the 21st century in a new strategic doctrine, 
the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said Tuesday the summit  
``will focus simultaneously on what has been and is, and what will 
be ... including every aspect of the situation in Kosovo and the 
surrounding region.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, NATO's role as the institution of choice when the United  
States and its European allies decide to act together militarily 
has moved ``from the realm of theory to practice in the Kosovo 
crisis,'' said Ronald Asmus, a deputy assistant secretary of state 
and one of the summit planners. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a way that no speech or article can express, Kosovo has  
underscored the reason why the U.S. and Europe still need a strong 
military alliance in the 21st century,'' Asmus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Haas, a former National Security official in the Bush  
administration, said that because Kosovo has become a test for the 
United States and NATO, leaders will have to deal with the issue at 
the summit. 
</P>
<P>
	``People around the world will draw their lessons, like it or  
not, about what the United States and NATO are willing and able to 
do on behalf of their interests in the post-Cold War world,'' Haas 
said at a seminar at the Brookings Institution, where he is 
director of foreign policy studies. 
</P>
<P>
	At the summit, the United States and its European allies will  
try to define new missions and responsibilities for NATO, which 
include using force outside the territory of its 19 members. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Senate Armed  
Service Committee, has suggested that NATO postpone stating its new 
aims until the situation in Kosovo is clearer. 
</P>
<P>
	``My recommendation is that the conference not try to finalize  
such an important document and wait for a reasonable period until 
lessons learned from Kosovo can be fully assessed,'' Warner said in 
a telephone interview. ``Now is not the time to write in stone a 
new strategic concept.''

<HEADLINE> Black Woman Elected Mayor in N.C. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRENTON, N.C. (AP) -- A black woman was selected mayor of this  
small town where no black has ever before held office, succeeding a 
white man who resigned after saying blacks are unfit to govern. 
</P>
<P>
	The Town Council unanimously selected Sylvia Willis on Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
	She will complete former Mayor Joffree Leggett's term, which  
expires in November. Leggett resigned in March after saying blacks 
were not leaders and would rather be led by whites. 
</P>
<P>
	He made the comments amid criticism over the farming town's  
refusal to annex three black neighborhoods that have about 100 
residents. Trenton at the time had 200 residents, about 50 of them 
black. 
</P>
<P>
	After the NAACP got involved and blacks boycotted Trenton  
businesses, all of which are white-owned, the Town Council agreed 
to annex the neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Willis' husband, activist Daniel J. Willis, had threatened  
another boycott unless a black person was named to the council. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the beginning of a coming together -- or trying,  
anyway,'' Mrs. Willis said.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Down at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks edged higher Thursday morning as  
investors snapped up financial shares and Sony announced a deal 
with IBM. The dollar rose slightly against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average rose 22.90 points, or 0.14 percent, to  
close the morning session at 16,787.58. On Wednesday, the average 
closed up 49.52 points, or 0.87 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.02 yen, up 0.16 yen from late Wednesday in  
Tokyo and above its level of 118.68 yen in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, many Japanese bank issues rose following  
the gain in financial shares in New York after U.S. investment bank 
J.P. Morgan released stronger-than-expected first quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in Sony Corp. surged after an announcement Wednesday that  
it will jointly develop and market digital editing systems for 
television broadcasting with International Business Machines. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 16.65 points  
-- or 0.1 percent -- to 10,411.66 at Wednesday's close, its third 
straight record finish. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Tokyo market's rise was being capped by fears that the  
yen's appreciation against the dollar will hurt earnings at Japan's 
exporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
exchange's first section was up 1.23 points, or 0.09 percent, to 
1,344.58 The TOPIX closed up 11.61 points, or 0.87 percent, the day 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar gained on a wave of buying from  
Japanese trust banks at the mid-118 yen level, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the U.S. currency remained under some selling pressure after  
the Nihon Keizai business newspaper reported Wednesday that 
Japanese life insurers would reduce their investment in U.S. 
Treasury bonds. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Indiana's Luke Recker To Transfer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Luke Recker, Indiana's leading scorer last  
season, has decided to transfer, becoming the third starter in the 
past two years to leave Bobby Knight's program. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-6 sophomore swingman said Wednesday he hasn't decided  
which school he will attend next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the other recent transfers, however, Recker said the  
reason was his own lack of development as a player, not because of 
any personal conflict with the Hoosiers coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the toughest decision I have ever made,'' Recker said.  
``I love the state of Indiana, and playing for IU was always my 
lifelong dream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recker was Indiana's 1997 Mr. Basketball as a senior and made an  
oral commitment to become a Hoosier two years before that, becoming 
one of Knight's earliest recruits. 
</P>
<P>
	At Indiana, he started 63 of 66 games. Only junior guard A.J.  
Guyton, who also reportedly has been considering leaving early to 
enter the NBA draft, had more starts (64) over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I appreciate the opportunity given to me by coach Knight,''  
Recker said in a statement Wednesday. ``However, I have not been 
satisfied with my development as a player. I blame no one but 
myself for this and believe my development will best be served in 
another program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Recker started 30 of 32 games and averaged 12.8 points a game as  
a freshman, then started 33 of 34 games last season, averaging 16.1 
points a game. 
</P>
<P>
	Recker joins guard Neil Reed and center Jason Collier to leave  
the program in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Reed left after the 1997 season, accusing Knight of physical and  
verbal abuse, and later enrolled at Southern Mississippi. In 
December 1997, Collier quit the team, saying he no longer could 
take Knight's constant criticism, and enrolled at Georgia Tech. 
</P>
<P>
	Recker will have to sit out one season if he transfers to  
another Division 1 school and then will have two years of 
eligibility remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not easy to leave my friends, my family and my home  
state,'' Recker said. ``I love to play basketball, and the thought 
of sitting out a year kills me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There has been speculation he might transfer to Iowa to play for  
new coach Steve Alford, another former Indiana Mr. Basketball and 
two-time All-American at Indiana under Knight. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight was at a coaching clinic in Cuba and could not be reached  
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement from the Indiana athletic department said, ``We are  
very sorry that Luke has decided to leave Indiana University. He 
has been an integral and important part of our basketball program 
the last two years. We will miss him. We wish him much success as 
he goes forward.''

<HEADLINE> Excerpts From Kevorkian Sentencing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from Oakland County Judge Jessica Cooper's statement to  
Dr. Jack Kevorkian before sentencing him to 10 to 25 years in 
prison: 

</P>
<P>
	``This is a court of law and you said you invited yourself here  
to take a final stand. But this trial was not an opportunity for a 
referendum. The law prohibiting euthanasia was specifically 
reviewed and clarified by the Michigan Supreme Court several years 
ago in a decision involving your very own cases, sir.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``We have the means and the methods to protest the laws with  
which we disagree. You can criticize the law, you can write or 
lecture about the law, you can speak to the media, or petition the 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
	``But you must always stay within the limits provided by the  
law. You may not break the law. You may not take the law into your 
own hands. 
</P>
<P>
	``In point of fact, the issue of assisted suicide was addressed  
in this state by referendum just last November. And while the 
proponents of that were out campaigning, you were with Thomas Youk. 
And the voters of the state of Michigan said `no.' And they said 
no, 2 1/2-to-1.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``No one is unmindful of the controversy and emotion that exists  
over end-of-life issues and pain control. And I assume that the 
debate will continue in a calm and reasoned forum long after this 
trial and your activities have faded from public memory.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``This trial was not about the political or moral correctness of  
euthanasia. It was all about you, sir. It was about lawlessness. It 
was about disrespect for a society that exists and flourishes 
because of the strength of the legal system. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one, sir, is above the law. No one.''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``You were on bond to another judge when you committed this  
offense, you were not licensed to practice medicine when you 
committed this offense, and you hadn't been licensed for eight 
years. And you had the audacity to go on national television, show 
the world what you did and dare the legal system to stop you. 
</P>
<P>
	``Well sir, consider yourself stopped.''

<HEADLINE> Indy Entry List Totals 84 Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Jaques Lazier, the seventh rookie and the  
younger brother of former Indianapolis 500 winner Buddy Lazier, was 
among the final group of entries announced Wednesday for the May 30 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Another six cars whose entries were postmarked before last  
Friday's deadline were added to the list, raising the total to 84 
eligible to compete for the 33 starting spots. Seventy-five cars 
were entered last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Lazier, 28, who raced in the Indy Lights series last season, was  
assigned to two cars entered by DR-Lazier Racing, a team owned by 
his father, former Indy driver Bob Lazier. Buddy Lazier, the 1996 
winner, is one of three former champions entered in the race and 
will drive for Hemelgarn Racing with teammate Johnny Unser. 
</P>
<P>
	The other former winners are Eddie Cheever, last year's winner,  
and Arie Luyendyk, a two-time winner who plans to retire after the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Jaques Lazier, the other late entries were for veterans  
Scott Harrington, who was 15th in his only previous start at 
Indianapolis in 1996, and Jimmy Kite, 11th as a rookie last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The others in the 1999 rookie class who have been assigned cars  
are Mike Borkowski, John Hollansworth Jr., Dave Steele, Wim 
Eyckmans, Robby McGehee and Jeret Schroeder. Eyckmans is Cheever's 
teammate and protege; Steele is a Panther Racing teammate of Indy 
Racing League season points leader Scott Goodyear. 
</P>
<P>
	Hemelgarn and A.J. Foyt Enterprises each entered six cars, more  
than any other team. Defending IRL champion Kenny Brack and last 
year's Indy 500 pole winner Billy Boat are driving for Foyt, while 
another teammate could be added later for one of Foyt's other 
entries. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other drivers is Tony Stewart, a former IRL champion  
who left Team Menard to compete in the NASCAR Winston Cup series 
for team owner Joe Gibbs. Stewart has two cars entered by Tri-Star 
Motorsports, an Indy team he recently put together with Larry 
Curry, his former team manager with Menard, and Andy Card, a former 
Menard public relations man. 
</P>
<P>
	Taking Stewart's place this season with Menard is Greg Ray, who  
had the fastest speed during the recent open testing at the 
Speedway at more than 227 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Full practice will begin on May 15, with qualifications on May  
22-23.

<HEADLINE> RJR Nabisco Seeks To Buy Back Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. has offered to buy  
back nearly $4.8 billion in notes, bonds and preferred stock with 
proceeds from its recent deal to sell its international tobacco 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	The buyback will eliminate most of RJR Nabisco's $5 billion in  
outstanding debt, and facilitate the company's reorganization which 
includes a plan to spin off its domestic tobacco business to its 
shareholders. The nation's second-biggest tobacco company makes 
Winston, Camel and Salem cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR Nabisco would be left with its 80.6 percent stake in Nabisco  
Holdings Corp., the maker of Oreo cookies, Planters nuts and Ritz 
crackers. Nabisco carries an additional debt of about $3.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the tender offer, holders of RJR debt and  
preferred stock would receive a premium for redeeming the 
securities early, if they agree to the offer quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	The payments will vary according to the type of security being  
redeemed. 
</P>
<P>
	The holders of the securities also will get an additional  
payment for consenting to let RJR waive conditions it accepted when 
selling the securities. Among other things, RJR had agreed not to 
have its tobacco company borrow money on its own. 
</P>
<P>
	The buyback also depends on completion of the sale of the  
international tobacco business. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR agreed in March to sell its international tobacco business  
to Japan Tobacco Co., Japan's largest tobacco company, for $7.8 
billion in cash. Japan Tobacco is also assuming $200 million in 
debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the completion of the sale, RJR plans to spin off its  
domestic R.J. Reynolds Tobacco business to its shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
	RJR officials say the tobacco and food businesses will fare  
better separately. They say the legal problems faced by the tobacco 
business have depressed the stock market's valuation of the food 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Icahn, a onetime corporate raider who holds about 7.7  
percent of RJR stock, is waging a proxy fight for control of the 
RJR board, which is to be elected at the May 12 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	He wants the company to spin off its Nabisco holdings to  
shareholders instead of spinning off the domestic tobacco business. 
</P>
<P>
	In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, RJR Nabisco closed  
down 6 1/4 cents at $24.93 3/4 a share while Nabisco Holdings finished 
down $1 at $41.56 1/4.

<HEADLINE> Hubble Finds Most Distant Galaxy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope have peered 13  
billion years back into time, almost to the dawn of creation, to 
find the oldest, most distant object ever detected: a galaxy 
fizzing with new stars. 
</P>
<P>
	The galaxy lies near the edge of the universe, 13 billion  
light-years from Earth, where its presence was detected by its 
faint ultraviolet light, which is invisible to conventional 
telescopes. 
</P>
<P>
	Paradoxically, the oldest known galaxy -- dubbed ``Sharon'' after  
the sister of one of its discoverers -- appears young to us. 
</P>
<P>
	That's because the deeper astronomers look into space, the  
further back in time they are looking. It takes so long for light 
traveling through space to reach Earth that astronomers scanning 
the edges of the universe are seeing objects as they were billions 
of years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	By some estimates, we are seeing the galaxy as it existed 1  
billion years after the Big Bang, the colossal explosion believed 
to have created the universe. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery by researchers at the State University of New York  
at Stony Brook was reported in Thursday's issue of the journal 
Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	It marks the third time in the past year that astronomers have  
found what were thought to be the most distant objects yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Other astronomers said the finding can help them determine when  
galaxies formed and developed, and learn more about the origins of 
the chemical elements that make life possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``Finding the most distant galaxies is akin to finding the  
oldest fossils on Earth,'' said Patrick McCarthy of the Carnegie 
Institution Observatories in Pasadena, Calif. ``They give you a 
handle on the timing and processes by which the first recognizable 
galaxies coalesced from the primordial sea of light elements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Galaxies appear to come in two basic designs -- disc-shaped  
spiral galaxies like the Milky Way, and more massive, elliptical 
galaxies. But the SUNY researchers said their target is much too 
far away even for the Hubble to see clearly, so they can't say what 
type it might be. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really not interesting to look at,'' said Kenneth  
Lanzetta, co-author of the Nature study. ``There is no detail to be 
seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the new galaxy is so faint that some astronomers said  
they might have to wait until better instruments are developed to 
learn something from it. Richard Green of the Kitt Peak National 
Observatory in Tucson, Ariz., said the discovery is ``at the limit 
of our grasp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until recently, records for the most distant objects in space  
stood for years. But sensitive detectors on the Hubble and large 
ground-based telescopes are capturing the faintest light from the 
most distant neighborhoods of the cosmos, and the record books are 
being rewritten every few months. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, Princeton University researchers detected the most  
distant quasar known. But the distance given, about 13 billion 
light-years away, was only a rough estimate and not as precise as 
the SUNY finding, which has been accepted by other astronomers as 
the most distant so far. Last May, a University of Hawaii team 
using the Keck telescope discovered a galaxy 12.3 billion 
light-years away. 
</P>
<P>
	The SUNY team examined a deep and narrow wedge of space in 1997,  
using a spectrograph and other instruments on the Hubble. They used 
computers to separate out 400 overlapping objects and uncover the 
distant galaxy. 
</P>
<P>
	The SUNY astronomers whimsically nicknamed after the sister of  
researcher Sebastian Pascarelle. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon Pascarelle is a 32-year-old New York investment baker and  
``total liberal arts major'' who avoided science and math at 
Skidmore College. She became fascinated by her brother's dinnertime 
chat about the universe and pestered him to name something in the 
heavens after her. 
</P>
<P>
	She was flattered when he did so -- until she saw the galaxy's  
image and a blurted, ``It's just a dot!'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted a planet named after me,'' she said. ``I guess I'll  
have to settle for a galaxy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sharon's fame may be fleeting -- both for the galaxy and the  
banker. Lanzetta said the SUNY team will soon publish another study 
showing a half-dozen galaxies even deeper in space and closer to 
the dawn of time. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot more out there,'' Lanzetta said.

<HEADLINE> Romney Trims Salt Lake Games Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- When Mitt Romney took over the  
scandal-laden Salt Lake Olympics organization, he pledged to put 
the athletes first. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is the athletes -- specifically U.S. athletes -- who are  
the first to fear they are in jeopardy from his budget-paring, and 
that has put them, the U.S. Olympic Committee and Romney's Salt 
Lake Organizing Committee on a collision course. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC was to have taken over the Utah Winter Sports Park and the  
speedskating oval this week, but that has now been put off for 90 
days to give the differing parties time to seek a way out. 
</P>
<P>
	USOC vice president Sandy Baldwin on Tuesday said that will give  
the SLOC board a chance to digest the ramifications of $84 million 
in budget cuts proposed by Romney, including some $5 million for 
two key venues. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney says he's worried the scandal over how Salt Lake won the  
2002 Winter Games will make it hard for the SLOC and USOC to raise 
$300 million more needed from sponsors to fund the $1.45 billion 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney's proposed cuts are a hedge against a shortfall.  
</P>
<P>
	The $5 million amounts to about a third of the operating budget  
for the Utah Winter Sports Park, which has ski jumps, the 
bobsled-luge track and the Oquirrh Skating Oval -- the speedskating 
venue. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a cut could mean closing the venues for a long stretch,  
possibly a year, and that prospect has agitated USOC and athletes 
who learned of it from Romney last week. The athletes had been 
counting on training on the luge, jumps and oval until the 2002 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``You shouldn't cut it when it deals with athletes,'' Baldwin  
said after a meeting Tuesday of SLOC's finance committee. ``If U.S. 
athletes do not do well in the 2002 Games, it will reflect on the 
games, and training is part of that,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baldwin, who also is a member of the SLOC board's management  
committee, does not believe corporate sponsors will remain skittish 
enough to jeopardize the budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the magnitude of the cuts proposed is necessary  
at all,'' Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
	USOC and SLOC have a joint venture company, called the Olympic  
Properties of the United States, or OPUS, that is marketing the 
games to sponsors, with a USOC executive at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
	Several athletes attended Tuesday's meeting in a show of support  
for the USOC position and were relieved when Randy Dryer, executive 
director of the Utah Sports Authority, proposed putting the 
purchase of the sports park on hold. 
</P>
<P>
	The finance committee endorsed the delay, although the SLOC  
managers could have acted without the endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	The sports authority built the park near Park City with taxpayer  
money. SLOC has agreed to turn it over to the state, along with $99 
million, after the games. The purchase price -- $59 million and a 
$40 million legacy -- was set by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	Dryer said he will ask the executive board of the sports  
authority to endorse the delay on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the next 90 days, either SLOC will be persuaded to make the  
cuts elsewhere or an alternative source for the $5 million will be 
found, said Dryer, who also serves on SLOC's management committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an issue for high-performance athletes and the community  
as well,'' Dryer said. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that tens of thousands of youngsters use the skating  
oval, and thousands of people have used the ski jumps and luge 
track at the Utah Winter Sports Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC-SLOC joint venture, OPUS, had a goal to raise $889  
million, including $550 million for SLOC, by Aug. 1. The date has 
been pushed back a year, to August 2000, with USOC marketing head 
John Krimsky putting the blame on the Salt Lake scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	However, former SLOC president Frank Joklik told a civic club  
Tuesday that organizers had been worried about a drop-off in 
corporate-sponsor signings before the scandal hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We kept on receiving assurances the pace would pick up  
again,'' he said. ``There was considerable doubt about that as 
(1998) drew to a close -- even before the revelations of the 
bid-committee problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the joint venture still could raise the $300 million  
needed to balance the budget. ``It seems like a doable endeavor, 
but will require very, very hard work,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In another development Tuesday, SLOC chairman Robert Garff said  
Bennie Smith Jr., who was instrumental in the Salt Lake bid 
committee's wooing of African IOC members, has resigned from SLOC 
and from the board of the Utah Athletic Foundation, which is to 
operate the sports park after the Games. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Smith, in a letter to him on April 7, cited ill health  
and a desire to spend more time with his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith did return a call.  
</P>
<P>
	Garff said that while the bribery scandal was being  
investigated, Smith ``fought to stay on the board during that 
controversial period because he wanted his name cleared.'' SLOC's 
ethics panel found no wrongdoing by Smith.

<HEADLINE> Time To Get `Scared Straight' Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Scared Straight! 20 Years Later'' does several  
things rather nicely -- although ``nice'' won't be the word that 
springs to viewers' minds. 
</P>
<P>
	The program forcefully restates what's even truer today than 20  
years ago: Juvenile crime gets a major assist from drug and alcohol 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	It includes a where-are-they-now? update on all 17 young  
troublemakers seen in the original ``Scared Straight!'' 
documentary. Were they really scared straight? Did they turn their 
lives around? And, by the way, what became of the men who, as 
sadder-but-wiser jailbirds, gave those kids that magnificent 
tongue-lashing? 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, this two-hour special affords another look at the  
original one-hour ``Scared Straight!'' film which, even now, packs 
a wallop. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scared Straight!'' showcases a prisoner-run effort to frighten  
kids out of ending up in prison. A group of juvenile offenders 
makes a ``field trip'' to New Jersey's Rahway State Prison, where 
they come face to face with a team of hardened criminals. As 
members of the Lifers' Program, these convicts explode with their 
no-nonsense warning. 
</P>
<P>
	Theirs is a verbal assault armed with humiliation, grisly detail  
and unassailable logic -- all of it high-decibel and 
expletive-filled. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't get away with nothin'! We're HERE!'' screeches Ali,  
a fearsome presence who lost an eye in a prison fight. ``What makes 
you think YOU'RE gonna get away with it?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kids who arrived so cocky and defiant are soon reduced to tears.  
</P>
<P>
	UPN, which airs ``Scared Straight! 20 Years Later'' from 8 to 10  
p.m. EDT Thursday, will attach an ``explicit language'' label to 
the broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, viewers may find that ``explicit'' doesn't cover the  
explicitness of an inmate's response when a kid doesn't pay full 
attention to his lecture: ``You move one more bleeping time and 
I'll bite your bleeping nose off and spit it in your damn face!'' 
Except nothing is bleeped. 
</P>
<P>
	Disquieting, to say the least.  
</P>
<P>
	But no one who missed ``Scared Straight!'' when it first aired  
can grasp its impact that March night in 1979. After all, that was 
before ``adult'' films on a home VCR, before premium-cable fare 
like HBO's gritty prison drama ``Oz.'' Back then, TV didn't get 
much more risque than ABC's controversial sitcom ``Soap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet viewers didn't object when ``Scared Straight!'' shook them  
to the core. They understood that it told an important story. 
Despite the inmates' uncensored vocabulary and harsh accounts -- or 
maybe because of it -- ``Scared Straight!'' proved to be a 
sensation. It not only won huge ratings but also two Emmys and the 
Oscar for best feature documentary. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's heard that kind of language one place or  
another,'' says Arnold Shapiro, who conceived ``Scared Straight!'' 
and produced this follow-up. ``The language isn't the offensive 
part. The offensive part is the drugs, the alcohol abuse and the 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was naive 20 years ago,'' he concedes in a recent interview.  
``I did not appreciate how much a part drugs and alcohol played in 
these kids' illegal activities.'' That's the message Shapiro wants 
to put across now. 
</P>
<P>
	At 58, the prolific filmmaker has long displayed a social  
conscience. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his 50 prime-time documentaries is the 1992 ``Scared  
Silent: Exposing and Ending Child Abuse,'' which, with Oprah 
Winfrey as host, aired simultaneously on CBS, NBC and PBS, then on 
ABC two days later. Among his 10 series is ``Rescue 911,'' which 
CBS carried for six seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	For ``Scared Straight! 20 Years Later,'' Shapiro was able to  
track down all of his former ``kids,'' now in their mid-30s. With 
actor Danny Glover as host, the special in its second hour becomes 
a sort of reunion special -- and adopts a decidedly happier tone. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't a downer,'' says Shapiro. ``This is a major success  
story, an inspiring story of a group of kids who were incorrigible 
at the time. Now, some of them are doing fine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One has died, but of the surviving 16, only Qaadir (who in 1979  
brashly forecast for himself life as ``a professional thief'') has 
become a career criminal. He's currently behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	Angelo is among those who were scared straight. Today a husband  
and father, he installs floor tile for a living. Without that 
get-acquainted trip to Rahway, he says, ``I think that I would have 
done hard time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That couple of hours was torture,'' recalls Marlene, now  
married and a waitress. ``It made me realize I want to be somebody 
-- not a drunk, not an inmate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shapiro wants today's youth to reach the same conclusion. His  
special is airing on a weeknight, he says, so that schoolchildren 
assigned to watch it can discuss it the next day in class. 
</P>
<P>
	And the younger the audience, the better, Shapiro adds. ``Is 9  
or 10 too young for kids to be watching this? No way is it too 
young!'' 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	`48 HOURS': A six-month investigation by ``48 Hours'' reveals  
disturbing information on human medical testing in the United 
States. The broadcast uncovers an under-regulated industry of 
medical experimentation, compounded by a lack of government and 
professional oversight, which critics claim has led to injury and 
death. One example: The federal government knows exactly how many 
animals are used in scientific research (388,000 guinea pigs, for 
example), but has no statistics on human testing. ``48 Hours: 
Ultimate Risk'' airs Thursday at 10 p.m. EDT on CBS. Dan Rather 
anchors.

<HEADLINE> Fed Program Turns Farms to Wetlands / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALPAUGH, Calif. (AP) -- With only a few years left before  
retirement, cotton farmer Calvin Pryse needed to decide what to do 
with his 1,000-acre farm in the southern San Joaquin Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	None of his three adult children is interested in agriculture,  
so Pryse called Larry Norris, a local wildlife biologist for the 
U.S. Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Norris, an area specialist for USDA, signs up landowners to take  
advantage of a federal program converting marginal farmland into 
wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have rather waited two more years,'' said Pryse, 60,  
as he stood in front of a 640-acre field that once grew cotton, 
alfalfa and hay. ``But you have to take what you can. ... I'll just 
retire earlier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pryse signed up with the Wetlands Reserve Program last year. He  
received about $1,000 per acre for the first 640-acre lot. A second 
field -- 280 acres -- is pending final approval. That'll leave Pryse 
about 100 acres to continue farming as a ``hobby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This came out just about the right time for me,'' Pryse said.  
``These easements basically gave us enough money to retire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The wetlands program received limited funding in 1992 for pilot  
projects but took off by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of last year, 3,714 landowners in 47 states --only  
Nevada, New Mexico and Alaska are missing -- put more than 665,000 
acres into a choice of easements that last 10 years, 30 years or in 
perpetuity. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the beginning, there was a lot of doubts ... whether  
America's farmers would be willing to enter into long-term 
conservation easements with the federal government,'' said Bob 
Misso, the wetlands program director. ``But after a few projects, 
farmers started coming out of the woodwork.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When a farmer signs a contract, the land still belongs to him,  
but what he can do with it is severely limited. 
</P>
<P>
	With perpetual easement, the federal government pays for all of  
the costs of restoring the farmland to wetlands for wildlife 
habitat, such as leveling ground and creating streams. With 30-year 
easements, the landowner has to put up 25 percent of the costs; 
with the 10-year plan, the landowner pays for all construction. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the total acreage signed into the program in California  
-- 37,000 acres -- pales in comparison to states like Louisiana, with 
105,000 acres, the total money paid to farmers here is 
second-highest in the nation because agriculture land value is much 
greater. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana still leads the list with $72 million total, but  
California is a close second with $70 million. The two states could 
easily trade places this year. Of $98 million budgeted for 1999, 
$11 million will be spent in California. 
</P>
<P>
	``California has a long waiting list. We wish we can fund more,  
but we can't fund everything,'' Misso said. Of 85 California 
applicants, only five were accepted for this year, with two others 
likely to be approved. 
</P>
<P>
	The window of opportunity is rapidly closing. The wetlands  
program has a maximum limit of 975,000 acres nationwide. Misso 
estimates the limit will be reached sometime next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Although thousands of farmers have participated, not everyone is  
keen on the idea of taking farmland out of commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way the program is written, compensation is really loaded  
toward perpetual easement, and we tend to worry a little bit that 
when farmers sign those easements, they don't completely understand 
the contract or have enough legal counsel,'' said Rosemarie 
Watkins, American Farm Bureau's director of governmental relations 
for conservation issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The farm bureau is printing a guide for growers interested in  
setting their land aside for wetlands preservation. It is expected 
to be published later this year.

<HEADLINE> Drug Errors Blamed on Confusion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Federal regulators have received 53 reports of  
errors by doctors and pharmacists dispensing the popular new 
arthritis drug Celebrex, a problem blamed on confusing the 
painkiller with similarly named drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of reports of such mixups is the most the Food and  
Drug Administration has received for any drug that has been on the 
market only four months, the FDA's Jerry Phillips said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency is in talks with the drug's maker, Monsanto Co.'s  
Searle unit, about how to respond to the problem, Monsanto and FDA 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the reports involve serious injury or death, but medical  
authorities said confusion with some other drugs is potentially 
fatal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that it has happened in a short time since the drug  
was approved also has the office concerned,'' said Phillips, who 
heads the FDA's Office of Postmarketing Drug Risk Assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the options Searle and the FDA are considering: changing  
the drug's name again, and launching an education campaign to curb 
confusion by pharmacists, doctors and consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients received the wrong drug in 10 of the cases. The wrong  
drug was prescribed in 19 cases but caught before consumers 
received it. In 24 cases doctors and pharmacists reported that they 
found the name confusing. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical authorities say reports to the FDA generally represent a  
small proportion of the errors that occur. 
</P>
<P>
	Searle has already changed the drug's name once, from Celebra to  
Celebrex, after federal regulators said it sounded too much like 
other drugs. But doctors and pharmacists are still confusing 
Celebrex with the antidepressant Celexa and the seizure drug 
Cerebyx. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not an issue that is unique to Celebrex,'' Monsanto  
spokeswoman Scarlett Foster said. ``We'll decide with (the FDA) 
what are the best steps for us to take and will work with them to 
make sure that people are careful and are appropriately giving out 
the prescribing information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deaths will occur if the name isn't changed, said Michael Cohen,  
chairman of the Institute for Safe Medication Practices, a 
Warminster, Pa., nonprofit group that tracks medication errors. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be serious outcomes if the name isn't changed,''  
said Cohen, whose group has successfully urged some drug makers to 
change sound-alike names. ``It seems like we always have to wait 
until there is a death before something's done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the errors involved an 80-year-old woman who mistakenly  
received the antidepressant Celexa instead of Celebrex twice a day 
for a month. A pharmacy staffer confused the drug names when 
pulling the drug from the shelf, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	That error could have had serious consequences because the woman  
was already on drug similar to Celexa, which blocks the chemical 
serotonin in the brain, and might have suffered a serious overdose 
of the compound. Millions of Americans take serotonin-blockers such 
as Eli Lilly's Prozac and Pfizer's Zoloft. 
</P>
<P>
	Some health systems are acting to avoid name confusion. Fairview  
Health Services of Minneapolis is asking doctors to write both the 
drug's generic name and its trade name on prescriptions and to list 
what ailment the drug is meant to treat, said Steven Meisel, 
assistant pharmacy director for the hospital system. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrex has been extremely popular since it went on the market  
in January because it is as effective a painkiller as ibuprofen and 
other so-called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but it is 
much less likely to cause severe stomach problems such as bleeding 
ulcers. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 2 million prescriptions for Celebrex have been  
dispensed so far, making it the second-fastest selling new drug 
after Pfizer's impotence-treatment drug Viagra. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto and its co-marketer Pfizer are promoting Celebrex in  
all markets except in Japan. Additional approvals are pending in 
more than 30 countries.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Market's Main Index Rises / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The Tokyo stock market's main index finished higher  
today amid speculation that public pension fund money will flow 
into the market. The dollar slipped against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 119.19 yen in the late afternoon, down 1.17  
yen from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York 
level of 119.83 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 49.52  
points, or 0.87 percent, closing at 16,764.68. On Tuesday, the 
index rose 207.76 points, or 1.26 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo stocks were lower for much of today's trading on worries  
over earnings at high technology companies, but moved higher toward 
the closing bell. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders said expectations that public pension funds will soon be  
allocating money to the market reversed the course. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was some anticipation of (public pension fund) buying,''  
said Dhia Amir, senior institutional sales trader at Nomura 
Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the overall rise in the market, high technology issues,  
including Sony Corp. and Toshiba Corp., were among today's losers. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors worried about earnings at high technology companies  
after Intel Corp. of the United States warned late Tuesday that its 
earnings may weaken in the second quarter, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was also hurt by a report in the Nihon Keizai  
business daily today that the Sony group's net profit is likely to 
fall below 100 billion yen ($840 million) for the fiscal year 
ending March 31, 2000, for the first time in four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the Nikkei's gains, declines outnumbered advancers 638  
to 558, with 122 issues unchanged. Volume on the exchange's first 
section was estimated at 719 million shares, up from Tuesday's 692 
million shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
exchange's first section was up 11.61 points, or 0.87 percent, to 
1,343.35. The TOPIX gained 15.54 points, or 1.18 percent, the 
previous day. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the yen gained ground against the dollar  
after the Nihon Keizai reported that Japan's major life insurers 
will decrease purchases of bonds denominated in foreign currency, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nihon Keizai said today that Japan's five major life  
insurers will sharply reduce or suspend altogether purchases of 
foreign currency denominated bonds in the current fiscal year as 
they shift their investment focus to domestic assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's fiscal year began on April 1.  
</P>
<P>
	Traders said U.S. hedge funds sold the dollar rather  
aggressively amid the reported move by the Japanese insurers. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the dollar was supported on buying from Japanese trust  
banks in the low 119 yen range later in the session. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 128.74 yen, down  
from 130.10 yen late Tuesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 211 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.645 percent from Tuesday's finish of 1.600 percent, 
driving its price down to 101.35 yen from 101.74 yen.

<HEADLINE> Aikman Signs $85.5M Extension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Leave it to Jerry Jones to pay Troy Aikman  
an NFL-record $85.5 million and still walk away looking like he got 
the better end of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
	By reworking the three remaining years on Aikman's contract, the  
Dallas Cowboys owner freed enough room under the salary cap to sign 
center Mark Stepnoski on Tuesday and likely add free agents Raghib 
Ismail and Quentin Coryatt before the Saturday's college draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman's reward for being a good trooper? A six-year extension  
that makes him the highest-paid player in pro football history and 
includes a $20 million signing bonus that's among the biggest in 
pro sports history. Aikman, who will be 41 when the deal ends in 
2007, already has received $13 million and will get the other $7 
million in early 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	A league source speaking on condition of anonymity divulged the  
contract details to The Associated Press late Tuesday. Neither 
Jones nor Aikman's agent, Leigh Steinberg, would discuss the 
specifics of the deal other than to say it gives Dallas much more 
flexibility under the salary cap for several years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's structured in a way that it is beneficial to the longterm  
goals of our organization from the standpoint of the salary cap,'' 
Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman's previous contract also put him atop the NFL's salary  
chart, and he reworked it almost every year to help Jones re-sign 
key players or to bring in free agents. Steinberg said Aikman again 
did not want his contract to be an obstacle for Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our goal was to free up cap room so that Troy could play with  
a competitive team,'' Steinberg said. ``He wants more rings on his 
fingers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cowboys reportedly have had verbal agreements with  
Stepnoski, Ismail and Coryatt for several weeks, but couldn't 
finalize the deals until they had the salary cap room to sign them. 
The NFL is investigating whether that happened and if the team 
violated league rules. 
</P>
<P>
	With that black cloud hovering, Jones met with Steinberg at team  
headquarters late Friday into early Saturday and hammered out the 
framework for Aikman's new deal. It was signed Monday and announced 
Tuesday during a news conference intended to feature Stepnoski. 
Neither Aikman nor Steinberg were in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones said that while the dollar distribution of the Aikman deal  
will greatly help the team in free agency, he thinks a bigger 
benefit is that Aikman will definitely be a Cowboy for many years 
to come. 
</P>
<P>
	``Players like to come to teams that have great quarterbacks.  
And we believe in this organization that we have one of, if not the 
finest skilled player at the position,'' Jones said. ``We can 
fundamentally build our organization around Troy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aikman was the first overall selection in the 1989 draft and the  
first player picked under Jones' regime. He guided Dallas' 
transformation from 1-15 to Super Bowl champions three seasons 
later. He's since become one of only three quarterbacks to lead a 
team to three Super Bowl victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``His talent and commitment will help us ultimately get back to  
the Super Bowl,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones may not be done trimming Dallas' payroll. Fullback Daryl  
Johnston, who was exposed in the expansion draft, will likely have 
to take a pay cut or be released. Ditto for receiver Billy Davis, 
who didn't live up to the big contract he signed before last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Steinberg, who also represents Johnston, said his client ``would  
very much like to stay with the Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	Next on Jones' list of contracts to extend is Deion Sanders, who  
is going into the last year of his deal. Jones called his talks 
with Sanders' agent Eugene Park ``a work in progress,'' adding that 
no deal is imminent.

<HEADLINE> Paper: Ovitz To Drop for NFL Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Entertainment executive Michael Ovitz will  
drop his bid to build a stadium in nearby Carson and endorse a 
competing proposal to bring professional football back to Southern 
California, according to a published report. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing unidentified sources, the Los Angeles Times reported  
today that Ovitz will support a proposal for renovating the 
historic Memorial Coliseum, where the Rams and Raiders previously 
played. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the newspaper said, Ovitz will back a potential  
plan to build a new baseball stadium for the Los Angeles Dodgers in 
Exposition Park. 
</P>
<P>
	That plan would put a new ballpark on the site of the aging Los  
Angeles Sports Arena, which is near the east end of the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz could not be immediately located for comment on the  
report. A call placed by The Associated Press to his Artists 
Management Group after business hours Tuesday was not immediately 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Times, Ovitz was not immediately available for  
comment But the newspaper quoted sources as saying he is expected 
to throw his support to the Coliseum plan by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz, a veteran Hollywood agent and studio executive, has tried  
to entice the National Football League with a site in Carson, where 
he hoped to build a hacienda-style stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL owners gave tentative approval for an expansion team in  
Southern California last month, but did not choose between the bid 
by Ovitz and the Coliseum proposal. Instead, they said the team 
would be awarded if Los Angeles presents an acceptable stadium plan 
by Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Fox Group, which owns the Los Angeles Dodgers,  
said it intends to keep the baseball team in Dodger Stadium, at 
least for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	``The proposal brought to us, one of many we have seen, is too  
preliminary and nonspecific for us to comment on,'' Fox and the 
Dodgers said in a statement issued Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nonetheless, we are progressing with our plans of investment  
in -- and limited renovation of -- Dodger Stadium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the renovation of Dodger Stadium apparently would not end  
the possibility of the team getting a new stadium in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we have said before, this program does not resolve the  
long-term issues that the Dodgers face,'' Fox officials said in a 
statement. ``We will work to develop a long-term plan to address 
these issues, while recognizing the special relationship our fans 
have with Dodger Stadium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dodger Stadium is located in Chavez Ravine, about five miles  
from the Coliseum.

<HEADLINE> Favored Lu Ravi Wins at Keeneland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Odds-on favorite Lu Ravi took the lead  
entering the turn and held off Pantufla in the stretch to win the 
$108,800 Doubledogdare Stakes on Wednesday at Keeneland. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoshio Fujita's 4-year-old daughter of A.P. Indy ran 1 1-16  
miles in 1:41 1-5, 2-5 of a second slower than the track record. 
The victory was her seventh in 13 career starts. She earned $67,456 
to increase her lifetime winnings to $600,986. 
</P>
<P>
	Pantufla kept up for more than a half-mile but had to settle for  
second, 2 1/2 lengths behind Lu Ravi and 2 1/2 lengths in front of 
third-place Biogio's Rose in the field of six fillies and mares. 
</P>
<P>
	Lu Ravi, ridden by Willie Martinez, paid $3.40, $2.60 and $2.10.  
Pantufla returned $5.20 and $2.10. Biogio's Rose was worth $2.20.

<HEADLINE> Body of Tammy Wynette Exhumed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The body of country music legend Tammy  
Wynette was exhumed Wednesday and an autopsy performed to try to 
answer lingering questions about what caused her death. 
</P>
<P>
	Widower George Richey, Wynette's fifth husband and the subject  
of a $50 million wrongful death lawsuit brought by three of her 
daughters, requested the exhumation and autopsy. 
</P>
<P>
	The results are expected in four to six weeks.  
</P>
<P>
	In a lawsuit filed last week, the daughters claim Wynette died  
because her doctor, Dr. Wallis Marsh of Pittsburgh, did not monitor 
her condition closely enough and overprescribed medication. 
</P>
<P>
	They also claim Richey did not seek medical care for her after  
being urged to do so by Marsh. 
</P>
<P>
	Richey read a statement at a news conference criticizing the  
daughters for the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm saddened that, out of frustration over financial matters,  
her daughters have been willing to work so hard to discredit their 
mother. And that's what they have done,'' said Richey, who is not 
the father of any of the daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	Wynette, who died at age 55 and had 20 No. 1 hits, including  
``Stand By Your Man,'' endured many health problems for much of her 
life and took various drugs to quell her pain. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of her four daughters -- Tina Jones, Georgette Smith and  
Jackie Daly -- believe Wynette could have lived longer with better 
medical care. 
</P>
<P>
	Marsh, who practices at the University of Pittsburgh Medical  
Center, issued a statement last week denying any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Richey discovered Wynette's body in their Nashville home on  
April 6, 1998. Marsh flew in to sign the death certificate and 
listed the cause of death as a blood clot to the lungs.

<HEADLINE>  Red-Hot Red Sox Keep Perspective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Walk into the Boston Red Sox clubhouse after a  
victory and there's no music blaring. Instead, some players are 
quietly watching television cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason Boston is off to its best start in 44 years is that  
its players take the highs and lows in stride. Despite the loss of 
Mo Vaughn to free agency and Nomar Garciaparra to a hamstring 
injury, there haven't been many lows so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really tough if you come into the clubhouse after the  
game to tell who won,'' Bret Saberhagen said. ``It's good we don't 
have music in the clubhouse. With music playing, everybody gets too 
excited when you win. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then when you lose and don't have the music on, there's too  
much emphasis on one loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, that's all there's been. One loss.  
</P>
<P>
	And Boston rallied from a 4-0 deficit in that game to tie Tampa  
Bay 4-4 last Sunday before losing 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitching has been the biggest reason for the Red Sox's 6-1  
start. Saberhagen is 2-0 and hasn't allowed a run in 12 2-3 
innings. Mark Portugal is 1-0 and unscored on in 6 1-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Throw in a 2-0 start by Pedro Martinez and a 1-0 start by Tim  
Wakefield and Boston's rotation has been dominant in a series of 
low-scoring games. The Red Sox have outscored opponents 34-13 in 
seven games and have a 1.74 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pitching is going to keep us in a lot of games this year  
because we've got a solid fourth starter (Portugal) and I've had a 
full season since coming off surgery,'' Saberhagen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Boston's day off Wednesday, Saberhagen pitched 6 2-3  
innings in Tuesday's 6-0 victory over the Chicago White Sox. He 
said he threw without pain, something that never happened last 
season despite a 15-8 record. He had missed most of the previous 
two seasons following shoulder surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox had the AL's second-best record last year, but few  
forecasters picked them to make the playoffs this season. The 
successful start doesn't mean they'll continue to win, and, with 
the New York Yankees in the AL East, it certainly doesn't mean the 
Red Sox will win the division. 
</P>
<P>
	But predictions that they would fall apart after Vaughn signed  
with Anaheim seem off base. Boston is 4-1 in the last five games 
even though Garciaparra was limited to just one pinch-hitting 
appearance and doesn't expect to play Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't gave big heroes here. Everybody's playing the game to  
just add a little bit,'' Martinez said. ``I think that's one of the 
keys to the team being successful so far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Offerman is another.  
</P>
<P>
	He was the main hitter general manager Dan Duquette signed as a  
free agent and won't make fans forget Vaughn any time soon. After 
all, Vaughn hit 40 homers last year while Offerman has 22 in his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	But as Vaughn recovers from a sprained ankle suffered in the  
California Angels' opener, Offerman is 15-for-32 with six doubles, 
three triples and five RBIs. He even was walked intentionally in 
the seventh inning Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	His four-year, $26 million deal for which Duquette was ridiculed  
seems like a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	``How many times do you see them walk the leadoff hitter  
intentionally?'' Boston manager Jimy Williams asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been fantastic for us,'' Boston reliever Derek Lowe said.  
``He gets on base for the middle of our lineup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe is part of a bullpen that is doing even better than the  
starters. He gave up the only two runs relievers have allowed in 20 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, Boston's victories have come against Kansas City, Tampa  
Bay and Chicago and its next eight games are against Chicago, Tampa 
Bay and Detroit before a three-game home series with Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``Beating any team builds our confidence,'' left fielder Troy  
O'Leary said. ``When we play New York or Baltimore, we'll have that 
confidence.''

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Impeachment Debate Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian parliament's lower house postponed an  
impeachment debate against President Boris Yeltsin until mid-May 
during a quarrelsome session today. 
</P>
<P>
	It took several hours and four votes in the State Duma before  
the divided lawmakers set a new date for the debate, which had been 
scheduled to begin Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin's Communist foes in parliament are leading the call for  
his ouster, but they don't want an impeachment vote until they can 
amend the rules and hold an open ballot. The Communist leaders fear 
that if the ballot is secret -- as stipulated under current rules -- 
then some party members may defect and vote against impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Duma's delays have angered Yeltsin, who has accused his  
opponents of trying to keep him under constant political attack by 
dragging out the process. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged lawmakers to hold the debate Thursday as planned, or  
drop the motion altogether. 
</P>
<P>
	Pro-government factions resisted the Communists' initiative to  
postpone it, but on the fourth vote lawmakers agreed to hold the 
debate on May 13 to 15. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin quickly denounced the  
move. 
</P>
<P>
	``All these actions show that the (impeachment) motion has been  
and remains purely political,'' he said on NTV television. 
</P>
<P>
	A parliamentary committee has spent months formulating the  
charges against Yeltsin. The impeachment motion, which requires a 
two-thirds majority in both houses of parliament and approval of 
Russia's two highest courts, is considered likely to fail, as have 
previous attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Yeltsin's influence has eroded due to frequent illnesses  
and Russia's continuing economic crisis, and the motion is expected 
to have a slightly better chance than before. 
</P>
<P>
	The parliamentary committee has charged Yeltsin with instigating  
the 1991 Soviet collapse, improperly using force against hard-line 
lawmakers in 1993, launching the botched war in the separatist 
region of Chechnya, bringing the nation's military to ruin and 
waging genocide against the Russian people by pursuing economic 
policies that impoverished the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Russian politicians, including a group of influential  
provincial governors who sit in the upper house, have denounced the 
impeachment debate as a bid by the Communists to rally support 
before December's parliamentary elections.

<HEADLINE> Study: Pacific Traps Carbon Dioxide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Finally, someone has something nice to say about El Nino.  
</P>
<P>
	Researchers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  
Administration found that from 1991 to 1994 -- years when El Nino 
warmed the Pacific -- the ocean released 30 percent to 80 percent 
less carbon dioxide, a gas that is believed to trap heat in the 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	The finding was published in today's issue of the journal  
Nature. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists commonly estimate how much carbon dioxide should be  
in the atmosphere by calculating how much fossil fuel is burned. 
But some 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide go unaccounted for each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the NOAA research, reduced carbon dioxide releases  
in the Pacific during El Nino could account for about 16 percent to 
36 percent of this ``missing'' CO2. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, we are very, very interested in where the CO2,  
which we are releasing every year during fossil fuel burning, ends 
up,'' said Rik Wanninkhof, an NOAA oceanographer. 
</P>
<P>
	Understanding the year-to-year changes in CO2 levels is key to  
explaining how the oceans, the land and the atmosphere regulate 
Earth's climate. 
</P>
<P>
	Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere have been rising for  
decades, a phenomenon blamed on increased burning of fossil fuels 
and deforestation. Some scientists say this has contributed to this 
century's global warming trend. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, episodes of El Nino -- the naturally occurring,  
cyclical warming of the Pacific blamed for causing uproars in 
weather patterns -- were shown to spur more plant growth, which in 
turn sucks carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. The NOAA research 
shows yet another way El Nino helps reduce CO2 levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Usually, the equatorial waters of the Pacific are the source of  
three-quarters of the carbon dioxide released by the world's 
tropical oceans. The northern Pacific sucks up all of that carbon 
and more each year, making it one of the biggest ``carbon sinks,'' 
or areas that absorb carbon dioxide. 
</P>
<P>
	El Nino intensifies that process: The trade winds along the  
equator die down, so the upwelling of cold, carbon-rich waters 
decreases and less CO2 is sent into the atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the NOAA study, the equatorial Pacific released 900  
million tons of carbon in 1996, a normal year. The same seas 
released 300 million tons in 1992, 600 million tons in 1993 and 700 
million tons in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Doney, an oceanographer with the National Center for  
Atmospheric Research, said what is different about this study is 
the wealth of data the researchers were able to gather. The 
scientists put their equipment on NOAA ships servicing 80 weather 
stations all over the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've got good snapshots for six or seven different areas  
through a pretty major period,'' he said. ``This study is very 
important in terms of diagnosing what happened to the carbon 
dioxide.''

<HEADLINE> Site of Real Rose Theater Is Opened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- In the Academy Award-winning film ``Shakespeare in  
Love,'' the Rose Theater gleams, a three-tiered wooden structure 
that teems with avid playgoers. 
</P>
<P>
	The site of the real Rose Theater, which opened anew to paying  
customers Wednesday, could best be summed up as a dark, damp 
basement under an 11-story office building. 
</P>
<P>
	It's left to a state-of-the art light and sound show, narrated  
by actor Sir Ian McKellen, to fill in the gaps. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmaker Simon Hughes calls the Rose ``the holy of holies of  
English theater.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes was among the campaigners who linked arms 10 years ago  
with the elite of Britain's acting profession to stop bulldozers 
from clearing away the theater's foundations after they were 
discovered during construction work. 
</P>
<P>
	The office building went up, but only after the public uproar  
forced the government to cough up $1.6 million for the developers 
to suspend the structure on girders. That gave the Rose relics a 
space where they could be preserved and monitored. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, they must wait until the office building ends its  
commercial life and is pulled down -- expected in less than 10 years 
-- to allow full excavation and restoration of the site. 
</P>
<P>
	The open-air Rose was built in 1587 and demolished after 1606  
when the Shakespeare's Globe theater surpassed it in popularity. 
The height of its commercial success came in the 1590s, with a 
repertory of plays by Shakespeare, Christopher Marlowe and Thomas 
Kyd. 
</P>
<P>
	A replica of the Globe, which puts on a slate of plays, was  
opened in 1997 at the initiative of the late American actor Sam 
Wanamaker. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, visitors to the Rose will merely be able to stand on a  
viewing platform, built where the galleries lay on the theater's 
east side. 
</P>
<P>
	In front of the platform is a 2-foot-deep pond, covering a  
concrete cap. Under the cap is a network of irrigation pipes and a

<HEADLINE> Purdue Jumper Awaits 4th Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- Purdue's Michael Turner, the three-time  
defending Big Ten champion in the triple jump, is in Home Hospital, 
awaiting a fourth operation in an attempt to save his right leg. 
</P>
<P>
	Turner, who set a Purdue record of 53 feet, 7 1/2 inches when he  
finished third in last month's NCAA indoor championships at the RCA 
Dome in Indianapolis, injured his leg in a freak accident while 
practicing on April 1. 
</P>
<P>
	``What can I do about it? You can't rewind time and not take  
that popup,'' Turner said of the exercise in which a jumper 
``pops'' off the takeoff board but doesn't extend far into the pit. 
</P>
<P>
	This time he left the board awkwardly and fell face-first toward  
the sand. In bringing down his right foot, the knee hyperextended, 
he tore ligaments and severed an artery and one of the main nerves 
leading from the knee. 
</P>
<P>
	Impaired circulation caused him to lose most of the muscle on  
the outside of his leg, and his foot remains numb. 
</P>
<P>
	``They thought my leg was going to be amputated,'' Turner told  
The Indianapolis Star on Monday. ``That was the first thing that 
came out of their mouths.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. John Gossard, an orthopedic surgeon, said the severity of  
the injury was something one might expect from a victim of an 
automobile collision, not a track and field athlete at practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never seen anything like it,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Surgery has reestablished blood circulation, saving the leg for  
now. But dead tissue must be removed so Turner's wounds can be 
covered with skin grafts. 
</P>
<P>
	He is scheduled to return home to Inglewood, Calif., within 10  
days to begin rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Purdue track team will wear ``M.T.'' patches for  
the rest of the season. Mike Conley, the 1992 Olympic champion in 
the triple jump, lifted Turner's spirits with a visit last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was kind of hard to take at first. But it really hasn't  
still hit me yet,'' Turner said. ``I think everything happens for a 
reason. God puts you in certain predicaments for certain reasons 
just to make you stronger. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if my purpose on this Earth is to be a track  
star,'' he said. ``I don't know if it is to win four Big Ten titles 
in a row. You never know. I could walk out of here and have a 
miraculous surgery and be totally healed and finish competing. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never know what tomorrow holds.''

<HEADLINE> Coal Train Derails on Mo. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARKVILLE, Mo. (AP) -- A coal train derailed, piling 26 cars into  
the space of one city block and damaging buildings and automobiles 
near the track. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The 121-car Burlington Northern Santa Fe train was en route from  
Lincoln, Neb., to Kansas City, Kan., when it derailed late Tuesday. 
The cause was still under investigation, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	A water main ruptured by the wreck forced Park College to cancel  
classes today, and parts of the downtown area were blacked out by a 
severed power line, said City Administrator Pat Hawver. 
</P>
<P>
	The derailment also wiped out two buildings next to the tracks.  
</P>
<P>
	One man was home in an apartment next door to one of the  
destroyed buildings. ``He jumped up against the wall that was 
furthest from the tracks and said a prayer,'' Hawver said. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 3,000 tons of coal buried four parked automobiles.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's coal everywhere,'' Hawver said. ``The downtown  
business are open, but there's no parking along Main Street.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Parkville is about 15 miles north of Kansas City, Mo.

<HEADLINE> Gretzky Thinking About Retirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Hockey is on the verge of losing its greatest player.  
</P>
<P>
	After setting virtually every scoring record, Wayne Gretzky  
seems to be ready to call it a career. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky has invited his family to come to New York on Sunday for  
the New York Rangers' regular-season finale against Pittsburgh, an 
end to a second straight non-playoff season for the Blueshirts. 
</P>
<P>
	While there has been speculation and reports over the past two  
days concerning the Great One's future, Walter Gretzky said his 
son's mind was made up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would strongly suspect that Sunday will be his final game,''  
the elder Gretzky told radio station CKGL in Kitchener, Ontario. 
``I haven't talked to him personally. He's talked with his mom, but 
most likely he will announce a retirement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he asked his son last summer when he would retire, and  
he replied, ``The day that I stop enjoying it is the day I'm 
finished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers were reportedly set to make a big push today to  
convince Gretzky against retirement. Coach John Muckler and general 
manager Neil Smith were to meet with Gretzky and plead with him to 
remain with the team, the New York Daily News reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Should he then still decide to retire -- as has been speculated --  
the Rangers would hold a news conference on Saturday to make the 
announcement official and allow fans to give him a proper sendoff 
the next day, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Messier, who won four Stanley Cups with Gretzky while  
playing for Edmonton in the 1980s, reserved judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone else is insinuating that he's retiring -- but  
everybody except the most important person, and that's himself. So 
we'll just wait and see the way things turn out and what Wayne 
himself has to say,'' Messier said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking Tuesday via satellite from New York to a conference on  
the state of hockey in Canada, Gretzky reminisced about the sport 
and sounded much like a 38-year-old man ready to hang up his 
skates. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hockey has been a part of my life as long as I can remember,''  
he said. ``I lived it and I breathed it as a kid and as an adult. 
It's the only job I've ever had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He took no questions.  
</P>
<P>
	If this is the end, Gretzky will leave with statistics and  
awards that are staggering by any standard. 
</P>
<P>
	He had 894 goals and 1,961 assists in 1,483 regular season  
games, including nine goals and 51 assists in 66 games with the 
Rangers this season. In the playoffs, the Great One had 122 goals 
and 260 assists in 208 games. 
</P>
<P>
	For his career, he was a nine-time winner of the Hart Trophy as  
league's most valuable player (1980, '81, '82, '83, '84, '85, '86, 
'87, '89); 10 times the league's leading scorer (1981, '82, '83, 
'84, '85, '86, '87, '90, '91, '94); a four-time Lady Byng winner as 
the most gentlemanly player (1980, '91, '92, '94); a five-time 
winner of the Lester Pearson award as NHL's outstanding player 
(1982, '82, '84, '85, '87), and twice the winner of the Conn Smythe 
Trophy as most valuable player in playoffs (1985, '88). 
</P>
<P>
	This hasn't been a typical season for Gretzky, who missed 11  
games with a neck injury. He had played in 223 straight games since 
signing with the Rangers as a free agent in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury was the second in Gretzky's career involving a disc.  
In 1992-93, he missed most of the season with a lower back injury 
before coming back to lead the Los Angeles Kings to the Stanley Cup 
finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998-99 season has included at least one milestone for the  
NHL's leading career scorer. His ninth goal of the year gave him 
1,072 as a professional, moving him past boyhood hero Gordie Howe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wherever Wayne Gretzky has traveled, that's where hockey is,''  
Rangers color analyst John Davidson said in a telephone interview 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Davidson reiterated that he believes Gretzky is 80 percent sure  
he will retire after Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Rangers' win over Tampa Bay on Monday night, Gretzky  
admitted he was thinking about retirement but had not made a 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have 1,000 different thoughts, to be honest,'' Gretzky said.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to think about it. ... All of a sudden it's become a  
bigger issue than I imagined,'' he said. ``Let's see what happens 
over the next five or six days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers intend to pick up the $5 million option on Gretzky's  
contract this week, Smith said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith insisted that Gretzky is an emotional player who has ups  
and downs and that missing the playoffs for a second straight year 
and being sidelined with a neck injury might have made him consider 
retirement a little more. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he is going to play,'' Smith said optimistically.  
</P>
<P>
	Muckler, a longtime associate, also felt Gretzky would be back  
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no reason to say that, really. I guess because it would  
be a sad day if he does elect to retire,' Muckler told TSN's That's 
Hockey. ``I think Wayne still has the passion for the game. He 
still plays the game hard, he likes the people associated with the 
game. I think he would miss it terribly. And he can still 
contribute to the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers in Toronto and New York have reported that Gretzky  
will retire after Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Barnett, Gretzky's agent, did not immediately return a  
telephone call left at his Riverside, Calif., office by The 
Associated Press on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Toronto Sun reported Gretzky would retire, saying the only  
way he would revise his decision to quit would be if his wife, 
Janet, and Barnett urged him to step back and review his decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sun and ESPN quoted unidentified sources as saying Gretzky  
asked for an unusually large number of tickets for Sunday's game, 
although the Rangers said that he officially only asked for 10 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	Gretzky responded to questions about Davidson's report by  
saying, ``There's been times where I've said things to friends that 
get blown way out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I will say is that I will not be one of those  
guys who says `I'm 90 percent sure' or `Maybe I'm coming back.' The 
decision I make will be 100 percent. No ifs, ands or buts.''

	Apple's Profits Double  
</P>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Apple Computer Inc. more than doubled  
its quarterly profit and beat Wall Street expectations in a strong 
recovery fueled by demand for the company's new iMac personal 
computers. It was the company's sixth straight quarterly profit. 
Apple, which had suffered nearly two years of red ink, reported 
late today it earned $135 million, or 84 cents a share in its 
fiscal second quarter, which ended March 27. That was up from a 
profit of $55 million, or 38 cents a share, in the same quarter a 
year ago. Excluding one-time gains, Apple would have earned 60 
cents a share, beating the 57 cents a share predicted by analysts 
surveyed by First Call.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors anxious about earnings dumped  
technology shares once again today, nearly spoiling a rally in blue 
chip stocks that sent the Dow Jones industrials to another closing 
high -- up 16.65 to 10,411.66. The S&AMP;P 500 fell 21.32 to 1,328.50 
and the tech-laden Nasdaq composite fell 76.01 to 2,507.49. As 
investors sold tech shares, they replaced them with manufacturing, 
transportation and basic-materials stocks that have been out of 
favor for some time. That buying sent the Dow past 10,500 for the

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Time Warner Inc. bounced back from a loss a year  
ago to post a net profit of $138 million in the first quarter. The 
improved results reflected strong growth across the company's media 
holdings and a one-time gain from ending a video distribution 
agreement. Time Warner's earnings translated to 10 cents per share 
for the three months ending March 31. That compared to a net loss 
of $62 million, or 12 cents a share, in the same period a year ago, 
when its earnings were dragged down by slumping music sales. 
Revenues rose 2.4 percent to $6.20 billion from $6.05 billion.

	Study: Tobacco Ads Influence Teens  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three heavily advertised cigarette brands --  
Marlboro, Newport and Camel -- are the most popular choice among 
teen-agers who smoked last year, according to a study released 
today. The study, commissioned by the Department of Health and 
Human Services, found that 88 percent of 12th grade smokers puffed 
on those three brands in 1998. Among 10th- and eighth-graders, the 
figures were 86 percent and 82 percent, respectively. It is illegal 
for anyone under 18 to buy tobacco products. Vice President Al Gore 
was unveiling the study today at a ``Kick Butts Day'' anti-smoking 
rally at Roswell Kent Middle School in Akron, Ohio. He said the 
figures underscore the need to require tobacco companies to bear 
the cost of teaching young people not to develop a smoking habit.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Nixes Shipbuilding Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon on Wednesday sank a merger  
between defense giants General Dynamics Corp. and Newport News 
Shipbuilding that would have created a single shipbuilder for the 
Navy's largest, most expensive ships. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed $2 billion deal would have meant just one supplier  
for aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines. It also would have 
reduced competition in other sectors of military shipbuilding, and 
any cost savings to the Navy would not justify that loss of 
competition, Defense Secretary William Cohen said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because the merger would collapse the two existing companies  
into a single entity, there would be a reduction in the likelihood 
of future competition,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	General Dynamics, of Falls Church, Va., made an unsolicited bid  
for Newport News in February. The deal required Pentagon review and 
also was subject to a review by the Justice Department's antitrust 
division. 
</P>
<P>
	If successful, General Dynamics would have dominated the  
approximately $7 billion annual market for Navy ships, including $4 
billion aircraft carriers and submarines costing roughly half that. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholas D. Chabraja, General Dynamics chairman and chief  
executive officer, called the Pentagon decision ``disappointing'' 
and said the firm has withdrawn its offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``General Dynamics believes that its proposed acquisition of  
Newport News Shipbuilding would have meant significant savings for 
the U.S. Navy, enhanced value for the shareholders of both 
companies, and still preserved jobs,'' Chabraja said. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport News Chairman and Chief Executive Officer William P.  
Fricks said Pentagon opposition means the company will proceed with 
its previously planned buyout of another rival shipyard, Avondale 
Industries of New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are unable to conclude that a merger with General Dynamics  
could close,'' Fricks said. ``Accordingly, Newport News will 
proceed with the Avondale transaction, which we continue to believe 
makes sound strategic and financial sense, and which has received 
antitrust clearance from the Department of Justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newport News announced Jan. 19 that it planned to acquire  
Avondale in a $470 million merger. 
</P>
<P>
	The General Dynamics bid on Feb. 10 was widely seen as a counter  
to the Avondale deal, which was on hold pending review of the later 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the Pentagon review concerned calculating possible cost  
savings, which Cohen called considerable, from having shipbuilding 
engineering, research and development talent concentrated in one 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	But Cohen said planned improvements at Newport News can save  
nearly as much money as the merger offered, without a loss in 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``While there was still an important differential, we felt that  
this differential was not now so great as to override the 
management and competitive challenges we could face from the 
merger,'' Cohen said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	In an agreement with Newport News announced at the same time  
Wednesday, the shipyard will renegotiate some Navy contracts and 
agree to a lower price, but will keep profits reaped from 
improvements in efficiency over the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
	Those negotiations were in the works long before the General  
Dynamics bid arose, said Lee Buchanan, assistant secretary of the 
Navy for research, development and acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	General Dynamics estimated it could save the Pentagon $190  
million to $280 million annually, Buchanan said. The Navy put the 
figure at between $115 million and $200 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``General Dynamics did offer very attractive savings. Now the  
question is how do you write off savings versus the damage to 
competition. That's the rub,'' Buchanan said.

	``It's my own fault. It was quite cold last night and I didn't  
go out warmed up,'' Sampras said. ``I felt it move on a serve. It's 
acute lumbago. It spasmed on me last night and this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have had the same problem in the past. The important thing  
is rest, and hopefully in seven to 10 days I can start to do 
things. Without your health you don't have anything and that is my 
livelihood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras acknowledged that with his withdrawal here and from  
Monte Carlo he will probably be overtaken as the world's top-ranked 
tennis player. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a setback but I am not panicked. There is a lot of tennis  
yet to be played this year and I am still positive,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras said he expects to play in Rome in mid-May and after  
that in the World Team Cup Championship in Duesseldorf, Germany.

<HEADLINE> Millionaire Finds Missing Daughters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A wealthy banker found his ex-wife and two  
children in Switzerland 22 months after they vanished amid 
allegations that he abused his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarah Shah, 9, and Genevieve Marie, 7, were located on Saturday  
with their mother, Ellen Dever, in Lucerne, said Edward Eisen, 
father Bipin Shah's spokesman. The girls were in good condition 
when they returned to Philadelphia on Sunday with their father, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shah had searched from Australia to South Africa for the girls,  
spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on investigators and 
bounty hunters and offering a $2 million reward. 
</P>
<P>
	Shah wouldn't comment further, requesting privacy and time to  
readjust. The FBI said Shah found the girls while the agency was 
still in the process of securing a warrant for Ms. Dever's arrest 
in Lucerne. 
</P>
<P>
	The daughters disappeared with Ms. Dever on June 8, 1997. Shah  
has custody of the girls. Ms. Dever faces federal charges of 
unlawful flight to avoid prosecution for concealment of a child, 
said FBI Agent Linda Vizi in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dever and Shah were married for seven years, before the  
relationship deteriorated amid charges of abuse and adultery and 
finally ended in divorce in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Three times, Ms. Dever filed protection-from-abuse requests in  
Montgomery County after claiming her husband punched her in the 
face, threw her to the floor, and yelled obscenities and threats. 
</P>
<P>
	Shah denied the accusations and no charges were filed, but the  
court granted a protection order and the two reached an agreement 
to avoid each other in 1996. Each continued to accuse the other of 
harassment. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Dever said when she left with the children that she was  
taking them for ``a surprise vacation.'' She never returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Shah, who earned his millions with automated teller and  
electronic payment bank systems, claimed that an underground 
network to help parents and children escape domestic abuse had 
helped Dever disappear with the two girls. But he denies that he 
abused his family.

	Serbs Blame NATO for Refugee Deaths  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslavia said NATO jets blasted  
apart a convoy of refugees under Serb police escort today, killing 
at least 64 Kosovars. NATO said its pilots fired on military 
vehicles only, and the Pentagon suggested that Serbs may have been 
responsible for the deaths. A Pentagon spokesman said relief 
organizations reported that refugees entering Albania had said 
Yugoslav planes attacked civilian convoys. Meanwhile, NATO 
warplanes zeroed in on Serb targets throughout Kosovo, hammering 
ground forces in an effort to limit troop movement.

	FBI Warns of Serb Terrorism in U.S.  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI has warned the U.S. military to be  
alert for possible Serb-led terrorist attacks inside the United 
States after several Serbian Orthodox churches received ``threats 
to kill'' American soldiers, according to a memo obtained by The 
Associated Press. The Serb-language letter urges Serbian-Americans 
to respond violently to NATO strikes on Yugoslavia. The government 
memo was distributed to military bases and other sensitive federal 
installations, such as nuclear weapons labs, through a special 
electronic mail warning system, officials said.

	Chernomyrdin To Seek Kosovo Peace  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has been  
appointed to take charge of Russia's efforts to negotiate a peace 
agreement for Kosovo. Russia has strongly opposed NATO's bombing 
campaign in Yugoslavia, and it has been eager to play a role in 
settling the conflict. Chernomyrdin indicated he may visit the 
United States ``for meetings at the highest level.'' Although 
Russia is opposed to the airstrikes, it also has been critical of 
President Slobodan Milosevic's campaign against ethnic Albanians in 
Kosovo.

	Kevorkian Starts Hunger Strike

	DETROIT (AP) -- Dr. Jack Kevorkian, imprisoned on a murder  
conviction, says he will begin a hunger strike immediately. The 
assisted-suicide advocate was sentenced yesterday to 10 to 25 years 
in prison for the death of Thomas Youk, a man who suffered from Lou 
Gehrig's disease. A new jail policy prevents the 70-year-old 
retired pathologist from being force fed. Kevorkian says he has

	Pentagon Nixes Shipbuilding Merger  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon has rejected a merger between  
defense giants General Dynamics and Newport News Shipbuilding that 
would have created a single shipbuilder for all nuclear submarines. 
The proposed $2 billion deal also would have reduced competition in 
other sectors of military shipbuilding, and any cost savings to the 
Navy would not justify that loss of competition, Defense Secretary 
William Cohen said in a statement.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Volunteers who keep an eye on America Online  
chat-rooms for free are demanding that the internet provider pay 
them for their services. The workers lead chat rooms, report 
violations of Internet rules and answer questions from puzzled 
surfers. AOL employs about 10,000 volunteers, some of whom have 
complained to the U.S. Department of Labor, which is looking into 
the matter. AOL defends the system, saying ``volunteerism'' is part 
of the culture of the Web.

close. On the NYSE, gainers led losers 1,769-1,282. As investors

day the NHL regular season ends. ``It's just a lifetime decision. 
Once it's done, it's done, 100 percent, whether I come back or I 
don't.'' The league's career leading scorer said he spoke with 
Rangers coach and planned to meet with general manager Neil Smith 
after the team got to Ottawa for tomorrow night's game.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Inmate Testifies in Framing Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHEATON, Ill. (AP) -- An ex-death row inmate took the stand  
Wednesday at the trial of seven police and former prosecutors 
accused of railroading him for a 1983 murder, denying he ever 
described a ``vision'' he had about the crime to detectives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never told them that, never,'' Rolando Cruz said.  
</P>
<P>
	The men are charged with lying, creating evidence and conspiring  
to frame Cruz for the murder of 10-year-old Jeanine Nicarico. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz, 35, was twice convicted and spent nearly a decade on death  
row but was acquitted in 1995 after a sheriff's official changed 
key testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities claim that he revealed incriminating details to  
detectives in a May 9, 1983, statement describing a ``vision'' or 
``dream'' he had about the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Special prosecutor William Kunkle contends detectives made up  
the statement, while defense attorneys say Cruz is a chronic liar 
who cannot be believed. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz acknowledged under questioning that he repeatedly lied to  
sheriff's detectives investigating the Nicarico murder. But he 
emphatically denied making the dream statement or offering 
detectives details that suggested he was involved in the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Cruz said, he gave detectives a made-up version of the  
crime implicating three other men. He said he repeated that story 
in a tape-recorded statement the next day, May 10. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz said he told the lies because he doesn't like police and  
dislikes he three men he implicated. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys repeatedly objected to Cruz's contentions that  
police knew he was lying. They will get their chance to question 
Cruz after Kunkle finishes with him Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz and fellow defendant Alejandro Hernandez were twice found  
guilty of murder, first in a joint trial in 1985 and later in 
separate retrials. But each verdict was overturned on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Cruz was acquitted after a sheriff's official changed his  
testimony backing up detectives' version of the dream statement. 
Charges against Hernandez were dropped after Cruz was acquitted, 
and an investigation into the changed testimony led to charges 
against the law enforcement veterans. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants are three former prosecutors and four police  
officers.

<HEADLINE> Time Warner Earns $138M in Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Time Warner Inc. bounced back from a loss a year  
ago to post a net profit of $138 million in the first quarter. The 
improved results reflected strong growth across the company's media 
holdings and a one-time gain from ending a video distribution 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner's earnings translated to 10 cents per share for the  
three months ending March 31. That compared to a net loss of $62 
million, or 12 cents a share, in the same period a year ago, when 
its earnings were dragged down by slumping music sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues rose 2.4 percent to $6.20 billion from $6.05 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	The figures include results from Time Warner Entertainment Co.,  
a partnership with the Colorado cable operator MediaOne Group Inc. 
which holds most of Time Warner's cable systems, the Warner Bros. 
film studio and the HBO premium cable channel. Time Warner owns 
about 75 percent of the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner also posted hefty gains in cash flow, a common  
measure for performance among large media companies with heavy debt 
burdens. Cash flow excludes interest costs and other non-operating 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner's total cash flow jumped 47 percent to $1.25  
billion, which includes a one-time gain of $215 million from the 
early termination of a video distribution agreement with MGM/UA. 
Without the gain, cash flow rose 22 percent to $1.04 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Performance was strong across the company's media holdings.  
</P>
<P>
	Publishing operations, which includes the magazines Time,  
Fortune, People and Entertainment Weekly, had an 11 percent rise in 
cash flow thanks to strong advertising sales. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's music holdings, which had been slumping in recent  
years, continued a comeback with a 10 percent rise in cash flow. 
The group's artists won 24 Grammys in February, including Madonna, 
Alanis Morissette and Eric Clapton. 
</P>
<P>
	The film division also posted gains of 10 percent, excluding the  
one-time gain from the video contract, thanks to hits like ``You've 
Got Mail'' and ``Analyze This.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Time Warner's WB Network, in which Chicago-based Tribune Co.  
owns a minority interest, continued to post losses as it expands 
its national operations, which include the drama series 
``Felicity.''

<HEADLINE> Immigrant Wins $197M Lottery Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRAINTREE, Mass. (AP) -- In an instant, Maria Grasso went from  
baby sitter for a millionaire to millionaire baby sitter. 
</P>
<P>
	The 54-year-old Chilean immigrant came forward Wednesday to  
claim the $197 million Big Game jackpot, the world's biggest 
lottery prize ever won by one person. She beat odds of 76 
million-to-1. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't believe it,'' she said. ``I haven't had time to  
think clearly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She decided to take the money in a lump sum of $104 million --  
$70.2 million after taxes -- instead of in 26 annual installments. 
</P>
<P>
	The divorced mother of two said she is not sure what she will do  
with the money, but she mentioned her family and handicapped 
children as priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Since finding out she won on April 6, her only major purchase  
was the navy blue suit she wore to the news conference at state 
lottery headquarters. ``I'm a very down-to-earth person,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Until she quit last week, Ms. Grasso worked for the family of  
Chris Gabrieli, a Boston venture capitalist who ran for Congress 
last year. Since 1996, she has lived in the family's Beacon Hill 
townhouse and looked after Gabrieli's children. There are now four 
children, ages 1 to 5. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's the kind of person who deserves a good turn in life,''  
said Gabrieli, who is worth somewhere between $25 million and $125 
million himself, according to campaign records. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Grasso bought the winning ticket at a grocery store near  
baseball's Fenway Park while shopping for the family. Ms. Grasso 
said she does not play the lottery regularly but did this time 
because the jackpot was so big. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she chose the winning numbers at random. With the  
winning ticket beside her bed, she had difficulty sleeping the 
night she won. 
</P>
<P>
	``At first I couldn't believe that it could be,'' Ms. Grasso  
said. ``There are so many million chances.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Grasso, one of six children, came to the United States in  
1971, earned her high school equivalency diploma in 1976 and became 
a U.S. citizen in 1984. She has worked as a teaching assistant for 
the mentally handicapped. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been my priority, to work with children, special  
needs children,'' she said. ``I think this will be a chance for me 
to keep helping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She also will be able to help her family -- both her two grown  
children and her relatives in Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	``She fully deserves what has happened to her,'' a woman named  
Ana, who said she is Ms. Grasso's sister, told National Television 
in Chile. ``She has worked hard all her life to help her family, 
especially our mother.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Big Game jackpot swelled to $197 million when no one won the  
twice-a-week drawing from Feb. 2 until April 6. During that period, 
328 million tickets were sold in the six Big Game states -- 
Massachusetts, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Grasso said she waited until Wednesday to come forward  
because she needed time to get a lawyer and clear her head. 
</P>
<P>
	During that time, rumors abounded that the winner was a Nigerian  
immigrant cab driver. After colleagues at the man's taxi company 
spread word the driver had won the jackpot, the man got so much 
attention that he had to hire a lawyer to deny he was the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``I felt sorry for him,'' Ms. Grasso said.  
</P>
<P>
	The nation's biggest jackpot was $295 million, but that was  
split last July by 13 Ohio machinists who pooled their ticket 
purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1997 lottery drawing in Spain -- named El Gordo, or the Fat One  
-- had a $270 million purse, the richest in the world. But the money 
was split among many winners, and the biggest single prize was only 
$2 million.

<HEADLINE>  Quayle To Run for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Former Vice President Dan Quayle, trying  
to refurbish his image and jump-start his GOP presidential 
campaign, declared his candidacy Wednesday by pledging to rebuild 
American values after ``a dishonest decade of Bill Clinton and Al 
Gore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking office for the first time since he and President Bush  
succumbed to Clinton and Gore in 1992, the former Indiana senator 
sought to push beyond a history of political gaffes and 
controversies. ``Murphy Brown is gone,'' he said, ``and I'm still 
here fighting for the American family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's use of the TV sitcom in the 1992 campaign to highlight  
a ``poverty of values'' brought him criticism and ridicule from 
some quarters. But he returned to the theme Wednesday, betting that 
primary voters will reward him for casting a spotlight on the 
family-values debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question in life is not whether you get knocked down. You  
will. The question is, are you ready to get back up, are you 
willing to get back up and fight for what you believe in?'' Quayle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of nearly 6,000, packed to the gym rafters at his former  
high school, shouted ``Q2K! Q2K! Q2K!'' for Quayle-2000. Fireworks 
exploded before and after his speech, covering the stage in a haze 
of smoke. Rock music, hundreds of handpainted signs and an 
appearance by ball-tossing former Chicago Bears quarterback Jim 
McMahon gave the announcement a pep rally feeling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have come back home to announce that I will seek and I will  
win the presidency of the United States,'' Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who succeeded Quayle as vice president and is seeking the  
Democratic presidential nomination, was singled out by Quayle for 
calling President Clinton a great leader during the impeachment 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``What arrogance. What disdain for the values that parents are  
trying to teach their children. What contempt for the rule of 
law,'' Quayle said. ``This should not stand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are coming to the end of a dishonest decade of Bill Clinton  
and Al Gore,'' he said. ``It's time we work to reclaim the values 
that made America great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's staff dismissed the attack. Spokesman Chris Lehane said,  
``Dan Quayle's vision of America will take us back to the Dark Ages 
of the last GOP administration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing relaxed and in command of his topics, Quayle spoke  
from notes and varied from a draft of the speech given to 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	He promoted his proposed 30 percent across-the-board tax cut,  
billing it as a boon to middle-income families. 
</P>
<P>
	And he portrayed himself as the best qualified potential  
commander-in-chief, recalling his participation in White House war 
councils. After Bush picked him as vice president, Quayle had 
withstood withering criticism for having joined the Indiana 
National Guard years earlier, thus avoiding service in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can only get so much from briefing books and crash  
courses. You need experience,'' Quayle said. Texas Gov. George W. 
Bush, the early favorite for the GOP nomination, is getting scores 
of private briefings to bone up on foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``A presidency is not to be inherited,'' Quayle said.  
</P>
<P>
	Aides would not say whether Quayle was alluding to Gore or the  
Texas governor -- or perhaps both. Gore is Clinton's choice to win 
in 2000, and Bush is the son of the former president. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked for comment, Bush campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said  
simply, ``Governor Bush congratulates Vice President Quayle on his 
announcement and wishes him well. Governor Bush intends to campaign 
by laying out a positive vision for a brighter future for 
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle himself wants to inherit President Bush's mantle.  
</P>
<P>
	The former vice president, 52, is a long shot for the nomination  
despite his popularity among grass-roots activists and his strong 
organization in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	He joins a crowded field of conservative candidates wrestling  
over the same votes. His campaign team has come together slowly. 
And he raised about $2 million in the first quarter of 1999 -- $1 
million less than projected. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's largest obstacle is what one supporter calls the  
``potato factor'' -- a reference to the day he misspelled the word 
in a classroom full of school children. That and other miscues 
turned the vice president into a punch line for countless jokes, 
cementing for many American the perception that Quayle was 
ill-suited for the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuck with the image, Quayle wants to turn it to his advantage  
in the GOP primaries. He is telling conservative voters that the 
controversies prove his willingness to fight the media and liberal 
elite to protect values. A new internal poll of 1,000 primary 
voters showed that 70 percent agreed with this statement: ``Dan 
Quayle has proven he can take a punch; the media made fun of him 
and he is still standing firm for what he believes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His supporters argue that Quayle will easily exceed the low  
expectations to sneak up on Bush, who they say can't live up to his 
early billing. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Quayle has lost key supporters to Bush, including former  
aides David Beckwith and Al Hubbard. 
</P>
<P>
	State GOP chairman Mike McDaniel has yet to endorse a GOP  
presidential candidate -- not a good sign for favorite son Quayle -- 
and Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith is a top Bush adviser.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Retailer May Sell FAO Schwarz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Disappointed with the performance  
of FAO Schwarz, the Dutch retail group Vendex NV may sell its 
upscale U.S. toy store chain. 
</P>
<P>
	FAO Schwarz was a sore point in an earnings report released  
Tuesday, and the chairman of Vendex did not rule out a sale of the 
group's only non-European unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter van Bakkum, a Vendex spokesman, said Wednesday that a sale  
of FAO Schwarz is possible but that there were no immediate plans 
for shedding the business it acquired last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The focus now in on improving earnings, but it is true the  
company's strategy is focused on Europe,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vendex is studying ways to improve the performance of the toy  
chain, including a newly launched online sales effort, Van Bakkum 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In releasing financial results for the fiscal year ended Jan.  
31, Jan-Michiel Hessels, the chairman of Vendex, said Tuesday it is 
``not impossible'' FAO Schwartz would be sold this year. But he 
quickly added that Vendex is still attempting to improve profit 
margins at the stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Vendex did not break down profit by company, Hessels  
said profit at FAO Schwarz dropped ``sharply'' over the fiscal 
year. Its sales, however, rose to $197 million from $181 million in 
the previous year, mostly reflecting acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Vendex reported an overall profit of $139 million, down from  
$575 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline reflected problems at FAO Schwarz and the Amichi  
clothing chain as well as lost revenue from divested companies and 
the costs of acquisitions. Excluding one-time charges, the company 
said its operating profit jumped 57 percent to $143 million.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Sees Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- President Kim Dae-jung said Wednesday  
the South Korean economy was recovering, but urged vigorous 
corporate restructuring to boost foreign investors' confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our economy still has many problems but, beginning this year,  
the situation is improving,'' Kim told local journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	After shrinking 5.8 percent last year, Kim said, the economy  
grew 3.1 percent in the first quarter of this year. The jobless 
rate topped out at 8.7 percent in February and declined to 8.2 
percent in March, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said he expected the economy to grow at least 2  
percent this year and 5 percent next year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kim said continued restructuring of the country's bloated  
conglomerates was crucial to a sustained recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	He criticized the top five conglomerates -- Hyundai, Samsung,  
Daewoo, LG and SK -- for being slow to slim down, and renewed his 
threat to order banks to stop providing new loans for them. 
</P>
<P>
	Kim has been urging big businesses to swap or merge some of  
their overlapping subsidiaries in semiconductors, petrochemicals 
and autos to improve efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, South Korean conglomerates, called chaebol, thrived  
on cozy relations with military governments. A single chaebol 
controls 40 to 60 subsidiaries, making everything from computer 
chips to cars and ships. 
</P>
<P>
	When the economy slowed in 1997, about a dozen conglomerates  
collapsed under their debt load, leaving banks with mounds of 
non-performing loans that caused a sudden loss of confidence and 
triggered a flight of foreign capital. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korea accepted a record $58 billion bailout from the  
International Monetary Fund in late 1997. Structural economic 
reforms were a key condition of the rescue package.

<HEADLINE> Holocaust Survivors To Get Checks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Holocaust survivors and their families should  
start receiving insurance settlements on previously unpaid claims 
by summer's end, the chairman of an international commission says. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not be successful until we have begun to pay some  
claims,'' said former Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, who 
now heads the International Commission on the Holocaust Era. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission hopes to establish procedures by the end of May  
about how to identify and pay claims on insurance policies issued 
to Holocaust survivors or the heirs of people killed by the Nazis 
during World War II, the Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Many European Jews purchased life or property insurance policies  
in an effort to protect their assets in the uncertain days leading 
up to the war. 
</P>
<P>
	Six European insurance companies -- Assicurazioni Generali of  
Italy, Allianz of Germany, AXA of France, Winterthur, Baseler and 
Zurich of Switzerland -- belong to the commission, charged with 
resolving unpaid insurance claims by Holocaust victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Eagleburger said the companies set up a $100 million fund. Of  
that, $90 million was placed into an escrow account and will be 
used to pay apparently valid claims that cannot be substantiated 
because records were destroyed. The other $10 million will go 
toward operating expenses.

<HEADLINE> Patricia Neal Keeps Career Alive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``You can't give up,'' Patricia Neal says,  
quickly adding: ``You sure want to, sometimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In her case, it's understandable.  
</P>
<P>
	Neal, whose strong performances in such movies as ``Hud,'' ``A  
Face in the Crowd'' and ``The Fountainhead'' have made her one of 
the most respected actresses in film, has survived almost as much 
tragedy as Job. 
</P>
<P>
	The 73-year-old Academy Award- and Tony-winning actress has  
endured the death of a daughter, the near death of her baby boy, a 
nervous breakdown, a husband who had an affair with her best 
friend, and a series of massive strokes that paralyzed her, 
impaired her speech and nearly killed her. 
</P>
<P>
	Thoughts of suicide crept into her mind, she says, but whenever  
she voiced them, her then husband, Roald Dahl, would ask her if she 
wanted to use a gun or some other method. 
</P>
<P>
	Such tough love worked, but the main reason she didn't give up  
was simple: ``I'm a stubborn woman,'' she says, laughing with that 
distinctive contralto of hers. ``I don't think I'd kill myself in a 
million years. I really don't. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't lie down. ... I'm fightin' all the way.''  
</P>
<P>
	Now, in a life marked by disasters and comebacks, Neal has come  
back again, starring in her first feature film in 10 years, in the 
title role in Robert Altman's delightful ``Cookie's Fortune.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She plays a dotty, lonely old woman who misses her late husband  
so much that she decides to join him. Her suicide leads to a 
``murder'' investigation that brings out the eccentricities in 
everyone in her small Mississippi town. 
</P>
<P>
	Neal says she got the part because her daughter, Lucy, met  
Altman in Cannes. He mentioned that he was going to make ``Cookie's 
Fortune'' and still had to cast the title character. 
</P>
<P>
	``What about mom?'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Altman then saw Neal at a party Lucy threw for her and decided  
the part was hers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to see how I was all these years later,'' says Neal,  
who recalls meeting Altman shortly before her stroke in 1965, when 
she was pregnant with Lucy and doing Otto Preminger's ``In Harm's 
Way'' in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	Neal, who won the Oscar as best actress for 1963's ``Hud,''  
admits she badly wanted this part and that jobs have been scarce in 
recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't quite understand it, but nobody calls me and nobody  
wants me,'' she says in a singsong, almost coquettish way. ``But I 
love to act.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She hopes this film reminds people that she's still alive and  
kicking -- and willing and able to act. 
</P>
<P>
	The film, which co-stars Charles S. Dutton, Glenn Close, Liv  
Tyler and Julianne Moore, has received mixed reviews, but all of 
the actors have won raves. One critic was moved to praise Neal for 
``lighting up the screen with a confident, stylish performance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While not working regularly, Neal has been busy taking cruises  
with friends around the world, resting up in Martha's Vineyard, and 
making a few trips a year to the 20-year-old rehabilitation center 
named after her in her hometown of Knoxville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	When she went into movies she was already an accomplished  
actress with the 1947 Tony for her performance in Lillian Hellman's 
``Another Part of the Forest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But her screen debut in 1949's ``John Loves Mary,'' a piece of  
fluff that also starred Jack Carson and Ronald Reagan, was panned 
by The New York Times. And critics dismissed her next two films -- 
including ``The Fountainhead,'' which co-starred her then lover, 
the much older and still married Gary Cooper -- as silly and 
pretentious. 
</P>
<P>
	``It didn't turn out very well,'' Neal concedes about her early  
days in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	So she went back to Broadway and played the teacher driven to  
suicide in Hellman's ``The Children's Hour.'' At Hellman's house 
Neal met Dahl, the writer who would become famous for his horror 
tales and children's stories. 
</P>
<P>
	They married in 1953 and had five children. The marriage lasted  
three decades until ending in a nasty divorce after Neal discovered 
Dahl and one her best friends were having an affair. Their marriage 
also was marked by tragedy. Her only son Theo was in a car accident 
as a baby, nearly died and needed many operations. Her daughter, 
Olivia, died of complications from measles in 1962 at age 7. Then 
she had a series of strokes. Dahl remained at her side through it 
all. He died in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Her struggle back to where she could walk and talk again is seen  
as epic in the annals of stroke rehabilitation. (A 1991 biopic 
about her travails starred Glenda Jackson as Neal and Dirk Bogarde 
as Dahl.) She made a grand return to the screen by 1968, winning an 
Oscar nomination for her performance in ``The Subject Was Roses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She still limps and has bad vision in one eye because of the  
stroke, but sitting at her dining room table in her Upper East Side 
high-rise apartment, she says: ``Sure look perfect now compared to 
then.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The actress, who wears a little Oscar pendant around her neck,  
notes her memory can be ``vague.'' But she is as sharp as a 
stiletto otherwise, and displays no self-pity in recounting her 
hard times. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really extraordinary, what happens in one's life. Then  
it's over. But it ain't over now,'' she says, with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	Among her fondest memories is playing Olivia Walton in ``The  
Homecoming: A Christmas Story,'' the 1971 made-for-TV film that 
served as the pilot for the CBS series ``The Waltons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She remembers it touched her heart to be playing someone with  
the same name as her late daughter and she became upset when Olivia 
temporarily was changed to Mary during the film's development. 
</P>
<P>
	These days she is planning her next couple of cruises, one of  
which may conflict with her mother's 100th birthday in September. 
</P>
<P>
	When told that her mother's longevity should augurs well for her  
own prospects, she laughs and says, ``I ain't gonna make that. I've 
been told by two fortunetellers I'm going to live to 95. I don't 
know if they're right. It'd be funny if they were.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Likely To Pay Contempt Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is likely to pay a financial  
penalty rather than challenge a contempt-of-court ruling that he 
gave ``intentionally false'' testimony about his relationship with 
Monica Lewinsky, according to a top adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House declined to comment officially Tuesday on  
whether Clinton would appeal the ruling and referred questions to 
Robert Bennett, Clinton's private attorney. Bennett did not return 
calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was held in contempt of court Monday by U.S. District  
Judge Susan Webber Wright in Little Rock, who presided in the 
sexual harassment suit brought by Paula Jones. Wright found that 
Clinton gave ``false, misleading and evasive answers'' in a January 
1988 deposition in which he denied having sexual relations with Ms. 
Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright ordered Clinton to pay ``any reasonable expenses,''  
including legal fees incurred by Mrs. Jones as a result of 
Clinton's false testimony. The judge also directed Clinton to 
reimburse the court $1,202 for her travel to Washington to preside 
over taking the deposition. And she referred the matter to the 
Arkansas Supreme Court's Professional Conduct Committee, which has 
the power to revoke Clinton's law license or to impose other 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	A top adviser to Clinton, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said Tuesday the ``most likely course'' being discussed by the 
president's lawyers would have Clinton pay the penalty without 
contesting it, provided that Mrs. Jones' demand for reimbursement 
was reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
	But this adviser said Clinton was interested in keeping his law  
license and that his attorneys might contest any regulatory effort 
in Arkansas to revoke it. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart refused to answer  
questions about the case. Lockhart said he was not aware that the 
White House was considering its own appeal on the constitutional 
point of separation of powers. 
</P>
<P>
	In Little Rock, Mrs. Jones met with her attorneys, who were  
given 20 days to submit a statement of legal costs for possible 
reimbursement.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Mayor Meets Firefighters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Firefighter Matt Moseley's dramatic rescue of a  
construction worker trapped atop a burning crane also may have 
ended the bad blood between the firefighters' union and the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Bill Campbell met with union officials Tuesday at the  
urging of Moseley, whom the mayor praised as a hero for dangling 
from a helicopter and pulling worker Ivers Sims to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting ended with promises for higher pay, the hiring of  
150 more firefighters and the purchase of new breathing apparatus. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that this incident has changed things for the  
positive,'' said Moseley, a member of Atlanta Professional 
Firefighters Local 134. ``I've had a talk with the mayor and I 
believe we're going to do some positive things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The union was angered earlier this year when police received a  
$2,000 raise, while a $500 raise for firefighters was rejected by 
the City Council. Starting salaries range from $27,000 to $30,000. 
In addition, the mayor had refused requests to fill vacancies and 
replace faulty equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Moseley even told reporters he was ``somewhat uncomfortable''  
sharing the limelight with Campbell at a news conference and joint 
appearances on TV after Monday's televised rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	Attitudes changed after Tuesday's meeting.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think it just took the dramatics of what happened yesterday  
to realize that we need to sit down and start a dialogue,'' said 
union president David Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell spokesman Nick Gold said the mayor ``was so moved by  
what happened yesterday with the heroic rescue that he wanted to 
find some parity between firefighters and police.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Train Breaks Own Speed Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A manned, magnetically levitated Japanese train  
broke its own world speed record on a test run today, clocking 343 
mph, the train's developer said. 
</P>
<P>
	The train -- a five-car superconducting magnetically levitated  
linear motor vehicle, or MLX01 maglev, with 13 engineers aboard -- 
set the record on a test track near the city of Kofu, 68 miles west 
of Tokyo, said Hirotaka Kawana, a spokesman for Central Japan 
Railway Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous record of 330 mph for a manned run was set on Dec.  
12, 1997, the spokesman said. An unmanned Japanese maglev reached a 
speed of 342 mph on Dec. 24, 1997, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Central Japan Railway Co. is developing the maglev train jointly  
with Japan's Railway Technology Research Institute. They will 
decide by March next year whether to adopt the train for use in 
future commercial transportation projects. 
</P>
<P>
	Hideyuki Kobayashi, an official at the research institute, said  
the total cost of developing the train was $2.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Maglev trains differ from conventional trains in that magnets  
lift them slightly off the ground, eliminating speed-reducing 
friction with the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, lawmakers in the United States authorized $1 billion  
in federal money to explore and construct a maglev segment. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan is home to some of the world's fastest passenger trains.  
The ``bullet trains'' run up to 186 mph and have reached maximum 
speeds of 275 mph in test runs.

<HEADLINE> Two Charged in Death of Boy Witness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRIDGEPORT, Conn. (AP) -- Two brothers were charged Wednesday  
with killing an 8-year-old boy and his mother to keep the youngster 
from testifying against one of them in a murder case. 
</P>
<P>
	The slayings Jan. 7 horrified many people and prompted sharp  
criticism of Connecticut's witness protection program. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Peeler, 27, and Adrian Peeler, 23, were charged with  
murder, conspiracy and other offenses in the slayings of Leroy 
``B.J.'' Brown Jr. and his mother, Karen Clarke, 29, who were found 
shot to death in their home. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers could get the death penalty. They were jailed  
without bail. 
</P>
<P>
	Leroy had been scheduled to testify against Russell Peeler in  
the 1998 slaying of Ms. Clarke's fiance. The boy had witnessed an 
earlier drive-by shooting in which Peeler allegedly attempted to 
kill the man. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Attorney Stephen Robinson said Wednesday the boy and his  
mother were ``apparently murdered for living up to their civic 
duty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Even the most jaded among us was moved by the littlest hero,''  
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Leroy and his mother had received police protection for a short  
time after the fiance's slaying, but Ms. Clarke found the officers' 
presence intrusive and asked police to end the surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after the slayings, police arrested the brothers on  
unrelated charges. It took more than three months to charge them in 
the killings. Investigators would not discuss the evidence or say 
which brother they believe fired the shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my understanding that both individuals strongly assert  
their innocence,'' said the brothers' lawyer, Preston Tisdale. 
</P>
<P>
	Russell Peeler was free on bail, awaiting trial in the fiance's  
slaying, on the day mother and son were killed. He was supposedly 
being monitored by way an electronic bracelet. 
</P>
<P>
	A bill is now pending in the Legislature that would provide an  
assortment of protections for witnesses, including relocation, 
housing and living expenses and armed escorts to court proceedings 
for up to a year. 
</P>
<P>
	A panel appointed by the governor has also recommended making it  
a capital offense to murder a witness. 
</P>
<P>
	The Peeler brothers are subject to the death penalty only  
because there was more than one victim and because one of the dead 
was under 16. 
</P>
<P>
	As the murder charges were announced Wednesday, officials also  
disclosed that the brothers were indicted on federal drug-dealing 
charges last week. They were accused of crack distribution and 
other offenses.

<HEADLINE> AMA Delays Forming Doctors' Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The American Medical Association has decided  
against forming a labor union of doctors for now, saying their 
members need more time to consider the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The trustees want the issue of collective bargaining to be  
brought before the AMA's House of Delegates in June before a 
decision is made to form a national labor organization, the AMA 
said Tuesday in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors are looking to unionization as a way to withstand  
pressures from managed care companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue is so complex, and of such far-reaching impact on  
the practice of medicine and patient care, that the matter requires 
careful and thorough consideration by the House before it selects a 
course of action,'' said Dr. D. Ted Lewers, vice chairman of the 
AMA board. 
</P>
<P>
	One union has gotten the jump on AMA organizing efforts. Last  
month, the Service Employees International Union announced a new 
group, the National Doctors Alliance, and a $1 million organizing 
drive.

<HEADLINE> Genentech Admits Illegal Marketing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Genentech Inc. will pay one of the  
largest-ever fines against a pharmaceutical company as part of a 
guilty plea for illegally marketing its growth hormone drug. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said Wednesday that the South San  
Francisco company will admit that from 1985 to 1994 it aggressively 
marketed the synthetic hormone Protropin for treating burns and a 
kidney disorder, even though those uses were not approved by the 
Food and Drug Administration. Genentech will also pay a $50 million 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
	If the judge approves the plea bargain, it would be the first  
time a pharmaceutical firm is found guilty of the criminal charge 
of promoting a drug for uses not approved by the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA has also said that Protropin was being prescribed to  
children who were short but otherwise healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate statement, Genentech confirmed the plea but would  
only say it promoted the drug ``for medical uses that had not been 
approved by the (FDA).'' Genentech did not immediately return phone 
calls requesting information about the specific medical uses to 
which they were pleading guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	Growth hormone, the company's first product, which was launched  
in 1985, was approved for sale to children suffering from a rare 
growth disorder called hypopituitary dwarfism. 
</P>
<P>
	Genetech's Protoprin sales totaled more than $1.2 billion  
between 1985 and 1994. Sales of the drug, which last year were $214 
million, have declined in recent years to due competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions were raised, however, about Genentech's marketing  
tactics. A 1996 survey in the Journal of the American Medical 
Association found that 40 percent of patients were getting the drug 
for uses not approved by the FDA. Off-label use is legal, but drug 
makers may not promote it. 
</P>
<P>
	Government investigations also looked into allegations that  
Genentech gave kickbacks to doctors who were big prescribers. But 
that issue was not included in the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The illegal marketing practices were conducted under a different  
regime at Genentech. The company gained a reputation for aggressive 
marketing under its former chief executive officer, G. Kirk Raab. 
He was fired for financial improprieties in mid-1995, just as the 
federal probe began. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials said Genentech halted the illegal marketing in  
1994 and has taken steps to reform its marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	``This insidious practice distorts medical judgments, boosts  
health care premiums and adds to the cost of taxpayer-supported 
government health care plans,'' said U.S. Attorney Robert Mueller. 
</P>
<P>
	About 30,000 children are treated with growth hormones in the  
United States yearly, but the American Academy of Pediatrics 
recommends only limited use, such as for children who have hormone 
deficiencies or a rare chromosomal abnormality. 
</P>
<P>
	The $50 million penalty was first announced by Genentech last  
Friday as a proposed settlement. It will consist of a $30 million 
criminal fine and a $20 million civil penalty.

<HEADLINE> Dems Seek Campaign Funding Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democrats began a signature drive  
Wednesday aimed at forcing Republican leaders to allow a vote on 
legislation to overhaul campaign financing law. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Marty Meehan, D-Mass., said Democrats were resorting to the  
signature drive because ``it has become painfully clear that 
whoever is calling the shots for the Republican leadership has no 
intention of scheduling a vote'' this session. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the rarely used ``discharge petition'' procedure,  
supporters of a bill can force its consideration on the floor if 
they can come up with the signatures of a majority 218 members. 
</P>
<P>
	As of mid-afternoon Wednesday, the petition, started by a group  
of moderate Democrats called the ``Blue Dogs,'' had 150 signatures. 
Meehan's office said all were believed to be Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Meehan and Republican Rep. Christopher Shays of Connecticut are  
the chief sponsors of a campaign finance overhaul bill that last 
year overcame stiff resistance from the GOP leadership and passed 
252-179. Then-Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., agreed to allow a vote 
after a petition drive neared the 218 mark. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar Senate bill, sponsored by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz.,  
and Russell Feingold, D-Wis., had 52 supporters but, with little 
time left in the session, couldn't get the 60 votes needed to break 
a filibuster and bring it to a final vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Shays' office said new Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has  
promised to give them a vote this year but has not set a date. 
Hastert spokesman John Feehery said the speaker was thinking about 
holding the vote this fall after the House finishes work on the 
year 2000 spending bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's now or never,'' said House Democratic leader Dick  
Gephardt of Missouri. ``'Wait until August' is just another excuse 
for why the House won't pass campaign reform again this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ann McBride of Common Cause, a government finance watchdog, said  
Hastert knows the Shays-Meehan bill would pass if it gets a vote 
``and that is exactly what he is afraid of.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shays has not signed the petition, but urged his party to take  
swift action on the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be a colossal mistake for Republican members of  
Congress to allow themselves to be dragged to the altar kicking and 
screaming,'' Shays said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Shays-Meehan bill would ban federal ``soft money'' --  
unlimited and unregulated donations to political parties -- and 
would expand disclosure requirements. It also would restrict issue 
ads, which seek to influence elections under the guise of educating 
voters.

<HEADLINE> Intel Profits Rise 57 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Intel Corp. shares fell sharply this morning  
after the computer chip maker reported that first-quarter sales 
were slightly below forecasts and warned that future revenues could 
drop. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors focused on the sales figures instead of Intel's  
better-than-expected profit, which rose 57 percent in the quarter 
amid cost-cutting. The financial results, announced late Tuesday, 
had reassured some analysts that problems in the personal computer 
business may be mostly confined to its biggest chip customer, 
Compaq Computer Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	But Intel, whose chips supply the brainpower for 90 percent of  
the world's personal computers, expects second-quarter revenue to 
stay the same or fall slightly from its first-quarter revenue of 
$7.1 billion, citing ``seasonal factors'' in the microprocessor 
business. Some analysts had expected a slight increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel's stock price was down 6 percent in early trading,  
dropping $3.75 a share at $56.75. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, by beating profit expectations, Intel -- a bellwether for  
the rest of the PC industry -- apparently suggested Compaq's woes 
were confined to its own business. 
</P>
<P>
	The results ``suggest to me the rest of the industry is fine,''  
said David Wu, an analyst with ABN Amro in San Francisco. ``The 
news here really is there is no news.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., said it earned $2.0  
billion, or 57 cents a share, in the three months ended March 27. 
That was up from a profit of $1.27 billion, or 36 cents a share, in 
the year-ago quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel's per-share profit beat the expectations of analysts  
surveyed by First Call, who had been projecting 55 cents a share 
after accounting for a 2-for-1 stock split this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel also was helped by higher interest income and a lower tax  
rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue rose 18 percent to $7.1 billion from $6.0 billion in the  
year-ago quarter, a slightly less-than-expected increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel said first-quarter revenues were down 7 percent from the  
final quarter of 1998 due to a seasonal slowdown in PC sales. But 
year over year, the company was helped by strong demand for its 
range of new microprocessors, which supply the primary brainpower 
for computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel introduced its latest Pentium chips for personal computers  
and more powerful business machines this quarter. It also launched 
a faster Celeron chip for the fast-growing category of PCs costing 
less than $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel officials said the Celeron chips are starting to help the  
company take back some business from rival makers of chips for 
inexpensive PCs, such as Advanced Micro Devices. Reports show that 
consumers bought more computers at retail stores in the first two 
months of the year from AMD than Intel -- knocking the chip giant 
from the No. 1 spot for the first time.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Economists Urge Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Iraqi economists urged the government  
Wednesday to privatize some state industries as a way to jump-start 
the economy, which has been devastated by U.N. sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	The economists, mainly university professors, were nearly  
unanimous in arguing that Iraq's bloated socialist sector had to be 
drastically trimmed and passed over to private entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
	Their studies showed that while most government-owned industries  
have come to a grinding halt, private firms and utilities were 
still prospering, despite the sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	To achieve economic prosperity, ``the government has to reduce  
its role as a direct producer of non-strategic industries in favor 
of the private sector,'' economist Abdelghafur al-Attraqchi told a 
conference Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting was attended by several government ministers, and  
shadowed by yet another slump in the value of the dinar, which fell 
to a record low of 2,005 to the dollar, down from 1,995 last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Before sanctions were slapped on Iraq for invading Kuwait in  
1990, one dinar was officially worth more than $3. 
</P>
<P>
	Such criticism in the presence of senior government officials  
was daring, given the restrictions on expression of opinion in 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh assured the economists that  
the government was discussing the possibility of selling some state 
enterprises to the private sector. He did not elaborate, and joined 
the ministers of finance and planning in blaming U.N. sanctions for 
Iraq's economic woes. 
</P>
<P>
	The sanctions severely limit Iraq's oil sales. They are to  
remain in place until Baghdad rids itself of weapons of mass 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq's 1980-1988 war with Iran, the 1991 Gulf War over Kuwait  
and the continuing U.N. trade sanctions have depleted state coffers 
of foreign cash, the experts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers had few figures and indicators on which to base  
their observations. Iraq has long stopped issuing economic data.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Writing Another Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton is writing  
another book, this time detailing how she and President Clinton 
entertain guests at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The book, ``An Invitation to the White House,'' will be  
published by Simon &AMP; Schuster in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	According to a statement Wednesday by the publisher, Mrs.  
Clinton will discuss ``the challenges and pleasures'' of White 
House entertaining and showcase more than 20 events, from annual 
receptions, state dinners, private parties and Christmas 
gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton will work with two researchers and a senior editor.  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's other books were, ``It Takes a Village,'' about  
raising children, and ``Dear Socks, Dear Buddy: Kids' Letters to 
the First Pets,'' about the Clintons' cat and dog. 
</P>
<P>
	In keeping with her practice, Mrs. Clinton will donate the  
proceeds of the new book to charity, said Julie Mason, a 
spokeswoman for the first lady.

<HEADLINE> Romney Trims Salt Lake Games Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- When Mitt Romney took over the  
scandal-laden Salt Lake Olympics organization, he pledged to put 
the athletes first. 
</P>
<P>
	But it is the athletes -- specifically U.S. athletes -- who are  
the first to fear they are in jeopardy from his budget-paring, and 
that has put them, the U.S. Olympic Committee and Romney's Salt 
Lake Organizing Committee on a collision course. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC was to have taken over the Utah Winter Sports Park and the  
speedskating oval this week, but that has now been put off for 90 
days to give the differing parties time to seek a way out. 
</P>
<P>
	USOC vice president Sandy Baldwin on Tuesday said that will give  
the SLOC board a chance to digest the ramifications of $84 million 
in budget cuts proposed by Romney, including some $5 million for 
two key venues. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney says he's worried the scandal over how Salt Lake won the  
2002 Winter Games will make it hard for the SLOC and USOC to raise 
$300 million more needed from sponsors to fund the $1.45 billion 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney's proposed cuts are a hedge against a shortfall.  
</P>
<P>
	The $5 million amounts to about a third of the operating budget  
for the Utah Winter Sports Park, which has ski jumps, the 
bobsled-luge track and the Oquirrh Skating Oval -- the speedskating 
venue. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a cut could mean closing the venues for a long stretch,  
possibly a year, and that prospect has agitated USOC and athletes 
who learned of it from Romney last week. The athletes had been 
counting on training on the luge, jumps and oval until the 2002 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	``You shouldn't cut it when it deals with athletes,'' Baldwin  
said after a meeting Tuesday of SLOC's finance committee. ``If U.S. 
athletes do not do well in the 2002 Games, it will reflect on the 
games, and training is part of that,'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baldwin, who also is a member of the SLOC board's management  
committee, does not believe corporate sponsors will remain skittish 
enough to jeopardize the budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the magnitude of the cuts proposed is necessary  
at all,'' Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
	USOC and SLOC have a joint venture company, called the Olympic  
Properties of the United States, or OPUS, that is marketing the 
games to sponsors, with a USOC executive at the helm. 
</P>
<P>
	Several athletes attended Tuesday's meeting in a show of support  
for the USOC position and were relieved when Randy Dryer, executive 
director of the Utah Sports Authority, proposed putting the 
purchase of the sports park on hold. 
</P>
<P>
	The finance committee endorsed the delay, although the SLOC  
managers could have acted without the endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
	The sports authority built the park near Park City with taxpayer  
money. SLOC has agreed to turn it over to the state, along with $99 
million, after the games. The purchase price -- $59 million and a 
$40 million legacy -- was set by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	Dryer said he will ask the executive board of the sports  
authority to endorse the delay on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the next 90 days, either SLOC will be persuaded to make the  
cuts elsewhere or an alternative source for the $5 million will be 
found, said Dryer, who also serves on SLOC's management committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an issue for high-performance athletes and the community  
as well,'' Dryer said. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that tens of thousands of youngsters use the skating  
oval, and thousands of people have used the ski jumps and luge 
track at the Utah Winter Sports Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC-SLOC joint venture, OPUS, had a goal to raise $889  
million, including $550 million for SLOC, by Aug. 1. The date has 
been pushed back a year, to August 2000, with USOC marketing head 
John Krimsky putting the blame on the Salt Lake scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	However, former SLOC president Frank Joklik told a civic club  
Tuesday that organizers had been worried about a drop-off in 
corporate-sponsor signings before the scandal hit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We kept on receiving assurances the pace would pick up  
again,'' he said. ``There was considerable doubt about that as 
(1998) drew to a close -- even before the revelations of the 
bid-committee problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the joint venture still could raise the $300 million  
needed to balance the budget. ``It seems like a doable endeavor, 
but will require very, very hard work,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In another development Tuesday, SLOC chairman Robert Garff said  
Bennie Smith Jr., who was instrumental in the Salt Lake bid 
committee's wooing of African IOC members, has resigned from SLOC 
and from the board of the Utah Athletic Foundation, which is to 
operate the sports park after the Games. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Smith, in a letter to him on April 7, cited ill health  
and a desire to spend more time with his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith did return a call.  
</P>
<P>
	Garff said that while the bribery scandal was being  
investigated, Smith ``fought to stay on the board during that 
controversial period because he wanted his name cleared.'' SLOC's 
ethics panel found no wrongdoing by Smith.

<HEADLINE> Former Prince To Re-Record Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Even for a notorious control freak, the Artist  
Formerly Known as Prince is planning a pretty audacious challenge 
to his old record company. 
</P>
<P>
	Unhappy at his failure to gain possession of the music he  
recorded for Warner Bros., the Artist said he will re-record the 
music and sell it on his own. 
</P>
<P>
	That's everything. ``Purple Rain,'' ``Little Red Corvette,''  
``Raspberry Beret, ``Kiss,'' the whole catalogue. He recorded 17 
albums for Warners beginning in 1978 when he was seen as a teen-age 
prodigy until their nasty divorce five years ago, not including a 
greatest hits package. 
</P>
<P>
	Re-creating the music shouldn't be much of a problem. That's  
because on most of the records he played all the instruments 
himself and provided all the vocals, the Artist said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fleetwood Mac would be hard-pressed to do something like  
this,'' he said. ``The only people I would have to argue with are 
the people in my head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's not discouraging anyone from buying his old records; he  
still gets paid when that happens. But he gets paid a lot more if 
he sells them himself, and he wants to own recordings of the music 
which made his name -- before he changed it, of course. 
</P>
<P>
	He has repeatedly made known his interest in obtaining the  
rights to his own master recordings, said Bob Merlis, a spokesman 
for Warner Bros. Records. That doesn't mean there have been any 
negotiations toward that end. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll always talk to somebody,'' Merlis said. ``It's extremely  
unlikely that we will ever give an artist, with no compensation, 
original works that were sold to us under a valid contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Re-recording material isn't unprecedented; Chuck Berry and Jerry  
Lee Lewis did it when they switched record companies in the early 
days of rock 'n' roll, Merlis said. But it's unusual today, and 
most contracts with artists prohibit such re-recording for a set 
period of time. He wouldn't comment on The Artist's contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be interested to hear what it sounded like,'' Merlis  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before last New Year's Eve, Warner Bros. distributed to  
radio stations a single version of Prince's song, ``1999,'' that 
was originally released in 1982, sparking some renewed sales. The 
Artist responded by re-recording the song in several different 
versions and selling the CD via his Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	But that was just one song -- not hundreds.  
</P>
<P>
	The Artist insists that much of his early material will sound  
better when redone since recording technology has improved. He 
won't say whether he will be faithful to the old versions or if he 
will tweak them. He gave no timetable for their release. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most artists lose their voice, their hair and their bands,''  
the 40-year-old singer said. ``That's not going to happen to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The workaholic songwriter said he's composing an opera,  
presumably in his spare time. He's also making another studio 
album, and in another departure from his work habits, he is 
allowing other producers to work on his music, and is writing songs 
with others. 
</P>
<P>
	He won't identify the collaborators, other than to say, ``I'm  
working with some people you wouldn't expect me to be working 
with.'' They might even remain unidentified on the final release 
due to contractual issues. 
</P>
<P>
	And how will the strong-willed Artist deal with it when a  
collaborator disagrees with him on how something sounds? 
</P>
<P>
	``They know it's my album,'' he said. ``They're going to give me  
the last word.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since leaving Warner Bros., the Artist briefly had a  
distribution deal with EMI. Most recently, he's been selling his 
music primarily through orders placed to his Web site, including 
last year's box set, ``Crystal Ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he's likely to work out a deal with a major label to  
release his next album. He said he has no problem working with a 
big label. ``What I had a problem with is ownership of the work 
when I was finished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Re-recording would be the latest salvo in his decade-long feud  
with Warners. It was that feud that led to him scrawling ``slave'' 
on his face during some performances, and to legally changing his 
name to an unpronounceable symbol. While he has his own typically 
eccentric spin, he's also a model for the growing trend of 
musicians taking control of their business affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	His ``freedom'' mantra is actually consistent with the unusual  
announcement that he had renewed his vows with his wife, Mayte, in 
February. He said they wanted to ``transcend'' their marriage 
without the encumbrance of a legal contract. But he stressed that 
he and his wife, a former dancer whom he married in 1996, did not 
get a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	His album sales have steadily tumbled since ``Purple Rain'' sold  
12 million. That's not unexpected, since few musicians stay on top 
for so long. But his decision to stand apart from the traditional 
record business machinery also probably ensures that his hitmaking 
days are over. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he's much happier now.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's more fun for me because you can actually see the  
difference in the music,'' he said. ``You can feel the freedom in 
the air when you're like that and you're not thinking about 
anything like what is the next single or how can I make my image 
look good for the video. 
</P>
<P>
	``All that stuff is in your head whether you're thinking about  
it or not.''

<HEADLINE> Comparing Starr's Testimony </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Some comparisons between Starr's congressional appearances:  
</P>
<P>
	THEN: Nov. 19, 1998. Starr testified before the House Judiciary  
Committee, which was considering grounds for impeaching President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	NOW: April 14, 1999. Starr's audience was the Senate  
Governmental Affairs Committee, which is deciding whether to seek 
renewal of the Independent Counsel Act or let the law expire June 
30. 
</P>
<P>
	 *----	 
</P>
<P>
	THEN: Committee Democrats, who had demanded Starr's appearance  
at the impeachment hearing, grilled him for hours about how his 
staff treated Monica Lewinsky, grand jury leaks, his private law 
clients and other matters. 
</P>
<P>
	NOW: Starr stunned Democrats by calling for the abolition of the  
Independent Counsel statute. Said Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.: 
``If you live long enough, you'll experience everything. I never 
expected to be sharing that judgment with you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *----	 
</P>
<P>
	THEN: Starr defended his work, saying his investigations led to  
convictions of 14 people, including Webster Hubbell and former 
Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
	``This office has achieved a superb record in courts of law -- of  
significant and hard-fought convictions, of fair and wise decisions 
not to charge, of thorough and accurate reports. ... We are 
officers of the court who live in the world of the law. We have 
presented our cases in court, and with very rare exception, we have 
won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NOW: Starr continues to defend his work, including the many  
expansions of his investigation of the president: ``The number of 
expansions is unique, and it may have fed the misconception that we 
were investigating individuals rather than outcomes. Let me make 
clear: That was not the case. Indeed, I am as proud of our 
decisions not to bring several indictments as I am of anything else 
we have done.''

<HEADLINE> Utah Delays Sale of Sports Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Utah Sports Authority's executive  
committee agreed Wednesday to delay the sale of a sports park to 
Olympic organizers who are slashing budgets in the wake of the 
bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Utah Winter Sports Park near Park City, the site for ski  
jumping, bobsled and luge events, had been scheduled for sale to 
the Salt Lake Organizing Committee on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	But if the governor signs off on the 90-day delay on Thursday  
morning as expected, the deal will not close until mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the SLOC board's management committee will  
consider $84 million in budget cuts proposed by management, 
including $5 million for the operation of the sports park and the 
speedskating oval at Kearns. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed cuts ``created a cloud of uncertainty. It may or  
may not become a problem,'' said Randy Dryer, chairman of the 
sports authority. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletes and the U.S. Olympic Committee were peeved by the  
revelation during a closed-door meeting last week that a third of 
the venues' operations budget, or about $5 million, could be 
sliced. 
</P>
<P>
	Athletes had counted on the venues to train for the 2002 Winter  
Games, and a cut of that size likely would mean closing the sports 
park for some time. The oval is already closed until 2000 so a roof 
can be built. 
</P>
<P>
	USOC vice president Sandy Baldwin said Tuesday she doesn't  
believe the SLOC needs to make such big budget cuts and that 
athletic venues shouldn't suffer. 
</P>
<P>
	New SLOC president Mitt Romney fears scandal-weary corporate  
sponsors will boycott the games, jeopardizing the remaining $300 
million needed to finance the $1.45 billion budget. He wants $84 
million in cuts as a hedge against a shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
	The marketing company selling sponsorships has not had much luck  
since investigations this winter showed Salt Lake's bidders for the 
games wooed International Olympic Committee members with $1.2 
million in cash, scholarships, vacations, medical care and shopping 
sprees, 
</P>
<P>
	Dryer said Wednesday the agreement with the SLOC does not  
require Olympic organizers to spend a certain amount of money 
operating the park. However, it does spell out that the SLOC will 
assume responsibility for the sports park's 20 employees and 
existing programs. 
</P>
<P>
	It would be hard to carry on the sports programs if the park was  
closed, Dryer said. ``We have whatever legal remedies there are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC, like the sports authority, doesn't want to close the  
park and will do so only if there is no option, Dryer said. He's an 
ex-officio member of the SLOC board's management committee. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 90-day delay, the SLOC will operate the park as its  
owner and will assume all liability and the $200,000 to $300,000 
operation costs. According to the measure approved by the sports 
authority's executive committee on Wednesday, the delay cannot be 
extended. 
</P>
<P>
	That provision was sought by Utah Senate President Lane Beattie  
and House Majority Leader Marty Stephens. The two share a seat on 
the SLOC management committee, a post created when the SLOC was 
reorganized amid the scandal in February.

<HEADLINE> 3 Children Drown in Fla. Van Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Trapped in a van filling with murky  
water, Michael Ellis watched helplessly as his brother's three 
children struggled against their seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis managed to wriggle out of his restraints and get out  
through an open window as the water poured in. His brother, Trevor 
Ellis, and passers-by yanked him to safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't help any of the children,'' Michael Ellis said  
Tuesday, recalling the weekend accident. ``I tried but I couldn't 
because of the seat belt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trevor Ellis and passing motorists also couldn't reach his  
trapped children, 15-year-old Dean, 12-year-old Fiona and 
7-year-old Andrew. All three drowned. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was it,'' said Trevor Ellis, a minister at First Apostle  
Assembly Church of Pahokee. ``We couldn't get anybody else out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The children had watched their father preach his Sunday sermon  
and were catching a ride home with their uncle when a tire on the 
van blew out and the vehicle plunged into a canal off State Road 
80. 
</P>
<P>
	Trevor Ellis, 37, saw it all in his rearview mirror.  
</P>
<P>
	``I heard a little sound behind me. I saw pieces of the tire  
flying,'' said Ellis, who was riding in a car with his wife ahead 
of the van. ``I knew he had a blowout. I saw the van swing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no guardrail at the accident site, about 40 miles west  
of West Palm Beach, where the family lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I kicked my boots off and jumped in the water. The van just  
went down so, so fast,'' Trevor Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
	A tow truck pulled the van out 40 minutes after it went under.  
</P>
<P>
	Trevor Ellis' wife, Esther, lost her only son, Andrew, in the  
crash. The other children were from her husband's previous 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know they're at a better place,'' she said. ``God is giving  
me the strength to go on in order that one day I can see them 
again.''

<HEADLINE> Woman Helps Resolve Hostage Ordeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HIGHLAND, Ind. (AP) -- When a frightened bank robbery suspect  
holed up in her living room, Evelyn Wojas didn't panic. In fact, 
she comforted the tearful man through a three-hour police standoff 
and helped him surrender. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was probably the calmest person I've ever had to deal  
with (in a hostage situation),'' said Edward Davies, deputy 
commander of the Lake County Sheriff's Department and a veteran 
hostage negotiator. 
</P>
<P>
	Wojas, a 61-year-old grandmother, was not hurt.  
</P>
<P>
	``The more I was with him, the more I felt sorry for him,'' she  
said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wojas was in her basement Monday afternoon when she heard a  
commotion overhead. Thinking an animal had gotten in the house, she 
grabbed a broom to shoo it away. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, she found a man later identified as Christopher Forte,  
who police said had just robbed Lake Federal Savings and Loan. 
</P>
<P>
	Wojas said she tried to dash upstairs, but Forte pulled her  
back. She said he made her sit on a table but was very polite and 
didn't threaten her. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, tactical officers arrived, evacuating people from  
nearby houses. 
</P>
<P>
	During the ensuing hours, Forte cried, telephoned his  
girlfriend, worried he would be shot by police and spoke of 
suicide, Wojas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, police persuaded him to surrender. Wojas walked out  
first, followed by Forte. 
</P>
<P>
	Forte, 28, of Omaha, Neb., who told authorities his real name is  
Shanti Giombetti, was charged Tuesday with bank robbery, taking a 
hostage and carrying a firearm during a violent crime. He faces up 
to 37 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.

<HEADLINE> Report: Yugoslavs Attack Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Refugees fleeing Kosovo are reporting to  
relief workers that Yugoslav helicopters and airplanes have been 
attacking refugee convoys in the Serbian province, a Pentagon 
official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon said it had ``no direct evidence'' that an attack  
on a convoy today, in which 64 civilians were killed, was committed 
by the Yugoslavs, although NATO has known for some time that 
Yugoslav warplanes have been attacking Kosovo Liberation Army 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbs claimed that the convoy was hit by NATO bombs, but  
Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said NATO planes hit only military 
targets. ``We did hit military vehicles in a convoy,'' he said. 
``We are quite sure we hit only military vehicles. We will 
obviously review what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said officials had heard for the first time today, through  
relief organizations in the area, that refugees entering Albania 
were saying Yugoslav planes had attacked civilian convoys. 
</P>
<P>
	He described these as ``preliminary reports that may or may not  
be correct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, President Clinton is expected to call up thousands of  
military reserves to support a major buildup of NATO air power as 
strikes against Yugoslavia target more Serb troops hunkered down in 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Bacon said today that ``several thousand'' reservists likely  
would be ordered to active duty. He would not be more specific, and 
said Defense Secretary William Cohen had not yet made his formal 
recommendation to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration, preparing for an extended air  
campaign now that three weeks of bombing has failed to halt the 
Serb war on ethnic Albanians, also will seek emergency money from 
Congress for the NATO operation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon said it could be $3 billion to $4 billion, but  
congressional estimates say $5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are taking our allied air campaign to the next level,''  
Clinton said Tuesday after asking members of Congress to give the 
NATO attack more time to smash Serb forces instead of pushing for 
consideration of sending U.S. ground troops into Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Most lawmakers appeared to listen, but they also said NATO  
airstrikes hadn't damaged Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's 
military as much as hoped, according to briefings they received 
from Defense Secretary William Cohen and Army Gen. Henry Shelton, 
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're disappointed there hasn't been more done,'' said Sen.  
Dick Lugar, R-Ind. ``General Shelton, Secretary Cohen, they're all 
disappointed about this too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said, ``The bombing  
itself has not had the impact I would have liked it to have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., said Milosevic  
must contend with a new factor: ``He now has an Albanian guerrilla 
force in the country, sometimes just over the border, that he 
didn't have before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Interviewed today on ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' Gephardt  
said, ``If we will stay unified and keep our resolve ... we can get 
this done without ground troops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a candidate for the presidency, who  
advocates preparing for a ground war against Milosevic, told ABC: 
``If we can't prevail here, then there will be very few places in 
the world where we can prevail. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, the lawmakers said, urged patience and emphasized that  
the air bombardment of Iraq during the Persian Gulf War in 1991 
took 44 days. In that case, however, it also took a 100-hour ground 
war to end the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon is preparing to add 300 warplanes to NATO's air  
forces at the request of the NATO commander, Army Gen. Wesley 
Clark. Now, nearly 500 U.S. aircraft and 200 allied planes are 
involved. Cohen is expected soon to approve deploying all or most 
of the 300 American aircraft, defense officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. reinforcements, which could include A-10 ``tank  
killers'' as well as F-15 and F-16 jet-fighters, would boost NATO's 
ability to attack ground troops, artillery and air defense sites. 
More refueling tankers will keep planes in the air longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said NATO aircraft are flying  
day and night now, but Clark ``would like to fly more intensively 
... to basically apply more pressure. A lot of what he's asking for 
will be targeted against units operating in Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO is flying 450 to 500 sorties a day, as much as triple the  
number over Yugoslavia in the early days of the airstrikes, which 
began March 24, with persistent rain and clouds hampering flights 
and interfering with laser-guided bombs. 
</P>
<P>
	The extra air power likely would require calling up military  
reservists, Bacon said, although he didn't know how many would be 
needed or when it might happen. 
</P>
<P>
	Several hundred Air National Guard members already are  
participating as volunteers in addition to about 22,000 active-duty 
U.S. forces involved in NATO operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Air Force refueling aircraft are operated by members of the  
Air National Guard. Nine Air Guard refueling wings from nine states 
are now participating in the NATO missions with KC-135 refueling 
units from five Air Force Reserve wings in five states. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest recent mobilization of reserves was for the 1991  
Gulf War, when about 230,000 from the Army, Air Force, Navy and 
Marine Corps were called to active duty. 
</P>
<P>
	The Army also may need to mobilize National Guard and Reserve  
members as part of Task Force Hawk, the contingent of Apache attack 
helicopters and surface-to-surface missiles being assembled in 
Albania to hit Serb tanks and armored forces in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles Wald, a strategic planner for the  
Joint Chiefs of Staff, said all 24 Apaches and 26 support 
helicopters, plus some 2,600 U.S. troops and equipment, were 
expected to be in and around Tirana, Albania, by week's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Wald said Serb forces were ``hunkered down'' in Kosovo, short of  
fuel following allied attacks on oil refineries, storage sites and 
fuel trucks, and unable to use dozens of roads, bridges and rail 
lines destroyed by NATO. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Serbs remained an effective force against Kosovar  
Albanians, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb air defenses also remained a threat despite heavy NATO hits  
on radar and command links because of built-in redundancies 
throughout Yugoslavia, Wald said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would consider it just as dangerous as on Day One,'' Wald  
said.

<HEADLINE> Buzz Owner Named in Sex Complaint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Salt Lake Buzz owner Joe Buzas, his minor  
league baseball team and its parent organization were named in a 
sexual harassment complaint filed in federal court by an Indiana 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Heather L. Alwine of Fort Wayne, Ind., claims her rejection of  
the 80-year-old Buzas' advances cost her jobs with the Buzz and its 
parent club, the Minnesota Twins. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaint, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Salt  
Lake, seeks unspecified damages and ``declaratory and injunctive 
relief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Submission to, or toleration of, Buzas' advances was made a  
condition of Ms. Alwine's employment, and when she firmly declined 
she was punished by, among other things, no longer being considered 
for a position with the Salt Lake Buzz,'' the complaint reads. 
</P>
<P>
	Alwine's lawyer, Larry Jenkins, said his client was not  
seriously considered for the Buzz's general manager position 
because she refused to ``play along'' in a series of confrontations 
with Buzas. 
</P>
<P>
	``She feels her rights were violated,'' Jenkins said.  
</P>
<P>
	Buzz spokesman Tony Reyna said Buzas and the team would have no  
comment until Buzas had read the complaint. Buzas scheduled a news 
conference for Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Twins assistant media relations manager Brad Smith said the team  
also would have no immediate comment on the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenkins described the Twins' role in the complaint as ``minor.''  
</P>
<P>
	The complaint claims Alwine raised the issue of Buzas' alleged  
advances with Twins vice president and assistant general manager 
Bill Smith. The complaint says Smith told Alwine he would address 
the issue with Buzas and also help her seek employment within the 
Minnesota organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Alwine later received a form letter from the Twins which said  
the team had no position for her. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's an inference they didn't want to deal with her because  
she's a troublemaker,'' Jenkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	A career minor-league owner, Buzas has operated at least one  
minor league franchise -- sometimes as many as three -- in each of 
the past 43 summers. He played briefly for the New York Yankees in 
1945 and managed in the Puerto Rican winter leagues during the '40s 
and '50s. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenkins said his investigation into the Buzz office climate  
revealed what he alleged was a pattern of behavior by Buzas. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's plenty of other stones we need to overturn, but we did  
enough to feel confident in the charges,'' Jenkins said. ``It does 
appear she's not the only one who's been subjected to similar 
treatment.'' 
</P>

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Long-term Treasury bonds fell Wednesday as a  
large supply of notes from mortgage financer Freddie Mac headed to 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 7/32  
point, or $2.19 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, rose to 5.51 percent from 5.49 percent 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading stayed in a narrow range Wednesday, without any major  
economic data to move the market. Traders focused instead on 
Freddie Mac's sale of an additional $3 billion of an existing 
five-year note. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities  
were modestly lower, falling just 1/16, and intermediate maturities 
were down 1/8 point to 3/16 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.27 percent as the  
discount rose 0.01 percentage point from Tuesday to 4.17 percent. 
Six-month yields were 4.49 percent, as the discount rose 0.01 
percentage point to 4.33 percent. One-year yields were 4.62 percent 
as the discount held steady at Tuesday's late rate of 4.41 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 4.81 percent from 4.63 percent late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell 7/32 point to 124 21/32. The average 
yield to maturity was unchanged from Tuesday's close, at 5.21 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Hog Farmers Hope To Force Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hog farmers who want to stop paying federally  
mandated promotion fees when they sell their livestock say they 
have gathered enough signatures to force a vote on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhonda Perry, an organizer for the Campaign for Family Farms,  
said the group would announce at a Thursday news conference in Des 
Moines, Iowa, that they have 16,500 signatures -- more than the 
14,986 required by the Agriculture Department to call for a 
referendum on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The signatures, which must represent 15 percent of all hog  
producers and importers, must still be verified by federal 
officials before a referendum can be set, but Perry and others said 
they were confident. 
</P>
<P>
	``To end up with 2,000 more I think says something,'' Perry  
said, adding that the group would submit the signatures to USDA 
early next month. ``There is a lot of opposition to a program that 
has absolutely no accountability to the people who are paying for 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Petitioners would like USDA to hold a referendum in 60 to 90  
days. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA spokesman Andy Solomon said the law provides no specific  
timetable for setting a referendum after signatures have been 
verified. A referendum would be decided by a simple majority vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The fee, called the checkoff program, requires pork producers to  
pay 45 cents for every $100 of animal value. 
</P>
<P>
	The money goes to the quasi-governmental National Pork Board,  
which contracts promotion services through the National Pork 
Producers Council, a trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	An audit released last week by the Agriculture Department's  
inspector general said the pork board was too closely tied to the 
industry group and recommended that it take steps to separate. The 
audit found no evidence, however, that the pork board had misused 
checkoff dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Perry and others contend producers get very little for  
the millions they pay each year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're a business person and you continue to throw money  
into a program in which your business does not see a return on 
investment, people would say you're a bad manager,'' Perry said. 
``In agriculture, that's called a mandatory checkoff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hog farmers have been especially stressed this year as an  
oversupply dropped prices to their lowest level in four decades. 
They also point to the disparity between the prices producers are 
getting and what retailers are charging consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Cattle producers are considering a similar effort to force a  
vote on checkoff fees.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Yank Howe Barred From Coaching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITEFISH, Mont. (AP) -- Former New York Yankees pitcher Steve  
Howe's ban from a volunteer coaching position with a girls' 
softball team because of his past history of drug abuse was upheld 
by the Whitefish School Board Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The action supported the decision of Superintendent Dave Peters  
to bar Howe, 41, whose daughter, Chelsi, is a sophomore on the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a crowd that came to the board meeting to support Howe,  
board members said they were unwilling to second-guess Peters' 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Howe, a former National League Rookie of the Year and 13-year  
veteran of the major leagues, was suspended several times for 
violating Major League Baseball's substance abuse policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steve Howe is a really great coach, and (my daughter) thinks  
his participation would help the girls in a big way,'' said the 
mother of one player. 
</P>
<P>
	Barb Barker, president of the Whitefish Softball Association,  
requested that the board put the Howe matter on a future agenda, 
offering an opportunity for all sides to make their cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``As parents, we're just tickled to death when our kids get a  
coach who can teach,'' Barker said. ``Steve Howe would like to be a 
volunteer so he can teach. Please let him teach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Board chairman David Fern, however, stressed that the board  
would only revisit Peters' decision if it appeared school district 
policy had been breached. 
</P>
<P>
	In this case, he said, policy was clear and had been followed  
properly. 
</P>
<P>
	Fern said district policy calls for background checks on  
volunteers associated with the school, and if those background 
checks reveal concerns, the superintendent has the right to deny 
the volunteer's request. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can make a mistake in life, and these young ladies will,''  
said softball association member Terry Fennessy. ``But you can pay 
restitution and move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The danger, she said, is that the girls learn that a mistake  
once made ``will haunt them the rest of their lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Board member Leo Tracy said Howe took to the field even after  
Peters ordered him not to, and he referred to what he described as 
Howe's ``unwavering defiance of authority'' and ``incredible 
ability to use bad judgment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howe did not attend the hearing to respond to Tracy's comments  
and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new policy says check the background,'' Fern said. ``So  
it's time to check everyone. What we' re trying to do with this 
policy is to avoid the subjectivity. Subjectivity undermines the 
policy process. We have to represent the philosophy of the board, 
the district policy and the state and federal laws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Tuesday's decision make both policy and intent clear.  
</P>
<P>
	``Steve Howe has no job with us. Period. Can he apply again?  
Sure. That's up to him.''

<HEADLINE> War Crimes Suspects Said in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Two men suspected of war crimes in Bosnia and  
Croatia are now involved in Yugoslavia's oppression of ethnic 
Albanians in Kosovo, Britain's defense secretary said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's regime has recruited  
Gen. Ratko Mladic and paramilitary leader Zeljko Raznatovic, also 
known as Arkan, to command and supply units responsible for 
``massacring and raping'' thousands of ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, 
Defense Secretary George Robertson told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Robertson said that Arkan, whose Tiger commandos were active  
during the Croatian and Bosnian wars, stands indicted by the war 
crimes tribunal in The Hague in the 1991 massacre of 250 men taken 
from a hospital in Vukovar during Croatia's war for independence 
from Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the tribunal's chief prosecutor, Louise Arbour, has  
previously acknowledged Arkan's indictment, no detail on the actual 
charges had been released before now. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have further evidence that Arkan is recruiting volunteers  
for his paramilitary unit, the Tigers,'' Robertson said. ``We 
understand that he's even been scouring prisons in Serbia, offering 
pardons to anyone prepared to join the Tigers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The defense chief said that Mladic, whom he noted was accused of  
involvement in the slaughter of thousands of men in the Bosnian 
enclave of Srebrenica, is now commanding a gang of paramilitaries 
in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, we cannot know definitively what is going on inside  
Kosovo today, because it is closed off to those who might give 
independent evidence, but you only have to listen to the 
refugees,'' he later told the British Broadcasting Corp. in a radio 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told the House of  
Commons on Wednesday that NATO peacekeeping troops could be sent 
into Kosovo without the agreement of the Yugoslav government, if 
Serb resistance on the ground had effectively ended. 
</P>
<P>
	But he reiterated that NATO had no plans to launch a ground war  
against the military and police forces in Kosovo, a province in 
Yugoslavia's dominant republic, Serbia.

<HEADLINE> Report: Nissan Faces Big Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Nissan Motor Co., Japan's second biggest automaker,  
lost substantially more than it had expected last fiscal year and 
its chairman is expected to resign as a result, the Yomiuri 
newspaper reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	But a Nissan spokeswoman said the report was speculative. She  
said the company is putting together its earnings results for the 
latest fiscal year and no final numbers are available. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said Nissan lost more than 30 billion yen, or $252  
million, in the fiscal year ended March 31, three times more than 
10 billion yen loss projected for the year in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan Chairman Yoshifumi Tsuji was expected to resign to take  
responsibility for the unexpectedly large loss and a restructuring 
effort designed to resuscitate the troubled automaker, the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss resulted from sluggish domestic sales which eroded  
operating profit, along with special losses from Nissan's 
securities portfolio and aid extended to affiliated dealerships, 
the paper reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper also reported that Nissan may either slash its  
dividend payments or forego them entirely. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Wednesday, a spokesman for Nissan said the company's North  
American operations are likely to have posted a profit in fiscal 
1998 for the first time in two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Renault SA of France agreed to pay $5.4 billion for  
a 36.8 percent stake in debt-hobbled Nissan.

<HEADLINE> Food, Parties Mark Taxation Ritual </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For millions of procrastinating Americans,  
it's time to face the music: Income tax returns must be postmarked 
or filed electronically by midnight Thursday, and that's expected 
to mean 40 million last-minute state and federal returns. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of larger post offices around the country will be open  
late to accommodate the crush, many of the biggest until midnight 
local time. And taxpayers who file electronically have until the 
last minute to zap their returns to the Internal Revenue Service. 
</P>
<P>
	A reminder: If you can't finish in time, file for an extension  
using Form 4868 and pay the IRS as much of your estimated bill as 
possible to avoid interest and penalties. You can also pay by 
MasterCard, American Express or Discover card by calling 
1-888-2PAYTAX -- for a 2.5 percent fee. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS expects to receive 126 million individual income tax  
returns this year, with total income taxes projected at $828.6 
billion. That's just under half the $1.7 trillion in overall 
federal tax collections used to pay for everything from cruise 
missiles to highway bridges to food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
	Working people pay more in U.S. taxes than over 40,000  
foreign-controlled corporations operating in this country. The 
General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, 
reported Wednesday that tax loopholes allowed a majority of those 
companies to escape any taxes in 1995 -- an amount estimated at $35 
billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of citizenship here, but these corporations are  
getting by in many cases with a free ride,'' said Sen. Byron 
Dorgan, D-N.D., who released the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, mainly because of new child and education credits,  
Americans are enjoying much larger refunds at $1,563 on average, or 
15 percent above last year. And they've used computers to 
electronically file 21.1 million returns, almost 24 percent more 
than last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But the jury is still out on whether the much-publicized IRS  
reform law is making the agency treat taxpayers better. Senate 
Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, whose hearings last year 
helped spark the reforms, said he believes only about 20 percent of 
all IRS employees support the changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Typically, a bureaucracy will say, 'We'll just wait it out,'''  
said Roth, R-Del. ``We're talking about changing attitudes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti, however, told the Finance  
Committee on Wednesday about key changes. They include a new 
service-oriented mission statement, ways to rate employees that 
don't include enforcement quotas and a reorganization to create 
four separate operations aimed at individual taxpayers, small 
businesses, large corporations and tax-exempt entities. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's very little doubt that real change is occurring,''  
said Rossotti, who has been in office 17 months. ``We have only 
just begun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most individual taxpayers probably won't have any contact with  
the IRS after they've sent in their forms. But for those who can't 
pay, these changes in attitude will be put to the test. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRS has relaxed its ``offer-in-compromise'' program to let  
more taxpayers negotiate a lower settlement of their tax bill. 
Rossotti promised the new rules would prevent a duplication of last 
year's 80,000 rejections out of 105,000 offers. 
</P>
<P>
	Installment agreements are also easier to get. In almost all  
cases, the IRS will now automatically accept a request for an 
installment plan -- attach Form 9465 to your return to request one -- 
as long as the amount owed is $25,000 or less and they agree to pay 
within five years. 
</P>
<P>
	More and more people are depending on a professional tax  
preparer to do their taxes -- an estimated 61 million returns this 
year. One big reason is the tax code's complexity, which Congress 
increased the past two years with more than 1,200 tax law changes. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear if taxpayers will have to deal with more changes  
next year. Congressional Republicans are pushing through budget 
blueprints that call for some $800 billion in tax relief over the 
next decade, but there is very little money for tax cuts in fiscal 
2000 alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet anti-tax sentiment continues to run high on Capitol Hill.  
Coinciding with Thursday's tax deadline, the House plans debate for 
the fifth year in a row on a proposed constitutional amendment 
requiring a two-thirds vote of Congress to pass most tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
	It has no chance of passing.  
</P>
<P>
	``Over the long haul, people will focus on this,'' said Rep. Joe  
Barton, R-Texas, the main sponsor. ``It may not happen this week, 
but we're keeping the issue alive.''

	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Lucent Technologies plans to build a

optical networking products. 
</P>
<P>
	The 120,000-square-foot facility is to be staffed by 500  
employees when it opens next spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Cisco Systems and Nortel Networks, two of Lucent's main rivals

<P>
	The Lucent facility will focus on optical networking, which uses  
ultra-thin strands of glass fiber to transmit voices, video and 
data with a beam of light. Optical fiber can carry far more 
information hundreds of times faster than traditional phone lines 
made of copper. 
</P>
<P>
	``Optical technology will be as important to the 21st century as  
electricity was to the 20th century,'' said Gerry Butters, 
president of Lucent's Optical Networking Group.

<HEADLINE> Brand Set To Leave Duke For NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- After leading Duke to the Final Four, center  
Elton Brand, the consensus national college basketball player of 
the year, may be leading a bevy of departures from the Blue Devils. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand and associate head basketball coach Johnny Dawkins  
scheduled a 2 p.m. news conference today to announce whether the 
6-foot-8, 270-pound sophomore center will leave Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand has an unlisted phone number and could not be reached for  
comment Tuesday. Dawkins did not return a call to his office. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand averaged 17.8 points and 9.8 rebounds this past season and  
was the main cog in a Blue Devil machine that racked up a 37-2 
record and made it to the NCAA championship game, which Duke lost 
to Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the first sophomore to win the John R. Wooden Award,  
presented by the Los Angeles Athletic Club to college basketball's 
top player. Brand also was honored this season by The Associated 
Press, the Atlanta Tipoff Club and the United States Basketball 
Writers Association as national player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Some observers of the game said Brand's expected announcement  
could lead sophomore Will Avery and freshman Corey Maggette to join 
the underclassmen jumping to the pros. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery's mother said she and her son met Friday with coach Mike  
Krzyzewski at his home, where he is recovering from hip surgery, to 
discuss Avery's pro prospects. Terry Simonton said her son is 
leaning toward staying in school next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we talked to him, we were staying,'' she told The News &AMP;  
Observer of Raleigh. ``But K said it wasn't a decision that has to 
be rushed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no answer Tuesday at an Augusta, Ga., telephone  
listing in Simonton's name. 
</P>
<P>
	Simonton said she was irked by a report in the Duke student  
newspaper Monday that Avery was considering leaving the Blue Devils 
partly because of poor grades. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing wrong with Will's grades,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Underclassmen have until May 15 to announce their intentions.

<HEADLINE> Gingrich Returns to Center Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After months on the sidelines, former House  
Speaker Newt Gingrich returned to center stage in the nation's 
capital Wednesday to raise money for his new political action 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I left the Capitol with an extraordinary sense of happiness,''  
Gingrich told the crowd, which greeted him with three standing 
ovations. ``As a visionary and a strategist and a teacher, I 
carried us as far as I could.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Entering the dining room where more than 500 guests had  
assembled, Gingrich smiled as he basked in the adoration of 
well-wishers, television cameras charting his every move. ``It's 
fun,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dinner, expected to take in more than $500,000, marked  
Gingrich's re-entry into political life after his abrupt 
resignation from the House last November. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was a major transitional figure making his own  
transition,'' said Rep. J.D. Hayworth, R-Ariz. ``We haven't heard 
the last of Speaker Gingrich. History isn't finished with him. Nor 
is he finished with history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gingrich also is setting up a consulting firm but is banned from  
lobbying his former colleagues until January. 
</P>
<P>
	A prolific fund-raiser, Gingrich remains a powerful figure in  
the Republican Party, which he brought to majority status in the 
House in 1994 for the first time in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``His network is still there,'' said Colgate University  
political science professor Michael Johnston. ``He's got the 
biggest Rolodex in Washington after Bill Clinton. Think of all the 
connections he's got.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guests Wednesday night included all of the House Republican  
leaders, led by the man who succeeded him as speaker, Dennis 
Hastert of Illinois. Also attending were Sen. Connie Mack of 
Florida, Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, and Bill Bennett, a former 
education secretary and drug policy coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	Lobbyists serving as co-chairmen of the event included former  
Rep. Vin Weber, who represents AT&AMP;T and Microsoft, and former 
Republican National Chairman Haley Barbour, whose clients include 
CBS and tobacco and food giant Philip Morris. 
</P>

	``You don't forget somebody the day after that somebody is no

<P>
	Gingrich's new PAC will provide financial assistance to  
Republicans who share the former speaker's desires to cap federal, 
state and local taxes at 25 percent of a person's income, use some 
Social Security funds for private investment accounts and build a 
national missile defense, said former Gingrich aide Mike Shields.

Gingrich's favorite charities, the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation.

<HEADLINE> Ford To Keep Producing Escort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- With U.S. sales of its subcompact Escort still  
strong, Ford Motor Co. has decided to delay its demise and continue 
producing it alongside its new Focus sedan and wagon. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford had planned to end production of the Escort in June as it  
retooled its plants in Wayne, near Detroit, and Hermosillo, Mexico, 
for the 2000 Focus. Instead, the No. 2 automaker will consolidate 
production of the Escort sedan and ZX2 coupe at Hermosillo through 
at least the 2000 model year. 
</P>
<P>
	Production of the Escort's wagon version and the Escort's twin,  
the Mercury Tracer, will end in July, freeing capacity at the 
Mexican plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Escort sales in the United States were up 7 percent in the first  
quarter over the same period of 1998, due in part to generous 
discounts. The Escort ranks No. 5 in car sales behind the Toyota 
Camry, Honda Accord, Ford Taurus and Chevrolet Cavalier. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is plenty of room for both Focus and Escort in our Ford  
showrooms, particularly while we're experiencing one of the hottest 
automotive sales cycles in industry history,'' said Jim O'Connor, 
Ford division president. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford executives hope that if they keep the Escort on sale,  
consumers won't perceive the more sophisticated, European-designed 
Focus as simply an Escort replacement. The fear is that potential 
buyers who would never consider an Escort won't consider a Focus 
either if the two are closely linked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, they want to establish the Focus as its own  
product,'' George Peterson of AutoPacific Inc., an industry 
consulting firm, said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Focus, which went on sale in Europe last fall and debuts in  
North America next autumn, has received positive reviews for its 
roominess, handling and unusual styling. European sales reached 
165,000 cars in the model's first six months. 
</P>
<P>
	In North America, Ford will initially offer a sedan and wagon,  
followed by a two-door hatchback in early 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson said having both the Focus and Escort on North American  
dealers' lots makes sense. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a car that is substantially better than the Escort and  
will be more expensive than the Escort,'' Peterson said. ``It's 
like what Jeep did with the Cherokee, keeping it in production 
forever while the Grand Cherokee is there carrying the torch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford won't say when it will kill off the Escort. Spokeswoman  
Anne Doyle said its survival beyond the 2000 model year depends on 
demand. The trade weekly Ward's Automotive Reports quoted unnamed 
Ford sources this week as saying the Escort will remain no more 
than two years, when Ford plans to begin producing a Focus-based, 
sport utility-car ``crossover'' vehicle at Hermosillo. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford expects the Focus to appeal more to younger buyers and  
those who otherwise would buy a Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic or 
other import. 
</P>
<P>
	The Focus is one reason Ford is expected to ax the Ford  
Contour-Mercury Mystique twin compacts by the end of the 2000 model 
year, Peterson said. The Contour has never lived up to U.S. sales 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Wind, who owns two Ford dealerships in the Pittsburgh area  
and is vice president of the national Ford Dealer Council, said 
dealers pressed Ford to keep the Escort. Although the big sales 
growth in recent years has been in pickups and SUVs, subcompact 
cars still represent about 14 percent of the new vehicle market. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in a conference call with the dealers council  
representatives across the country today and they were euphoric 
about the decision to keep the Escort,'' Wind said. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Ford announced Wednesday it was boosting capacity at  
its Windsor, Ontario, engine plant near Detroit by 100,000 engines 
to meet greater-than-anticipated demand for its big V8s and V10s 
used in Ford SUVs and pickups.

<HEADLINE> Jenny Jones Completes Time on Stand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) -- Completing three days on the witness  
stand, talk show host Jenny Jones said Wednesday that a man who 
killed a fellow guest after a segment on gay crushes was an adult 
and made ``an informed choice'' to appear on the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones stepped down after 12 hours of testimony in the $50  
million lawsuit against her show. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones, who is not being sued, insisted that she and her show  
were not responsible for the 1995 shooting death of Scott Amedure, 
a gay man who had described his crush on fellow guest Jonathan 
Schmitz during a ``Jenny Jones Show'' taping. Schmitz has said he 
is heterosexual and was humiliated. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmitz was convicted in 1996 of second-degree murder. The  
conviction was overturned because of an error in jury selection, 
and his retrial is set for Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	In the lawsuit against the show and its producer, Warner Bros.,  
Amedure's family accuses ``The Jenny Jones Show'' of tricking a 
mentally troubled Schmitz into appearing on the program and leading 
him to believe his admirer was a woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Jones said: ``I don't think we exploit people'' Schmitz, she  
said, ``was an adult. He knew the person with the crush could be a 
man or a woman. He was given enough information to make an informed 
choice.''

<HEADLINE> Harris To Spin Off Lanier Division </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Fla. (AP) -- Facing slipping profits, Harris Corp. has  
announced a major reorganization that will spin off its Lanier 
Worldwide office systems unit and focus the company on its 
communications technology business. 
</P>
<P>
	The Melbourne-based electronics giant said Tuesday that it would  
become two publicly held businesses: Lanier, which makes copiers, 
fax machines and other office products; and Harris, which produces 
communications products ranging from cellular switches and military 
radios to digital-TV transmitters. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also will cut up to 400 jobs, mostly in Melbourne.  
The new Harris will employ 12,000 workers -- more than 8,000 workers 
in Brevard County -- with expected annual sales of $2.3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris hopes to use the reorganization to turnaround its  
communications business, which has been hurt by slumping sales in 
Asia and South America. 
</P>
<P>
	The job eliminations will occur across the board in finance,  
marketing, administration and human resources, officials said. 
Overall, the cuts are expected to save $30 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris also plans to sell its power semiconductor operation, a  
$300 million unit that makes up almost half of Harris' microchip 
division, with facilities in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Ireland and 
Malaysia. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes represent the second major streamlining at Harris in  
less than a year. The company cut 2,300 jobs in companywide in July 
in response to a worldwide slump in demand for microchips. 
</P>
<P>
	On March 30, Harris announced it expected the communications  
slump to continue until midyear and that its profit for the quarter 
ending April 2 would be at $940 million, or 52 cents a diluted 
share, well below Wall Street expectations.

<HEADLINE> Drug Errors Blamed on Confusion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Federal regulators have received 53 reports of  
errors by doctors and pharmacists dispensing the popular new 
arthritis drug Celebrex, a problem blamed on confusing the 
painkiller with similarly named drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of reports of such mixups is the most the Food and  
Drug Administration has received for any drug that has been on the 
market only four months, the FDA's Jerry Phillips said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency is in talks with the drug's maker, Monsanto Co.'s  
Searle unit, about how to respond to the problem, Monsanto and FDA 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the reports involve serious injury or death, but medical  
authorities said confusion with some other drugs is potentially 
fatal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that it has happened in a short time since the drug  
was approved also has the office concerned,'' said Phillips, who 
heads the FDA's Office of Postmarketing Drug Risk Assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the options Searle and the FDA are considering: changing  
the drug's name again, and launching an education campaign to curb 
confusion by pharmacists, doctors and consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients received the wrong drug in 10 of the cases. The wrong  
drug was prescribed in 19 cases but caught before consumers 
received it. In 24 cases doctors and pharmacists reported that they 
found the name confusing. 
</P>
<P>
	Medical authorities say reports to the FDA generally represent a  
small proportion of the errors that occur. 
</P>
<P>
	Searle has already changed the drug's name once, from Celebra to  
Celebrex, after federal regulators said it sounded too much like 
other drugs. But doctors and pharmacists are still confusing 
Celebrex with the antidepressant Celexa and the seizure drug 
Cerebyx. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not an issue that is unique to Celebrex,'' Monsanto  
spokeswoman Scarlett Foster said. ``We'll decide with (the FDA) 
what are the best steps for us to take and will work with them to 
make sure that people are careful and are appropriately giving out 
the prescribing information.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deaths will occur if the name isn't changed, said Michael Cohen,  
chairman of the Institute for Safe Medication Practices, a 
Warminster, Pa., nonprofit group that tracks medication errors. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be serious outcomes if the name isn't changed,''  
said Cohen, whose group has successfully urged some drug makers to 
change sound-alike names. ``It seems like we always have to wait 
until there is a death before something's done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the errors involved an 80-year-old woman who mistakenly  
received the antidepressant Celexa instead of Celebrex twice a day 
for a month. A pharmacy staffer confused the drug names when 
pulling the drug from the shelf, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	That error could have had serious consequences because the woman  
was already on drug similar to Celexa, which blocks the chemical 
serotonin in the brain, and might have suffered a serious overdose 
of the compound. Millions of Americans take serotonin-blockers such 
as Eli Lilly's Prozac and Pfizer's Zoloft. 
</P>
<P>
	Some health systems are acting to avoid name confusion. Fairview  
Health Services of Minneapolis is asking doctors to write both the 
drug's generic name and its trade name on prescriptions and to list 
what ailment the drug is meant to treat, said Steven Meisel, 
assistant pharmacy director for the hospital system. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrex has been extremely popular since it went on the market  
in January because it is as effective a painkiller as ibuprofen and 
other so-called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, but it is 
much less likely to cause severe stomach problems such as bleeding 
ulcers. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 2 million prescriptions for Celebrex have been  
dispensed so far, making it the second-fastest selling new drug 
after Pfizer's impotence-treatment drug Viagra. 
</P>
<P>
	Monsanto and its co-marketer Pfizer are promoting Celebrex in  
all markets except in Japan. Additional approvals are pending in 
more than 30 countries.

<P>
	SUNRISE, Fla. (AP) -- Florida Panthers general manager Bryan  
Murray has been named GM of Canada's 1999 National Team at the 
upcoming World Hockey Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray, also the vice president of the Panthers, was an  
assistant coach for the Canadian entry at the 1990 World 
Championships. He helped lead them to the semifinals where they 
lost to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime you get the opportunity and be invited to represent  
your country it's an exciting challenge,'' said Murray, a native of 
Quebec. ``It's a very competitive tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's current National Team coach Mike Johnston will be the  
head coach at the World Championships, which will be held from May 
1-16 in Oslo, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada won the the gold medal in 1997 and finished in sixth  
place last year.

<HEADLINE> ABA Public Policy Activism Knocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MISSOULA, Mont. (AP) -- The American Bar Association is risking  
its standing as an objective and impartial organization with its 
public policy activism, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas 
says. 
</P>
<P>
	The ABA is becoming ``just another interest group,'' Thomas said  
Tuesday during a speech sponsored by the University of Montana 
School of Law. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest lawyer's group should work to take politics  
out of the process of reviewing judicial nominations and reduce the 
role of special interest groups, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ABA gave Thomas its mid-level rating of ``qualified'' to be  
a member of the Supreme Court at the time of his nomination in 
1991. Before Thomas, the last nominee to be given a simple 
``qualified'' rating was Sandra Day O'Connor in 1981. Other 
nominees were deemed ``well qualified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said the use of political litmus tests and publicity  
campaigns to influence appointments undermines the authority of the 
judges selected. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can't play the role of Dr. Frankenstein; add a part,  
change a part, until all are satisfied,'' Thomas said. 
``Legislation lends itself to compromise. Judges do not. They are 
individuals, not collections of policies.''

<HEADLINE> Russia, China Warn US of Arms Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia and China on Wednesday warned of a new arms  
race if the United States goes ahead with plans to develop a 
nationwide defense system against limited missile attack. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Senate recently approved a bill calling for  
construction of the defense system ``as soon as technologically 
possible.'' The Americans have grown concerned about the 
possibility of attack from countries such as Iran, Iraq and North 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian politicians have been unanimous in assailing the U.S.  
plan to develop anti-missile defenses, saying the move would 
violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty. Moscow strongly 
opposes U.S. proposals to amend the treaty to allow for limited 
missile defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian and Chinese military officials and diplomats who met in  
Moscow to discuss the situation issued a statement saying the two 
countries have serious concerns about the U.S. plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fulfillment of these plans would violate the main  
obligation under the ABM treaty,'' said the statement, circulated 
by the Russian Foreign Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia and China ``believe that undermining or violating the ABM  
treaty would lead to a whole range of negative consequences: New 
factors would appear that would be capable of destabilizing the 
international situation ... and create conditions for the 
resumption of the arms race,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia also contends the creation of a missile defense system  
would put on hold any further nuclear weapons reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin recently approved a bill by Russian  
lawmakers that would make their approval of the START II arms 
reduction treaty, which the United States is anxious to see 
ratified, dependent on a U.S. commitment to the ABM treaty.

	Milosevic To Meet Belrus Leader  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan  
Milosevic is expected today to meet with Belarus President 
Alexander Lukashenko, a vehement opponent of the NATO strikes. The 
authoritarian Lukashenko said last fall Belarus would supply 
weapons to Yugoslavia if NATO launched raids, but has so far 
announced no specific plans to do so. In Brussels, Belgium, Balkan 
turmoil topped the agenda as U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan 
headed into talks with European leaders today. Both NATO and 
Russia, which has been sharply critical of the bombing campaign, 
have indicated they view Annan as a possible mediator.

	Germany Proposes Kosovo Peace Plan

<P>
	BONN, Germany (AP) -- Germany launched a peace plan for Kosovo  
today that offers Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic a 24-hour 
suspension of NATO airstrikes if he starts withdrawing his forces 
from the province. ATO would ``permanently suspend'' airstrikes 
once the pullout is completed, according to a copy of the proposal 
provided by the Foreign Ministry. The plan was a new step in 
Western efforts to build a diplomatic front against Milosevic with 
Russia, which strongly opposes NATO's assault, and the United 
Nations. It calls for a U.N. military force to move in as Yugoslav 
forces withdraw, a return of Kosovo refugees and for Kosovo to be 
put under U.N. administration until a permanent peace settlement is 
agreed.

Jayalalitha, head of a powerful regional party from south India,

test flight of the Ghauri II took place east of the Pakistani 
capital of Islamabad, government officials said. Residents of the 
capital handed out sweets, a traditional means of celebrating, and 
offered each other congratulations as news spread of the missile 
test. The test was not a surprise, with analysts anticipating 
Pakistan would respond to the test of the Agni II missile conducted 
Sunday by India. The Agni II has about the same range and payload 
capacity as Pakistan's Ghauri II.

	Entertainment highlights during the week of April 18-24:  
</P>
<P>
	60 years ago: Bette Davis and George Brent starred in ``Dark  
Victory.'' The film also starred Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
	35 years ago: Peter Sellers starred in ``The Pink Panther,''  
directed by Blake Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
	30 years ago: Janis Joplin and the Kozmic Blues performed at

</P>
<P>
	10 years ago: Helen Hayes, Mary Tyler Moore and Lauren Bacall

The change was delayed while the club was being renovated. 
</P>
<P>
	And Kevin Costner, Ray Liotta and James Earl Jones starred in  
``Field of Dreams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One year ago: Tom Cruise won the John Huston Award for his  
advocacy of artists' rights. The award recognizes individuals who 
exhibit ``courage, vision and service'' on behalf of artists. 
</P>
<P>
	And ``Ellen,'' the sitcom that brought the issue of  
homosexuality to televisions across the country, was canceled by 
ABC. 

</P>
<P>
	Spoken 10 years ago:  
</P>
<P>
	``I try to have the gimmick, the big hair and loud clothes, and  
high heels and long fingernails. All of this is born out of a

<HEADLINE> Issues Increase Lobbyists' Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's major airlines spent the closing  
days of the last Congress inveighing against Transportation 
Department ideas to encourage competition in smaller markets. They 
walked away with a victory as Congress ordered further study before 
new rules take effect. 
</P>
<P>
	The victorious campaign came with a price. Expenses for the  
airlines' lobbying group, the Air Transport Association, increased 
almost 50 percent, from $2.6 million in 1997 to $3.8 million in 
1998. The association represents American, Delta, USAirways and 
other major airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Other businesses with hot issues before Congress also increased  
their lobbying budgets last year, disclosure reports show. 
</P>
<P>
	For example:  
</P>
<P>
	--MasterCard and Visa ran up big bills of their own lobbying  
Congress, quadrupling spending to $5.3 million as they urged 
lawmakers to make it harder for people to erase debts in bankruptcy 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	--The tobacco industry more than doubled its spending, to $56.4  
million, as it successfully defeated legislation that would have 
raised cigarette taxes as part of a plan to discourage teen 
smoking, disclosure reports show. 
</P>
<P>
	--The growing high-technology industry also boosted spending.  
Microsoft Corp., sued in 1998 by the Justice Department and some 
state governments over alleged antitrust violations, more than 
doubled its lobbying expenses, from $1.9 million in 1997 to $3.2 
million in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is how politics works,'' said Ellen Miller, director of  
Public Campaign, an advocacy group that wants to change campaign 
finance laws. ``Those well-heeled interests hire better-heeled 
lobbyists to carry their water straight to the members'' of 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The airlines haven't had much time to savor the industry's  
lobbying victory. They have a new battle to fight. Sen. John 
McCain, R-Ariz., the Commerce Committee chairman, has proposed 
legislation establishing a four-year program to develop air service 
in small communities and require the Transportation Department to 
review marketing and other airline practices that could inhibit 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the government wading into the free marketplace,'' Air  
Transport Association spokesman David Fuscus said. ``You start 
messing around with market forces, and competition is going to go 
down, and prices are going to go up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another winner last year was the tobacco industry. Its  
successful effort to kill anti-smoking legislation carried a price 
tag of almost $100 million -- $56.4 million on lobbying and at least 
$40 million more on television commercials opposing the bill, which 
Senate Republicans killed last June. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading the opposition was Brown &AMP; Williamson, which spent $24.9  
million on lobbying, a big jump from $3.7 million in 1997; and 
Philip Morris, which increased its lobbying expenditures to $23 
million from $15.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the lobbyists weighing in on behalf of tobacco were two  
former Senate majority leaders, Democrat George Mitchell of Maine 
and Republican Howard Baker of Tennessee; former Texas Gov. Ann 
Richards, a Democrat; and Republican ex-Rep. Stan Parris of 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco companies spent $26.2 million on lobbying in 1997.  
</P>
<P>
	Despite their lobbying efforts, credit card companies failed to  
win passage of bankruptcy legislation. Each house of Congress 
passed its own bankruptcy measure last year, but the Senate 
adjourned without voting on a compromise to reconcile the two 
bills. The issue again is before the new Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Visa increased its lobbying bill to $3.6 million from  
$900,000 in 1997. MasterCard International's lobbying expenses rose 
to $1.8 million from $430,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The credit card companies also had other issues to lobby on last  
year, including legislation affecting Internet commerce and 
overhauling the financial service industry. In October, the Justice 
Department sued Visa and MasterCard, saying that the two companies, 
which account for 75 percent of all credit card purchases in the 
United States, had stifled competition.

<HEADLINE>  Quayle To Run for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Former Vice President Dan Quayle, trying  
to refurbish his image and jump-start his GOP presidential 
campaign, declared his candidacy Wednesday by pledging to rebuild 
American values after ``a dishonest decade of Bill Clinton and Al 
Gore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking office for the first time since he and President Bush  
succumbed to Clinton and Gore in 1992, the former Indiana senator 
sought to push beyond a history of political gaffes and 
controversies. ``Murphy Brown is gone,'' he said, ``and I'm still 
here fighting for the American family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's use of the TV sitcom in the 1992 campaign to highlight  
a ``poverty of values'' brought him criticism and ridicule from 
some quarters. But he returned to the theme Wednesday, betting that 
primary voters will reward him for casting a spotlight on the 
family-values debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question in life is not whether you get knocked down. You  
will. The question is, are you ready to get back up, are you 
willing to get back up and fight for what you believe in?'' Quayle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of nearly 6,000, packed to the gym rafters at his former  
high school, shouted ``Q2K! Q2K! Q2K!'' for Quayle-2000. Fireworks 
exploded before and after his speech, covering the stage in a haze 
of smoke. Rock music, hundreds of handpainted signs and an 
appearance by ball-tossing former Chicago Bears quarterback Jim 
McMahon gave the announcement a pep rally feeling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have come back home to announce that I will seek and I will  
win the presidency of the United States,'' Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who succeeded Quayle as vice president and is seeking the  
Democratic presidential nomination, was singled out by Quayle for 
calling President Clinton a great leader during the impeachment 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``What arrogance. What disdain for the values that parents are  
trying to teach their children. What contempt for the rule of 
law,'' Quayle said. ``This should not stand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are coming to the end of a dishonest decade of Bill Clinton  
and Al Gore,'' he said. ``It's time we work to reclaim the values 
that made America great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's staff dismissed the attack. Spokesman Chris Lehane said,  
``Dan Quayle's vision of America will take us back to the Dark Ages 
of the last GOP administration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing relaxed and in command of his topics, Quayle spoke  
from notes and varied from a draft of the speech given to 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	He promoted his proposed 30 percent across-the-board tax cut,  
billing it as a boon to middle-income families. 
</P>
<P>
	And he portrayed himself as the best qualified potential  
commander-in-chief, recalling his participation in White House war 
councils. After Bush picked him as vice president, Quayle had 
withstood withering criticism for having joined the Indiana 
National Guard years earlier, thus avoiding service in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can only get so much from briefing books and crash  
courses. You need experience,'' Quayle said. Texas Gov. George W. 
Bush, the early favorite for the GOP nomination, is getting scores 
of private briefings to bone up on foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``A presidency is not to be inherited,'' Quayle said.  
</P>
<P>
	Aides would not say whether Quayle was alluding to Gore or the  
Texas governor -- or perhaps both. Gore is Clinton's choice to win 
in 2000, and Bush is the son of the former president. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle himself wants to inherit Bush's mantle.  
</P>
<P>
	The former vice president, 52, is a long shot for the nomination  
despite his popularity among grass-roots activists and his strong 
organization in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	He joins a crowded field of conservative candidates wrestling  
over the same votes. His campaign team has come together slowly. 
And he raised about $2 million in the first quarter of 1999 -- $1 
million less than projected. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's largest obstacle is what one supporter calls the  
``potato factor'' -- a reference to the day he misspelled the word 
in a classroom full of school children. That and other miscues 
turned the vice president into a punch line for countless jokes, 
cementing for many American the perception that Quayle was 
ill-suited for the job. 
</P>
<P>
	Stuck with the image, Quayle wants to turn it to his advantage  
in the GOP primaries. He is telling conservative voters that the 
controversies prove his willingness to fight the media and liberal 
elite to protect values. A new internal poll of 1,000 primary 
voters showed that 70 percent agreed with this statement: ``Dan 
Quayle has proven he can take a punch; the media made fun of him 
and he is still standing firm for what he believes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His supporters argue that Quayle will easily exceed the low  
expectations to sneak up on Bush, who they say can't live up to his 
early billing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Americans will begin to see a rejuvenated Dan  
Quayle,'' said Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Quayle has lost key supporters to Bush, including former  
aides David Beckwith and Al Hubbard. 
</P>
<P>
	State GOP chairman Mike McDaniel has yet to endorse a GOP  
presidential candidate -- not a good sign for favorite son Quayle -- 
and Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith is a top Bush adviser.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Yank Howe Barred From Coaching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITEFISH, Mont. (AP) -- Former New York Yankees pitcher Steve  
Howe's ban from a volunteer coaching position with a girls' 
softball team because of his past history of drug abuse was upheld 
by the Whitefish School Board Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The action supported the decision of Superintendent Dave Peters  
to bar Howe, 41, whose daughter, Chelsi, is a sophomore on the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a crowd that came to the board meeting to support Howe,  
board members said they were unwilling to second-guess Peters' 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Howe, a former National League Rookie of the Year and 13-year  
veteran of the major leagues, was suspended several times for 
violating Major League Baseball's substance abuse policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steve Howe is a really great coach, and (my daughter) thinks  
his participation would help the girls in a big way,'' said the 
mother of one player. 
</P>
<P>
	Barb Barker, president of the Whitefish Softball Association,  
requested that the board put the Howe matter on a future agenda, 
offering an opportunity for all sides to make their cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``As parents, we're just tickled to death when our kids get a  
coach who can teach,'' Barker said. ``Steve Howe would like to be a 
volunteer so he can teach. Please let him teach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Board chairman David Fern, however, stressed that the board  
would only revisit Peters' decision if it appeared school district 
policy had been breached. 
</P>
<P>
	In this case, he said, policy was clear and had been followed  
properly. 
</P>
<P>
	Fern said district policy calls for background checks on  
volunteers associated with the school, and if those background 
checks reveal concerns, the superintendent has the right to deny 
the volunteer's request. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can make a mistake in life, and these young ladies will,''  
said softball association member Terry Fennessy. ``But you can pay 
restitution and move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The danger, she said, is that the girls learn that a mistake  
once made ``will haunt them the rest of their lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Board member Leo Tracy said Howe took to the field even after  
Peters ordered him not to, and he referred to what he described as 
Howe's ``unwavering defiance of authority'' and ``incredible 
ability to use bad judgment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Howe did not attend the hearing to respond to Tracy's comments  
and could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new policy says check the background,'' Fern said. ``So  
it's time to check everyone. What we' re trying to do with this 
policy is to avoid the subjectivity. Subjectivity undermines the 
policy process. We have to represent the philosophy of the board, 
the district policy and the state and federal laws.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Tuesday's decision make both policy and intent clear.  
</P>
<P>
	``Steve Howe has no job with us. Period. Can he apply again?  
Sure. That's up to him.''

<HEADLINE> Team To Search for Mercury Capsule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Thirty-eight years after Gus  
Grissom's Mercury capsule sank to the bottom of the Atlantic, an 
underwater salvage expert hopes to find and recover the sunken 
spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	Curt Newport heads out to sea this weekend in his most extensive  
search yet for Liberty Bell 7. He's been trying to find the capsule 
for 14 years and last summer teamed up with the Discovery Channel. 
</P>
<P>
	The crew plans to set sail Sunday on a two-week hunt in  
3-mile-deep water about 300 miles offshore. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a pretty good idea where to look for it,'' Newport  
said Wednesday. ``To say I'm cautiously optimistic is probably the 
right term.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Liberty Bell 7 sank after splashing down with the astronaut on  
July 21, 1961. The explosive bolts that blow open the hatch 
detonated prematurely. To this day, there is debate over whether 
the hatch malfunctioned or Grissom panicked and blew it open. 
</P>
<P>
	The capsule is the only U.S. manned spacecraft lost after a  
successful mission. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have always considered Liberty Bell to the most important  
American space artifact yet to be recovered,'' said Max Ary, 
president of the Kansas Cosmosphere and Space Center, which will 
restore the capsule if it's found. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport tried to find the capsule in 1992 and again in 1993  
after years of poring over NASA charts and photographs and 
interviewing those who were there when Liberty Bell 7 went down. 
Those attempts were tacked on to other missions, however, and were 
conducted hastily. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, this is a full-fledged, dedicated mission to go out and  
locate and recover this thing,'' Newport said. ``We have a lot more 
time, we have a better sonar, we can examine a much larger area of 
the ocean at one time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery Channel is paying for the expedition as well as  
filming it for a documentary to be broadcast this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``The story of the Liberty Bell 7 is a fascinating one that, to  
my knowledge, really hasn't been told except for a segment in `The 
Right Stuff,''' said Karen Baratz, a Discovery Channel spokeswoman. 
She declined to give the cost of the expedition, except to say it 
was in the seven figures. 
</P>
<P>
	The capsule, made of aluminum, titanium, magnesium and other  
metals, sank after a 15-minute suborbital flight that was America's 
second manned space shot. Helicopter rescuers could not lift the 
water-filled capsule, and the line was cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Grissom insisted until his death in a 1967 Apollo launch pad  
fire that he did nothing to cause the hatch to blow. NASA 
exonerated Grissom after the Mercury accident and he went on to fly 
on Gemini 3, although some accounts, including Tom Wolfe's 1979 
book ``The Right Stuff,'' suggested Grissom panicked. 
</P>
<P>
	Ary said there's a good chance the mystery can be solved if the  
hatch is recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	If finding the 7-foot capsule is like looking for a pencil in a  
haystack, as Ary put it, finding the 3-foot hatch is like looking 
for the proverbial needle. It's believed to be anywhere from 
several hundred feet to a quarter-mile from the capsule. 
</P>
<P>
	Two cameras and a tape recorder that sank with the capsule could  
shed light on what happened, but it's doubtful the film and tape 
could be salvaged after so long underwater. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport, 47, a former space station worker who left Oceaneering  
International in January to found his own company, Liberty Bell 7 
Inc., said he's not out to set the record straight. He's more 
interested in preserving a piece of history. 
</P>
<P>
	``Outside of Challenger, this is the only one we haven't gotten  
back,'' he said. ``It's the right thing to do. It's patriotic. It 
was one of ours.''

<HEADLINE> Media General Earnings Dip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Media General Inc., a Southeastern  
newspaper publisher and broadcaster, reported an 11 percent decline 
in first-quarter earnings Wednesday because of lower newsprint 
prices and weaker broadcast advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	The Richmond-based media company earned $11.3 million in the  
first three months of the year, down from $12.7 million in the same 
period last year. Per-share earnings fell to 42 cents from 47 
cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues slipped to $232.2 million from $234.7 million.  
</P>
<P>
	J. Stewart Bryan III, Media General's chairman and chief  
executive officer, said that profit increases in the company's 
publishing and cable TV divisions were not enough to offset lower 
profits from broadcasting and newsprint production. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's earnings from selling newsprint were hurt by an  
oversupply of the product, which depressed prices. Broadcasting 
profits declined because of soft national advertising sales and a 
decline in political advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan said the company's earnings last year got a boost from the  
Winter Olympics, which were carried on Media General's CBS 
affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
	Increased classified advertising sales helped the publishing  
division, while higher advertising, subscriber and premium event 
numbers resulted in better earnings at the cable holdings. 
</P>
<P>
	Media General is an independent communications company doing  
business primarily in the Southeast. It has interests in 
newspapers, broadcast and cable television, recycled newsprint 
production and diversified information services. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Media General closed at $47.50, up 62 1/2 cents, in  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Falcons' Robinson Accepts Pay Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- Saying he sees this as a new beginning,  
Eugene Robinson accepted a pay cut and showed up for the Atlanta 
Falcons' offseason workout program. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will not be held hostage by the past,'' said Robinson, who  
was arrested on the eve of Atlanta's Super Bowl game against Denver 
for attempting to solicit oral sex in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson signed a new contract Tuesday that reduced his salary  
from $1.9 million to $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a money thing,'' he said. ``I've got money. I want to  
... do something that's right. This is ... a new beginning. I have 
goals. I want to get back to the Super Bowl and do it right. I want 
to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the Falcons re-signed cornerback Ronnie Bradford last  
month, coach Dan Reeves said he would move Bradford to free safety 
-- Robinson's position. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson called Reeves last week from his home outside Seattle  
and the coach told him he needed to be in the workout program. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am deeply humbled and (grateful) for this opportunity,''  
Robinson said. ``I'm not trying to get away from it. I want it to 
be ... a scar I will always remember. I don't want it to affect 
what I do as a football player.''

<HEADLINE> Elton Brand Leaves Duke for NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Elton Brand headed to the NBA today,  
becoming the first Duke player to leave college early for the pros. 
</P>
<P>
	The national college player of the year led Duke to the NCAA  
championship game as a sophomore and will be giving up his last two 
years of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of how well he has done, the decision-making process  
has been moved up,'' coach Mike Krzyzewski said. ``Elton is making 
the right decision for everyone involved. I am 100 percent in 
support of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-8 center, in a widely anticipated announcement, plans  
to finish this semester at Duke and attend summer school before 
embarking on his pro career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I will eventually finish, but just not in the four-year time  
period,'' he said. ``I will always be a part of Duke, the coaches 
and the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He appeared at a news conference with associate head basketball  
coach Johnny Dawkins. Krzyzewski, recovering from hip surgery, 
spoke by telephone hookup. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand averaged 17.8 points and 9.8 rebounds this past season. He  
was the main cog in a Blue Devils team that compiled a 37-2 record 
and made it to the NCAA championship game, where it lost to 
Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
	He is the fourth player to come out early for the NBA draft,  
joining Ron Artest (St. John's), Steve Francis (Maryland) and 
Albert White (Missouri). 
</P>
<P>
	Brand was the first sophomore to win the John R. Wooden Award,  
presented by the Los Angeles Athletic Club to college basketball's 
top player. Brand also was honored this season by The Associated 
Press, the Atlanta Tipoff Club and the United States Basketball 
Writers Association as national player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand's announcement could lead two other Duke underclassmen --  
sophomore Will Avery and freshman Corey Maggette -- to jump to the 
pros. 
</P>
<P>
	Avery's mother, Terry Simonton, said she and her son met Friday  
with Krzyzewski at his home to discuss Avery's pro prospects. She 
said her son is leaning toward staying in school next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we talked to him, we were staying,'' she told The News &AMP;  
Observer of Raleigh. ``But K said it wasn't a decision that has to 
be rushed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Underclassmen have until May 15 to announce their intentions.

<HEADLINE> The Artist Taking On Musical Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Artist has gone on a legal offensive against  
Web sites devoted to him. At least one site has responded by going 
after his symbol. 
</P>
<P>
	The copyright and trademark infringement lawsuits, filed in  
February against nine Web sites, accuse them of selling bootlegged 
recordings by the former Prince and offering access to downloads of 
his songs. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the format known as MP3, the selling and trading of  
music downloaded through computers has become wildly popular. It 
has made the music industry, and some artists, nervous because of a 
perceived threat to the CD and tape market. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Artist clearly wants to stop unauthorized distribution of  
his music,'' said Michael Elkin, his attorney. ``The material that 
he puts out is the material that he selects. People should not be 
permitted to release product without his consent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In trying to stop the Web sites' activities, the Artist has also  
alleged unauthorized use of photographs, sales of books and a 
CD-ROM. He also said people have been infringing upon his trademark 
of the odd symbol that he has used as his name since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	One defendant, Uptown Productions, filed a countersuit last week  
that claimed the Artist had no right to trademark his symbol. The 
former Prince can't claim unauthorized use because he frequently 
encouraged people to use it as a substitute for his name, said the 
company, which operates a Web site and distributes a fan magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Uptown also claims the symbol is in the public domain since it's  
a copy of an ancient symbol for soapstone. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Rapp, the lawyer who represents Uptown, said he believed  
the Artist was going on the attack to chill competition because he 
wanted to put out a fan magazine of his own. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really just want to be left alone,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Judge OKs Black Farmer Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge's final stamp of approval on a  
multimillion-dollar settlement for black farmers is being hailed as 
a significant step in ending years of discrimination by the 
Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the first time ever in a racial discrimination case that  
serious money has been paid out,'' Alexander Pires, lead attorney 
for the plaintiffs, said after the judge's approval was announced 
Wednesday. ``I think it's going to encourage others to speak out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman issued a statement saying the  
settlement was ``fair and just, both for the black farmers and for 
the American people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``With this approval, USDA can move forward, putting a painful  
chapter of our history behind us,'' Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman's approval came four months  
after attorneys for the two sides announced a settlement. At that 
time, Friedman gave preliminary approval to the deal, but he held a 
fairness hearing last month to get farmers' input. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge has worked with attorneys on both sides over the past  
few weeks to try to address some of the farmers' concerns. No 
changes were made in the financial terms, although some safeguards 
were added to ensure farmers' rights during the settlement process, 
attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers had complained that the deal lacked checks and balances  
to prevent them from being abused during the process. Many also 
wanted long-term safeguards against racism. 
</P>
<P>
	Black farmers sued two years ago because they had been denied  
access to government loans and subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	Pires said more than 18,000 farmers have already signed up for  
the settlement and estimated that it could eventually be worth more 
than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, farmers with less documented evidence of  
discrimination can take a $50,000 payment, as well as $12,500 to 
cover taxes, and have their government debts forgiven. Farmers with 
more evidence could opt to go before an independent arbitrator and 
seek larger damages. Farmers could also choose to opt out of the 
lawsuit and pursue their own cases. 
</P>
<P>
	At the judge's suggestion, attorneys added a provision that  
allows the judge to select a monitor who will oversee the 
settlement. Another provision adds a layer of retired judges to 
review decisions made by an adjudicator, who will decide whether 
many farmers qualify. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some black farmers had a lukewarm response to the  
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it still leaves a lot to be desired,'' said Gary  
Grant, president of the Black Farmers and Agriculturists 
Association. ``The membership mostly has been saying, 'Get rid of 
it, it's not any good.'''

<HEADLINE> A Look at Players in NFL Draft '99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The top players in this weekend's NFL draft,  
with players grouped by projected NFL positions. All are seniors 
unless noted: 
</P>
<P>
                             *OFFENSE   	
</P>
<P>
                           *QUARTERBACKS   	
</P>
<P>
	POSITION OUTLOOK: Probably the deepest group since the famous  
class of 1983 that featured John Elway and Dan Marino. Anywhere 
from four to six will likely go in the first round. Most are 
extremely mobile, too. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	TIM COUCH, Kentucky, 6-4 1/2, 227, junior -- Classic dropback passer  
was a second-team All-American and finished fourth in Heisman 
Trophy balloting in '98. Passed for 8,835 yards and 74 TDs in his 
career, while throwing 35 INTs. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Completed 72.3 percent of his passes and threw for at  
least 300 yards and one TD in every game last season. Tougher 
runner than many realize. Good size and a strong, accurate arm. 
Quick release. Nice touch. Steps up in the pocket well. Smart, 
confident leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Played in a wide-open, short-passing system that  
helped him compile gaudy statistics. Not many big wins under his 
belt. Only two full seasons as a starter. Did not work out at 
combine. Needs some work on deep passes. Might take time to 
develop. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: Probably first to Cleveland. If he falls, it won't  
be far. 
</P>
<P>
	AKILI SMITH, Oregon, 6-2 1/2, 221 -- Junior college transfer who  
also played minor league baseball. Productive passer (3,763 yards 
and 32 TDs in '98). Pac-10 co-offensive player of year. Has opened 
a lot of eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Good mobility, size and athleticism. Throws deep ball  
very well. Might have the best arm in the draft. Stands tall and 
strong in the pocket. Great practices at the East-West Shrine game. 
Threw only eight INTs last season. Blossomed as a senior. Timed at 
4.65 in 40-yard dash. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Only started one full season. Still a little raw.  
Sometimes makes poor decisions and forces the ball. Pulled out of 
the Senior Bowl. Must learn to read the whole field. Will be 24 
before his first NFL season. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: Stock has soared. Could go anywhere in the top three  
(Cleveland, Philadelphia, Cincinnati). 
</P>
<P>
	DONOVAN McNABB, Syracuse, 6-2 3/8, 226 -- Four-year starter who  
might have been the most valuable player in college football last 
season. Holds Big East career records for passing yards (8,389) and 
TDs (77). 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Incredibly elusive. Strong arm and can throw with  
remarkable accuracy on the run. Does things others can't. 
Improvises when the play breaks down. Good vision. Impressed at the 
Senior Bowl. Might be the finest athlete at QB to enter draft in 
years. Clutch performer. Ran a 4.64 40-yard dash. Ranked sixth in 
nation in passing efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Did not play in a pro-style offense. Not a refined  
pocket passer. Has a tendency to scramble early. Needs some work on 
mechanics and technique. Sometimes forces throws. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: High first-round pick. Eagles (2) or Bengals (3)  
might grab him, otherwise Chicago (7) probably won't pass. 
</P>
<P>
	DAUNTE CULPEPPER, Central Florida, 6-4, 252 -- Tremendous  
physical specimen set an NCAA record for single-season completion 
percentage (73.6). Drafted by the New York Yankees. Has often been 
compared to Titans QB Steve McNair. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Passed for more than 10,000 yards and rushed for more  
than 1,000 in his four-year career. Possesses rare size, power and 
speed for a QB. Cannon for an arm with good touch on deep balls. 
Finished sixth in Heisman voting. Reads coverages well. Huge 
upside. Played well against Nebraska as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Played mostly against subpar competition in college.  
Threw four INTs against Auburn in a rare nationally televised game. 
Has too many passes batted down for someone his size. Lacks a quick 
release. Could be a project. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: Too talented to slide too far. Top 15 pick, maybe  
Baltimore (10) or Tampa Bay (15). 
</P>
<P>
	CADE McNOWN, UCLA, 6-0 1/2, 211 -- First-team All-American placed  
third in Heisman Trophy balloting. Lefty owns Pac-10 career record 
for total offense and was Senior Bowl MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Heady leader who made many clutch plays to keep his  
team in national title hunt last season. High percentage passer. 
Finds second and third receivers skillfully. Throws well on 
rollouts. Plenty of experience (44 starts). Knows how to win. Threw 
only six INTs in junior year. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Smaller than scouts would like and many question his  
arm strength. Mechanics are not great. Throws sidearm sometimes. 
Did not play well in Rose Bowl. Can't throw off-balance. Stands in 
against pass rush, but takes a lot of hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: Could go as high as 12th to New Orleans, or he could  
slip. 
</P>
<P>
	BROCK HUARD, Washington, 6-4 1/2, 228, junior -- Overshadowed by  
other fine QBs in Pac-10. Played better in '97 than last season. 
Brother of Damon Huard, backup QB for Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Good-looking dropback passer with enviable size.  
Throws a nice ball and hits receivers in stride. Powerful arm, 
quick release. Intelligent. Was surrounded with mediocre talent, 
especially at WR, in '98. Left-hander from traditionally strong QB 
school. Expected to be better as a pro. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Might have come out a year too early. Did not live  
up to potential in college, especially last season. Durability a 
question mark. Doesn't handle pass rush well. Inconsistent. 
Tendency to throw off back foot. Not impressive at combine. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: Could sneak into late first round, otherwise a  
worthwhile second-rounder. 
</P>
<P>
	SHAUN KING, Tulane, 6-0, 221 -- Exciting performer who set an  
NCAA single-season record for passing efficiency. Stock has risen 
dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Led Tulane to 12-0 record in '98 without big-time  
talent around him. Strong arm. Good scrambler. Tough and smart, 
played with broken left hand last year. First Division I-A player 
to pass for over 3,000 yards and rush for over 500 in same season. 
Threw only six INTs last year -- none in last 166 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Played mainly against weak competition. Short.  
Played in fast break, no-huddle offense. Seems much more 
comfortable in shotgun. Doesn't have a single outstanding trait. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: Minnesota (29) or Atlanta (30) might take a chance,  
but he's probably a second or third-rounder. 
</P>
<P>
	OTHERS TO WATCH:   	
</P>
<P>
	-- Michael Bishop, Kansas State, 6-0 3/8, 195, speedy Heisman  
runner-up might find his NFL future at another position. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Scott Covington, Miami, 6-2 1/8, 217, late bloomer with accurate  
arm, but some question his toughness. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Kevin Daft, California-Davis, 6-1 3/8, 184, prolific passer from  
same small school as former Jets QB Ken O'Brien ('83 draft). 
</P>
<P>
	-- Joe Germaine, Ohio State, 6-0 7/8, 203, smart and accurate with a  
nice release, but small. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Graham Leigh, New Mexico, 6-2, 212, can run and throw and has  
good size, but played poorly as a senior following his strong 
junior season. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
                           *RUNNING BACKS   	
</P>
<P>
	POSITION OUTLOOK: Some consider the crop thin after Williams and  
James, but there is hidden talent further down. Cloud, Collins and 
Zereoue should still be available after the first round. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	RICKY WILLIAMS, Texas, 5-10 3/4, 236 -- Heisman Trophy winner set  
NCAA Division I-A career rushing record (6,279 yards). Played minor 
league baseball in Philadelphia Phillies organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Maybe the best RB in college football history. Has  
everything a back could want: speed, size, power, durability. Runs 
through tacklers. Led nation in rushing last two seasons. Little 
wasted effort. Quick moves. Great balance. Holds 20 NCAA rushing 
records and 44 school marks. Ran for 2,124 yards in '98. Averaged 
6.2 yards per carry for his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Small hands. Was overweight at combine. Tends to  
fumble. Has carried the ball a lot and taken plenty of hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: If three QBs go first, he'll be fourth (Colts) or  
fifth (Redskins). But Philadelphia (2) might bite. The Saints would 
love to trade up for him. 
</P>
<P>
	EDGERRIN JAMES, Miami, 6-0 1/2, 223, junior -- Only player in school  
history with consecutive 1,000-yard rushing seasons. Ran for 299 
yards against UCLA in '98. Timed at 4.51 in 40-yard dash. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Powerfully built, with speed. Already reads blocks  
like a seasoned veteran. Very difficult to tackle. Sheds defenders. 
Big, strong thighs. Can get to the corner and turn it. Excellent 
receiver. Has a nose for end zone. Improved a lot in college and 
still maturing. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Shuffles his feet a bit when he runs. Short steps.  
Not a true breakaway threat. Runs a little high. Fumbles. Might 
develop slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: First round pick, maybe Rams (6).  
</P>
<P>
	ROB KONRAD, Syracuse, 6-3, 260 -- Prototype fullback in the mold  
of Mike Alstott or Daryl Johnston. First FB in school history to 
wear coveted No. 44. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Good all-around athlete. Runs hard and straight  
ahead. Hits the hole well. Multi-dimensional skills. Excellent 
receiver. Punishing blocker. Nice size with speed (4.53 40-yard 
dash). 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Injury-prone. Was not as productive in college as he  
could have been. Should be tougher to bring down. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: Late first-round or early second-round pick,  
possibly to the Patriots (28). 
</P>
<P>
	CECIL COLLINS, McNEESE STATE, 5-9 7/8, 209, junior -- Transferred  
from LSU after being arrested and kicked off team. Dismissed by 
McNeese State for failing drug test. Pleaded guilty to battery and 
unauthorized entry and faces four years probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Ran for at least 172 yards in all three starts for  
LSU in '97 before breaking leg. Averaged 8.3 yards per carry in 
four games total. Great burst. Makes people miss. Ran a 4.37 
40-yard dash in individual workout. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Nobody wants to draft the next Lawrence Phillips.  
Inexperienced -- played only six games in college. Has had some 
injuries in addition to off-field problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: First-round talent, but lots of baggage. Still,  
Miami (24) or New England (20 and 28) might be interested. Could 
fall a long way. 
</P>
<P>
	OTHERS TO WATCH:   	
</P>
<P>
	-- Jerry Azumah, New Hampshire, 5-10, 195 -- Division I-AA  
standout had monster combine. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Marlon Barnes, Colorado, 5-10, 207 -- oft-injured speedster ran  
a blazing 4.25 40-yard dash. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Shawn Bryson, Tennessee, 6-0 1/2, 235 -- skilled fullback with  
speed had 57-yard TD run against Florida last season. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Mike Cloud, Boston College, 5-10 1/2, 200 -- first-team  
All-American explodes through holes, had solid Senior Bowl and 
could be a real sleeper. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Kevin Faulk, LSU, 5-8, 197 -- explosive but small, probably  
would have been picked higher if he came out last year. Could be a 
dangerous third-down back and return specialist. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Sedrick Irvin, Michigan State, 5-11 1/2, 223, junior --  
productive, versatile cousin of star Cowboys WR Michael Irvin had 
three straight 1,000-yard seasons in Big Ten. Lacks great speed and 
makes too many moves. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Terry Jackson, Florida, 5-11 1/2, 218 -- big and versatile, but is  
he a TB or FB? Could go in second round if someone decides. History 
of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	-- James Johnson, Mississippi State, 6-1 1/4, 235 -- tough power back  
was first-team All-SEC in '98 with 1,383 yards rushing. Doesn't cut 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Brian Shay, Emporia State, 5-7 7/8, 208 -- holds NCAA all levels  
career rushing record with 6,958 yards. Small player, small school, 
big heart. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Amos Zereoue, West Virginia, 5-9 7/8, 202, junior -- quick darter  
makes nifty cuts and lots of tacklers miss. Averaged over 1,500 
yards rushing last two seasons. Short but strong, could be third RB 
taken. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
                          *WIDE RECEIVERS   	
</P>
<P>
	POSITION OUTLOOK: Would have been stronger if juniors Peter  
Warrick and R. Jay Soward had come out. Holt and Boston look like 
sure first-rounders, probably Johnson, too. After that it's 
anybody's guess. Plenty of others have talent with question marks 
attached. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	TORRY HOLT, N.C. State, 6-0 1/2, 190 -- First-team All-American  
caught 88 balls for 1,604 yards and 11 TDs last season. Strong 
individual workout showed he's fully recovered from postseason knee 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Smooth and fluid. Big-play threat. Makes  
over-the-shoulder catches well. Changes speeds nicely in his 
routes. Excelled against Florida State two years in a row. ACC 
Player of the Year and career receiving leader. Dangerous kick 
returner. Scored 33 career TDs. Ran a 4.44 40-yard dash. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Not a blazing sprinter. Drops passes occasionally.  
Sometimes starts to run before the catch. Had to pull out of Senior 
Bowl because of injury. Not quite as tall as some of today's NFL 
prototype WRs. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: First WR selected, Top 10 pick -- maybe Arizona (8).  
</P>
<P>
	DAVID BOSTON, Ohio State, 6-2 1/2, 208, junior -- Second-team  
All-American presents all kinds of matchup problems. Caught 85 
passes for 1,435 yards and 13 TDs in '98. Father Byron is an NFL 
official. Timed at 4.47 in the 40-yard dash. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Big and physical, with huge arms. Rare strength for a  
wideout. Unlimited talent. Often a dominant college player. 
Breakaway speed. Comes back to ball well. Cuts and separates from 
coverage nicely. Confident. Played at school that has produced a 
number of excellent pro receivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Must improve route-running and consistency.  
Sometimes immature. Work ethic a question mark. Considered selfish 
by some. Not a strong blocker. Might have benefited from another 
year in school. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: Second WR taken, Top 20 pick -- possibly Pittsburgh  
(13). 
</P>
<P>
	KEVIN JOHNSON, Syracuse, 5-10 5/8, 188 -- Former QB who switched to  
WR when he lost the starting job to Donovan McNabb as a freshman. 
Tremendous kick returner ran a 4.31 40-yard dash. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Dynamic player. Blazing, deep speed. Big-play threat  
who can go all the way on every touch. Probably the fastest 
receiver in the draft. Still developing as a wideout. Huge upside. 
Elusive, natural runner after the catch. Returned five kicks for 
TDs in college. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Not very physical. Tends to catch the ball with his  
body instead of his hands. Must learn to adjust to coverages. Raw. 
Does not always play as fast as he is. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: Bottom half of first round, maybe to Giants (19),  
Arizona (21) or Miami (24). 
</P>
<P>
	TROY EDWARDS, Louisiana Tech, 5-9 7/8, 192 -- Playmaker won  
Biletnikoff Award as nation's best receiver. Caught 21 balls for 
NCAA-record 405 yards and three long scores against Nebraska last 
year. Ran a 4.57 40-yard dash. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Prolific college receiver. Played well when facing  
strong competition. Excellent hands. Dangerous after the catch. 
Holds Division I-A career record with 50 TD catches. Caught 140 
balls for 1,996 yards in '98. Acrobatic. Will go over the middle. 
Plays faster than his times suggest. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Short. Often faced subpar competition. Benefited  
from wide-open passing offense. Too many drops. Talks a lot. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: Second- or third-round choice, but he could be a  
steal. 
</P>
<P>
	PEERLESS PRICE, Tennessee, 5-10 7/8, 180 -- Talented pass-catcher  
had 199 yards receiving and TD against Florida State in national 
title game. Was MVP of SEC Championship game. Timed at 4.56 in 
40-yard dash. Stock is rising. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Plays best in big games. Short, quick moves. Strong  
on the sidelines. Good at separating from defender when ball 
arrives. Uses hands well. Impressive leaper. Good body control. 
Polished. Great workout in March. Comes from traditionally rich WR 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Not blazing speed or great size. Lost some  
explosiveness after leg injury in '97. Tendency to drop passes. 
Lacks natural hands. Some feel he's not as good as he thinks he is. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: Might jump into late first round, perhaps Atlanta  
(30). Otherwise a strong second-rounder. 
</P>
<P>
	OTHERS TO WATCH:   	
</P>
<P>
	-- D'Wayne Bates, Northwestern, 6-1 3/4, 215, big target fits NFL  
mold and had productive college career despite some nasty injuries. 
Has run a 4.47 40-yard dash since. Probably a second-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Darnell McDonald, Kansas State, 6-2 7/8, 190, tall wideout  
catches ball with his hands and could be a fine possession 
receiver. Possible sleeper. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Dee Miller, Ohio State, 5-11 3/8, 194, overshadowed somewhat by  
teammate Boston, but nearly as effective. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Tai Streets, Michigan, 6-1 1/2, 189, lanky producer had big  
senior season (team MVP) and outstanding combine. Excellent in red 
zone and on fade routes. Good blocker. Climbing charts fast. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Craig Yeast, Kentucky, 5-7 1/8, 161, undersized speedster owns  
SEC career record for catches (208). Phenomenal kick returner. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
                            *TIGHT ENDS   	
</P>
<P>
	POSITION OUTLOOK: Weak. Probably not a first-round pick in the  
group. Some think there might be depth further down, but there are 
no standouts and most are one-dimensional. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	JIM KLEINSASSER, North Dakota, 6-2 5/8, 274 -- Fine athlete who also  
played college basketball. Likened to Packers TE Mark Chmura. 
Caught 45 passes for 710 yards and five TDs in '98. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Strong drive blocker. Powerful frame. Tough and  
physical. Dominated at Division II level. Runs routes and cuts 
well. Releases off line smoothly. Agile. Good character. Timed at 
4.65 in 40-yard dash. Projected as a starter in NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Has not played against top competition. Not a  
polished receiver. Drops some passes. Doesn't always play up to his 
ability. Might take a while to make an impact. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: Second-round choice at best, maybe Giants (50),  
Buccaneers (51) or Buffalo (54). 
</P>
<P>
	OTHERS TO WATCH:   	
</P>
<P>
	-- Larry Brown, Georgia, 6-4 5/8, 262, huge target with good hands  
was also a fine college basketball player. Might be too slow and 
sluggish. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Dan Campbell, Texas A&AMP;M, 6-5 1/4, 264, physical blocker caught  
only seven passes last season. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Rufus French, Mississippi, 6-3 1/4, 251, junior, first-team  
All-American is an excellent pass-catcher with soft hands. Not a 
strong blocker. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Sheldon Jackson, Nebraska, 6-3 3/8, 237, fast, fluid and athletic  
receiver improved a lot in college. Limited as a blocker. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Reggie Kelly, Mississippi State, 6-3 3/4, 251, hard worker with  
untapped potential. Stock has risen. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Derrick Spiller, Texas A&AMP;M, 6-2 1/8, 242, fine receiver with  
speed creates coverage problems for LBs. Undersized with 
questionable work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Jerame Tuman, Michigan, 6-3 7/8, 240, nice all-around skills  
might make him second-best TE available. Good receiver, adequate 
blocker, great at nothing. 
</P>

<P>
                             *TACKLES   	
</P>
<P>
	POSITION OUTLOOK: An extremely deep class. Probably the position  
after QB with the most talent available. As many as seven could go 
in the first round, and at least five probably will. The group is 
missing that one dominant standout, however. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	JOHN TAIT, Brigham Young, 6-6 5/8 317, junior -- All-WAC performer  
in '97 and '98 spent two years on a church mission. Ran a 5.19 
40-yard dash. Played left tackle in college, but might project as a 
right tackle, for now. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Well-built with little fat. Good athlete. Excellent  
pass blocker. Uses hands well. Understands position. Aggressive. 
Good feet, body control and balance. Bends well. Hard worker. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Not as massive as many NFL tackles. Did not face  
great competition in college. Comes from school with suspect track 
record on linemen. Old for a rookie (24). 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: Top 10 pick, maybe eighth to Arizona or ninth to  
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	LONNIE ``L.J.'' SHELTON, Eastern Michigan, 6-5 3/4, 322 -- Big and  
athletic, he was extremely impressive at Senior Bowl and combine. 
Father, Lonnie Sr., was an All-Star during 10-year NBA career. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Plenty of potential. Thick upper body. Can probably  
carry even more weight. Excellent feet and aggressive hands. Sets 
up well for pass protection. Great balance. Had 102 knockdown 
blocks in '98. Stock is rising fast. Likened to Baltimore standout 
Jonathan Ogden and even Art Shell. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Did not play against top competition in college.  
Does not dominate consistently at point of attack. Work ethic might 
be a question mark. Lacks football experience. Gets lazy with 
technique. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: First-round choice, possibly to Chiefs (14).  
</P>
<P>
	AARON GIBSON, Wisconsin, 6-6 3/8, 380 -- First-team All-American and  
the biggest player ever at a school known for developing massive 
linemen. Despite his size, he might get moved to guard in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Mammoth, mountain of a man who just buried opponents  
in college. Awesome power. Well coached. More athletic than one 
would expect. Dominating run blocker. Huge wingspan. Worked hard to 
get into shape and become a player. Bench-presses 475 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Stamina is a concern because of his weight. Needs  
work on pass protection -- his team didn't throw much. Not real 
quick and has difficulty with footwork. Injured in Rose Bowl and 
couldn't play in Senior Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: Middle to late first-round pick. Might fit with  
Giants (19) or Arizona (21). 
</P>
<P>
	MATT STINCHCOMB, Georgia, 6-5 3/4, 297 -- First-team All-American  
excelled in the classroom, as well. Has run a 5.19 40-yard dash. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Projected as a natural, pass-protecting left tackle.  
Excellent technique. Strong upper body. Uses hands well. Lombardi 
Award finalist. Great work ethic. Student of the game. Extremely 
competitive. Will play through pain. Experienced and mature. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Gets knocked back sometimes. Finesse blocker and not  
very physical. Lacks great lower body strength and explosion. 
Struggled some against speed pass rushers. Had shoulder injury late 
in '98. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: Late first-round selection, maybe to Arizona (21),  
San Francisco (27) or Denver (31). 
</P>
<P>
	KRIS FARRIS, UCLA, 6-7 7/8, 322, junior -- Outland Trophy winner as  
nation's top lineman and first-team All-American in '98. His stock 
has dropped dramatically since season ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Huge. Did not allow a sack and gave up only three QB  
pressures last season. Good balance. Seals off outside rush. 
Adjusts smoothly in space. Cut blocks well for someone his size. 
Long arms and quick feet. Can slide and mirror pass rushers. Graded 
out at 96 percent against Texas last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Not especially athletic or strong. Super talent  
around him may have helped in college. Tall and gangly build. 
Played left tackle with a left-handed QB, so has not protected a 
passer's blind side. Bends at the waist. Doesn't use leverage well. 
Plays too tall. Questionable run blocker. Not explosive. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: Size could keep him in first round, otherwise he  
could fall far behind a host of other tackle prospects. 
</P>
<P>
	SOLOMON PAGE, West Virginia, 6-5 3/8, 309, junior -- Three-year  
starter has all the tools. Key component of a dangerous offense in 
college. Ran a 5.32 40-yard dash. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Nice upside. Good size. Athletic with quick feet.  
Long arms. Uses hands well. Good body control. Has skills to play 
left tackle in NFL. Makes solid hits on the move. Lots of talent. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Missing consistency. Plays too upright. Probably  
would have benefited from another year in school. Considered 
immature and lazy with technique at times. Can be provoked. Might 
be a bit of a project. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: Could go in first round, possibly to San Francisco  
(27) or Patriots (28). 
</P>
<P>
	OTHERS TO WATCH:   	
</P>
<P>
	-- Jon Jansen, Michigan, 6-6 1/2, 302, right tackle climbing on  
draft boards. A durable battler with good technique. Uses hands 
effectively. Athleticism has improved, but he's still a step slow. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Zach Piller, Florida, 6-5 3/4, 332, bench-pressed 225 pounds 40  
times, best at the combine. Plays mean, but limited mobility might 
make him a guard. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Chris Terry, Georgia, 6-4 3/4, 291, quiet former defensive  
lineman played in Stinchcomb's shadow. Good all-around athlete, but 
light. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Floyd Wedderburn, Penn State, 6-4 3/4, 333, some think he's  
underrated while others feel he's overrated. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
                              *GUARDS   	
</P>
<P>
	POSITION OUTLOOK: Not very strong. There are a handful of solid  
players, but it's unlikely any will make the first round. Only 
three college guards in the '90s have been picked in Round 1 and 
then played guard in NFL. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	DOUG BRZEZINSKI, Boston College, 6-4, 305 -- Blue-collar blocker  
was first-team All-Big East in '98. Added 10 pounds of muscle in 
offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Considered a throwback with a mean streak. A brawler.  
Pure guard. Good in tight areas. Excellent trap blocker. Uses 
leverage and extends arms well. Pass protects nicely. Had 102 
knockdown blocks last year. Started every game (46) during his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Missing great agility and quickness. Lacks range.  
Gets exposed outside. Not a gifted athlete. Might struggle against 
more athletic players. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: Early second-round selection, maybe St. Louis (36  
and 42). 
</P>
<P>
	DERRICK FLETCHER, Baylor, 6-6, 348 -- A former defensive lineman  
who played offensive tackle as a senior. Bench-presses 440 pounds 
and squats 805. Has run an eye-opening 5.21 40-yard dash. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Huge with real power. Strong run blocker. Explosive  
in a small area. Very quick off the ball. Long arms. Dominates in 
some situations. Can run and hit on sweeps. Light on his feet for 
his size. Did not allow a sack in '98. All kinds of potential. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Not effective on an island. Might be a bit too  
heavy. Still learning the position. Doesn't always play to his 
ability. Not considered a hard worker. Not as mobile laterally as 
scouts would like. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: Some team might love his size and potential, and  
grab him as high as the early second round. 
</P>
<P>
	OTHERS TO WATCH:   	
</P>
<P>
	-- Brandon Burlsworth, Arkansas, 6-3 3/8, 308, opponents laugh at  
this Drew Carey look-alike and then he handles them for four 
quarters. Athletic second-team All-American ran a 4.88 40-yard dash 
at combine -- fastest among offensive linemen. Former walk-on. 
Smart, tough and consistent. Pulls well. Must improve pass 
protection. Overachiever. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Anthony Cesario, Colorado State, 6-5 7/8, 306, second-team  
All-American takes good angles and plays tough in close. Locks on 
and stays with blocks. Intense. Wrist injury and strength a 
concern. Average athlete. Some teams love him, others aren't 
impressed. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
                             *CENTERS   	
</P>
<P>
	POSITION OUTLOOK: An average group, thin after Woody. He's the  
only first-round pick. NFL teams rarely look for centers early in 
the draft. The best of the rest might all drop to the second day. 
</P>
<P>
	DAMIEN WOODY, Boston College, 6-3 5/8, 319, junior -- Might be the  
best center to enter draft in years. Big part of effective ground 
game in college. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Aggressive and powerful drive blocker. Fires low. Has  
been making line calls since he was a freshman. Good size. Long 
arms. Moves well. Flexible and quick. Good feel for the game. Uses 
hands nicely. Outstanding pass protector. Naturally strong with 
good balance. Comes off the ball well. Graded 94 percent against 
Georgia Tech in '98. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Sometimes gets lazy and lacks consistency. Doesn't  
always finish his blocks or look for someone else to hit after 
initial assignment. Not a great athlete. Got heavier in offseason. 
Needs to work harder. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: First-round choice, possibly to Dallas (22) or Green  
Bay (25). 
</P>
<P>
	OTHERS TO WATCH:   	
</P>
<P>
	-- Eric de Groh, West Virginia, 6-4 5/8, 298, extremely intelligent,  
very competitive and durable. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Jamar Nesbit, South Carolina, 6-4 1/4, 329, massive player who  
might need to trim down to be effective. Can play guard and tackle 
as well. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Mike Newell, Colorado State, 6-3 5/8, 292, would be rated higher  
except for recent back surgery. Quick, strong and dedicated. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Craig Page, Georgia Tech, 6-2 1/2, 288, first-team All-American  
isn't big, but plays hard every down. Tenacious. Weightroom 
monster. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Grey Ruegamer, Arizona State, 6-4 5/8, 304, smart, agile and  
versatile -- can play a number of positions on the line. Tough and 
nasty with a temper.

</P>
<P>
                             *LINEMEN   	
</P>
<P>
	POSITION OUTLOOK: A slightly above average group with a decent  
mix of pass rushers and run stuffers. McFarland and Ekuban look 
like the only definite first-rounders, with the possible addition 
of Kerney. The class lacks a sure thing and probably won't have a 
player picked in the Top 15. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	ANTHONY McFARLAND, LSU, 6-0 3/8, 292 -- First-team All-American  
tackle is a disruptive force in the middle. Reminds some of Warren 
Sapp. Ran a speedy 4.79 40-yard dash. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Powerful arms and a thick lower body. Quick and fast  
with explosive strength. Took on double-teams throughout college 
career and still dominated at times. Good penetrator, spends lots 
of time in opponent's backfield. Intense. Has rare ability to take 
over a game from defensive tackle position. Had eight sacks as a 
nose tackle in '98. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Short. Does not go all out on every play. Not a  
two-gap player. Should use hands more to help shed blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: Middle of the first round, maybe to Patriots (20) or  
Dallas (22). Jacksonville (26) would probably love it if he 
slipped. 
</P>
<P>
	EBENEZER EKUBAN, North Carolina, 6-3 1/2, 261 -- End who has played  
defense for just two years after switching from TE. Very fast for a 
DE (4.63 40-yard dash). Physically impressive. Native of Ghana. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Unlimited potential and great work habits. Aggressive  
and intense. Intelligent. Explosive burst. Had 96 tackles and seven 
sacks last year. Broke Lawrence Taylor's school single-season 
record with 23 tackles for loss. Comes off ball well. Probably the 
best pure DE in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Shorter than NFL teams like for a DE. Still raw with  
a lot to learn. More speed than power, sometimes struggles against 
run. Instincts aren't there yet. Needs time to develop. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: Middle first-round pick, perhaps to Tennessee (16)  
or Oakland (18). 
</P>
<P>
	PATRICK KERNEY, Virginia, 6-5 1/8, 262 -- Second-team All-American  
end was a college lacrosse star, as well. Had 15 sacks last season. 
Ran a 4.72 40-yard dash. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Played extremely well against top competition,  
including Georgia standout tackle Matt Stinchcomb. Good-looking 
speed pass rusher with smarts. Plenty of moves. Turns the corner. 
Chases running plays effectively. Works hard in weight room. 
Bench-presses over 440 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Might struggle against run. Doesn't have bulk to be  
tough at point of attack. Needs to get stronger and be more 
physical. Hip injury forced him out of Senior Bowl. Couldn't run at 
combine. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: Late first-round selection. Jacksonville at No. 26  
or Denver (31) might be interested. 
</P>
<P>
	LAMAR KING, Saginaw Valley State, 6-3, 276 -- Improving end from  
small school is a former UPS employee. Was headed to Nebraska at 
one point. Has bulked up and weighs more now than at end of season. 
Ran a 4.78 40-yard dash and stock is soaring. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Lots of speed, energy and moves. Spins well.  
Potentially a dangerous pro pass rusher. Balanced in pursuit. 
Complete skills. Big upside. Dominated in college. Had 27 1/2 sacks in 
two years of college ball after superb JUCO performance. Tough. 
Ambidextrous. Tremendous athletic ability. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Played at Division II school against subpar  
competition. Could not play in Senior Bowl because of injury. Plays 
to level of opponents at times. Doesn't adjust well to cut blocks. 
Inexperienced and untested. An unknown quantity. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: Might jump into first round, especially if there is  
a run on DEs. Jacksonville (26) seems willing. Otherwise, early 
second round. 
</P>
<P>
	OTHERS TO WATCH:   	
</P>
<P>
	-- Tony Bryant, Florida State, 6-3 3/4, 268, end has all the  
measurables, but doesn't make enough plays. Not as good as recent 
DEs from FSU. Stock has dropped, but still could sneak into first 
or second round based on athletic ability. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Tom Burke, Wisconsin, 6-2, 243, first-team All-American end  
had 21 sacks in '98 and gives maximum effort. Undersized as a DE, 
could be moved to OLB to rush passer. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Ed Chester, Florida, 6-3 7/8, 294, second-team All-American  
tackle was highly touted until nasty knee injury in '98. Serious 
health concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Jared DeVries, Iowa, 6-3 7/8, 287, second-team All-American  
tackle blessed with quick step and ``farm strength.'' Could become 
a good pass rusher, but might be too light to play in the middle. 
Lots of effort. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Reggie McGrew, Florida, 6-1 5/8, 301, junior, tackle with a thick  
build who excels against the run. Maybe should have stayed in 
school, but might be a high pick. 
</P>
<P>
	-- John Thornton, West Virginia, 6-2 3/8, 304, tackle plays tough  
against the run. Fills holes and stacks up blockers. Used to 
double-teams. Quick, but must develop as a pass rusher. Projects as 
possible nose guard.

</P>
<P>
                           *LINEBACKERS   	
</P>
<P>
	POSITION OUTLOOK: Plenty of talent available including some real  
eye-popping athletes in Kearse, Katzenmoyer and Claiborne. The 
group of inside LBs is deeper than the crop of outside LBs. Many 
don't fit any one position well. Probably four, maybe five, will be 
chosen in the first round. There are solid players after that, too. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	JEVON KEARSE, Florida, 6-4 3/4, 252, junior -- Second-team  
All-American is as explosive as they come. Projects as either 
outside LB or DE, depending on team he's drafted by and its system. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Mind-boggling specimen is nicknamed ``The Freak''  
because of athletic ability. Great pass rusher. Tremendous size and 
speed (4.43 40-yard dash). Intense and powerful. Sometimes just 
destroys plays. Pass coverage skills. Had 7 1/2 sacks and 54 tackles 
in '98. Finalist for Butkus Award. Could be a Lawrence Taylor-type 
dominant pro. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: A 'tweener. Nobody is sure where to play him. Might  
be too small to play defensive end. Not a true outside LB. Raw 
talent. Didn't really have a position in college -- often just went 
after the ball. Might take time to find where he fits best. Some 
say he should be more productive and question his instincts. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: High first-round pick, possibly Washington (5) or  
Chicago (7). 
</P>
<P>
	CHRIS CLAIBORNE, Southern California, 6-2 5/8, 253, junior -- Inside  
linebacker was Butkus Award winner as nation's best LB and 
first-team All-American. Timed at 4.63 in 40-yard dash. Had 107 
tackles, five sacks, six INTs and two TDs last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Versatile and skilled. Big and fast. Makes plays all  
over the field. Pursues sideline to sideline with tremendous 
lateral agility. Great range. Fine hands. Relentless and fluid. 
Strong tackler. Can play inside or outside. Good pass rusher and 
cover skills -- rare combination. Excelled against Florida State. 
Pac-10 Defensive Player of the Year in '98. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Played poorly in Sun Bowl loss to TCU despite making  
13 tackles. Looked sluggish and slow. Must work on eluding low 
blocks. Did not run at combine. Some questions about work ethic. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: Top 10 pick, but a small chance he might slide.  
Could go as high as fourth (Colts), or maybe ninth (Lions). 
</P>
<P>
	ANDY KATZENMOYER, Ohio State, 6-3 5/8, 264, junior -- Inside LB  
started every game (37) at OSU. Butkus Award winner in '97. 
Arrested twice on alcohol-related charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Can change a game with one play. Big hitter.  
Remarkable ability. Size, speed and power. Loves to play. Flies to 
the ball. Chiseled physique. Burst onto college football scene with 
tremendous freshman season. Slides well laterally and closes fast 
on ball-carrier. Classic middle LB with nasty streak. A throwback. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Seemed to regress somewhat during his college  
career. Was better player as freshman and sophomore than junior. 
Didn't make enough plays in '98. After all the hype, might be 
better on paper than field. Struggled in classroom. Some scouts 
question his instincts and intelligence. Can be blocked. Winds up 
on the ground too much. Not a great pass rusher. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: Middle of the first round. Possibly to Tennessee  
(No. 16) or Oakland (No. 18). 
</P>
<P>
	RAHIM ABDULLAH, Clemson, 6-5 3/4, 233, junior -- Probably the best  
pure outside LB in the draft. First-team All-ACC in '98 with 7 1/2 
sacks, 89 tackles and 15 tackles for loss. Ran a 4.66 40-yard dash 
and has 35-inch vertical leap. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Playmaker with three TD returns in his career. Built  
well. Physical against the run and can play the pass. Tall, fast 
and athletic. Good blitzer. Strong instincts. Takes good pursuit 
angles. Still growing into his frame. Long arms. Good at knocking 
down passes and kicks. Nice upside. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Somewhat raw. A bit stiff. Did not run well at  
combine. Does not make all the routine plays. Missing consistency. 
A little gangly. Plays too erect and not real powerful. Might take 
time to develop. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: Possible first-round selection. Maybe to Oakland  
(18) if Katzenmoyer is gone, or Minnesota (29). 
</P>
<P>
	AL WILSON, Tennessee, 5-11 3/4, 239 -- First-team All-American  
inside LB was heart and soul of superb Tennessee defense 
responsible for national title last season. Ran a 4.56 40-yard 
dash. Tough guy could climb charts. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: An absolute warrior. Plays hurt and hates to lose.  
Adjusted well to mid-career switch from outside to inside. Great 
leader. Plays low to ground. Runs down ball-carriers. Rare speed. 
Very disruptive. Knocks over blockers. Hits everything with 
authority. Loves to mix it up. Tremendous tackler. Very intense. 
Knows how to play football. No-nonsense, just makes plays. Compared 
to Mike Singletary. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Undersized and short. History of injuries, including  
separated shoulder in '98. Sometimes plays out of control. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: Might sneak into first round but probably not. If  
healthy, could be a bargain lower down. 
</P>

	-- Barry Gardner, Northwestern, 6-0 1/2, 248, prolific tackler at  
inside LB, but not a great athlete. Gets to the ball, but lacks 
coverage skills. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Lamont Green, Florida State, 6-2 1/2, 230, all-world talent at  
outside LB, but somewhat of an underachiever. Has struggled with 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Hannibal Navies, Colorado, 6-2 3/8, 238, fits at outside LB  
athletically and has tools that can't be taught. Super speed, but 
doesn't make enough plays. Was slowed by injuries in '98. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Dat Nguyen, Texas A&AMP;M, 5-11 1/4, 231, won prestigious Lombardi  
and Bednarik Awards at inside LB. First-team All-American was 
tackling machine in college. Flies all over field and makes big 
hits, but he's small. Has added bulk since end of season, but it 
might not be enough. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Mike Peterson, Florida, 6-1 3/4, 224, second-team All-American is  
undersized as an outside LB, but productive and consistent. Just 
makes plays. Coaches love him. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Johnny Rutledge, Florida, 6-2 1/8, 246, complete inside LB is  
good in coverage. Fine lateral movement. Can play every down. 
Impressed at Senior Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Gary Stills, West Virginia, 6-1 1/4, 244, might fit perfectly as  
a relentless, pass-rushing outside LB in 3-4 scheme. History of 
injuries. Often out of control. Undisciplined. Old rookie (25). 
Could sneak into first round. 

</P>
<P>
                          *DEFENSIVE BACKS   	
</P>
<P>
	POSITION OUTLOOK: Tremendous class of cornerbacks -- albeit small  
-- is balanced by a weak group of safeties without a probable 
first-round pick. Bailey and McAlister, both rare talents, 
highlight the bunch. Edwards looks like the best safety prospect, 
but there could be a lucky catch further down. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	CHAMP BAILEY, Georgia, 6-0 5/8, 181, junior -- First-team  
All-American cornerback might be the best all-around player in the 
draft. Played both defense and offense in college like Charles 
Woodson. Ran a 4.42 40-yard dash and has 41-inch vertical leap. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Incredible athlete. Remarkably durable. Was on field  
for huge number of plays last season and seemed to maintain stamina 
and strength. Averaged more than 100 snaps per game. Was team's 
best WR, too. Skilled cover corner. Great closing speed and ball 
reactions. Superior body control. Explosive burst out of breaks. 
Fine hands. Exciting runner. Could be pro WR. Standout long jumper 
in track. Excels on special teams. Won Nagurski Award as country's 
premier defensive player. Gifted. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Slightly smaller than scouts hope for. Can build up  
his body more. Didn't play great in bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: Could go as high as third overall (to Cincinnati).  
Otherwise, probably fourth (Indianapolis) or fifth (Washington). 
</P>
<P>
	CHRIS McALISTER, Arizona, 6-0 3/4, 199 -- First-team All-American  
and an excellent kick returner. Had five INTs and 34 tackles in 
'98. Father, James, was All-America RB at UCLA and played in NFL. 
Ran a 4.45 40-yard dash. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Might be most coveted natural corner in draft because  
of size and strength. More typical of today's big, physical pro 
CBs. Named top special teams player in country last year. Good 
hitter. Very fluid with super body control. Solid build. Quick 
backpedal. Jams receivers at line. Fast to the ball. Sparkling 
private workout. Makes the INT instead of just knocking pass away. 
Excellent run-supporter. Great performance against Nebraska in 
Holiday Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Hands are not always reliable. Occasional  
concentration lapses. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: Top 10 to Top 15 selection. Might wind up at No. 11  
(Minnesota). 
</P>
<P>
	ANTOINE WINFIELD, Ohio State, 5-8 5/8, 180 -- First-team  
All-American won Thorpe Award as nation's top defensive back last 
year. Timed at 4.41 in 40-yard dash. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Provides excellent deep coverage and can take a top  
receiver out of the game all by himself. Excellent timing when 
jumping for the ball. Perhaps the best tackling CB to enter draft 
in years. Had 75 stops and two sacks in '98. Great on run support. 
Dynamite blitzer. Fires low out of backpedal. Tough and physical 
despite his stature. Aggressive. Played behind Seahawks CB Shawn 
Springs early in career. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Small. Tends to bite on play action. Doesn't always  
find ball instinctively. Bigger receivers can beat him on jump 
balls. Didn't have tremendous personal workout. More quick than 
fast. Did not intercept a pass in '98. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: Bottom half of the first round. Possibly to Buffalo  
(23). 
</P>
<P>
	FERNANDO BRYANT, Alabama, 5-11, 177 -- Athletic CB was first-team  
All-SEC last season. Had 51 tackles and two INTs. Two uncles, Ray 
and Don Griffin (a fine 49ers CB), played in NFL. Was timed at 4.48 
in 40-yard dash. Stock is rising. 
</P>
<P>
	Strengths: Quick feet and great body control. Impressive at  
Senior Bowl and private workout. Very smooth and fluid. Plants and 
drives on ball nicely. Explosive acceleration out of backpedal. 
Reads receivers' moves well. Good catch-up speed. Little wasted 
motion. Durable (40 straight starts). 
</P>
<P>
	Weaknesses: Not especially strong against the run. Not very  
physical. Some feel he's an underachiever. Broke his jaw in spring 
of '98. Could work harder. Does not have ideal size. Must get 
stronger. 
</P>
<P>
	Prediction: Late first-round or early second-round choice. If  
the Vikings don't get McAlister at No. 11, they might grab Bryant 
at No. 29. Green Bay (25) also might be interested. 
</P>
<P>
	OTHERS TO WATCH:   	
</P>
<P>
	-- Larry Atkins, UCLA, 6-2 7/8, 230, big, physical safety hits like  
a truck and forces turnovers, but poor in coverage. Second-team 
All-American. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Dre' Bly, North Carolina, 5-9 5/8, 197, junior, CB has fallen off  
charts considering how high he once was rated. Poor season in '98. 
Was often beaten deep. Still might land in second round based of 
stellar first two college seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Rich Coady, Texas A&AMP;M, 6-0 5/8, 203, former walk-on safety had  
surprisingly strong combine. Struggles in single coverage. Father, 
Richard Sr., played for Bears. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Antwan Edwards, Clemson, 5-11 7/8, 213, third-team All-American  
played both cornerback and safety in college and will likely move 
inside in NFL. Nice size, speed and athletic skills. Four-year 
starter. Not much of a hitter. Second-round choice. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Charles Fisher, West Virginia, 5-11 3/4, 186, inexperienced but  
athletic cornerback with size is moving up rapidly. Short on 
instincts. Worked out well. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Tony George, Florida, 5-11 7/8, 200, college cornerback will  
likely move to safety. Lacks great speed, but attacks the ball. 
Good tackler. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Daylon McCutcheon, Southern California, 5-8 3/4, 180, skilled but  
small cornerback might be second-round choice. Third-team 
All-American and four-year starter. Father, Lawrence, was All-Pro 
RB for Rams in 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Damon Moore, Ohio State, 5-11 3/8, 215, playmaking ballhawk at  
safety. Second-team All-American. Inconsistent. Good instincts, big 
hitter. Could be a steal. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Anthony Poindexter, Virginia, 6-1, 223, first-team  
All-American safety would have been sure first-rounder if not for 
serious knee injury in '98. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Fred Vinson, Vanderbilt, 5-10 5/8, 177, excellent cover  
cornerback is cousin and former college teammate of Cardinals 
safety Corey Chavous. Could be second-rounder. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
                           *SPECIALISTS   	
</P>
<P>
	POSITION OUTLOOK: An average group. It is unlikely any team will  
sacrifice a real high pick for a kicker or punter. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	KEEP AN EYE ON:   	
</P>
<P>
	-- Martin Gramatica, Kansas State, 5-8, 180, kicker with a cannon  
for a leg. Made a 65-yard FG against Northern Illinois. Could go on 
first day. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Jeff Hall, Tennessee, 5-11 3/8, 190, clutch, consistent kicker  
can make 50-yarder. Strong fundamentals. Possibly second-best PK. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Chris Sailer, UCLA, 5-8 3/4, 199, strong leg, but inconsistent.  
Was better as a junior than senior. Also can punt. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Rodney Williams, Georgia Tech, 6-0 1/8, 189, punter with a  
booming leg. Inconsistent and poor technique. Gets distance and 
hang time. Also a good athlete. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Hunter Smith, Notre Dame, 6-1 3/8, 218, punter with strong leg.  
Can pooch and directional kick well. Also can kick off. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Josh Bidwell, Oregon, 6-3 1/8, 228, punter with powerful leg and  
unlimited distance. Not polished. Gets punts off quickly. Tall and 
athletic.

<HEADLINE> Dems Seek Campaign Funding Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democrats are trying to prod reluctant  
Republican leaders into allowing quick action on legislation 
reining in the explosion of unregulated donations to political 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
	Using one of the few tactics available to the minority party to  
force a floor vote on a bill, Democrats began a ``discharge 
petition'' signature drive Wednesday. By late afternoon, they had 
185 signatures, all Democrats, of the 218 needed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The time to act on reform is now,'' said Rep. David Minge,  
D-Minn., a member of the so-called Blue Dogs, a group of moderate 
House Democrats who organized the signature campaign. ``With the 
money chase in recent election cycles at an all-time high, the 
problem seems only to be getting worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The goal is to get a vote on legislation sponsored by Reps.  
Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and Marty Meehan, D-Mass., that would 
ban federal ``soft money'' -- unlimited and unregulated donations to 
political parties -- and would expand disclosure requirements. It 
also would restrict issue ads, which seek to influence elections 
under the guise of educating voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Shays-Meehan bill overcame strong opposition from  
the GOP leadership to pass 252-179. A parallel Senate bill, 
sponsored by Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Russ Feingold, D-Wis., 
also had a majority 52 backers but died in the waning days of the 
session when it failed to get the 60 votes needed to overcome a 
filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, supporters have emphasized the need for an early  
start so they won't get buried in the end-of-session rush. ``It's 
now or never,'' said House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of 
Missouri. ``'Wait until August' is just another excuse for why the 
House won't pass campaign reform again this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has promised Shays  
that there will be a vote this year, and Hastert's spokesman, John 
Feehery, said Wednesday that the current thinking is to bring up 
the issue after the House finishes its work on year 2000 spending 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Shays, who had not yet signed the petition, urged his party to  
move more quickly. ``It would be a colossal mistake for Republican 
members of Congress to allow themselves to be dragged to the altar 
kicking and screaming,'' he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans, who generally have the edge on Democrats in  
raising money for political campaigns, say Shays-Meehan and similar 
bills violate constitutional rights to free speech by limiting the 
amounts that can be spent on elections.

<HEADLINE> Spanish Bank To Cut 3,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADRID, Spain (AP) -- Banco Santander Central Hispano says it  
will cut 3,000 jobs, or 2.8 percent of its work force, and shut as 
many as 700 branch offices over the next 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank is the product of a merger announced in January between  
Banco Santander and Banco Central Hispano in a stock swap valued at 
$11.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement late Tuesday to the Spanish stock market  
regulatory commission, the bank said the job cuts will be carried 
out through early retirements at a cost of about $650 million. 
</P>
<P>
	This amount will be charged to BSCH's reserves, pending approval  
from the Bank of Spain, the bank said. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company has 105,000 employees and 8,500 offices  
overall.

<HEADLINE> Leno Is Hollywood's No. 1 Motorhead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BURBANK, Calif. (AP) -- So many jalopies, so little time.  
</P>
<P>
	``Tonight Show'' host Jay Leno, Hollywood's consummate  
motorhead, has a personal stash of more than 100 cars and 
motorcycles -- he's not sure of the exact count -- in a 
43,000-square-foot warehouse near Burbank Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never sell anything,'' Leno said, ``and now I'm at the point  
where I can spend more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each piece of his collection has a name -- like Duesenberg,  
Rolls-Royce, Bentley, Packard, Maserati or Harley-Davidson. Then 
there's a fleet of rare vehicles that includes a 1913 Mercer 
Raceabout, a couple of Stanley Steamers and a 1946 Morgan 
barrelback three-wheeler. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty cars and 55 or 60 motorcycles. And they all run,  
maintained by the anvil-jawed comic and three mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
	Leno is not afraid to get his hands dirty. ``I like to fool  
around,'' he said. His head is often under a hood, while he's 
twisting a wrench, after taping his show at the NBC-TV studios four 
miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of his cars are prewar. But Leno also has modern cars,  
including several Dodge Vipers. 
</P>
<P>
	Leno drives a different vehicle to work every day, parking his  
pride-and-joy ``du jour'' in his assigned parking space at NBC. The 
``Tonight Show'' Internet site describes the car he drives to work 
each day in a feature called Jay's Garage. 
</P>
<P>
	On a recent day it was a 1989 Ford Festiva (well, sort of). He  
bought a Festiva and a Ford Taurus 5-speed SHO and put the Taurus 
engine and transmission in the back seat of the Festiva and added a 
nitrous oxide (laughing gas) bottle to boost the horsepower. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just a bit of a hot rod,'' Leno smiled.  
</P>
<P>
	His favorite?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm enamored with the Duesenbergs,'' he said after thinking a  
minute. Hollywood's encyclopedia of motorcars then seemed to regret 
the answer as his car collection flashed through his memory bank. 
</P>
<P>
	He defended his passion for cars, one shared by Tim Allen, Jerry  
Seinfeld and Nicolas Cage, saying with a laugh: ``It's cheaper than 
crack and hookers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leno's wife Mavis puts up with his hobby.  
</P>
<P>
	``My wife collects English literature and I collect cars. They  
don't mesh, other than she learns a little about cars and I learn a 
little about literature,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He gets a kick out of Hollywood's reaction when he shows up  
behind the wheel for show business events or parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say, 'Gee, Jay Leno came here and he drove himself.' If  
you're well-known in Hollywood, they expect you to have a driver 
and a limousine. It's like saying, 'He ate the food himself!' 
They're just amazed. It's so stupid,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When he arrived in California, his only wheels were on a 1955  
Buick Roadmaster. It's in the warehouse, too. He doesn't have his 
first car, a 1934 Ford pickup, but he wishes he did. 
</P>
<P>
	Leno grew up when cars were a big deal. He paid $350 for the  
dented '34 Ford when he was 14, even though he wouldn't have a 
driver's license for two years. He sanded, painted and buffed it 
every day. His parents bought him new upholstery. 
</P>
<P>
	In his autobiography, ``Leading With My Chin,'' Leno remembers  
the day there was a rainstorm while he was in school and water was 
drenching his new upholstery. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then suddenly through the window I saw my mom and dad tear  
into the parking lot. They screeched up next to my truck and 
dragged a huge piece of plastic out of their car. Then they covered 
the truck in the pouring rain. I watched them do this. And I just 
began crying right there in class. That memory has always stayed 
with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Leno won the Meguiar's Award that recognizes car buffs.  
He was praised by Barry Meguiar, whose company sells car-care 
products, as ``a pure hobbyist who has helped elevate the status of 
the collector car hobby to what it is today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Expanding his passion, the comic writes a monthly column for  
Popular Mechanics magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Leno has also established a scholarship at McPherson College in  
Kansas, the only college in the country that offers an associate 
degree in automobile restoration. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've lost sight in this country of people who can do things  
with their hands,'' Leno said. ``I think there are a lot of kids in 
this country who are good mechanics and their parents discourage 
them by saying there's no future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leno's frustration at finding a machinist inspired the  
scholarship. The old craftsmen in America have retired or died and 
no one is passing on these skills, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was a kid, if you weren't smart you went into shop,''  
he said. ``But there are people who have a natural affinity to that 
sort of thing. If you're a kid and interested in being a machinist, 
here's a scholarship that's there for them.''

<HEADLINE>  Quayle To Run for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Former Vice President Dan Quayle, trying  
to refurbish his image and jump-start his GOP presidential 
campaign, declared his candidacy Wednesday by pledging to rebuild 
American values after ``a dishonest decade of Bill Clinton and Al 
Gore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking office for the first time since he and President Bush  
succumbed to Clinton and Gore in 1992, the former Indiana senator 
sought to push beyond a history of political gaffes and 
controversies. ``Murphy Brown is gone,'' he said, ``and I'm still 
here fighting for the American family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's use of the TV sitcom in the 1992 campaign to highlight  
a ``poverty of values'' brought him criticism and ridicule from 
some quarters. But he returned to the theme Wednesday, betting that 
primary voters will reward him for casting a spotlight on the 
family-values debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question in life is not whether you get knocked down. You  
will. The question is, are you ready to get back up, are you 
willing to get back up and fight for what you believe in?'' Quayle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of nearly 6,000, packed to the gym rafters at his former  
high school, shouted ``Q2K! Q2K! Q2K!'' for Quayle-2000. Fireworks 
exploded before and after his speech, covering the stage in a haze 
of smoke. Rock music, hundreds of handpainted signs and an 
appearance by ball-tossing former Chicago Bears quarterback Jim 
McMahon gave the announcement a pep rally feeling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have come back home to announce that I will seek and I will  
win the presidency of the United States,'' Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who succeeded Quayle as vice president and is seeking the  
Democratic presidential nomination, was singled out by Quayle for 
calling President Clinton a great leader during the impeachment 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``What arrogance. What disdain for the values that parents are  
trying to teach their children. What contempt for the rule of 
law,'' Quayle said. ``This should not stand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are coming to the end of a dishonest decade of Bill Clinton  
and Al Gore,'' he said. ``It's time we work to reclaim the values 
that made America great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's staff dismissed the attack. Spokesman Chris Lehane said,  
``Dan Quayle's vision of America will take us back to the Dark Ages 
of the last GOP administration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing relaxed and in command of his topics, Quayle spoke  
from notes and varied from a draft of the speech given to 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	He promoted his proposed 30 percent across-the-board tax cut,  
billing it as a boon to middle-income families. 
</P>
<P>
	And he portrayed himself as the best qualified potential  
commander-in-chief, recalling his participation in White House war 
councils. After Bush picked him as vice president, Quayle had 
withstood withering criticism for having joined the Indiana 
National Guard years earlier, thus avoiding service in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can only get so much from briefing books and crash  
courses. You need experience,'' Quayle said. Texas Gov. George W. 
Bush, the early favorite for the GOP nomination, is getting scores 
of private briefings to bone up on foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``A presidency is not to be inherited,'' Quayle said.  
</P>
<P>
	Aides would not say whether Quayle was alluding to Gore or the  
Texas governor -- or perhaps both. Gore is Clinton's choice to win 
in 2000, and Bush is the son of the former president. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked for comment, Bush campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said  
simply, ``Governor Bush congratulates Vice President Quayle on his 
announcement and wishes him well. Governor Bush intends to campaign 
by laying out a positive vision for a brighter future for 
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle himself wants to inherit President Bush's mantle.  
</P>
<P>
	The former vice president, 52, is a long shot for the nomination  
despite his popularity among grass-roots activists and his strong 
organization in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  Quayle To Run for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Former Vice President Dan Quayle, trying  
to refurbish his image and jump-start his GOP presidential 
campaign, declared his candidacy Wednesday by pledging to rebuild 
American values after ``a dishonest decade of Bill Clinton and Al 
Gore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking office for the first time since he and President Bush  
succumbed to Clinton and Gore in 1992, the former Indiana senator 
sought to push beyond a history of political gaffes and 
controversies. ``Murphy Brown is gone,'' he said, ``and I'm still 
here fighting for the American family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's use of the TV sitcom in the 1992 campaign to highlight  
a ``poverty of values'' brought him criticism and ridicule from 
some quarters. But he returned to the theme Wednesday, betting that 
primary voters will reward him for casting a spotlight on the 
family-values debate. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question in life is not whether you get knocked down. You  
will. The question is, are you ready to get back up, are you 
willing to get back up and fight for what you believe in?'' Quayle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of nearly 6,000, packed to the gym rafters at his former  
high school, shouted ``Q2K! Q2K! Q2K!'' for Quayle-2000. Fireworks 
exploded before and after his speech, covering the stage in a haze 
of smoke. Rock music, hundreds of handpainted signs and an 
appearance by ball-tossing former Chicago Bears quarterback Jim 
McMahon gave the announcement a pep rally feeling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have come back home to announce that I will seek and I will  
win the presidency of the United States,'' Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who succeeded Quayle as vice president and is seeking the  
Democratic presidential nomination, was singled out by Quayle for 
calling President Clinton a great leader during the impeachment 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``What arrogance. What disdain for the values that parents are  
trying to teach their children. What contempt for the rule of 
law,'' Quayle said. ``This should not stand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are coming to the end of a dishonest decade of Bill Clinton  
and Al Gore,'' he said. ``It's time we work to reclaim the values 
that made America great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's staff dismissed the attack. Spokesman Chris Lehane said,  
``Dan Quayle's vision of America will take us back to the Dark Ages 
of the last GOP administration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing relaxed and in command of his topics, Quayle spoke  
from notes and varied from a draft of the speech given to 
reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	He promoted his proposed 30 percent across-the-board tax cut,  
billing it as a boon to middle-income families. 
</P>
<P>
	And he portrayed himself as the best qualified potential  
commander-in-chief, recalling his participation in White House war 
councils. After Bush picked him as vice president, Quayle had 
withstood withering criticism for having joined the Indiana 
National Guard years earlier, thus avoiding service in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can only get so much from briefing books and crash  
courses. You need experience,'' Quayle said. Texas Gov. George W. 
Bush, the early favorite for the GOP nomination, is getting scores 
of private briefings to bone up on foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``A presidency is not to be inherited,'' Quayle said.  
</P>
<P>
	Aides would not say whether Quayle was alluding to Gore or the  
Texas governor -- or perhaps both. Gore is Clinton's choice to win 
in 2000, and Bush is the son of the former president. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked for comment, Bush campaign spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said  
simply, ``Governor Bush congratulates Vice President Quayle on his 
announcement and wishes him well. Governor Bush intends to campaign 
by laying out a positive vision for a brighter future for 
America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle himself wants to inherit President Bush's mantle.  
</P>
<P>
	The former vice president, 52, is a long shot for the nomination  
despite his popularity among grass-roots activists and his strong 
organization in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	He joins a crowded field of conservative candidates wrestling  
over the same votes. His campaign team has come together slowly. 
And he raised about $2 million in the first quarter of 1999 -- $1 
million less than projected. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's largest obstacle is what one supporter calls the  
``potato factor'' -- a reference to the day he misspelled the word 
in a classroom full of school children. That and other miscues 
turned the vice president into a punch line for countless jokes, 
cementing for many American the perception that Quayle was 
ill-suited for the job.

<HEADLINE> Holocaust Survivors To Get Checks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Holocaust survivors and their families should  
begin receiving settlements on unpaid insurance claims by this 
fall, the chairman of an international commission says. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not be successful until we have begun to pay some  
claims,'' said former Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, who 
heads the International Commission on the Holocaust Era. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission hopes to establish procedures by the end of May  
about how to identify and pay claims on insurance policies issued 
to Holocaust survivors or the heirs of people killed by the Nazis 
during World War II, the Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Many European Jews purchased life or property insurance policies  
in an effort to protect their assets in the uncertain days leading 
up to the war. 
</P>
<P>
	Six European insurance companies -- Assicurazioni Generali of  
Italy, Allianz of Germany, AXA of France, Winterthur, Baseler and 
Zurich of Switzerland -- belong to the commission, charged with 
resolving unpaid insurance claims by Holocaust victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Eagleburger said the companies set up a $100 million fund. Of  
that, $90 million will be used to pay apparently valid claims that 
cannot be substantiated because records were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	The other $10 million will go toward operating expenses.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Hits New York City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There was the joke about nuclear weapons -- and  
how exactly President Clinton knew how many China had. There was 
the wisecrack about campaign contributions and the reference to 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan as ``my old friend.'' There 
was even a lawyer joke. 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji visited New York City on Tuesday to  
talk trade. In the process, he maintained what many say is a more 
collegial and open style that includes off-the-cuff remarks and 
humor that belies the tough image so important to China as it 
negotiates for membership in the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider his quip about Hong Kong newspapers, which he says have  
described economic concessions he has made in trade talks as ``a 
gift'' to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `Could you please not put it that way? It might be  
construed as a political contribution,''' Zhu deadpanned. China has 
faced accusations in recent months that it tried to channel money 
to the Clinton-Gore campaign in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu characterized his U.S. visit as a crucial step toward  
opening Chinese markets to more foreign investment. He said he was 
undeterred by bumps in trade negotiations last week, telling the 
U.S.-China Business Council and The Economic Club of New York that 
``in the broad history of China-U.S. relations, these are small 
matters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, the U.S. and Chinese governments agreed to  
``move intensively'' toward resolving sticking points in the trade 
agreement that would lead to WTO membership for China. Both sides 
predicted an agreement by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
	Membership in the WTO, which regulates world trade, would give  
China a say in global trade rules and help open the country to 
foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
	China, whose doctrinaire communism kept its markets tightly  
state-controlled until the early 1980s, has been embracing 
capitalism guardedly while simultaneously trying to retain 
government control over its economy. It now has its own stock 
markets, and the National Association of Securities Dealers, which 
operates the Nasdaq stock market, announced Tuesday it would open 
an office in Shanghai by mid-2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu's nine-day, six-city visit comes at a time when tensions  
between China and the United States are high on other fronts as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, in addition to continual criticism of China's  
human-rights record and the campaign-finance charges, U.S. 
officials have accused Beijing of spying. Zhu said he doubted the 
espionage charges and had asked President Jiang Zemin and military 
leaders about them. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said they knew nothing about this,'' he told CNN in an  
interview Tuesday afternoon. ``If you want to investigate, we will 
be willing to assist it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	China has long denounced human-rights criticism as meddling in  
its internal affairs, but some of Zhu's comments Tuesday indicated 
a willingness to listen. He said improving rule of law is a 
pressing need in China, and insisted leaders are committed to 
improving human rights -- in a way that best suits China. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not afraid of democracy. We are not afraid of rule of  
law. We are not against human rights,'' he said. ``China's senior 
leaders, when we were young, we were fighting for human rights and 
democracy and rule of law. How could we be against such things?''

<HEADLINE> Five Children Die When Car Sinks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EPHRATA, Wash. (AP) -- A car carrying seven people plunged off a  
rural gravel road and into a swift-flowing irrigation canal, where 
it sank upside down. Five children were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Two women, the children's mothers, escaped from the car through  
the driver's side window and swam to safety after the accident 
Tuesday evening, the Grant County sheriff's office said. They went 
to a nearby home to seek help. 
</P>
<P>
	The car was pulled from the water about two hours later and the  
bodies of the five boys were found in the back seat of the small, 
two-door car. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of traumatized people,'' said Undersheriff  
Mike Shay, who pulled the bodies out. ``Five children is a 
traumatic thing. You look at those five kids you think of your own 
children and grandchildren.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The children were identified as Alexis Curiel, 2; Jose Curiel  
Jr., 4; Jose Chavez, 3; Martin Chavez, Jr., 2; and Victor Eduardo 
Chavez, 11. None appeared to have been wearing seat belts and no 
child seats were found, Shay said. 
</P>
<P>
	Their mothers, Rosa Curiel, 24, and Maria Chavez, 32, were  
treated at a hospital and released. The families had been in the 
area for three years, the sheriff's office said. 
</P>
<P>
	The women had been traveling the canal access road on their way  
to visit a friend, Shay said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ephrata, with about 6,000 residents, is about 130 miles east of  
Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	The arid region is crisscrossed with huge canals of the federal  
Columbia Basin Project, which distributes water from Grand Coulee 
Dam to hundreds of thousands of acres of potatoes and other crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Water in the canals can be more than 10 feet deep, depending on  
the time of year, and treacherous. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, four divers drowned in an irrigation canal near Yakima,  
about 100 miles southwest of Ephrata. Two of the divers were trying 
to retrieve abandoned and submerged cars, and the other two were 
search and rescue divers sent after them.

<HEADLINE> Worker-Safety Agency Under Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The fathers of two men killed in accidents on  
the job are urging senators to help the government meet its mandate 
to protect the health and safety of the nation's work force. 
</P>
<P>
	But while blaming the Occupational Safety and Health  
Administration for their sons' deaths, both said Tuesday they want 
to help, not hurt, the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``OSHA is needed but it needs reform,'' said Ron Hayes, of  
Fairhope, Ala., whose 19-year-old son died in 1993 after being 
sucked into a Florida grain elevator. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department said the charges leveled against the  
agency, which it oversees, and some of its staff, were ``groundless 
and untrue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hayes and Charles LeCroy of Tallahassee, Fla., testified for a  
proposal by Sen. Michael Enzi, R-Wyo., to help the agency by 
enlisting private consultants to inspect work sites, freeing 
federal workers to concentrate on the most dangerous sites. 
</P>
<P>
	Enzi, chairman of the employment, safety and training panel of  
the Senate Health, Labor, Education and Pensions Committee, said 
workers are at risk because of the agency's inability to police the 
more than 6 million places of employment. 
</P>
<P>
	``Serious and potentially deadly practices go uninspected and  
unstopped,'' he said. ``The result is disastrous and, 
unfortunately, is often fatal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LeCroy, whose son died in a 1994 explosion at a Florida paper  
mill, said inspectors visited the site several times and knew the 
equipment was inferior. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yet OSHA did not force the mill to correct the problems, nor  
did they declare the work area to be unsafe,'' LeCroy said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement distributed after the hearing, Charles Jeffress,  
assistant secretary of labor for occupational safety and health, 
defended the agency and criticized what he called the ``one-sided, 
inaccurate testimony'' presented. 
</P>
<P>
	``OSHA sets high professional standards and holds its staff to  
them,'' he said. ``Our compliance officers are dedicated to 
enforcing the law, not breaking it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Labor Department officials did not testify at Tuesday's hearing.  
</P>
<P>
	At a hearing in March, Jeffress said Enzi's plan would undermine  
the agency's mandate because of inherent conflict of interest and 
accountability problems. 
</P>
<P>
	He said inspectors are concentrating on the most hazardous  
workplaces, spending less time at safer ones and are using Labor 
Department data to target inspections to industries with the 
highest injury and illness rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeffress also announced the appointment Tuesday of Art DeCoursey  
as a special liaison to help victims and their families get 
information from OSHA. DeCoursey is Jeffress' liaison for small 
business. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Clintons Pay $89,951 in U.S. Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, paid  
a smaller part of their 1998 income in federal taxes than the 
average person in their bracket, giving the government 17 percent 
of the $504,109 they earned. 
</P>
<P>
	Tax returns released Tuesday by the White House showed the  
Clintons earned $65,402 less than they did in 1997 and paid $89,951 
in federal taxes this year. They overpaid their taxes by $4,267, 
which will be applied to next year's tax bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, paid $52,951 in  
federal taxes for 1998, or 23 percent of $224,132 in adjusted gross 
income. After being criticized for giving only $353 to charity the 
year before, the Gores opened their wallets wide in 1998 with 
$15,197 in gifts to causes including religious institutions, 
education organizations, groups that aid the homeless and mentally 
ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons' 1998 return closely mirrored that from the  
previous year, when they reported $569,511 in adjusted gross income 
and paid $91,964, or 16 percent, in federal taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Among recent presidents at similar points in their White House  
years, the Bushes paid 15 percent of their incomes in federal taxes 
in 1991 and 22 percent in 1990, the Reagans 27.5 percent and 25 
percent in 1986 and 1987, the Carters 34 percent and 33 percent in 
1978 and 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent Internal Revenue Service statistics say  
taxpayers earning between $200,000 and $500,000 from 1994 to 1996 
paid in taxes an average of 25.5 percent of adjusted gross income. 
For incomes between $500,000 and $1 million, the average was 30 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, 1.2 million taxpayers had adjusted gross incomes  
between $200,000 and $500,000, and 200,000 incomes between $500,000 
and $1 million. That's out of 120.4 million tax returns filed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons reported $509,345 in total income, reduced to  
$504,109 after deduction of self-employment taxes. Income sources 
included $200,000 from Clinton's salary as president, $16,665 in 
interest, $16,736 in dividends, $1,329 in taxable refunds or 
credits, $74,289 in business income, $200,318 in capital gains and 
$8 in other income from two small investments. 
</P>
<P>
	The dividend and interest income included $12,000 from the Henry  
G. Freeman Jr. Pin Money Fund, a trust fund established in 1912 for 
the spouse of the president. As in previous years, the first lady 
will contribute that money to charity, the White House said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clintons took a $161,938 deduction for charitable gifts,  
including $99,220 for gifts in 1998 and $62,718 in gifts carried 
over from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
	The $74,289 in business income came from profits generated by a  
book written several years ago by Mrs. Clinton about child rearing, 
``It Takes a Village.'' Proceeds from another book she wrote, about 
the family cat, Socks, and dog, Buddy, go directly to the National 
Park Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	White House press secretary Joe Lockhart said all book income is  
donated to charity, minus taxes and administrative expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The first family received $53,462 in short-term capital gains  
and $146,856 in long-term capital gains -- both from the Pell Rudman 
Trust Co., holder of a private trust for the Clintons. The 
arrangement shields the Clintons from involvement with their 
investments and prevents public disclosure of their income sources.

<HEADLINE>  Colombian Rebels Release 6 Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Leftist rebels have released six  
hostages from a hijacked Avianca airliner that was forced to land 
by several pistol-waving passengers on a remote northern Colombian 
airstrip. 
</P>
<P>
	The hostages were freed Tuesday in the rural area of San Pablo,  
not far from the landing field where the twin-engine Fokker 50, 
carrying 41 passengers and five crew, landed after being 
commandeered Monday en route from the northeastern city of 
Bucaramanga to the capital of Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
	The freed hostages, turned over to the International Red Cross,  
were quickly examined at a local hospital and then put on a 
helicopter headed for Bucaramanga. 
</P>
<P>
	Those freed and apparently in good health included a 76-year-old  
Italian catholic lay worker, Giovanni Ferrazi; a three-month-old 
baby and his grandmother; and an elderly couple, Luis Florez and 
his wife, Lilia Davila, whose children had pleaded for kidnappers 
to release the 72-year-olds with histories of heart and lung 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``They treated us very well,'' Florez told the RCN television  
network, referring to his captors. Florez said all of the 
passengers and crew members still being held hostage were in good 
condition and well cared for. 
</P>
<P>
	No group has claimed responsibility for the hijacking.  
</P>
<P>
	Florez and Red Cross officials said they could not identify  
which rebel group was responsible for the seizure, but President 
Andres Pastrana said Tuesday the government believed the National 
Liberation Army, the country's No. 2 guerrilla band, was to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	The liberated hostages described the harrowing highjacking by  
passengers who sprung from their seats minutes after takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Florez said the men rose from their seats, placed ski masks over  
their heads and told the passengers to keep their heads down. 
</P>
<P>
	Once on the ground, Florez said the plane's occupants were  
marched off the airstrip and through knee-deep water on their way 
to riverboats, which shuttled them to the jungle camp where they 
were held until Tuesday's release. 
</P>
<P>
	Security forces sent to the airstrip in Vijagual, 220 miles  
north of Bogota, found an abandoned rebel camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5,000-member National Liberation Army, or ELN, is the most  
active rebel group in the region, which has seen fierce combat in 
recent months between guerrillas and their paramilitary rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	The kidnappers were thought to have headed with their quarry  
into the adjacent San Lucas range, a mountainous region that rebels 
have traditionally used for hiding kidnap victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Embassy said it was trying to confirm local media  
reports an American was on the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Pastrana's spokesman said a rescue attempt was unlikely.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see that as a possibility,'' Otto Gutierrez told  
Caracol radio. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  Colombian Rebels Release 6 Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Leftist rebels have released six  
hostages from a hijacked Avianca airliner that was forced to land 
by several pistol-waving passengers on a remote northern Colombian 
airstrip. 
</P>
<P>
	The hostages were freed Tuesday in the rural area of San Pablo,  
not far from the landing field where the twin-engine Fokker 50, 
carrying 41 passengers and five crew, landed after being 
commandeered Monday en route from the northeastern city of 
Bucaramanga to the capital of Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
	The freed hostages, turned over to the International Red Cross,  
were quickly examined at a local hospital and then put on a 
helicopter headed for Bucaramanga. 
</P>
<P>
	Those freed and apparently in good health included a 76-year-old  
Italian catholic lay worker, Giovanni Ferrazi; a three-month-old 
baby and his grandmother; and an elderly couple, Luis Florez and 
his wife, Lilia Davila, whose children had pleaded for kidnappers 
to release the 72-year-olds with histories of heart and lung 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``They treated us very well,'' Florez told the RCN television  
network, referring to his captors. Florez said all of the 
passengers and crew members still being held hostage were in good 
condition and well cared for. 
</P>
<P>
	No group has claimed responsibility for the hijacking.  
</P>
<P>
	Florez and Red Cross officials said they could not identify  
which rebel group was responsible for the seizure, but President 
Andres Pastrana said Tuesday the government believed the National 
Liberation Army, the country's No. 2 guerrilla band, was to blame. 
</P>
<P>
	The liberated hostages described the harrowing highjacking by  
passengers who sprung from their seats minutes after takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
	Florez said the men rose from their seats, placed ski masks over  
their heads and told the passengers to keep their heads down. 
</P>
<P>
	Once on the ground, Florez said the plane's occupants were  
marched off the airstrip and through knee-deep water on their way 
to riverboats, which shuttled them to the jungle camp where they 
were held until Tuesday's release. 
</P>
<P>
	Security forces sent to the airstrip in Vijagual, 220 miles  
north of Bogota, found an abandoned rebel camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The 5,000-member National Liberation Army, or ELN, is the most  
active rebel group in the region, which has seen fierce combat in 
recent months between guerrillas and their paramilitary rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	The kidnappers were thought to have headed with their quarry  
into the adjacent San Lucas range, a mountainous region that rebels 
have traditionally used for hiding kidnap victims. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Embassy said it was trying to confirm local media  
reports an American was on the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Pastrana's spokesman said a rescue attempt was unlikely.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see that as a possibility,'' Otto Gutierrez told  
Caracol radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia's weak central government has little or no control over  
vast areas that are dominated -- and terrorized -- by an assortment 
of increasingly brazen armed groups. 
</P>
<P>
	A country of 40 million, Colombia has the world's highest

<HEADLINE> US, NATO Study WWII Yugoslav Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pentagon and NATO officials considering ground  
troop options for Yugoslavia are studying the history of Yugoslav 
resistance during World War II, when hundreds of thousands of 
German soldiers failed to pacify determined guerrilla opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nazi campaign was called Operation Punishment, reflecting  
Adolf Hitler's rage against Yugoslav partisans who overthrew their 
own government after Belgrade made a pact with Berlin. The campaign 
was well-named -- Yugoslav civilians were attacked with an intensity 
far beyond anything NATO would contemplate. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, though, the Wermacht took plenty of punishment. And  
five decades later, the campaign offers lessons for any force 
reckoning to do battle with the hardy ``South Slavs'' who plagued 
the German army in a costly guerrilla war. 
</P>
<P>
	When NATO first studied ground troop options last fall, Clinton  
administration planners cited the German experience as one reason 
to rule out ground troops as an option in the Kosovo crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We always look at historical campaigns -- that's something we  
always do'' when planning a deployment, said Maj. Shelly 
Stellwagen, an Army spokeswoman. But she cautioned, ``History alone 
is not enough -- you've got to look at the big picture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After insisting for weeks that no plans for ground troops were  
in the works, top Clinton administration officials now concede that 
some contingencies were studied and that plans could be activated 
quickly if NATO decided on a ground assault. U.S. lawmakers, 
frustrated with the continuing ethnic cleansing in the Kosovo 
province of Yugoslavia despite a three-week NATO air campaign, are 
pushing a resolution to authorize ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon planners said they were careful not to overdo the  
comparison of two markedly different armies fighting with different 
equipment in different political contexts. Moreover, Yugoslavia 
today constitutes a country less than half the size of the one the 
German army invaded in 1941. But the difficulty of the terrain and 
the stubbornness of the Yugoslav people remain powerful common 
denominators, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The German invasion force of nearly 200,000 -- a figure some U.S.  
officials have cited as necessary to invade Yugoslavia today -- 
fluctuated after 1941 from a low of 60,000 to a high of 700,000. 
Through it all, the Germans were never able to quell the multiple 
and dogged Yugoslav resistance forces. 
</P>
<P>
	An official U.S. Army history of the campaign, written in the  
early 1950s, contained a warning for any future force contemplating 
challenging Yugoslavia on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``The success achieved by the (Yugoslav) guerrillas against the  
Germans ... strengthened considerably the tradition of resistance 
to foreign occupation forces,'' the Army history concluded. ``There 
is little doubt that a foreign invader today, whether from East or 
West, would be confronted with a formidable task of pacification 
following a successful campaign against the regular forces of the 
Balkan nations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Hitler planned Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of  
the Soviet Union, he wanted to secure his southern flank by 
neutralizing Greece. To do that he needed Yugoslavia's cooperation, 
and in early 1941 he thought he had it. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hitler badly misjudged the sentiments of the Yugoslav  
people. 
</P>
<P>
	A coup in March 1941 toppled Yugoslavia's royal government,  
setting a precedent that undoubtedly influences the thinking of 
Yugoslavia's current leadership: Governments that cave in to 
foreign pressure will be ousted from within. 
</P>
<P>
	Hitler, in a rage, ordered the carpet-bombing of Belgrade.  
</P>
<P>
	Hitler's War Directive No. 25 said, ``The ground installations  
of the Yugoslav air force and the city of Belgrade will be 
destroyed from the air by continual day and night attacks.'' The 
strikes began 58 years ago this month, on April 6, 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	The Germans aimed specifically at killing civilians during 48  
hours of near-continuous bombing. Hitler wanted to spare 
Yugoslavia's factories for his own use. NATO, by contrast, has been 
seeking to avoid civilian casualties while aiming at destroying 
Yugoslav military and weapons installations. The Germans used 1,000 
attack and escort aircraft in those 48 hours. NATO has employed 700 
-- soon to be 1,000 -- strike and support aircraft in three weeks of 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Estimated death tolls from the Nazi bombing range widely, but  
published German and American estimates put the total as high as 
17,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The German ground invasion consisted of a dozen divisions --  
roughly 180,000 troops -- supplemented by forces from Bulgaria and 
Italy. German forces completed their conquest of the Balkans in 11 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	But the lightning conquest only began Germany's troubles in the  
Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite brutal tactics, summary executions and wholesale burning  
of villages, German forces assaulted guerrilla strongholds again 
and again only to see the rebels slip into the hills and forests. 
By mid-1943, the U.S. Army history recounted, ``It was obvious that 
more German troops would be required if the Balkans were to be 
held.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Total German forces peaked at 700,000 at the beginning of 1943,  
though many of these troops were either green or battle-weary 
veterans resting from the Russian front. No precise casualty 
figures exist for German forces in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Belgrade fell to the westward-marching Russians on Oct. 20,  
1944.

<HEADLINE> Amazon.com Plans Kansas Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COFFEYVILLE, Kan. (AP) -- Online retail giant Amazon.com plans to  
open its largest distribution center, bringing 500 jobs to this 
quiet refinery town tucked among rolling hills of grazing cattle in 
southeast Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	The company, which claims to be the Internet's largest retailer  
of videos, music and books, announced Tuesday it will expand an 
existing building to 750,000-square feet in a move it said would 
speed delivery of its products throughout the Midwest and 
Southeast. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was hailed by local and state officials, who said  
the move shows how high tech makes it possible for rural 
communities to attract good-paying jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The beauty about technology is it makes geography  
irrelevant,'' Lt. Gov. Gary Sherrer said, citing the good facility 
and work ethic the company found in the rural community. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffeyville joins Fernley, Nev. and New Castle, Del. as homes of  
regional distribution centers for Amazon.com. Officials for the 
Seattle-based company said they will ship more from Coffeyville in 
one day than they could ship in three days from their other centers 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
	The facility was expected to open by fall in time for the  
Christmas shipping rush, and reach its full expected employment of 
500 people by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company declined to say what wages it would pay workers, but  
said they would be competitive for the area and would include 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came up looked around, looked at the community and realized  
it was good work ethic, good people and the community had a lot of 
pride,'' said Jimmy Wright, chief logistics officer for Amazon.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Wright said company officials liked the state government in  
Kansas, which he described as progressive yet fiscally 
conservative. He cited it as one of the reasons his firm decided to 
locate here. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted us here, but they didn't give the farm away  
either,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The state will assist Amazon.com with ``a significant amount''  
of training dollars and other incentives, Sherrer said. He said it 
was still too early to put a dollar figure on the amount of state 
help. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kansas is very proud of Coffeyville because you had the  
capacity to pull this off,'' Sherrer said. ``... Most important, we 
are proud one of the most recognizable names in the world will in a 
short time be a citizen of Kansas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company's decision was an important step for Coffeyville,  
said Herb Krumsick of TGFWII, the company that owns the building 
that Amazon.com will lease. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a much bigger deal for Coffeyville than you will ever  
know,'' Krumsick said. 
</P>
<P>
	Company founder Jeff Bezos started the company in his garage in  
1994.

<HEADLINE> No Challenge in D.C. Sanity Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal prosecutors have decided not to  
challenge a psychiatrist's conclusion that Russell Eugene Weston 
Jr., the man accused of killing two policemen in the U.S. Capitol 
last summer, is currently incompetent to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``The government right now has no expert the defendant will  
permit to examine him,'' U.S. Attorney Ronald Walutes was quoted as 
saying in today's editions of The Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Weston, 42, allegedly gunned down officers John Gibson and Jacob  
J. Chestnut in a corridor of the Capitol on July 24. 
</P>
<P>
	He was examined last October by a court-appointed psychiatrist  
who determined he was incompetent to stand trial and recommended 
indefinite hospitalization. Prosecutors instead persuaded U.S. 
District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan to order additional exams by two 
other doctors. However, Weston refused to speak to either one. 
</P>
<P>
	Walutes said Weston's actions prevent prosecutors from forming  
an opinion about the suspect's mental state. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said he will order that Weston be placed in a federal  
psychiatric facility for at least 120 days of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The question of whether he ever will stand trial remains  
unresolved for now.

<HEADLINE> Former Prince To Re-Record Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Even for a notorious control freak, the Artist  
Formerly Known as Prince is planning a pretty audacious challenge 
to his old record company. 
</P>
<P>
	Unhappy at his failure to gain possession of the music he  
recorded for Warner Bros., the Artist said he will re-record the 
music and sell it on his own. 
</P>
<P>
	That's everything. ``Purple Rain,'' ``Little Red Corvette,''  
``Raspberry Beret, ``Kiss,'' the whole catalogue. He recorded 17 
albums for Warners beginning in 1978 when he was seen as a teen-age 
prodigy until their nasty divorce five years ago, not including a 
greatest hits package. 
</P>
<P>
	Re-creating the music shouldn't be much of a problem. That's  
because on most of the records he played all the instruments 
himself and provided all the vocals, the Artist said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fleetwood Mac would be hard-pressed to do something like  
this,'' he said. ``The only people I would have to argue with are 
the people in my head.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's not discouraging anyone from buying his old records; he  
still gets paid when that happens. But he gets paid a lot more if 
he sells them himself, and he wants to own recordings of the music 
which made his name -- before he changed it, of course. 
</P>
<P>
	He has repeatedly made known his interest in obtaining the  
rights to his own master recordings, said Bob Merlis, a spokesman 
for Warner Bros. Records. That doesn't mean there have been any 
negotiations toward that end. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll always talk to somebody,'' Merlis said. ``It's extremely  
unlikely that we will ever give an artist, with no compensation, 
original works that were sold to us under a valid contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Re-recording material isn't unprecedented; Chuck Berry and Jerry  
Lee Lewis did it when they switched record companies in the early 
days of rock 'n' roll, Merlis said. But it's unusual today, and 
most contracts with artists prohibit such re-recording for a set 
period of time. He wouldn't comment on The Artist's contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would be interested to hear what it sounded like,'' Merlis  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just before last New Year's Eve, Warner Bros. distributed to  
radio stations a single version of Prince's song, ``1999,'' that 
was originally released in 1982, sparking some renewed sales. The 
Artist responded by re-recording the song in several different 
versions and selling the CD via his Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	But that was just one song -- not hundreds.  
</P>
<P>
	The Artist insists that much of his early material will sound  
better when redone since recording technology has improved. He 
won't say whether he will be faithful to the old versions or if he 
will tweak them. He gave no timetable for their release. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most artists lose their voice, their hair and their bands,''  
the 40-year-old singer said. ``That's not going to happen to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The workaholic songwriter said he's composing an opera,  
presumably in his spare time. He's also making another studio 
album, and in another departure from his work habits, he is 
allowing other producers to work on his music, and is writing songs 
with others. 
</P>
<P>
	He won't identify the collaborators, other than to say, ``I'm  
working with some people you wouldn't expect me to be working 
with.'' They might even remain unidentified on the final release 
due to contractual issues. 
</P>
<P>
	And how will the strong-willed Artist deal with it when a  
collaborator disagrees with him on how something sounds? 
</P>
<P>
	``They know it's my album,'' he said. ``They're going to give me  
the last word.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since leaving Warner Bros., the Artist briefly had a  
distribution deal with EMI. Most recently, he's been selling his 
music primarily through orders placed to his Web site, including 
last year's box set, ``Crystal Ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he's likely to work out a deal with a major label to  
release his next album. He said he has no problem working with a 
big label. ``What I had a problem with is ownership of the work 
when I was finished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Re-recording would be the latest salvo in his decade-long feud  
with Warners. It was that feud that led to him scrawling ``slave'' 
on his face during some performances, and to legally changing his 
name to an unpronounceable symbol. While he has his own typically 
eccentric spin, he's also a model for the growing trend of 
musicians taking control of their business affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	His ``freedom'' mantra is actually consistent with the unusual  
announcement that he had renewed his vows with his wife, Mayte, in 
February. He said they wanted to ``transcend'' their marriage 
without the encumbrance of a legal contract. But he stressed that 
he and his wife, a former dancer whom he married in 1996, did not 
get a divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	His album sales have steadily tumbled since ``Purple Rain'' sold  
12 million. That's not unexpected, since few musicians stay on top 
for so long. But his decision to stand apart from the traditional 
record business machinery also probably ensures that his hitmaking 
days are over. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he's much happier now.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's more fun for me because you can actually see the  
difference in the music,'' he said. ``You can feel the freedom in 
the air when you're like that and you're not thinking about 
anything like what is the next single or how can I make my image 
look good for the video. 
</P>
<P>
	``All that stuff is in your head whether you're thinking about  
it or not.''

<HEADLINE> Students Arrested in Software Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEWISTON, Maine (AP) -- Four Bates College students were arrested  
for making pirated computer programs available for copying on their 
World Wide Web sites, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Detectives downloaded copies of a Microsoft Windows 98 update  
and Microsoft Office 2000, which isn't yet available, Lewiston 
Police Lt. David B. Chamberlain said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also were looking into the possibility that the  
students were compensated, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Maine law, making an unauthorized copy of a computer  
program, computer software or computer information is a crime that 
carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The four students were identified as Jayan Hong, 18, of Beverly  
Hills, Calif.; David Sek, 19 of Peabody, Mass.; Ali Malik, 21, of 
Lahore, Pakistan; and David Levin, 19, of Princeton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	All four were released from the Androscoggin County Jail on $500  
bail Tuesday evening, Chamberlain said.

<HEADLINE> iMac Sales Spur Apple Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Apple Computer Inc. rode the strong  
sales of its colorful iMac personal computer to its sixth-straight 
quarterly profit while surpassing Wall Street expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple Computer, which had suffered nearly two years of red ink  
before its current profit streak, reported late Wednesday it earned 
$135 million, or 84 cents a share in its fiscal second quarter, 
which ended March 27. That was more than double the $55 million, or 
38 cents a share, earned in the same quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding one-time gains, Apple would have earned 60 cents a  
share, beating the 57 cents a share predicted by analysts surveyed 
by First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of the hugely popular iMac computers for home users, as  
well as the speedy G3 business computers, gave Apple $1.53 billion 
in revenue in the January-March quarter, typically a slow one for 
computer companies. That was up 9 percent from the same period in 
1998 when revenues reached $1.41 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the positive report marks the end of Apple's  
recovery after losing nearly $2 billion between 1995 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apple is clearly back on track,'' said analyst Tim Bajarin,  
president of Creative Strategies in Campbell, Calif. ``I don't see 
any reason they won't be able to keep this momentum going, at least 
through the end of this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The company pioneered the commercial personal computer in the  
1970s, and made it easy to use in the 1980s with the Macintosh. But 
it fell on hard times in the 1990s as rival machines using 
Microsoft Corp. software largely erased the Mac's ease-of-use 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Shrinking sales and market share led to management shakeups. The  
company began to regain market share after Jobs replaced ousted 
chief executive Gil Amelio in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Apple introduced the iMac desktop personal computer  
for home users, and the speedy G3 Macintosh computers aimed at 
businesses. Apple is also building computers to order over the 
Internet, and has stopping making its Newton hand-held devices. 
Later this year, Apple is planning to release a new laptop. 
</P>
<P>
	While all the new products have been successful, it's the iMac  
that took the market by surprise, rapidly becoming a favorite with 
individual computer buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The iMac was the top-selling personal computer in retail stores  
during the fourth quarter of 1998, and sales of the iMac pushed 
Apple past IBM into third place in retail sales market share in 
February, according to the research firm PC Data.

<HEADLINE> Gore: Tobacco Targeting the Young </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore accused tobacco  
companies Wednesday of continuing to target young smokers, 
releasing two new studies to back up his claim. 
</P>
<P>
	One study said the most heavily advertised cigarette brands --  
Marlboro, Newport and Camel -- are the most popular among teen-agers 
who smoked last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other study, the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids said  
children are two and a half times as likely as adults to have seen 
tobacco advertising in the past two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're truly going to end this scourge we're going to have  
to fight this battle around every kitchen table,'' Gore said at the 
gymnasium of Roswell Kent Middle School, where 100 students wore 
red and white Campaign for Tobacco-Free T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	Annual spending on tobacco ads is about 100 times what is spent  
on anti-smoking messages, Gore said. Tobacco companies ``don't 
spend $5 billion for the heck of it,'' he said. ``They know it 
works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans said Gore is talking out of two sides of his  
mouth on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gore gobbled up at least $16,440 from the tobacco companies'  
PACS just from 1979 until 1990,'' Republican National Committee 
Chairman Jim Nicholson said. 
</P>
<P>
	And a spokesman for Marlboro-maker Philip-Morris said teen  
smoking is not the tobacco industry's fault. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have never marketed our product to kids and we have taken  
voluntary steps over time to focus our efforts on adult smokers 
only,'' Mike Pfeil said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study commissioned by the Department of Health and Human  
Services, found that 88 percent of 12th-grade smokers used the 
three heavily advertised brands in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco-Free Kids said 75 percent of children and 31 percent of  
adults indicated they had seen tobacco advertising in the previous 
two weeks. The study was conducted April 7-11.

<HEADLINE> JP Morgan Profits Soar 153 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- J.P. Morgan reported a 153 percent jump in  
first-quarter profits Wednesday, continuing the industry's torrid 
financial performance that reflects the unbounded strength of the 
financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	J.P. Morgan earned $600 million, or $3.01 a share, for the first  
three months of the year, outdistancing Wall Street's estimate of 
$1.73 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first quarter last year, the firm earned $237 million or  
$1.15 a share. That quarter, however, included a one-time 
restructuring charge, without which J.P. Morgan reported operating 
profits of $366 million, or $1.80 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were a blowout,'' said Carla D'Arista, an analyst with  
Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &AMP; Co. In addition to solid earnings, 
J.P. Morgan ``reported a $65 million year-over-year decline in 
expenses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	J.P. Morgan generated $2.49 billion in revenues, up 25 percent  
from nearly $2 billion in the first quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The surprisingly positive results follow yesterday's 18 percent  
first-quarter gain from Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., and a 33 percent jump 
at Paine Webber Group Inc. Both firms also beat analysts' 
expectations on record trading commissions and renewed strength in 
the global bond business. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the industry may have humbled Wall Street with their  
first-quarter performance, ``The question is how long can they 
sustain it?,'' D'Arista asked. ``These companies tend to reflect 
the tone of the market, and the market tends to self-correct'' from 
overvalued highs. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors nonetheless seemed focused on Wednesday's numbers, and  
sent J.P. Morgan's shares up $4.37 1/2 to $133.68 3/4 on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest boost to the bottom line came from bond trading.  
Corporate America returned to the fixed-income markets en force as 
interest rates fell to attractive levels. J.P. Morgan made $696 
million from its bond business, up 91 percent from the first 
quarter last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks, however, were also very strong as companies jumped to  
issue shares on the coattails of the Dow Jones industrial average's 
flight into record territory. Investors also paid J.P. Morgan 
millions in commissions to buy and sell stocks. J.P. Morgan 
reported revenues of $288 million from its equities business, more 
than double the year-ago period.

<HEADLINE> Delany Sisters' Story Comes to TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GASTONIA, N.C. (AP) -- One was a sharp-tongued spitfire who  
became a dentist at a time when women huddled at home with husband 
and children; the other was a mild-mannered school teacher who 
served as inspiration to legions of young women. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth ``Bessie'' Delany and Sarah ``Sadie'' Delany were best  
friends from birth, two exceptional sisters who each lived well 
past a century and whose observations about growing up black in 
America were shared in the 1993 best-selling book ``Having Our Say: 
The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the book was translated to the Broadway stage, veteran  
actresses clamored to play two intelligent, independent, successful 
older women. Such roles are a rarity -- especially in film and 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a new kind of woman on the horizon,'' says actress  
Ruby Dee. ``She's older, independent and she's got all her 
faculties. There's a whole life ahead after 65.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dee, 74, portrays Bessie, and Diahann Carroll plays Sadie in the  
made-for-television movie ``Having Our Say,'' which airs April 18 
on CBS. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delany sisters lived another lifetime after their 65th  
birthdays. 
</P>
<P>
	Sadie Delany died Jan. 25 at the age of 109. Bessie Delany died  
in 1995 at the age of 104. 
</P>
<P>
	They became best-selling authors in 1994 with the publication of  
their book, written in collaboration with Amy Hill Hearth, who was 
more than 65 years their junior. The sisters and Hearth followed up 
with ``The Delany Sisters' Book of Everyday Wisdom,'' which was 
released in 1994. After her sister's death, Sadie Delany wrote a 
third book: ``On My Own at 107: Reflections on Life Without 
Bessie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were matter-of-fact references in their best seller to the  
lynchings and ``Jim Crow'' segregation laws. of the post-slavery 
years that the sisters lived through. But there were also quiet 
triumphs -- their own impressive family saga, their pride in the 
1960s civil rights movement and their professional success in an 
age when most women stayed home. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, television doesn't often present the lives of  
blacks and women like the Delanys, says director Lynne Littman. 
</P>
<P>
	``You realize how images like this are not on television,'' she  
said in an interview while the movie was being filmed in the 
Gastonia and Charlotte areas, about 200 miles southwest of Raleigh. 
``They are dignified, educated, well-dressed, respectful and 
respectable African-American people who were around 100 years 
ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bessie was the more stubborn, confrontational sister who was  
almost lynched as a young woman after a run-in with a white at a 
railroad station. Sadie was the quieter sister who often got her 
way by smiling and agreeing, then doing what she wanted. 
</P>
<P>
	The sisters and their eight brothers and sisters grew up on the  
campus of St. Augustine's School (now college) in Raleigh, where 
their father, a former slave, was vice principal. All 10 children 
went to college. 
</P>
<P>
	The Delany sisters, neither of whom ever married, moved to New  
York City after they graduated from St. Augustine's. Sadie Delany 
earned a master's degree in education from Columbia University and 
became the first black domestic-science teacher in New York City's 
public schools. Bessie Delany also graduated from Columbia and 
became a dentist. 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll wanted the part of Sadie so badly that she finished her  
singing tour on a Sunday night and was in Charlotte for a reading 
Monday morning. ``I incredibly desired it with all my being,'' she 
said. ``I really wanted very seriously to make my desires known.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like most older women, Carroll and Dee have difficulty finding  
well-written parts. Throw black into the mix and ``it is 
impossible,'' Carroll says. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here I am in my 60s and I am finding a part that expects you  
to use every part of your craft, every part of your being, every 
part of your physicality,'' she says. ``It's a gift.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Getting these two women together wasn't easy. In addition to  
Carroll's tour, the producers had to work with Dee, who spent at 
least one weekend in Dallas, doing a play with her husband, Ossie 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Dee was so anxious about filming on this day that she woke up at  
2:30 a.m., 90 minutes before her alarm call. On the set, she 
munches half a turkey sandwich and a cup of cranberry juice between 
takes, rarely getting more than a bite down each time. 
</P>
<P>
	Of playing Bessie, she says: ``I feel right doing it, with the  
blessings, I hope, of all the other people who have played her, as 
well as Bessie herself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One reason it seems right is that when Dee walked to school each  
day as a child growing up in Harlem, she'd walk past 135th Street, 
where Bessie Delany had her dental office. 
</P>
<P>
	``People would tell me a black woman was up there who was a  
dentist,'' Dee says. ``I remember being impressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Carroll had a grandmother who had something of Bessie's  
attitude. Each summer as a child, the actress would spend several 
weeks in North Carolina on ``Miss Rebecca's'' farm, where her 
grandmother raised chicken and hogs and grew tobacco and cotton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was such a snobby little thing, running around, telling  
everyone I was from New York,'' Carroll says. ``But there were 
certain traditions of which my mother and father had spoken of with 
great affection, and trips to the South allowed me to experience 
some of those traditions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The movie also stars Della Reese, Richard Roundtree, Mykelti  
Williamson, Lonette McKee and Amy Madigan as the sisters' 
collaborator. 
</P>
<P>
	Littman, who won an Academy Award for ``Number Our Days,'' a  
documentary about the lives of older people, says she decided 
against doing ``Having Our Say'' in flashbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I learned about old people is that the past and the  
present aren't necessarily differentiated,'' she says. ``The past 
and the present happen in the same dimension.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the movie takes viewers back through what Littman calls  
``sense memory.'' For example, in one scene Bessie is shaking a 
branch at her sister and their collaborator and she remembers the 
switching they got as children. ``I'm still mad at you,'' she says 
to her sister. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a device that works in movies,'' she says. ``Whether it's  
an acceptable TV device, we'll find out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Littman will compete against herself Sunday night: At the same  
time as ``Having Our Say,'' Showtime will air ``Freak City,'' a 
film Littman also directed, starring Marlee Matlin and Natalie 
Cole.

<HEADLINE> Home of Heisman Faces Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The company holding the mortgage on the home of  
the famed Heisman Trophy says its dispute with the building's 
occupants is about real estate, not football. 
</P>
<P>
	And partners in 18 West, the Downtown Athletic Club's largest  
creditor, promise they have no plans to commandeer the trophy from 
the financially strapped club. 
</P>
<P>
	``This doesn't involve the Heisman Trophy,'' said Richard Born,  
a partner in 18 West. ``The Heisman Trophy stays with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The once-exclusive but now faded Downtown Athletic Club is  
fighting for life in a bitter battle in bankruptcy court, hoping to 
solve its problems with a last-ditch plan to have a hotel built on 
the upper floors of its 35-story Art Deco building. 
</P>
<P>
	But if the deal doesn't get court approval, the property could  
be sold at auction to face a potentially uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
	The club's director, William J. Dockery, says nothing less than  
the fate of college football's most prestigious honor is at stake. 
The Heisman Trophy, named for the club's first director, former 
coach John Heisman, has been awarded annually at the club since 
1935 to college football's best player. 
</P>
<P>
	Past winners have included O.J. Simpson, New York Jets  
quarterback Vinnie Testaverde and last year's recipient, Ricky 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to purloin our building,'' Dockery said Wednesday,  
complaining about the auction proposal. ``We've maintained the 
integrity of the Heisman Memorial Trophy for the last 65 years and 
we will never allow it to be sullied.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Born said 18 West's proposal to auction the building even  
includes a clause that would allow the club to survive. ``Whoever 
bought the building would be required to offer a lease to the club 
at about $12 a square foot,'' he said. ``If they can't pay $12 a 
square foot for real estate, they're probably not economically 
viable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The club sits on prime real estate in lower Manhattan --  
overlooking New York Harbor. But the carpeting is frayed, plaster 
is falling from above the boxing ring, and membership is at 1,400 -- 
down from 4,000 in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	The Heisman Room, where the award is announced each year, is  
hung with portraits of every winner. The fabled bronze statue of a 
football player cradling a ball under one arm, his other arm 
outstretched, sits in the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
	The club is proposing that the property be bought for $16  
million by a Stamford, Conn., investor, Chesslock-Bakker. The 
athletic facilities would then be sold back to the club for $8 
million, while the upper 15 floors would be turned into a hotel by 
the Pacific and Caribbean Hotel Group. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal was rejected by Judge James Garrity of U.S.  
Bankruptcy Court, but the club appealed the judge's decision. A 
hearing on the appeal is scheduled for April 22. 
</P>
<P>
	Dockery says he is confident the club's plan will be approved.  
``This deal is going to be the underpinning of the renaissance, the 
rebirth and the resurrection of the Downtown Athletic Club,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Creditors say they will not oppose the plan ``if in fact it pays  
everybody 100 cents on the dollar,'' said Born. But he said the 
plan appears inadequate because it involves ``a downpayment and an 
afterpayment'' rather than full payment upfront. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we want is for that mortgage to be paid off and we want  
all the other creditors to be paid off,'' said Steven Caspi, born's 
partner. ``And we wish the Downtown Athletic Club a wonderful 
future and good luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dockery, meanwhile, claims that 18 West has ``refused to accept  
payment'' for the mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
	Born and Caspi estimate that 18 West is owed about $10 million.  
New York City is the next-largest creditor, owed about $4 million 
in taxes.

<HEADLINE> Logging in Tongass To Be Limited </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, in a move to  
increase protections for ancient trees in the nation's largest 
forest, is placing 234,000 acres off-limits to logging and other 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes in the 17 million-acre Tongass National Forest in  
Alaska are also aimed at helping protect species such as the Sitka 
black-tailed deer and Alexander Archipelago wolf and should lead to 
the development of fewer roads in pristine areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're trying to do is strike a sustainable balance up  
there, both for the natural resources that are nationally 
significant as well as a sustainable source of timber for the 
forest products industry in southeast Alaska,'' Agriculture 
Undersecretary Jim Lyons said in a statement released today. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes will come in the form of an update to the 1997  
management plan for the Tongass. The plan will be in effect at 
least until 2007, Lyons said, adding that the decision is intended 
to end the 33 separate appeals that have been filed against the 
1997 plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The updated plan cuts the maximum allowable timber harvest in  
the Tongass by 30 percent a year, and land open to logging will be 
reduced by 15 percent to about 576,000 acres. 
</P>
<P>
	Also under the new plan, nearly half of the land that may be  
used for logging can be harvested only once every 200 years, 
instead of once every 100 years as is currently allowed. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons said the changes also will help sustain the forest  
industries, as the allowable timber harvest remains well within the 
projected demand for timber from the region in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
	But a timber industry representative said that the new maximum  
allowable harvest is below real demand and that the changes could 
put at least one sawmill in the region out of business. 
</P>
<P>
	``It confirms our worst fears that this administration is  
determined to drive the last nail in the coffin of southeast 
Alaska's timber-based economy,'' said Jack Phelps, executive direct 
of the Alaska Forest Association, which represents 300 forest 
products companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Bart Koehler, executive director of the Southeast Alaska  
Conservation Council, one of the groups that filed a 150-page 
appeal to the 1997 plan, said he was pleased with the changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're relieved that we're finally getting a decision,'' he  
said. ``We're also feeling very good about some very significant 
additional protections for some very important wildlands and 
watersheds in the Tongass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision will increase protected forest land in the Tongass  
to nearly 13.7 million acres, up from more than 13.4 million acres 
currently. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 234,000 additional acres being protected, 100,000 had  
been previously deemed as suitable for logging. The other 134,000 
were not considered suitable for logging, and the decision ensures 
they won't be available for logging for the life of the management 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan changes would take effect Oct. 1.

<HEADLINE> 'ER' Tops Nielsen Ratings Again / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Is ``ER'' ailing?  
</P>
<P>
	The medical drama's 17.9 rating and 30 share last Thursday was  
its lowest rating for a first-run episode since November 1994, its 
premiere year, Nielsen Media Research said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was still the week's most-watched show, as it has been for  
all 18 weeks that first-run episodes have aired this year. But the 
season-to-date ratings for television's most popular show are down 
11 percent from last year. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC suggests last week's ratings were down because many other  
prime-time programs aired reruns, and that some viewers may have 
assumed that ``ER'' was doing the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
	The slump is bad timing for NBC, which under a new deal is  
paying a record $13 million per episode for the drama -- more than 
five times what it paid in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``ER'' has been hurt by softness in NBC's Thursday night lineup,  
the recent departure of George Clooney and the simple passage of 
time, said Marc Berman, a television analyst for the ad buying firm 
Seltel. It's rare for a show in its fifth season to continue to 
grow in ratings, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the show is as compelling as it once was,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	This is also the first year old episodes of ``ER'' have aired in  
reruns on cable television and through syndication. The ability for 
fans to see the show several times a week generally hurts the 
ratings for first-run episodes, Berman said. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS narrowly won the week's ratings race over NBC, mirroring the  
season-to-date competition. CBS had an 8.3 rating and 14 share, NBC 
had an 8.2 rating and 14 share, ABC was at 6.4 and 11 and Fox had a 
6.3 and 11. All four networks were lower than their season averages 
in a week dominated by reruns. 
</P>
<P>
	For the emerging networks, the WB had a 2.7 rating and 5 share,  
UPN had a 1.7 rating and 3 share, and Pax TV was at 0.8 and 1. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' won the evening news race with a 7.5  
rating and 17 share. ABC's ``World News Tonight'' had a 7.1 rating 
and 16 share, and the ``CBS Evening News'' was at 6.2 and 14. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. The share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of April 5-11, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were ``ER,'' NBC, 17.9; ``Frasier,'' NBC, 15.2; 
``Friends,'' NBC, 14.8; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 13.7; ``Touched By an 
Angel,'' CBS, 13.2; ``Just Shoot Me'' special, NBC, 13.1; ``Will &AMP; 
Grace,'' NBC, 13.0; ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' CBS, 10.9; ``The 
X-Files,'' Fox, 10.4; ``CBS Sunday Movie: Blue Moon,'' CBS, 10.1; 
``Masters Golf Tournament,'' CBS, 10.1.

<HEADLINE> House OKs $1.74 Trillion Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Majority Republicans whisked a final $1.74  
trillion budget for fiscal 2000 through the House on Wednesday, 
paving the way for yearlong combat with President Clinton over tax 
cuts and spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The near party-line vote was 220-208. Senate approval was  
expected by Thursday, which Republicans hoped would help them 
spotlight their tax-cut drive even as Americans contend with the 
April 15 deadline for filing income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan signals the issues the GOP wants to highlight in this  
year's run-up to the 2000 elections: a 10-year tax cut totaling at 
least $778 billion, using Social Security's enormous surpluses to 
reduce the national debt, and extra money for defense and schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``A new agenda for the new millennium,'' said House Budget  
Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, a presidential hopeful. He 
added, ``We ought to march into the next century, the next 
millennium, with our heads held high.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the measure failed to adequately use federal  
surpluses to bolster Social Security and Medicare for the baby 
boomers' retirements or to beef up other social programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The budget passed by House Republicans falls short of what the  
American people need for meeting the challenges of the 21st 
century,'' he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats also said the budget would do little more than let  
Republicans claim they were finishing the budget on time, which 
Congress has achieved only once since making April 15 the legal 
deadline in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	``This looks like we're making the trains run on time, but in  
truth, down the tracks a train wreck awaits,'' said Rep. John 
Spratt of South Carolina, ranking Budget Committee Democrat, 
referring to upcoming battles with Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, which does not require the president's signature,  
sets overall totals for detailed tax and spending bills that 
lawmakers will produce later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	A prolonged duel with Clinton over those bills seems all but  
certain. For one, Clinton wants far smaller tax cuts. In addition, 
Republicans say they will pay for their defense and domestic 
spending increases by cutting other programs, which Democrats and 
even some Republicans say is unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, completion of the budget by Thursday in itself would  
mark a political victory of sorts for Republicans. GOP leaders want 
to cast themselves as performing their work on time, especially 
given that last year, an internal GOP dispute over tax cuts ended 
in Congress' failure to approve a budget for the first time since 
the current budget process started in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders also want to erase other memories of last year, when  
Republicans spent much of it dealing with Clinton's impeachment, 
and Democrats charged that the GOP Congress was achieving little 
for the public. 
</P>
<P>
	``As promised, this Congress has quietly been a workhorse,''  
said Rep. John Linder, R-Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's measure was a compromise between similar House and  
Senate budgets approved last month. It envisions a surplus of $141 
billion next year, though virtually all of it would come from 
Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP plan calls for using all $1.8 trillion in expected  
Social Security surpluses over the next decade to reduce the 
national debt -- or to revamp Social Security or Medicare should a 
bipartisan compromise emerge on either. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton would spend a small portion of those surpluses for  
domestic programs. Neither side has proposed changes in benefits or 
taxes for Social Security and Medicare that many experts say will 
be needed to buttress both programs for the long run. 
</P>
<P>
	Most economists agree that reducing the national debt would  
strengthen the economy by keeping interest rates lower. A larger 
economy should make it easier for the government to raise money to 
pay benefits to future retirees, they say. 
</P>
<P>
	By setting aside the Social Security surpluses, Republicans also  
hope to prevent Democrats from accusing them of diverting the money 
to tax cuts for the wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans say their tax cut might grow if new projections  
expected this summer show larger surpluses than now expected. It 
will start relatively small, about $15 billion next year if 
Republicans can find spending cuts or new revenue to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP leaders plan to decide which taxes to cut later this year.  
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers will also decide later this year how much to spend on  
specific programs. But the GOP budget proposes spending $289 
billion on defense, $9 billion more than this year and $8 billion 
more than Clinton proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP plan also calls for $66 billion for education and job  
training. That is about $1 billion less than Clinton proposed, but 
Republicans would outspend Clinton on elementary and secondary 
schools and would emphasize diminished strings on federal education 
aid.

</P>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Jim V. Blevins, the self-proclaimed  
``Popcorn King'' who marketed a corn that produced a fluffier, 
tastier popcorn to movie theaters and grocery stores, died Monday. 
He was 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Blevins was operating a Nashville food brokerage business in the  
1940s when he noticed the movie industry boom was boosting sales of 
popcorn, but suppliers hadn't caught up. 
</P>
<P>
	Blevins signed a contract to supply all the popcorn for a Middle  
Tennessee movie chain, marketing a hybrid corn that produced 
better-tasting, fluffier popcorn that allowed operators to get more 
volume per ounce of corn. 
</P>
<P>
	Blevins Popcorn Co. then helped introduce the Pops-Rite brand to  
the rest of the world, marketing the snack in jars of oil ready to 
pop, in sacks and with a low-fat buttery seasoning developed in his 
own kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
	Blevins sold the company in 1961.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1952, he took popcorn to Japanese baseball stands, creating  
an entity he later sold to Frito Lay.

columnist and assistant news editor for The Daily Oklahoman, died 
Monday of cancer. He was 45. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who had been with the newspaper since 1980, was also

	FALMOUTH, Mass. (AP) -- John F. ``Red'' Flaherty, a former  
American League baseball umpire, died April 1 after a lengthy 
illness. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Flaherty worked four World Series in his 21-year big league  
career that began in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1954 Flaherty found himself in the limelight when he was  
officiating at a game between the Washington Senators and the New 
York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	He called a Senators' base runner out at home plate when he  
tried to score from second on a single. Attending the game was 
President Eisenhower, who yelled out, ``No!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the locker room, Flaherty was asked whether  
Eisenhower's displeasure made him rethink his position. 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' Flaherty said. ``It wasn't even close.''

<P>
	``The Flintstones,'' a Hanna-Barbera cartoon that humorously  
chronicled family life in the Stone Age, ran from 1960 to 1966 and

	Ms. Vander Pyl also voiced Rosie the Robot and Mrs. Spacely on

<HEADLINE> American Pilots Return to Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The pilot union at American Airlines returns to  
court today in the compensatory damages hearing on the losses the 
air carrier suffered during a sickout earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, experts for the Allied Pilots Association  
said that American Airlines' losses from the job action are more 
than $50 million less than the company estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Geoffrey Heal, an economist at Columbia University, and Robert  
Mann Jr., an airline industry analyst, both testified for the union 
Monday that the losses they had calculated range between $1.4 
million and about $4.5 million, depending on the time period 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
	That's compared to the $58.7 million estimate made by American's  
parent company, Fort Worth, Texas-based AMR Corp., which has yet to 
call witnesses on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The losses are being debated before U.S. District Judge Joe  
Kendall, who will determine damages in the civil contempt of court 
charge against the union. 
</P>
<P>
	The APA was held in contempt for failing to encourage its  
members to return to their cockpits during 10 days in February. A 
total of about 2,500 pilots called in sick, resulting in the 
cancellation of nearly 6,700 flights. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall ordered the union to make a $10 million down payment,  
about 25 percent of the union's worth, toward damages resulting 
from the three days that pilots defied his back-to-work order. Any 
damages he decides will be paid to the airline. 
</P>
<P>
	The catalyst for the dispute that led to the sickout was an  
inability by the union and American to agree on the assimilation of 
the recently purchased Reno Air, an issue that has yet to be 
resolved. The union contends that Reno pilots should be integrated 
into American from the Dec. 23 purchase, raising salaries for those 
affected from that date. The airline says it will pay the higher 
rates as the pilots are retrained to American standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The union and company met last week with a federal mediator in  
hopes of resolving the disagreement, but no settlement was 
announced. No further talks are currently scheduled, but are 
expected to resume.

<HEADLINE> EU May Ease British Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The three-year ban on British beef  
exports introduced at the height of Europe's ``mad cow'' scare may 
be significantly eased in June, a European Commission spokesman 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best case scenario is that the ban is lifted sometime in  
June,'' said Gerry Kiely, agriculture spokesman at the European 
Union executive body. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission imposed the worldwide export ban in 1996 after  
the British government acknowledged a possible link between a 
brain-destroying cattle ailment called bovine spongiform 
encephalopathy with an equally fatal human illness, 
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU agreed last November to allow Britain to resume selective  
exports pending slaughterhouse inspections. It will allow the 
export of British beef from animals born after August 1996, when 
Britain banned the use of ground animal remains in cattle feed. 
</P>
<P>
	Veterinary experts have been inspecting British slaughterhouses  
since Monday and will report within 25 days to the EU Standing 
Veterinary Committee, Kiely said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they're satisfied, then they can set a date'' for the  
resumption of exports, said Kiely. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Britain exported 270,000 tons of beef, worth $1  
billion. Although mad cow cases have been detected in other 
countries, the overwhelming majority have been in Britain.

	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- A homeless man sleeping in a trash bin lost  
his foot when the bin was emptied into a garbage truck and he was 
caught in the compactor blade.

<P>
	Doctors surgically reattached the foot.  
</P>
<P>
	Ronald Watts, 36, apparently had sought shelter in the trash bin  
Monday night when temperatures dipped into the mid-30s, police

<HEADLINE> Manchester United 2, Arsenal 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Ryan Giggs ran through the entire Arsenal defense  
for the winning goal and put Manchester United into the FA Cup 
final with a pulsating 2-1 victory over defending titlist Arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	His team down to 10 men and under constant pressure in extra  
time, Giggs collected the ball 70 yards out. He ran towards the 
goal, dribbled past two defenders on the edge of the penalty area 
and then weaved past two more before firing a powerful, left-foot 
shot into the roof of David Seaman's net. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal in the semifinal replay came at the end of probably the  
best game of the season between two of the superpowers of English 
soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	David Beckham put United ahead with a brilliant 18th minute shot  
from 25 yards and a deflected shot from Dennis Bergkamp tied the 
game up in the 68th minute. 
</P>
<P>
	The drama and thrills never let up. United's best player on the  
night, Irish midfielder Roy Keane, was sent off and Bergkamp had an 
injury-time penalty shot saved by goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel. 
</P>
<P>
	United goes on to meet Newcastle in the May 22 final at Wembley.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was unbelievable,'' United manager Alex Ferguson said of  
the Giggs goal. ``That goal will be replayed many times. We have 
got to put that game in the memory bank.''

<HEADLINE> Coyotes Lose Roenick to Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The Phoenix Coyotes lost center Jeremy Roenick for  
an indefinite period after the team's top scorer suffered a broken 
jaw in the first period of Wednesday night's game against the 
Dallas Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix was on a power play as Roenick skated along the boards  
behind the Dallas goal when Stars defenseman Derian Hatcher leveled 
Roenick with a check at 5:52 of the opening period. 
</P>
<P>
	Roenick fell to the ice with blood coming from his mouth and was  
taken to the locker room, where the broken jaw was diagnosed. 
Hatcher received a five-minute boarding penalty and a game 
misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatcher's check was the aftermath of the previous meeting  
between the teams on March 23 when Roenick knocked Dallas' 
high-scoring center Mike Modano out of the game on a hit away from 
the puck. 
</P>
<P>
	Roenick received a five-minute penalty for boarding and a game  
misconduct and Modano left the game with a black eye in Dallas' 3-2 
win at America West Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	That hit was the topic of discussion by both teams leading up to  
Wednesday night's games. 
</P>
<P>
	Roenick leads the Coyotes with 24 goals and 48 assists.

<HEADLINE> Company Sheds Snake-Proof Fencing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FISHKILL, N.Y. (AP) -- A mining company owner who put up a fence  
to keep out rattlesnakes tore it down at the demand of 
environmental officials after being threatened with contempt. 
</P>
<P>
	The state had accused Jay Montfort of failing to obey a judge's  
order to tear down the wire-mesh fence by April 3. The fence was 
dismantled by Tuesday, and a contempt hearing on Wednesday was 
called off. 
</P>
<P>
	Montfort built the fence this year around a parcel of Hudson  
Valley property he has been seeking permission to mine. 
</P>
<P>
	The fence was about 250 feet from a den of Eastern timber  
rattlesnakes, which are listed as threatened under New York's 
Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
	The state claimed the fence would disrupt the snake's migration  
patterns. The snakes are expected to emerge from hibernation soon.

<HEADLINE> Jazz Fest Shirts a Status Symbol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- John Goodman wore one on ``Saturday Night  
Live.'' Band leader Paul Shaffer has donned them on David 
Letterman's show. People have worn them in Prague and on the Great 
Wall of China. 
</P>
<P>
	Jazz Fest shirts -- the brightly colored, Hawaiian-type shirt  
sold in a different pattern each year at the New Orleans Jazz and 
Heritage Festival -- have become a collectors' item, status symbol 
and more. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a business, no question,'' said Bud Brimberg, who started  
ProCreations Publishing Co. as a college project 25 years ago, 
while in his last year of law school. ``But I think of it as a work 
of art.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The business began with the festival posters, which Brimberg and  
two friends first designed and produced for the 1975 New Orleans 
Jazz and Heritage Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	Back then, Brimberg sold them from a 10-foot-by-10-foot tent for  
$5. This year, the posters will fill a 2,300-square-foot tent at 
the festival, which spans the last two weekends in April. 
</P>
<P>
	They will sell 10,000 unsigned posters for $49, 3,000 signed for  
$295 and 495 posters in which the artist does an extra drawing in 
the boarder for $495. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1981 poster of a saxophone player wearing a shirt with a  
piano keyboard on it became the inspiration for the souvenir 
shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I looked at that shirt and fell in love with it,'' Brimberg  
said. ``It was something that belonged in a place like the Jazz 
Fest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That led to the first HowAhYa shirt, with a giant keyboard down  
the front. Other styles have included grass green with palmetto 
leaves and accordions, a maroon shirt with red beans and rice, and 
this year's green fabric with swirling alligators and buttons that 
are replicas of alligator teeth. 
</P>
<P>
	Each year the shirts are designed by a new artist, and each year  
their popularity has grown. 
</P>
<P>
	``My husband and I get one almost every year,'' said Nancy  
Spain, a tourist from Mississippi who strolled through the French 
Quarter in a dark blue Jazz Fest shirt decorated with tiny masks. 
``They're great. Every time you wear it people come up and talk 
about it, ask about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We were in China on the Great Wall and there was a guy there  
wearing the `red beans' shirt,'' her husband, Mac, said. ``It was 
like meeting a friend instantly, except he was German and spoke 
only a little English. We just pointed and smiled. He kept saying, 
`Jazz Fest, Jazz Fest.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Brimberg said he was once on a bus in Prague when a local  
resident got on wearing one of his shirts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Slowly but surely, they're covering the world,'' joked  
Brimberg. ``Sales have tripled in the last three years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year Brimberg sold over 5,100 shirts during the seven days  
of the festival; this year he expects to sell 10,000 at $39 to $42 
each. 
</P>
<P>
	The shirts have careful attention to detail. For the alligator  
buttons on this year's shirt, Brimberg searched bait shops, fishing 
and hunting suppliers and camps along the Louisiana bayou before 
finding what he considered the perfect alligator tooth in the New 
Orleans Voodoo Museum. He then took it to a dentist and had the 
root drilled away before making the mold for the buttons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It not only has the shape of the tooth, it has those little  
grooves an alligator tooth has,'' said festival director Quint 
Davis, 
</P>
<P>
	Brimberg's company is privately owned and he wouldn't comment on  
its worth. A percentage of his profits are paid to the Jazz &AMP; 
Heritage Festival foundation, a nonprofit organization that funds 
musical workshops and other community programs. 
</P>
<P>
	New for this year, Brimberg is adding a line of clothing called  
BayouWear. The shorts, vests, sun dresses, skirts and aprons are 
available in the popular red beans and rice pattern and this year's 
alligator design.

<HEADLINE> Hornets' Coleman Arrested in Mich. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Charlotte Hornets center Derrick Coleman was  
arrested late Tuesday in his hometown and charged with interfering 
with a police officer's duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Several others were also arrested at Chuck's Millionaire Club in  
Detroit, Officer Collette Hill, a department spokeswoman, said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear what Coleman was accused of doing  
at the club. Police said the player was released on a $100 bond on 
the misdemeanor charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hornets said the incident apparently stemmed from the arrest  
of one of Coleman's friends for disorderly conduct. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just harassment. That's the only way I can look at it,''  
Coleman said before the Hornets played Detroit at the Charlotte 
Coliseum on Wednesday night. ``Just a waste of my time and theirs, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman disputed a report that he initially complied with a  
police order to leave the area, only to return later and be 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't leave,'' he said. ``They had my car blocked in.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Hornets played at Detroit on Monday and Coleman got  
permission from the team to stay behind. 
</P>
<P>
	The person answering the phone at Chuck's Millionaire Club said  
he was part of the cleaning crew and no one would be available to 
talk until later Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Coleman was arrested in Detroit and charged with  
refusing to move his truck and swearing at a police officer. The 
jury failed to reach a verdict and the case ended in a mistrial.

<HEADLINE> Everyone Wants a QB in the Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Cleveland Browns might be a new franchise,  
but they know how to play the draft game: When in doubt, peddle 
disinformation. 
</P>
<P>
	So while they say they've narrowed their choice with the No. 1  
pick in Saturday's draft to Tim Couch and Akili Smith and running 
back Ricky Williams, they won't tip their hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Let's tip it for them (no guarantees, no money back):  
</P>
<P>
	1. They won't take Williams, because the shelf life of a good  
NFL running back isn't as long as they'll need to get to the Super 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	2. They probably won't trade the pick unless they get something  
like all of New Orleans' No. 1 picks for the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	3. Ty Detmer, one of many ex-49ers on Carmen Policy and Dwight  
Clark's roster, is an adequate QB for a team without Super Bowl 
aspirations and the kind of guy who can help bring along a 
youngster. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith or Couch?  
</P>
<P>
	Chris Palmer, the Browns' coach, has been saying nice things  
about Smith and not so nice things about Couch, and Policy is tight 
with Smith's agent, Leigh Steinberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Drafters and draftees feed on disinformation.  
</P>
<P>
	TIM COUCH, QB, Kentucky.  

</P>
<P>
	2. PHILADELPHIA -- The Eagles need everything. But it starts at  
quarterback with DONOVAN McNABB, QB, Syracuse. Given the Philly 
phans and talk shows, he'd better outperform Smith. 

</P>
<P>
	3. CINCINNATI -- Mike Brown wants a quarterback, although the  
Bengals need a lot. Brown, who's made a lot of bad ones, makes the 
call. ... 
</P>
<P>
	AKILI SMITH, QB, Oregon.  

</P>
<P>
	4. INDIANAPOLIS -- As he was in Carolina four years ago, Bill  
Polian is a key to the first round. He can pick Ricky Williams or 
Chris Claiborne, trade the pick, trade Marshall Faulk, or take ... 
</P>
<P>
	CHAMP BAILEY, CB-WR, Georgia  

</P>
<P>
	5. WASHINGTON -- Ricky's still here?  
</P>
<P>
	RICKY WILLIAMS, RB, Texas.  

</P>
<P>
	6. ST. LOUIS -- The Rams took Lawrence Phillips here three years  
ago. Does that bode well for EDGERRIN JAMES, RB, Miami? 

</P>
<P>
	7. CHICAGO -- The Bears haven't had a Pro Bowler since 1994.  
JEVON KEARSE, DE-LB, Florida, can change that. 

</P>
<P>
	8. ARIZONA -- They need an offensive line, but the Cardinals have  
a second first-rounder. TORRY HOLT, WR, North Carolina State, is a 
steal this low. 

</P>
<P>
	9. DETROIT -- The Lions need an offensive tackle and defense and  
both are here. When in doubt, go defense ... 
</P>
<P>
	CHRIS CLAIBORNE, LB, Southern California.  

</P>
<P>
	10. BALTIMORE -- A quarterback fits. But CHRIS McALISTER, CB,  
Arizona, is the last building block in what could be one of the 
NFL's best defenses. 

</P>
<P>
	11. MINNESOTA -- The Vikings covet McAlister. They ``settle'' for  
DAUNTE CULPEPPER, QB, Central Florida, because who knows how long 
Randall Cunningham will last and who really wants Jeff George? 

</P>
<P>
	12. NEW ORLEANS -- Mike Ditka says he'll trade his entire draft  
for Williams. But he's stuck with Billy Joes at quarterback. So he 
takes CADE McNOWN, QB, UCLA, a winner like a guy named McMahon whom 
Ditka once coached. 

</P>
<P>
	13. PITTSBURGH -- Signing Wayne Gandy was supposed to stabilize  
the offensive line. Then Justin Strzelczyk was hurt, so they need 
JOHN TAIT, OT, Brigham Young. 

</P>
<P>
	14. KANSAS CITY -- Here go the big guys. L.T. SHELTON, OT,  
Eastern Michigan, whose father played in the NBA. 

</P>
<P>
	15. TAMPA BAY -- The road grader, AARON GIBSON, OT, Wisconsin,  
who moved up when he weighed in at a svelte 376. 

</P>
<P>
	16. TENNESSEE -- The Titans prefer an outside pass rusher. But  
they can't pass on ANTHONY McFARLAND, DT, LSU. 

</P>
<P>
	17. SEATTLE -- Mike Holmgren's first pick in his dual role: DAVID  
BOSTON, WR, Ohio State. 

</P>
<P>
	18. OAKLAND -- There are a lot of golf courses in the Bay Area  
for someone who got college credit for playing golf, ANDY 
KATZENMOYER, LB, Ohio State. 

</P>
<P>
	19. NEW YORK GIANTS -- No Gibson, Shelton or Tait. They either  
trade or take EBENEZER EKUBAN, DE, North Carolina. 

</P>
<P>
	20. NEW ENGLAND -- They can't get up high enough for Williams or  
James. So they'll get an RB later and take DAMIEN WOODY, C, Boston 
College. 

</P>
<P>
	21. ARIZONA -- The Cardinals could have had Tait. They opt for  
MATT STINCHCOMB, OT, Georgia. 

</P>
<P>
	22. DALLAS -- Jerry Jones grabs LAMAR KING, DE, Saginaw Valley  
State, who has been moving up quickly. 

</P>
<P>
	23. Buffalo -- The Bills do well in the 20s. That means a third  
first-round Buckeye, CB ANTOINE WINFIELD, a little guy who can 
cover. 

</P>
<P>
	24. MIAMI -- Jimmy Johnson got a lot from a Syracuse fullback  
nicknamed ``Moose.'' ROB KONRAD, FB, Syracuse, can run better. 

</P>
<P>
	25. GREEN BAY -- A lot of needs for a team a year removed from  
its second straight Super Bowl. TROY EDWARDS, WR, Louisiana Tech, 
for Brett Favre's arsenal. 

</P>
<P>
	26. JACKSONVILLE -- DEE-fence, DEE-fence. PATRICK KERNEY, de,  
Virgina. 

</P>
<P>
	27. SAN FRANCISCO -- If only someone had said ``Jake Plummer''  
instead of ``Jim Druckenmiller'' two years ago. Might trade down 
for him or take SHAUN KING, QB, Tulane -- a right-handed Steve 
Young? -- with this pick. 

</P>
<P>
	28. NEW ENGLAND -- They want JAMES JOHNSON, RB, Mississippi  
State. They can get him here or lower. 

</P>
<P>
	29. MINNESOTA -- They get lucky with FERNANDO BRYANT, CB,  
Alabama. 

</P>
<P>
	30. ATLANTA -- Despite its Super Bowl trip, this is NOT the team  
that has everything. KEVIN JOHNSON, WR, Syracuse. 

</P>
<P>
	31. DENVER -- A new right tackle, JON JANSEN, OT, Michigan, to  
replace Harry Swayne, who left for Baltimore.

<HEADLINE> Michelle Kwan Heading to UCLA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Michelle Kwan will attempt a combination much  
tougher than a triple lutz-triple toe loop. She's going to compete 
at the highest level of figure skating while attending college. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan, the three-time U.S. figure skating champion, on Wednesday  
said she will enter UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan, who will turn 19 in July, isn't sure what her UCLA  
schedule will be, although she plans to take a full course load. 
She has ``no idea'' what her competitive skating schedule will be, 
either, although the U.S. championships in Cleveland next February 
definitely are in her plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see my sister (Karen) in Boston University and my brother  
(Ronald) at UC-Irvine and I envy them and want to be a student,'' 
she said. ``We talk all the time about their college experience and 
how much they love it, and the time has come for me to go. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took last year off and really had no time to think about it  
and come to the decision I want to go to school. Now, I've come to 
that decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like most world-class figure skaters, Kwan has been tutored  
privately rather than attend high school. The two-time world champ 
and 1998 Olympic silver medalist is eager to become a student, just 
like anyone else at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since the eighth grade I've had a tutor and schooling always  
was on a one-on-one basis,'' Kwan said. ``I never had the high 
school experience, and I hope to make up for it and go for the full 
college experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Wylie, the 1992 Olympic silver medalist, is one of the few  
skaters who successfully pulled off the education-competition 
double. Wylie matriculated at Harvard, but saw his career really 
take off once he graduated. He spent six years touring with Stars 
on Ice before retiring last spring and entering Harvard Business 
School. 
</P>
<P>
	``I applaud what Michelle is doing,'' Wylie said. ``If I had any  
practical advice, I would tell her to enjoy the `normal aspects' of 
college life and not always be running to the skating rink to 
practices. Be realistic and not too hard on yourself on either side 
of the fence. Don't overcommit on either side of the spectrum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That might be the most difficult chore of all. Kwan, despite  
losing to Maria Butyrskaya of Russia at the world championships 
last month, is the crown jewel of the sport. There is a high demand 
for her from promoters, and the International Skating Union's rules 
for its various competitions are not geared toward fulltime 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan realizes that.  
</P>
<P>
	``For me, the key part is when I'm skating I can't think about  
school, and when I'm in school I can't think about skating,'' said 
Kwan, a 1998 graduate of Rim of the World High School in Lake 
Arrowhead, Calif., where she trains. Kwan took private tutoring for 
five years and, in 1997, won the Dial Student Athlete of the Year 
award given to the top student athlete in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``I worry about the balance, yes. I'm known to be a worrier. I  
believe I can handle it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So does Wylie.  
</P>
<P>
	``I advise her to challenge herself academically,'' he said.  
``She's a very smart girl. And I believe schooling will help her. 
Skating is such a mental sport and I think she can actually boost 
her performances in hidden ways by training her mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's hard in the midst of her career and the environment of  
skating that demands constant attention and training ... it's brave 
of a skater to sort of back out of that. I'm proud of Michelle for 
deciding to go to school, and it will help her skating in the long 
run.''

<HEADLINE> The Artist Taking On Musical Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Artist has gone on a legal offensive against  
Web sites devoted to him. At least one site has responded by going 
after his symbol. 
</P>
<P>
	The copyright and trademark infringement lawsuits, filed in  
February against nine Web sites, accuse them of selling bootlegged 
recordings by the former Prince and offering access to downloads of 
his songs. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the format known as MP3, the selling and trading of  
music downloaded through computers has become wildly popular. It 
has made the music industry, and some artists, nervous because of a 
perceived threat to the CD and tape market. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Artist clearly wants to stop unauthorized distribution of  
his music,'' said Michael Elkin, his attorney. ``The material that 
he puts out is the material that he selects. People should not be 
permitted to release product without his consent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In trying to stop the Web sites' activities, the Artist has also  
alleged unauthorized use of photographs, sales of books and a 
CD-ROM. He also said people have been infringing upon his trademark 
of the odd symbol that he has used as his name since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	One defendant, Uptown Productions, filed a countersuit last week  
that claimed the Artist had no right to trademark his symbol. The 
former Prince can't claim unauthorized use because he frequently 
encouraged people to use it as a substitute for his name, said the 
company, which operates a Web site and distributes a fan magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Uptown also claims the symbol is in the public domain since it's  
a copy of an ancient symbol for soapstone. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Rapp, the lawyer who represents Uptown, said he believed  
the Artist was going on the attack to chill competition because he 
wanted to put out a fan magazine of his own. 
</P>
<P>
	``We really just want to be left alone,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Deal Close in WNBA Labor Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A contract settlement appeared near between the  
WNBA and its players. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the WNBA players' association said progress had been  
made in negotiations and she was confident a new collective 
bargaining agreement could be in place soon. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the player reps said the players had agreed in principle  
to a settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Monica Lamb of the Houston Comets, who has been involved in  
negotiations, told Houston television station KRIV that ``in large 
part the deal is done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The players have chosen to accept the proposal and to go  
forward with it,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials for the two sides spoke by telephone Tuesday to work  
on specifics in a new collective bargaining agreement, with 
salaries and benefits being the main points. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've made some progress on some issues even though there was  
no formal meeting,'' said Pam Wheeler, director of operations for 
the WNBA players' association. 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Levy, a New York-based agent representing about 30 current  
or former WNBA players, told The Arizona Republic there wasn't 
``any real obstacle'' that still needed to be cleared. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the deal-killers are resolved,'' Levy told the newspaper.  
``There is nothing that is going to stop a contract from being 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Levy said the deal included minimum salaries of $30,000 for  
veterans and $25,000 for rookies plus year-round player health 
benefits. A key factor in settling this issue was allowing players 
to negotiate on merit rather than being predetermined by a slot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Salaries will no longer be arbitrarily set based on where  
you're drafted,'' Levy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Additionally, players would receive a percentage of the league's  
basketball-related income, and the league will establish and 
contribute to a 401k retirement plan. 
</P>
<P>
	As for players from the now-defunct ABL, teams in the WNBA would  
be limited this year to three such players each, with a fourth to 
be allocated to each of the two expansion teams -- Orlando and 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Levy also said the league will continue to pay for housing and  
local transportation for players during the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet to be determined, according to Levy, is the timing of player  
contract guarantees -- whether it's to be the start of the season as 
the players want, halfway through the 32-game season as the league 
proposes, or some compromise period. 
</P>
<P>
	The WNBA pre-draft camp is scheduled to begin Thursday in  
Chicago. League officials have said negotiations must wrap up by 
today if they want to start the camp on time. 
</P>
<P>
	The union has contacted several players over the last two days  
for their feedback on specific proposals, union spokesman Dan 
Wasserman said on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be a vote once a deal is finalized,'' Wasserman  
said. ``We're getting player sentiment on the different issues.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A majority of the 120 WNBA players is needed to ratify the  
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	No player representatives were involved in Tuesday's talks. Only  
league and union officials spoke on the phone, Wheeler said. 
</P>
<P>
	The WNBA's 12-team draft is scheduled for April 27.

<HEADLINE> Predators' Center To Have Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Nashville Predators center Sebastien  
Bordeleau will undergo surgery Thursday for a cracked vertebra he 
suffered when he was checked by an opponent, team officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bordeleau left Monday night's game after the first period  
complaining of neck pain caused when Los Angeles Kings defenseman 
Sean O'Donnell hit him. Team X-rays showed two vertebrae knocked 
out of alignment and he was taken by ambulance to Baptist Hospital, 
where further tests found one was fractured. 
</P>
<P>
	Predators general manager David Poile said the surgery will be  
performed around 12 noon at Baptist Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Team doctor Dr. Michael Pagnani said Tuesday that Bordeleau is  
lucky because he hasn't felt any tingling or numbness in his hands 
or feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Pagnani didn't say how long it would take Bordeleau to recover,  
but he said he should be able to play again. 
</P>
<P>
	Poile wouldn't say whether O'Donnell's hit was illegal but said  
he has talked with NHL officials.

<HEADLINE> Biz Inventories Rise Moderately </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Inventories at American businesses rose a  
moderate 0.4 percent in February even as sales increased a rapid 
0.9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Too big a buildup in inventories in relation to sales can signal  
production cutbacks as businesses work to reduce the backlog of 
unsold goods. 
</P>
<P>
	But the current inventory level is lean. Businesses had enough  
goods on shelves and back lots during both February and January to 
meet demand for 1.37 months, the Commerce Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	That means, according to analysts, that businesses probably will  
increase inventories along with sales and that's a good sign for 
manufacturers, who have been hit hard by recessions in Asia, Latin 
America and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	The February inventory increase, to a seasonally adjusted $1.09  
trillion, came after no change in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The advance in business sales, to $799.3 billion, followed a 0.2  
percent decline the month before. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, manufacturers' inventories were unchanged;  
wholesalers' stocks were up 0.6 percent, and retailers' rose up 0.7 
percent. Sales jumped 1.7 percent at retailers, the strongest in 
five years; 1 percent at wholesalers and 0.3 percent at factories.

<HEADLINE> Radio Competition Newlyweds Split </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) -- A couple who married after winning a  
blind-date radio competition have announced they are splitting up 
less than three months after tying the knot. 
</P>
<P>
	The Church of England demanded Wednesday that the radio station  
apologize to the couple, who met for the first time at the altar 
Jan. 25 after a team of relationship counselors and astrologers 
matched them in what station BRMB called a ``social experiment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Cordell, 28, and Carla Germaine, 23, blamed intrusions from  
the news media for their problems, saying it had put the 
relationship under unbearable pressure. A film crew and newspaper 
reporter accompanied them on their free honeymoon in the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the wedding and honeymoon, the salesman and the model  
won the use of a sports car and a luxury apartment in this central 
England city for a year if they stayed together. 
</P>
<P>
	The wedding sparked outrage among church leaders, who contended  
it reduced the sanctity of marriage to a game show. 
</P>
<P>
	``BRMB put temptation in their way and bear a major  
responsibility for what has happened, including the massive media 
interest which they engineered,'' said the Archdeacon of Aston, 
John Barton. ``I hope this otherwise responsible radio station will 
now have the courage and decency to apologize to the couple and the 
public for devaluing the institution of marriage.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Honors Pearl Harbor Planner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A wing from a bomber and an English Bible are among  
the items on display at a new museum dedicated to the Japanese 
admiral who planned the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
	Isoroku Yamamoto holds a special place in some Japanese people's  
hearts because he opposed the war and warned that Japan could never 
prevail over the might of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	He opposed Japan's alliance with Italy and Germany, fearing war  
with the United States. But once he decided that there was no 
alternative, he masterminded the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in 
Hawaii, which devastated the U.S. Pacific fleet and propelled the 
United States into World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1.4 million museum in Yamamoto's hometown of Nagaoka,  
northern Japan, opens Sunday and will preserve the memories of the 
admiral ``as a person,'' said Shinichi Hara, a Nagaoka resident who 
gathered donations from businesses for the museum. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think he wanted peace,'' said Hara. ``It was the flow of  
the times that was behind what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Japan opened its first national museum dedicated to  
World War II, which set off controversy because the exhibition 
fails to depict Japan's wartime atrocities or aggression. The 
museum, in Tokyo, focuses on Japanese civilian survivors of the 
war, skipping topics such as Pearl Harbor and the military's sexual 
slavery of Asian women. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yamamoto museum also skirts more public issues, centering on  
Yamamoto's personal artifacts, including a letter to his 
wife-to-be, Reiko, in which he asks her to marry him while warning 
that as a military man he would surely neglect her. 
</P>
<P>
	It also displays Yamamoto's works of calligraphy lamenting the  
destruction of war. A wedding photograph, his favorite deck of 
playing cards, his dagger and an English Bible of his will also be 
shown. 
</P>
<P>
	Yamamoto, who studied at Harvard University and later worked in  
Washington, D.C., was shot down by U.S. fighter planes while 
inspecting the front lines over the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	A wing from the Japanese bomber that he was aboard will be a  
centerpiece of the exhibition when the museum opens April 18, the 
56th anniversary of Yamamoto's death.

<HEADLINE> Genentech Admits Illegal Marketing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Genentech Inc. agreed Wednesday to pay $50  
million and plead guilty to illegally marketing its growth hormone 
drug, marking one of the largest-ever fines of a pharmaceutical 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said that Genentech will admit that from  
1985 to 1994 it aggressively marketed the synthetic hormone 
Protropin for treating burns and a kidney disorder, even though 
those uses were not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate statement, Genentech confirmed the plea but would  
only say it promoted the drug ``for medical uses that had not been 
approved by the (FDA).'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the judge approves the plea bargain, it would be the first  
time a pharmaceutical firm is found guilty of the criminal charge 
of promoting a drug for uses not approved by the FDA. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA has also said that Protropin was being prescribed to  
children who were short but otherwise healthy. Genentech did not 
immediately return phone calls requesting information about the 
specific medical uses to which they were pleading guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	Growth hormone, the company's first product, which was launched  
in 1985, was approved for sale to children suffering from a rare 
growth disorder called hypopituitary dwarfism. 
</P>
<P>
	Genetech's Protoprin sales totaled more than $1.2 billion  
between 1985 and 1994. Sales of the drug, which last year were $214 
million, have declined in recent years to due competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions were raised, however, about Genentech's marketing  
tactics. A 1996 survey in the Journal of the American Medical 
Association found that 40 percent of patients were getting the drug 
for uses not approved by the FDA. Off-label use is legal, but drug 
makers may not promote it. 
</P>
<P>
	Government investigations also looked into allegations that  
Genentech gave kickbacks to doctors who were big prescribers. But 
that issue was not included in the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The illegal marketing practices were conducted under a different  
regime at Genentech. The company gained a reputation for aggressive 
marketing under its former chief executive officer, G. Kirk Raab. 
He was fired for financial improprieties in mid-1995, just as the 
federal probe began. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal officials said Genentech halted the illegal marketing in  
1994 and has taken steps to reform its marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	``This insidious practice distorts medical judgments, boosts  
health care premiums and adds to the cost of taxpayer-supported 
government health care plans,'' said U.S. Attorney Robert Mueller. 
</P>
<P>
	About 30,000 children are treated with growth hormones in the  
United States yearly, but the American Academy of Pediatrics 
recommends only limited use, such as for children who have hormone 
deficiencies or a rare chromosomal abnormality. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA has cautioned that attempts to boost a child's height  
for cosmetic reasons could lead to tumors, diabetes, hip problems 
or difficulties with the child's self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
	``This unprecedented prosecution and fine sends a clear and  
strong signal that FDA takes very seriously promotions using 
illegal means,'' said Jane Henney, FDA commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
	Protropin, was controversial from the start because of its  
$20,000 annual cost and because it stirred an ethical debate over 
who should get the drug. 
</P>
<P>
	In the mid-1980s, Genentech faced competition in the  
growth-hormone field from a far larger rival, Eli Lilly &AMP; Co. 
Genentech's tactics helped it to win a larger market share.

<HEADLINE> Simpson Attacked by Gunman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- O.J. Simpson wrestled, bit and chased a  
gunman who confronted the former football star in a golf course 
parking lot and threatened him, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson, who was cut on the hand during Tuesday's incident, said  
he gave up the car chase because the man was running red lights and 
police told him to pull over. The gunman was not found. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson called the incident at a Griffith Park golf course ``the  
weirdest thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I had finished playing golf and was walking to the car saying  
goodbye to my buddies,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``I was 
taking my shoes off between cars and I sensed someone coming up 
behind me. I turned around and he was holding a gun on me. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, 'Man, why do you want to screw up your life? Take my  
car. You don't want to do this.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the man looked at him and called him by his name, saying  
``O.J., I hear you carry a lot of money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The assailant seemed intent on robbing him, Simpson said, but  
when he offered him money and his credit cards, he didn't take 
them. 
</P>
<P>
	``This guy looked like a regular solid citizen,'' he said. ``In  
his 40s, very clean cut. I might have taken him for an off-duty 
policeman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson said he told him people would see him aiming the gun,  
but the man refused to leave. ``He stepped toward me and we 
wrestled for the gun. I bit his hand so he would let go of the 
gun,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Simpson cut his hand with the barrel of the gun.  
</P>
<P>
	``My hand was bleeding and my first reaction wasn't to follow  
him, but I got in my van and followed him. I was chasing him. I 
called the LAPD and advised them where we were. He began to run red 
lights and they told me to pull over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he got the license number from the Oregon plates, which  
he gave to police, then went to the police station. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he thought the incident was an attempted carjacking,  
Simpson said, ``He didn't want the car, he wanted me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, Simpson was acquitted of murdering ex-wife Nicole Brown  
Simpson and Ronald Goldman. He later was found liable for their 
deaths in a civil trial and was ordered to pay $33.5 million in 
damages.

<HEADLINE> iMac Sales Spur Apple Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Apple Computer Inc. more than doubled  
its quarterly profit and beat Wall Street expectations in a strong 
recovery fueled by demand for the company's new iMac personal 
computers. It was the company's sixth straight quarterly profit. 
</P>
<P>
	Apple Computer, which had suffered nearly two years of red ink,  
reported late Wednesday it earned $135 million, or 84 cents a share 
in its fiscal second quarter, which ended March 27. That was up 
from a profit of $55 million, or 38 cents a share, in the same 
quarter a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding one-time gains, Apple would have earned 60 cents a  
share, beating the 57 cents a share predicted by analysts surveyed 
by First Call. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of the hugely popular iMac computers for home users, as  
well as the speedy G3 business computers, gave Apple $1.53 billion 
in revenues in the January-March quarter, typically a slow one for 
computer companies. That was up 9 percent from the same period in 
1998 when revenues reached $1.41 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The report was released after the close of financial markets,  
but Wall Street investors bid up the company's stock in 
anticipation of rosy results. The stock price was up 3.25 percent, 
or $1.26 to $35.75 per share, by the close of trading on the Nasdaq 
Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apple is clearly back on track,'' said analyst Tim Bajarin,  
president of Creative Strategies in Campbell, Calif. ``I don't see 
any reason they won't be able to keep this momentum going, at least 
through the end of this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apple's co-founder and interim CEO Steve Jobs said in a  
statement Wednesday that he is ``delighted that Apple grew faster 
than the industry in its sixth consecutive profitable quarter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apple lost nearly $2 billion between 1995 and 1997. The company  
pioneered the commercial personal computer in the 1970s, and made 
it easy to use in the 1980s with the Macintosh. But it fell on hard 
times in the 1990s as rival machines using Microsoft Corp. software 
largely erased the Mac's ease-of-use advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Shrinking sales and market share led to management shakeups. The  
company began to regain market share after Jobs replaced ousted 
chief executive Gil Amelio in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Apple introduced the colorful and easy-to-use iMac  
desktop personal computer for home users, and the speedy G3 
Macintosh computers aimed at businesses. Apple is also building 
computers to order over the Internet, and has stopping making its 
Newton hand-held devices. Later this year, Apple is planning to 
release a new laptop. 
</P>
<P>
	While all the new products have been successful, it's the iMac  
that took the market by surprise, rapidly becoming a favorite with 
individual computer buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	The iMac was the top-selling personal computer in retail stores  
during the fourth quarter of 1998, and sales of the iMac pushed 
Apple past IBM into third place in retail sales market share in 
February, according to the research firm PC Data.

<HEADLINE> Widow Testifies in General's Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROSEBURG, Ore. (AP) -- Edna Carl looked at a picture of her  
husband and choked back tears as she told jurors how the war hero 
who survived gunfire abroad succumbed in silence to a gunman in his 
own home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I started screaming, `No, no, no, don't do it!' But it was too  
late,'' the 75-year-old testified Tuesday. ``My husband never said 
a word.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The widow was the first witness in the murder trial of Jesse  
Fanus, who is accused of kicking in the door to the couple's 
southern Oregon home last summer and firing a shotgun blast that 
killed the Marine Corps' first flying ace, Maj. Gen. Marion Carl. 
Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Carl described how her 82-year-old husband -- who won the  
Navy Cross twice during World War II -- was a hero to the end, dying 
in a desperate attempt to stop the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
	She told the jury that Fanus burst into the house waving a  
sawed-off shotgun and demanding cash and a car. She said she led 
Fanus to believe she was alone, until her husband came out of a 
back bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``He leaped from the door,'' Mrs. Carl said, adding that a  
flustered Fanus angrily yelled, ``You told me you were alone!'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a split second, she said, Fanus fired a blast that grazed her  
in the head, and then turned and fired another blast that hit her 
husband squarely in the temple. 
</P>
<P>
	``I rushed to him,'' she said of her husband. ``The young boy  
put the gun back in my face and motioned to go into the bedroom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There, she got keys to her car and about $500, which the gunman  
took. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to identify the gunman in court, Mrs. Carl calmly raised  
her finger and pointed to Fanus at the defense table. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, I see him,'' she said. ``Right there,''  
</P>
<P>
	Fanus sat unmoving, looking back at her.  
</P>
<P>
	The 19-year-old defendant was arrested a week after the shooting  
in Pasadena, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Mark Hendershott hinted in his opening that  
Fanus never intended to kill. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll find from the evidence it was not a carefully  
considered shot,'' he said. ``The result should be something less 
than aggravated felony murder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carl, best known for his exploits in the battles of Guadalcanal  
and Midway, finished the war with 18 aerial victories. 
</P>
<P>
	He went on to fly U-2 spy planes over China, command a  
helicopter squadron in Vietnam and head the Navy test flight 
program, briefly holding the air speed record before it was broken 
by Chuck Yeager. 
</P>
<P>
	In the frantic minutes after the shooting, Mrs. Carl said she  
called 911. But when the operator asked her to stay on the line, 
she said: ``I can't. My husband is dying.''

<HEADLINE> Libya Suspects Committed for Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands (AP) -- Two Libyan suspects in the 1988  
Pan Am jet bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, were formally 
committed for trial today. 
</P>
<P>
	The legal formality, carried out in a brief hearing at this  
deserted U.S. air base where the two men will be tried, clears the 
way for the trial to begin in 110 days under Scottish law. 
</P>
<P>
	But a spokesman for Scotland's government said lawyers for the  
suspects may still ask for a delay to give them extra time to ready 
their defense, making a late July trial start unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
	``The clock is now ticking for the trial to start. But they  
could ask for an extension to prepare their case,'' said Scottish 
Office spokesman David Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
	Scottish officials said last week they didn't expect the trial  
to begin for another six months to a year. Once it gets under way, 
the trial itself could take another year or more, legal experts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously it is for the judge to decide, but you would expect  
them to have a reasonably sound case (for an extension),'' Hamilton 
said. ``I think it is unrealistic to expect a refusal from the 
judge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Libya surrendered the suspects April 5 for trial in the  
Netherlands after Libyan leader Moammar Ghadafi agreed to a trial 
on Dutch soil as a neutral venue. Under a treaty with the 
Netherlands, Camp Zeist, about 30 miles southeast of Amsterdam, 
will be considered Scottish soil for the duration of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men -- suspected former Libyan intelligence agents Abdel  
Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah -- have proclaimed 
their innocence. If convicted, they face up to life imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair entered no plea at today's committal hearing.  
</P>
<P>
	They are charged with murder, conspiracy to commit murder and  
violations of international aviation safety laws in the Dec. 21, 
1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. 
</P>
<P>
	A bomb planted in a suitcase aboard the jumbo jet killed all 259  
passengers and crew, mostly Americans and Britons, and 11 people on 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Megrahi and Fhimah are being held under tight security at  
Camp Zeist, where more than 100 heavily armed Scottish police 
officers and other officials are based. 
</P>
<P>
	Within hours of their handover, the United Nations suspended  
sanctions that were imposed on Libya in 1992 and 1993 for refusing 
to surrender the suspects.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Details Retirement Accounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton provided long-awaited  
details Wednesday of his plan to give tax credits to millions of 
Americans to encourage retirement savings in new personal 
investment accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Releasing the proposal the day before the annual income tax  
filing deadline, Clinton said the accounts would benefit mostly 
low- and moderate-income workers and are ``the right way to provide 
tax relief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the kind of tax cut America needs, targeted toward  
working families, toward savings and toward the future,'' Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans pushing instead for across-the-board income tax cuts  
gave the plan a lukewarm reception. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means  
Committee, said he favors bolstering retirement savings but 
Clinton's overall budget ``raises taxes on some Americans to give 
tax cuts to others, which divides our country and isn't fair.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's plan would provide a $300 annual tax credit each for  
workers and their spouses to invest in personal accounts known as 
Universal Savings Accounts. The USA program would be similar to the 
401(k) plans that many businesses now offer their employees. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Clinton would provide up to $350 -- or $700 for a  
couple filing a joint tax return -- as a government match to money 
people save on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	The benefits would begin to phase out at household incomes  
around $40,000. Households with incomes above $100,000 and 
individuals with incomes above $50,000 would, for the most part, 
not be eligible unless they did not have any retirement plan 
through work. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration estimates that about 124 million Americans  
would get some benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said the program is needed because half of Americans get  
no pension benefits from their employers. 
</P>
<P>
	``With these accounts, working families will have the chance to  
invest just as wealthier families do,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a Rose Garden ceremony, the president cited Andrew and Teresa  
Goldschmidt of Drexel Hill, Pa., as the type of couple gaining from 
his plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldschmidt is a self-employed plumber and heating contractor.  
His wife stays home to care for their three young boys. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a long road ahead and do what we can,'' said  
Goldschmidt. ``But I think to myself as the years pass, what will I 
live on during retirement?'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to administration officials, a couple such as the  
Goldschmidts, who would qualify for the maximum benefits under 
Clinton's plan, could be eligible for an upfront tax credit of $300 
per person, for a maximum of $600 for the family. A tax credit is 
an amount subtracted from taxes owed. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, if husband and wife each put $350 of their own  
income into a savings plan, the government would match those 
savings. 
</P>
<P>
	So, the $700 put in by the couple would be matched by $700 from  
the government, for total government contribution of $1,300. 
</P>
<P>
	The family would have a limited choice of investments, such as  
stock and bond mutual funds, and their accounts could not be 
touched until retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton proposed the accounts in his State of the Union speech  
in January, as part of his overall plan for using $4.8 trillion in 
projected government surpluses expected over the next 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The accounts would use up about 12 percent of the surpluses and  
would be an addition to Social Security benefits. Separately, 
Clinton has proposed devoting another 77 percent of expected 
surpluses directly to Social Security and Medicare. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans instead support a plan that would divert money  
Social Security now collects from workers' paychecks into personal 
investment accounts that would ultimately replace some Social 
Security benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's retirement accounts, however, are similar in some  
respects to proposals by the Senate Finance Committee chairman, 
Sen. William Roth, R-Del., and the House Budget Committee chairman, 
Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	To qualify for Clinton's accounts, workers would have to be  
between the ages of 18 and 70 and earn at least $5,000 a year. The 
maximum $300 annual tax credit would phase out. Those with over 
$80,000 would not be eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	The government matching contribution would phase down from a  
dollar-for-dollar match for the lowest earners to 50 cents on the 
dollar for those with incomes of $80,000 a year. In most cases, it 
would be eliminated entirely at $100,000.

<HEADLINE> Gun Dealer Settles With Chicago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A gun dealer has agreed to testify in the city's  
$433 million lawsuit that accuses the firearms industry of flooding 
the streets with weapons deliberately marketed to criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Taborden is the owner of Bob's Sports Headquarters in  
Justice, Ill., and is the first of 40 gun dealers and makers named 
in the suit to settle. He also agreed to cooperate in an 
investigation of the gun industry. 
</P>
<P>
	In return, the city and Cook County will drop all claims for  
monetary damages against Taborden and his business, said Jennifer 
Hoyle, a spokeswoman for the city's law department. 
</P>
<P>
	``We now have a witness who can give us an insider's account of  
the manner in which this industry knowingly markets illegal 
firearms in Chicago,'' plaintiff's lawyer Brian Crowe said Tuesday. 
``This will strengthen our case immeasurably.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Jakala, an attorney representing Taborden, said the  
settlement was his client's most reasonable option. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just look at the damage claim. He was facing a monumental  
damage claim,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, which officials expect to be a national test case,  
charges the gun industry with creating a public nuisance in Chicago 
by oversupplying suburban gun stores with firearms, knowing they 
will eventually make their way back into the city. Chicago has some 
of the toughest gun laws in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar lawsuits have been filed in New Orleans, Miami, Atlanta  
and Bridgeport, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Taborden's shop has entered into a consent decree under which  
the business will either close within 90 days or comply with a set 
of rules designed to prevent irresponsible firearms marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Taborden could not be reached Tuesday, and an employee at his  
suburban store refused to take a message.

<HEADLINE> Pharmacy Sued After Boy's Death </HEADLINE>

<P>
	LAREDO, Texas (AP) -- An 8-year-old boy died after a pharmacy  
gave him a drug for heroin addicts instead of one for hyperactive 
children, according to a lawsuit filed by the child's parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricardo Rogelio Gonzalez, who had attention deficit disorder,  
died in December. Employees at Rodriguez Pharmacy in Laredo had 
refilled the boy's prescription for Ritalin with methadone, a drug 
used to ease addicts off heroin, said Octavio Salinas, an attorney

	``The parents want the community to know so that this won't ever  
happen again to anybody,'' Salinas said Tuesday. 
</P>

<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Newspaper publisher and TV broadcaster Gray  
Communications Systems Inc. is buying three CBS television 
affiliates in Texas for $139 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The acquisitions would give the Atlanta-based company 13  
television stations, 10 of them CBS affiliates. Gray will get KWTX 
in Waco; KBTX in Bryan, a satellite station of KWTX; and KXII,

	Gray is paying $41.5 million in cash in the deal with KXII  
Broadcasters Inc., while stock and cash totaling about $97.5 
million are involved in the deal for the two other stations. 
</P>
<P>
	The transactions are subject to approval by shareholders of Gray  
and the selling companies, plus government regulatory approval. 
Gray said it expects the transactions to close before the end of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray operates three daily newspapers in Georgia -- The Albany  
Herald, The Rockdale Citizen in Conyers and the Gwinnett Daily Post

<HEADLINE> Teen-Ager Gets 70 Years for Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOMS RIVER, N.J. (AP) -- Portrayed as both victim and criminal, a  
teen-ager who admitted to killing an 11-year-old boy apologized as 
he was sentenced to 70 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Manzie, 17, described by prosecutors as a sociopath  
``programmed to have sex, rape and kill,'' told the victim's 
parents he doesn't know how he got that way: ``I still can't figure 
out why I did what I did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He will have plenty of time to think about it. A judge ordered  
Manzie to serve at least 59 1/2 years in prison before becoming 
eligible for parole. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie Werner was strangled after he came to Manzie's house  
selling items for the PTA in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Manzie killed the boy for rejecting his sexual  
advances. He later shot a photo of the boy's half-naked body, a 
necktie and alarm clock cord around his neck. 
</P>
<P>
	With his head bowed, Manzie calmly read a statement of apology,  
saying he was sorry ``for all of the suffering I've put so many 
people through.'' He ha pleaded guilty to murder. 
</P>
<P>
	The apology came during an emotional 2 1/2-hour courtroom drama  
Wednesday in which Manzie's mother was ejected for an angry 
outburst and Werner's grieving parents called for a life prison 
term. 
</P>
<P>
	The Manzies blamed psychiatrists and other mental health experts  
for not locking their son up before he killed the boy. His parents 
asked a judge to do so less than a week before the killing, but the 
judge released Manzie to his parents' custody.

<HEADLINE> West Texas Homes Destroyed by Winds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Tornadoes, baseball-size hail and heavy rain  
pounded West Texas, ripping roofs from houses and leaving dozens of 
families homeless. Only minor injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Hail accumulated in piles like snowdrifts in the Midland area,  
and wind gusting to more than 70 mph uprooted large trees. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was raining and then it went to hail,'' said Midland  
resident John Buntin. ``You couldn't see five feet from the 
window.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The wind damaged up to 150 homes in Midland County late Tuesday  
and knocked out electricity to dozens more. At least 20 homes were 
destroyed, said Lt. Judy Altom of the Texas Department of Public 
Safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Families forced from their homes were put up at Midland motels  
that donated space, said Doug Belcher, coordinator of a shelter set 
up at Cotton Flat Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
	As the storms rolled across the Dallas-Fort Worth area early  
today, wind damaged at least two weekend homes at Possum Kingdom 
Lake, said Brazos River Authority spokesman Mike Cox. 
</P>
<P>
	And today in southeastern Texas, a tornado struck the Woodcreek  
Shopping Center in Conroe, destroying at least one business and 
damaging others, police reported from the town just north of 
Houston. Stores had not yet opened and no one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	Hail as big as baseballs fell Tuesday in sparsely populated  
sections of Midland County. Hail broke windows at the sheriff's 
office in Colorado City and smashed the windshield of a state 
trooper's car near the town of Panhandle. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Weather Service said twisters touched down near  
Rotan, McCamey, Upton and Greenwood, where up to 3 1/2 inches of rain 
fell, but no injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The eastern fringes of the weather system spread moderate  
rainfall today through parts of Tennessee and into northern 
Georgia, among the Southeast states that have had hundreds of 
forest fires because of dry weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Weakening wind and increased public awareness had already  
reduced the numbers of fires in Georgia, the Georgia Forestry 
Commission reported today. The state had 73 wildfires that damaged 
593 acres Tuesday, down from 131 fires covering 5,404 acres Monday, 
the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	A fire in Georgia's Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge had  
grown to 600 acres today. It started Sunday and a dozen campers 
were evacuated from Stephen Foster State Park, about a mile from 
the fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Before today's rain, dozens of fires had charred more than 4,000  
acres of central and eastern Tennessee since the weekend. The 
biggest blaze had covered more than 3,100 acres in Sequatchie and 
Grundy counties. It was contained today but continued to burn. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida Gov. Jeb Bush has declared a state of emergency,  
allowing the National Guard to help firefighters, because months of 
drought have left the state on the verge of a repeat of last 
summer's devastating wildfires. At least two homes were destroyed 
by fire early this week. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 fires have burned nearly 2,000 acres in western  
North Carolina since Friday.

<HEADLINE> Red-Hot Red Sox Keep Perspective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Walk into the Boston Red Sox clubhouse after a  
victory and there's no music blaring. Instead, some players are 
quietly watching television cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason Boston is off to its best start in 44 years is that  
its players take the highs and lows in stride. Despite the loss of 
Mo Vaughn to free agency and Nomar Garciaparra to a hamstring 
injury, there haven't been many lows so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really tough if you come into the clubhouse after the  
game to tell who won,'' Bret Saberhagen said. ``It's good we don't 
have music in the clubhouse. With music playing, everybody gets too 
excited when you win. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then when you lose and don't have the music on, there's too  
much emphasis on one loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, that's all there's been. One loss.  
</P>
<P>
	And Boston rallied from a 4-0 deficit in that game to tie Tampa  
Bay 4-4 last Sunday before losing 5-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Pitching has been the biggest reason for the Red Sox's 6-1  
start. Saberhagen is 2-0 and hasn't allowed a run in 12 2-3 
innings. Mark Portugal is 1-0 and unscored on in 6 1-3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Throw in a 2-0 start by Pedro Martinez and a 1-0 start by Tim  
Wakefield and Boston's rotation has been dominant in a series of 
low-scoring games. The Red Sox have outscored opponents 34-13 in 
seven games and have a 1.74 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pitching is going to keep us in a lot of games this year  
because we've got a solid fourth starter (Portugal) and I've had a 
full season since coming off surgery,'' Saberhagen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Boston's day off Wednesday, Saberhagen pitched 6 2-3  
innings in Tuesday's 6-0 victory over the Chicago White Sox. He 
said he threw without pain, something that never happened last 
season despite a 15-8 record. He had missed most of the previous 
two seasons following shoulder surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Sox had the AL's second-best record last year, but few  
forecasters picked them to make the playoffs this season. The 
successful start doesn't mean they'll continue to win, and, with 
the New York Yankees in the AL East, it certainly doesn't mean the 
Red Sox will win the division. 
</P>
<P>
	But predictions that they would fall apart after Vaughn signed  
with Anaheim seem off base. Boston is 4-1 in the last five games 
even though Garciaparra was limited to just one pinch-hitting 
appearance and doesn't expect to play Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't gave big heroes here. Everybody's playing the game to  
just add a little bit,'' Martinez said. ``I think that's one of the 
keys to the team being successful so far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Offerman is another.  
</P>
<P>
	He was the main hitter general manager Dan Duquette signed as a  
free agent and won't make fans forget Vaughn any time soon. After 
all, Vaughn hit 40 homers last year while Offerman has 22 in his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	But as Vaughn recovers from a sprained ankle suffered in the  
California Angels' opener, Offerman is 15-for-32 with six doubles, 
three triples and five RBIs. He even was walked intentionally in 
the seventh inning Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	His four-year, $26 million deal for which Duquette was ridiculed  
seems like a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
	``How many times do you see them walk the leadoff hitter  
intentionally?'' Boston manager Jimy Williams asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been fantastic for us,'' Boston reliever Derek Lowe said.  
``He gets on base for the middle of our lineup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe is part of a bullpen that is doing even better than the  
starters. He gave up the only two runs relievers have allowed in 20 
innings. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, Boston's victories have come against Kansas City, Tampa  
Bay and Chicago and its next eight games are against Chicago, Tampa 
Bay and Detroit before a three-game home series with Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``Beating any team builds our confidence,'' left fielder Troy  
O'Leary said. ``When we play New York or Baltimore, we'll have that 
confidence.''

<HEADLINE> Black Artists Have Works Restored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- One painting was covered with soot, the artist's  
name invisible. Restored, the image of a black butler working as a 
rare free man before the emancipation of slaves now shines from the 
canvas. 
</P>
<P>
	A mural of blacks who changed history had been rolled up for  
decades, creased and cracked. The huge 1940 canvas by Charles 
White, ``Progress of the American Negro,'' now has a new life at 
the entrance to The Studio Museum in Harlem. 
</P>
<P>
	The paintings are part of ``To Conserve a Legacy,'' a 200-work  
exhibit from six historically black American colleges -- art 
repositories for generations of black Americans who had been 
excluded from the cultural mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
	The show is part of a $1.3 million project that resulted in the  
restoration and documentation of 1,400 works belonging to the half 
dozen schools. As a result, students learned conservation 
techniques to which few had been exposed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wondered why there were so few minorities in conservation,''  
said Jock Reynolds, director of the Yale University Art Gallery, 
co-curator of the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit's other main curator, Richard Powell, said the art  
reflects the modern American experience, ``but it's not the story 
of American art you will get from a museum like the Whitney,'' the 
New York City museum specializing in American works. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are colleges founded after emancipation, and their  
concept was that of freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The show documents the price of that freedom.  
</P>
<P>
	A section titled ``American Expressionism'' shows the naked body  
of a black man who was lynched, his head twisted to one side, a 
noose around the broken neck. The 1936 wooden sculpture by Nat 
Werner hasn't been exhibited very much because the image is so 
graphic. 
</P>
<P>
	Another in-your-face painting, John Biggers' ``Old Coffee  
Drinker'' from 1945, depicts a man in tattered clothes with his 
toes sticking out of huge ragged shoes. He clutches his cup with 
world-weary stoicism. 
</P>
<P>
	Biggers' ``wasn't interested in things pretty, but in the guts  
and grime,'' Powell said of the canvas that had been rolled up for 
years in the artist's Texas garage. 
</P>
<P>
	Other artists fascinated with the education of a newly freed  
people -- in everything from agriculture to traditional academics -- 
are exhibited in a section called ``Training the Head, the Hand, 
and the Heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A series of photographs by Frances Benjamin Johnston, believed  
to be the first female press photographer, shows students at 
Hampton College, where blacks and Native Americans were both trying 
to enter American society. 
</P>
<P>
	Another pioneer educational institution for blacks was Tuskegee  
University in Alabama, established in 1881 by Booker T. Washington. 
The fine art collection he contributed to the school is part of the 
exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the artists tapped into European traditions, while  
telling a quintessentially American story. ``Young African-American 
artists began looking at their world using European techniques,'' 
Powell said. 
</P>
<P>
	He pointed to a marble sculpture in neoclassical style,  
``Forever Free,'' whose heady liberationist spirit is very American 
-- a woman kneeling by a standing man, his broken shackles raised 
above his head. The sculptor was Edmonia Lewis, who was half black 
and half Indian. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are canonical pieces in African-American history,''  
Powell says of the art that is part of a section titled ``Forever 
Free: Emancipation Visualized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the exhibition highlights black artists like Jacob  
Lawrence, Romare Bearden, Horace Pippin and Henry Tanner, but the 
schools' holdings also include work by artists of other ethnic 
backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
	From Fisk University come paintings donated by Georgia O'Keeffe,  
who also gave to Fisk some photographs taken by her husband, Alfred 
Stieglitz. 
</P>
<P>
	And the avant-garde work of the late Josef Albers is displayed  
along with a geometric painting by William T. Williams, a prolific 
contemporary artist still working in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibition that started at the Williamstown Art Conservation  
Center in Massachusetts was organized by the Addison Gallery of 
American Art in Andover, Mass., and The Studio Museum, which is 
celebrating its 30th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid the pain of history, the exhibit offers much visual  
pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1934 night street scene by Archibald Motley, ``Black Belt,''  
is a palate of vivid colors depicting a festive crowd, and Motley's 
``The Liar'' features a group of carefree men smoke, drink and play 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to Fisk, Hampton and Tuskegee, the art comes from  
Howard University, Clark Atlanta University and North Carolina 
Central University. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of the project, funded by sponsors including AT&AMP;T  
and the Ford Motor Company, students helped revive works such as 
Elizabeth Catlett's ``Negro Woman,'' whose wooden face had fallen 
off. The subject's high cheekbones are now again illuminated by 
eyes made of onyx. 
</P>
<P>
	And the students breathed new life into the 1858 portrait of the  
Baltimore butler by Thomas Waterman Wood from the Howard 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was covered in soot, the frame was green. And we only saw  
the artist's signature after cleaning,'' said Powell, chairman of 
the art history department at Duke University. 
</P>
<P>
	The show remains at the Studio Museum until July 11, then  
travels to five of the universities as well as the Corcoran Gallery 
of Art in Washington, D.C., and the Art Institute of Chicago.

<HEADLINE> More U.S. Planes Head to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration, signaling that the  
U.S.-led NATO air campaign in Yugoslavia could stretch into summer, 
is adding close-in attack helicopters and planes to the force to 
hit Serb troops and aircraft accused of targeting fleeing ethnic 
Albanian refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. military leaders, in closed-door meetings with  
congressional officials, suggested NATO is poised to continue the 
three-week-old air campaign for several weeks longer, possibly into 
midsummer if Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's forces 
continue fighting Kosovar Albanians in the Serbian province of 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Army Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,  
told lawmakers that while bombing has been frequently hampered by 
weather, conditions usually improve in the Balkans in June and 
July, the officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be a sustained campaign,'' said one lawmaker  
who was briefed. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S.-led Gulf War in 1991 lasted only six weeks.  
</P>
<P>
	Shelton and Defense Secretary William Cohen were appearing today  
before the Senate Armed Service Committee to update lawmakers on 
the NATO airstrikes, which began March 24. 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was testifying before the  
House Appropriations Committee as U.S. officials put together an 
emergency budget request to pay for NATO operations. 
</P>
<P>
	White House budget chief Jacob Lew met for nearly an hour  
Wednesday with Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who said 
the Clinton administration was discussing something in the $4 
billion to $8 billion range. He said the administration wants to 
pay for the entire Balkans package using the expected federal 
surplus, including costs of caring for at least 500,000 refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, that's not what we'll get our members to go along  
with,'' Lott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans seem eager to pay for military costs of the  
crisis with the surplus while finding budget cuts to pay for the 
rest of it. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, NATO accused Serb forces of attacking a refugee  
convoy in retaliation for a NATO airstrike against a military 
convoy traveling on the same road near Djakovica in southwest 
Kosovo. The Serbs, however, blamed NATO airstrikes for the deaths 
of 64 refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, U.N. officials said 600 women and children refugees  
reported being attacked by Serb aircraft as they fled from Prizen, 
Kosovo, toward Albania, according to the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said it was difficult for NATO  
to target Serb fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters that, until now, 
had been occasionally attacking Kosovo Liberation Army strongholds 
but not civilians. NATO also has had a tough time setting its 
sights on Serb army, security and paramilitary troops and tanks 
hiding in the mountains of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``As we move more forces into the area and bring more forces to  
the fight and do more to suppress his air defenses, we would be 
able to get at these forces that we haven't already eliminated,'' 
Bacon said. ``It's not always easy to hit helicopters that fly 
close to the earth in hilly terrain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the a move to bolster NATO forces, Apache attack helicopters  
began arriving in Albania on Wednesday and the full contingent of 
24 was expected by today or Friday. NATO and President Clinton need 
to give final approval for the gunships to be used in battle. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Army Gen. Wesley Clark, commander of NATO, has requested  
the Apache force be doubled to 48, U.S. defense officials said. 
That would mean adding several thousand U.S. soldiers to the 2,500 
now in Albania to operate the Apaches and multiple rocket launchers 
used to clear a strike path. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 82 fresh U.S. warplanes also were arriving today in Europe  
to join NATO airstrikes, including 24 F-16 jet-fighters, four 
low-flying A-10 attack airplanes, 15 Marine EA-6B radar jammers to 
interfere with Serb air defenses and 38 refueling tankers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon said Serbs have fired dozens of surface-to-air  
missiles at allied planes in the past two days in the biggest 
demonstration yet of anti-aircraft fire. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the buildup, the Clinton administration is preparing  
within days to call up at least several thousand military 
reservists and approve deploying 300 more warplanes to join NATO 
airstrikes. That would bring the total air power to 1,000 aircraft 
-- two-thirds of them American. 
</P>
<P>
	Maj. Gen. Charles Wald, a planner for the Joint Chiefs, called  
the buildup and intensifying campaign ``an indication of our 
resolve that we're going to see this thing through to the end.''

<HEADLINE> Cos. To Test-Market Irradiated Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Gene Ray envisions a world where children eat  
meat decontaminated by low-grade electron beams like they readily 
drink milk decontaminated by pasteurization. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray is president and chief executive of Titan Corp., which is  
installing what he says is the first system in the country to 
electronically pasteurize ground beef for commercial purposes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's something that we have to do,'' he said Tuesday.  
``There is a real public health problem, and in every case, it has 
been proved that (the process) is perfectly safe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego-based Titan will build and operate the so-called  
``E-beam system,'' and meatpacking giants IBP Inc. and Excel Corp. 
will test market the irradiated beef later by early 2000 to gauge 
consumer acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest in irradiation has grown since recent contamination  
scares, including 1997's recall of 25 million pounds of ground beef 
feared contaminated with E. coli bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had several major customers express interest in offering  
the product,'' said Gary Mickelson, a spokesman for IBP. ``So 
that's contributed to our interest. It's another layer of 
protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During irradiation, meat is subjected to low-level doses of  
gamma rays or electron beams. Ray believes the electron beam 
process is superior to gamma ray irradiation because the technology 
is easier and cheaper to implement. Both, he said, are equally 
safe. 
</P>
<P>
	The process has been used for years on limited amounts of  
produce, spices and poultry, but the irradiation of red meat was 
just approved by the federal government in February. 
</P>
<P>
	Some groups have opposed the procedure if it involves gamma  
rays, and health advocates worry that using irradiation might 
compromise other safety measures such as proper handling and plant 
sanitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Excel spokesman Mark Klein said he feels confident the informed  
public will not have concerns about irradiated meat. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have to let people know that the technology is safe and  
that if they're looking for that added measure of safety, they may 
very well want to try this,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said irradiated beef could cost slightly more than untreated  
meat.

<HEADLINE> New York Times Co.'s Earnings Dip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Times Co.'s net earnings dipped in  
the first quarter as the company spent more on a national expansion 
of its flagship newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	But earnings per share edged higher due to a share buyback  
program, the company announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times reported net income of $61.4 million in the  
first three months of 1999, down 5 percent from $64.6 million in 
the same period a year ago. The year-ago figure included a one-time 
gain of $4.6 million from the sale of equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings per share rose to 34 cents from 33 cents because of a  
stock repurchase program which decreased the number of New York 
Times shares in circulation. 
</P>
<P>
	The per-share figures were in line with Wall Street  
expectations. In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, the 
company's shares rose $1.31 1/4 to $31.25. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a 3 percent decline in newsprint costs, the company's  
total costs rose 2.9 percent in the quarter due to higher wages and 
salaries and costs associated with a national expansion of The New 
York Times newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall revenues increased 2.3 percent to $739.1 million from  
$722.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspaper operations, which make up most of the company's  
business, had revenue growth of 3.2 percent due mainly to higher 
advertising rates and volume at The New York Times newspaper and 
the company's regional papers. 
</P>
<P>
	Performance at The Boston Globe was weaker due to continued  
slackness in help wanted ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Weekday net paid circulation for The New York Times newspaper  
rose 2.2 percent from the same period last year to 1.13 million, 
and Sunday circulation rose 3 percent to 1.71 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to its two main newspapers, the company also  
publishes 21 regional newspapers and three magazines including Golf 
Digest. It owns eight network-affiliated TV stations and two New 
York City radio stations.

<HEADLINE>  Algerian Candidates Charge Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- All but one candidate withdrew today  
from the contest for Algeria's presidency, protesting fraud in 
early voting meant to give the North African country its first 
civilian leader. 
</P>
<P>
	The move threw the nationwide vote set for Thursday into chaos,  
leaving only the favored candidate, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, in the 
running. Bouteflika is widely believed to have the support of the 
powerful military. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate reaction from the government or from  
Bouteflika. Constitutional experts said that according to the law, 
the vote would go on as planned -- with only one candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	The six candidates made their announcement in a joint statement  
after President Liamine Zeroual, a retired general, refused to meet 
them to discuss their grievances and suggested they file an 
official complaint about the alleged fraud. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE>  Algerian Candidates Charge Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- All but one candidate withdrew today  
from the contest for Algeria's presidency, protesting fraud in 
early voting meant to give the North African country its first 
civilian leader. 
</P>
<P>
	The move threw the nationwide vote set for Thursday into chaos,  
leaving only the favored candidate, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, in the 
running. Bouteflika is widely believed to have the support of the 
powerful military. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate reaction from the government or from  
Bouteflika. Constitutional experts said that according to the law, 
the vote would go on as planned -- with only one candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	The six candidates made their announcement in a joint statement  
after President Liamine Zeroual, a retired general, refused to meet 
them to discuss their grievances and suggested they file an 
official complaint about the alleged fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Zeroual, who is stepping down 18 months before the end of his  
five-year term, had personally guaranteed fair elections. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote was meant to give Algeria its first civilian president

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes at Record 10,511.66 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors anxious about earnings dumped  
technology shares once again today, nearly spoiling a rally in blue 
chip stocks that sent the Dow Jones industrials to another closing 
high -- up 16.655 tyo 10,411.66. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite index, which is heavily weighted with  
technology issues, fell sharply in what was expected to be 
record-high volume. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index also retreated. 
</P>
<P>
	The S&AMP;P 500 fell 21.32 to 1,328.50, and the Nasdaq composite  
fell 76.01 to 2,507.49. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 11-to-7 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,769 up, 1,282 down and 532 
unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 949.68 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
808.03 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 6.00 to 625.67, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index declined 1.68 to 736.12. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.15 to 417.39.  
</P>
<P>
	But as investors sold tech shares for a second day, they  
replaced them with manufacturing, transportation and 
basic-materials stocks that have been out of favor for some time. 
That buying sent the Dow past 10,500 for the first time, but the 
index gave up ground before closing up 16.65 at 10,411.66, its 
third straight record high close. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors are returning to manufacturing stocks amid the growing  
belief that the world economy is recovering, said Peter Canelo, 
U.S. investment strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. Threats 
of a world-wide recession had ``really (been) the killer for these 
export-sensitive industrial based companies,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ciaran O'Kelly, a stock trader at Salomon Smith Barney had a  
simpler explanation. Spooked by a warning late Tuesday from Intel 
that revenues from chip sales might soften in the second quarter, 
investors yanked money while they could out of risky high-tech 
issues, particularly Internet-related stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors who have had large profits in tech names, and in  
Internet technology in particular, are losing their nerves a 
little,'' O'Kelly said. ``It's almost a defensive strategy to sell 
Internet stocks, cash in and put the money to work and go 
bottom-fishing'' in cheaper names. 
</P>
<P>
	The leaders among the 30 Dow component were studded by stocks  
that are sensitive to changes in the global economy, including 
Alcoa, up more than 6 points; Caterpillar, up nearly 6; Boeing, up 
more than 4; and International Paper, up nearly 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation stocks also climbed, most notably airline shares,  
pushing the Dow Transportation average higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow component J.P. Morgan soared, after the bank holding  
company's first-quarter earnings were nearly double what analysts 
expected. Fleet Financial was up 7/8 at 43 15/16 after the 
Boston-based bank also beat estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	But those two stocks failed to carry the entire financial  
services sector higher, an illustration, O'Kelly said, that they 
are too expensive for the bargain hunters who held sway. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Intel fell sharply, fueling a sell-off in computer  
related issues. The computer chip maker reported first-quarter net 
earnings 2 cents a share above analysts' expectations late Tuesday, 
but said second-quarter sales might be soft. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer stocks were also big losers. Dow components Procter &AMP;  
Gamble and Johnson &AMP; Johnson were sharply lower.

<TEXT>
<P>
	PARMA, Italy (AP) -- Gabriel Batistuta scored off a rebound with  
nine minutes left Wednesday night, giving Fiorentina a 1-1 tie at 
Parma in the first leg of the Italian Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
	Batistuta, who leads the Italian League in scoring with 19  
goals, beat defender Lilian Thuram to the ball and slotted it home 
from 8 yards after goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon dove to block an 
angled shot by Edmundo. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernan Crespo took advantage of a defensive blunder to put Parma  
ahead in the 16th minute. He chipped a loose ball into the net from 
steps away after defender Tomas Repka botched a clear attempt of 
Mario Stanic's cross. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Crespo's 26th goal this season. He has five each in the  
Italian Cup and UEFA Cup, plus 16 in league action -- second only to 
Batistuta.

	MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) -- About 80 armed university students  
broke into the Foreign Ministry on Wednesday and occupied the 
building for an hour to demand increased funding for education. 
</P>
<P>
	Ministry spokesman Cesar Ubeda said the students were masked and  
carried homemade grenade-launchers and explosives. He said they 
broke windows and scrawled slogans on the walls. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
	The protest was one of a series to demand that the government

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Pope John Paul II will visit

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Colombia's violence-prone capital  
enjoyed its first day in three years without a murder, police said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in ``about three years'' there were no  
homicides over a twenty-four hour period, said Bogota police 
spokesman Sgt. Alberto Cantillo. 
</P>
<P>
	He could not say exactly when the last homicide-free day was  
registered. Nor was he making any bets on whether the trend would 
last. ``We'll see if the statistic holds up tomorrow,'' Cantillo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen people die violently on an average day in the city of  
about six million residents. The figure includes automobile 
fatalities as well as shootings and stabbings. 
</P>
<P>
	Bogota's alarming violence is indicative of the country of 40  
million people as a whole. Colombia's roughly 25,000 killings per 
year give it one of the world's highest murder rates.

	Mexican negotiators turned down Panama's request to allow for  
immediate tariff-free imports of beef, shrimp, lobsters, tuna and

<P>
	Trade between Panama and Mexico totals about $160 million a

said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic retail automotive sales of 137,879 units during the  
period were 8.6 percent below the first quarter of 1998, the 
Mexican Automotive Industry Association said in a press release.

<P>
	Total production for the quarter was up one percent from the  
356,245 units produced in the first quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	For March alone, General Motors Corp. led the market with 14,791

<HEADLINE> Senate Panel Lashes IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Senate committee tore into Olympic leaders  
Wednesday over the Salt Lake bribery scandal and took quick action 
to place the IOC under the same law that deals with corrupt 
governments. 
</P>
<P>
	With two members calling for International Olympic Committee  
president Juan Antonio Samaranch to resign and a general skepticism 
that the IOC was ready to clean up its act, the Senate Commerce 
Committee repeatedly criticized a ``culture of corruption'' that 
left the rings tarnished and the games defamed. 
</P>
<P>
	``A pattern of payoffs, palace intrigue and padded budgets has  
clouded over the integrity of the Olympics,'' Sen. Ron Wyden, 
D-Ore., said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite some senators' urging that immediate financial action be  
taken, commerce panel chairman Sen. John McCain said he wanted to 
go slow on legislation that would make the Olympics a 
less-attractive product for sponsors and direct billion-dollar TV 
rights fees to the U.S. Olympic Committee instead of the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Such legislation could wind up hurting athletes training for  
next year's games in Sydney and the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt 
Lake, the powerful Arizona Republican said. 
</P>
<P>
	But McCain, who held two IOC members to an excruciating 45  
minutes of questioning on Olympic finances and reform intentions, 
said he would immediately introduce a bill to place the 
international panel under the Federal Corrupt Practices Act, which 
forbids bribery of foreign officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll do it today,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The White House, meanwhile, said it hoped to have an answer soon  
on a USOC request to make the IOC a public body under international 
anti-corruption statutes. 
</P>
<P>
	After the three-hour session, McCain said he would consider a  
second hearing as IOC efforts to bounce back from the worst 
corruption case in its 105 years became clearer, well before the 
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had hoped we would come away from this hearing will a better  
feeling and understanding of the IOC's intentions on reform,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain was upset by the lack of support from Anita DeFrantz and  
James Easton, the two U.S. IOC members, for the main portions of an 
Olympic reform report by former Senate Majority Leader George 
Mitchell, another witness. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz, an IOC vice president hand-picked to testify by  
Samaranch, and Easton categorically endorsed just one of the 
report's four main recommendations, on term limits for IOC members 
who now are essentially elected for life. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's very interesting,'' McCain said with a raised eyebrow  
during the hearing. He later said he was ``very concerned about 
their lack of enthusiasm for the Mitchell commission 
recommendations,'' and that the IOC should carry the ``burden of 
proof'' if it fails to adopt them. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain spent large amounts of time trying to pin down the IOC  
members on financial matters, asking DeFrantz three times how much 
money the Olympic committee spent on direct support of athletes. 
DeFrantz finally said she did not know. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, McCain repeatedly asked how much the Lausanne,  
Switzerland-based IOC made each year. DeFrantz said the committee's 
budget was $40 million but did not know annual income figures, and 
finally had to ask for time to produce a written report, again 
being chastised by the chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly did not get a `go get 'em guys' type of  
encouragement,'' said DeFrantz, a lawyer who was testifying before 
Congress for the sixth time. ``But maybe the skepticism will help 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	News that the IOC kept the minutes of its general assemblies  
secret for 10 years, and those of executive board sessions locked 
up for 20 years, brought expressions of disbelief from McCain. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sixty percent of the IOC's income is from American  
corporations and donations and the American people deserve to know 
what happens in those meetings,'' he told DeFrantz. 
</P>
<P>
	But McCain seemed most perturbed about the absence of the  
73-year-old Samaranch, who snubbed his invitation to testify, 
citing schedule conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't mean to be discourteous, but I think the committee  
would have benefited from Mr. Samaranch's appearance,'' McCain 
said. ``He would have the information. Ms. DeFrantz and Mr. Easton 
did not, nor would I expect them to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The senator noted that, when his committee holds hearings on  
telecommunications legislation, ``we have CEOs come and testify.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others, however, wanted to make Samaranch's absence permanent.  
Democrats Ernest Hollings of South Carolina and Richard Bryan of 
Nevada said the IOC president should resign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe this problem starts at the very top,'' Bryan said.  
Any reforms the IOC enacts, he said, ``would lack credibility 
unless he (Samaranch) takes the honorable action to step down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hollings said he saw no reason for the former Spanish diplomat  
to stay in power. 
</P>
<P>
	``What are you all waiting on?'' he asked Mitchell, who has  
repeatedly said that changes in the IOC's structure are more 
important than change in leadership. ``We have to clean up 
Lausanne. Why not get rid of Samaranch? Let's apply some 
pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several senators said the IOC was dragging its feet on reforms.  
While he has created a 24-member task force to restructure the IOC, 
Samaranch has announced six members so far, they noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollings likened the situation to the fight against drugs  
imported from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to hear about Mexico making progress on drugs,''  
he said. ``And look at us, we're all doped up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC, which has escaped the worst of the blame for the  
scandal, was commended for quick action on several changes Mitchell 
recommended. 
</P>
<P>
	But committee president Bill Hybl was upbraided by McCain for  
failing to turn over a secret USOC report on Salt Lake that the 
Commerce Committee requested 30 days ago. Hybl said there were 
possible legal problems but promised to forward the report quickly.

<HEADLINE> Quayle Declares for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTINGTON, Ind. (AP) -- Former Vice President Dan Quayle,  
calling the 1990s ``the dishonest decade of Bill Clinton and Al 
Gore,'' launched his presidential campaign today by pledging to 
restore integrity and responsibility to the White House in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``Prosperity without values is no prosperity at all,'' Quayle  
told a cheering crowd of more than 5,000 at his former high school. 
Fireworks, rock music and bellows of ``Q2K!'' made his the most 
festive presidential announcement speech so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first bid for elective office since President Clinton  
toppled the Bush-Quayle ticket six years ago, the former Indiana 
senator sought to both attack Gore -- the potential Democratic 
nominee who succeeded Quayle as vice president -- and acquit himself 
for casting a white-hot spotlight on the family-values debate in 
the 1992 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle was criticized by Democrats and mocked by late-night  
comics for questioning the morality of a TV sitcom character in May 
1992. ``Murphy Brown is gone,'' Quayle now says, ``and I'm still 
here fighting for the American family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Working only from notes, Quayle varied frequently from a  
prepared text given to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	He derided Gore for being the president's chief defender during  
the impeachment saga, accusing the pair of showing ``contempt for 
the values parents try to teach their children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We are coming to the end of the dishonest decade of Bill  
Clinton and Al Gore, and America needs a fresh start,'' Quayle 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle promoted his proposed 30 percent across-the-board tax  
cut, billing it as a boon to middle-income families. 
</P>
<P>
	And he portrayed himself as the best qualified potential  
commander-in-chief, recalling his participation in White House war 
councils and his service on foreign policy committees in the House 
and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't learn foreign policy from briefing books or crash  
courses,'' Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
	He accused Clinton and Gore of compromising U.S. sovereignty,  
starving the armed forces' budgets and using the military ``as a 
laboratory for their social experiments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the sting of Quayle's remarks went beyond the  
administration. Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the early favorite for 
the GOP nomination, is getting scores of private briefings to bone 
up on foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
	And aides would not say whether Quayle was targeting Bush or  
Gore when he declared: ``A presidential nomination is not something 
that is inherited. It must be earned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their silence suggested that the line was written with both in  
mind; Gore is Clinton's choice to win in 2000, and Bush is the son 
of the former president. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle, 52, is a longshot for the nomination despite his  
popularity among grassroots activists. 
</P>
<P>
	He joins a crowded field of social conservative candidates  
wrestling over the same votes. His campaign team has come together 
slowly. And he raised about $2 million in the first quarter of 1999 
-- $1 million less than projected. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle's largest obstacle is what one supporter calls the  
``potato factor'' -- a reference to the day he misspelled the word 
in a classroom full of school children. That and other gaffes 
turned the vice president into a punchline for countless jokes, 
cementing for many Americans the perception that Quayle was 
ill-suited for the job. 
</P>
<P>
	His supporters argue that Quayle will easily exceed those low  
expectations to sneak up on Bush, who they say can't live up to his 
early billing. If the former vice president can emerge from Iowa 
and New Hampshire as the choice of social conservatives, his 
miscues would fade from memory in the showdown against Bush, 
supporters say. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Americans will begin to see a rejuvenated Dan Quayle  
with great campaign skills,'' said Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind. 
``George Bush has done a good job of building interest, but now he 
has the tough job of rising to those expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle has lost key supporters to Bush, including former aides  
David Beckwith and Al Hubbard. Hubbard, how helping Bush recruit 
policy experts, subscribes to a widespread belief that Quayle would 
be in better position today if he had run for Indiana governor in 
1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would have been a great governor and could have shown  
people that he can be a great chief executive officer,'' Hubbard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hubbard is not the only Indiana Republican with doubts about  
Quayle. 
</P>
<P>
	State GOP chairman Mike McDaniel has yet to endorse a GOP  
presidential candidate, which is not a good sign for favorite son 
Quayle, a 1965 graduate of Huntington High School who now lives in 
Phoenix. Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith is a top Bush 
adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	``People in our party are hungry to win this presidential  
election, and I think some of them, even though they probably agree 
with 98 percent of everything Dan Quayle says, wonder if he can win 
or not because of the image that he portrays,'' McDaniel said. 
</P>
<P>
	In their recent retreat, some Republican state chairmen used the  
term ``Quayle-ized'' to describe the fate facing Gore if jokes 
persist about his political miscues. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle believes he has found a way to deal with the perception  
problem: Portray the ridicule as a trial by fire, an example of how 
he could withstand the pressures of the presidency.

	``I don't know the term (the GOP chairmen) used,'' Quayle told  
The Associated Press before today's address. ``But my advice to 
Gore is to lighten up and enjoy it. If he shows this is really 
getting to him, if he can't handle this, he won't even come close 
to handling the presidency.''

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Cooperates With EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG said it is cooperating with a  
European Union investigation into sales practices of Mercedes-Benz 
dealers in several European countries but denied breaking the 
trading bloc's antitrust rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The alleged infringements took place between 1985 and 1996, well  
before last year's takeover of Chrysler Corp. by Daimler-Benz AG. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares in the German-American automaker dropped 1.9 percent in  
trading in Frankfurt after late Tuesday's disclosure that EU 
Competition Commissioner Karel van Miert had opened legal 
proceedings against DaimlerChrysler. 
</P>
<P>
	Company spokesman Detlef May in Stuttgart confirmed that an  
investigation had been under way ``for a long while'' and said the 
company expected to be cleared. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have supported the investigation, giving all the  
information required when it was requested,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU charges DaimlerChrysler broke antitrust rules by  
preventing its exclusive dealer networks in Germany, Belgium, the 
Netherlands and Spain from selling Mercedes-Benz cars to 
nonresidents of those countries. 
</P>
<P>
	In raids on Daimler-Benz offices in December 1996, investigators  
gathered circulars sent by the carmaker to its dealers, which 
instructed them not to sell to foreigners, commission spokesman 
Stefan Rating said in Brussels, Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	Raids in Spain also found evidence of commission charges being  
imposed on dealers that sold to foreigners. Similarly, in Belgium, 
dealers were discouraged from selling to foreigners by a 3 percent 
service fee imposed on top of the cost of the vehicle to be sold 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	``Attempts were made to keep cross-border sales as small as  
possible,'' Rating said. 
</P>
<P>
	Car companies in Europe regularly price the same cars  
differently in different countries to conform to local conditions, 
prompting bargain-hunters to cross borders to buy their cars. That 
practice is legal under EU rules but frowned upon by the automakers 
because it ends up costing them money. 
</P>
<P>
	In January 1998, the EU fined Volkswagen $110 million for  
allegedly preventing German and Austrian customers from buying and 
reimporting VW cars from Italy. VW has appealed the fine. 
</P>
<P>
	May said Daimler never tried to hinder cross-border sales.  
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler is also accused of fixing the price of its cars  
for sale to business fleets, the commission's Rating said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said a decision in the case was expected in four to six  
months. 
</P>
<P>
	If found guilty, DaimlerChrysler could face fines of up to 10  
percent of its worldwide revenues in the year preceding the 
decision. The company posted sales of $155 billion in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rating stressed the size of the fine is determined by how  
long the offense went on, its severity and the degree to which the 
company cooperated with the commission's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	VW's fine amounted to 0.4 percent of its annual sales.

<HEADLINE> Duke's Brand Steps Out on Coach K </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	At long last, Duke's Mike Krzyzewski has joined the list of  
coaches whose stars leave early to join the NBA. It's a sign of the 
times that instead of asking whether the move is good for the kid 
any more, most people will ask how Coach K kept the talent drain 
plugged for so long. 
</P>
<P>
	Sophomore Elton Brand, the consensus college basketball player  
of the year, announced Wednesday he will forgo his last two years 
of eligibility to try his luck in the pros. 
</P>
<P>
	Krzyzewski, who is recovering from hip surgery, was gracious in  
thanking Brand and sincere in wishing him well. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the NBA's new rookie salary scale, the last pick in the  
first round makes almost $2 million in his first three years and up 
to $1 million a year in his fourth. Considering the dollars 
involved, the move is almost always too tempting to pass up. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Lon Babby's client list argues just the opposite. It  
includes former Duke stars Grant Hill, Christian Laettner and 
Cherokee Parks, as well as Tim Duncan, who played four years at 
Wake Forest. But the only thing Babby says he's learned is that 
there is no right answer for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``For Tim and Grant, it was right to stay in school. Some kids  
benefit greatly, not just in terms of their game, but what they 
need to learn about life,'' Babby said. ``The other side is that 
there are lots of kids who don't want to stay or can't afford to. 
As long as the decision is based on good information and support 
from coaches and parents, you respect it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During Krzyzewski's tenure, Duke's principal rival, North  
Carolina, has practically become a finishing school for NBA-bound 
underclassmen. The Tar Heels lost a jug-eared, senior-to-be named 
Michael Jordan not long after Coach K first set foot in Durham, 
N.C., and they lost Antawn Jamison and rookie-of-the-year candidate 
Vince Carter to the pros only last season. And they've still had 
enough talent on hand to make Krzyzewski's life miserable year-in 
and year-out. 
</P>
<P>
	Brand will be hard to replace -- he averaged 18 points and 10  
rebounds, and at 6-foot-8 and 270 pounds, he occupied opposing 
defenses like few players in the college game can. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite the possibility that William Avery and freshman  
Corey Maggette are considering following Brand's career path, they 
will almost certainly return along with Shane Battier and Chris 
Carrawell. And Krzyzewski has signed letters of intent from four 
McDonald's All-America high school stars. 
</P>
<P>
	The uninterrupted flow of high school talent is why the top  
college coaches no longer get worked up when a teen-ager tells them 
he'll be opting for a seven-figure paycheck next fall rather than 
fifth-semester math. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also why those same coaches like to turn the question,  
``How will college basketball survive without these kids?'' on its 
head. What they ask instead is ``How will the NBA survive with 
them?'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year's draft, thankfully, will be thin on knuckleheads.  
Unfortunately, though, it will be even thinner on talent. Besides 
Brand, the only underclassmen whose announcements have merited any 
attention are Maryland's Steve Francis, St. John's Ron Artest and 
Missouri's Albert White. They could be joined by Connecticut's 
Richard Hamilton, Michigan State's Mateen Cleaves, UCLA's Baron 
Davis, Rhode Island's Lamar Odom and Auburn's Chris Porter in any 
combination. Then again, none of them may elect to come out. 
</P>
<P>
	That leaves seniors Wally Szczerbiak of Miami of Ohio, Duke's  
Trajan Langdon, Arizona's Jason Terry and a host of no-names and 
foreign names that even dedicated draftniks will be struggling to 
identify by the time the second round rolls around. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem the last couple of years,'' chief NBA scout Marty  
Blake said, ``is that every kid who has one good game hears from 
somebody that he ought to come out. Usually, the exact opposite is 
true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Had everybody who could have stayed in school for all or even  
part of their four years, these are some of the names that would 
have been in this year's draft as well: Kevin Garnett and Kobe 
Bryant (both went to the NBA from high school), Allen Iverson 
(Georgetown), Stephon Marbury (Georgia Tech), Jamison and Carter 
(North Carolina), Robert Traylor (Michigan), Jason Williams 
(Florida), Paul Pierce (Kansas), Larry Hughes (St. Louis) and Mike 
Bibby (Arizona). 
</P>
<P>
	Think Brand would have left Duke and taken his chances with that  
crowd? 
</P>
<P>
	Think again.  
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Clemens Seeks Share of AL Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There's been nothing lucky about Roger Clemens'  
16-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rocket, who has gone nearly 11 months without a loss, tries  
to tie the American League record held by Johnny Allen and Dave 
McNally on Thursday night against Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing to talk about,'' Clemens said. ``It is what it  
is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What it is is an amazing run by one of baseball's best pitchers.  
After beginning last season 5-6 for Toronto, Clemens hasn't lost 
since last May 29, a span of 24 starts. At the age of 36, he 
continues to overpower hitters, posting a 2.26 ERA during the 
streak and winning his fifth Cy Young award after last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't remember a power pitcher other than Nolan Ryan who  
could throw so hard for so long,'' said Orioles bullpen coach Elrod 
Hendricks, who caught McNally during his streak in 1968-69. ``Even 
Seaver had to learn how to conserve energy as he got older. Clemens 
doesn't give a damn about that. He still rears back, throws hard 
and has high pitch counts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Clemens' success is triggered on his hard fastball,  
McNally was more of a junkball lefty. McNally not only wasn't the 
dominant pitcher in the league, he wasn't even the ace of his own 
staff, which included Jim Palmer and Mike Cuellar. 
</P>
<P>
	McNally's streak, which ended on Rich Reese's grand slam for  
Minnesota, was in jeopardy many times before the Orioles bailed him 
out with late rallies. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why we called him McLucky,'' Hendricks said. ``Every  
time he would leave a game losing, we seemed to either tie it or 
take the lead. But most of the time he pitched great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens has pitched great nearly all the time. His streak  
includes three shutouts, an 18-strikeout game and three wins 
against Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes it more impressive is that many people felt Clemens'  
career was on the downside after he went 40-39 in his last four 
seasons in Boston. But after arriving in Toronto in 1997, Clemens 
regained the dominant form from early in his career and has won 
consecutive Cy Youngs. 
</P>
<P>
	``His velocity is back up a little,'' Baltimore's B.J. Surhoff  
said. ``He is able to locate his pitches, which is something most 
power pitchers don't do. He has refined his splitter to give him a 
second out pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's on a different plane than his fastball and slider. You  
have to lay off it to have any chance against him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens' opponent on Thursday has experience stopping long  
winning streaks. Mike Mussina was on the mound May 8, 1997, when 
Baltimore beat Seattle 13-3 to stop Randy Johnson's 16-game winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I'm pitching against the Yankees, in Yankee Stadium,  
against Roger Clemens going for the AL record, but I still have to 
pitch my game,'' Mussina said. ``If I get too juiced up, I won't be 
able to do what I have to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clemens and Mussina -- the active leaders in winning percentage  
(minimum 75 wins) -- have been two of the most consistent starters 
in the AL this decade. They have met five times since Mussina came 
up in 1991, with only one pitchers duel, which Mussina won 3-2 in 
1994. Overall, Clemens is 2-1 with two no decisions against 
Mussina. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not pitching against him,'' Clemens said. ``Our hitters  
will work on him and I will work on getting their hitters out.''

<HEADLINE>  UN: Some Kosovo Refugees Forgotten </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Relief organizations and governments have  
forgotten the plight of thousands of Kosovo refugees living in 
dreadful conditions on the Albanian border, a U.N. envoy asserted 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where are they? They should be in Kukes,'' said Olara Otunnu,  
the U.N. special envoy on children, on his return from a four-day 
mission to Albania and Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 300,000 people who have fled Kosovo for Albania in  
recent weeks passed through the border town of Kukes, and many are 
still there. 
</P>
<P>
	Otunnu said conditions among the 40,000 people -- two-thirds of  
them children -- still in the open at Kukes were ``simply 
appalling,'' and substantially worse than those in neighboring 
Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing had prepared me for what I witnessed in Kukes,'' he  
said. ``They are on their own in the fields, often on the back of 
tractors and trucks. They have no tents, no system of feeding of 
the people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Otunnu praised the work of the U.N. refugee and children's  
agencies, and of an Italian army-run refugee camp at Kukes, but 
said much more was needed. He called on other countries to follow 
the Italians' lead. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees said Wednesday that the  
health and sanitation situation in Kukes was receiving particular 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``The health situation is under control and medical teams are  
concentrating on providing first aid in the numerous centers in the 
area,'' the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Otunnu also called for more help for children affected by the  
Kosovo conflict, including schooling and counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are the most traumatized by the violence and the  
expulsion they witness, the most vulnerable to disease and 
malnutrition and they are particularly affected by family 
separation,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Spores Hurt U.S., Canada Tobacco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, Ga. (AP) -- Cuban imports are ruining the business of  
some Southern tobacco farmers, but don't blame Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	The wind, not Cuba's leader, is responsible for these imports:  
killer spores that are damaging the tobacco crop in southern 
Georgia and northern Florida this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The spores also are plaguing tobacco plants as far north as  
Canada and as far west as Kentucky, as well as tobacco farmers in 
Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	The tiny invaders known as sporangiospores cause a disease  
called blue mold, and they have cost Kentucky burley tobacco 
growers an estimated $300 million since 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue mold losses this year have forced some Georgia growers to  
replant their fields, said Rick Moss, a Colquitt County farmer. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are billions and billions of spores that blow in here  
from the Caribbean,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Infected plants often die, or fail to produce normal yields. But  
with effective fungicides and proper weather conditions, they can 
recover. 
</P>
<P>
	Released by tobacco plants, the spores can spread quickly  
through greenhouses and plant beds during their 72-hour lifespan. 
Initially, they attacked only the tender tobacco plants grown in 
covered plant beds or greenhouses during the winter and moved to 
the fields in the spring. Blue mold could not survive hot, summer 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
	That changed about 1979, with the arrival of a heat-tolerant  
strain that caused a $250-million loss in the United States and a 
$100-million loss in Canada. The disease changed again in the early 
1990s, becoming resistant to the pesticide Ridomil, which had been 
the most effective defense against it. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Georgia Commissioner of Agriculture Tommy Irvin  
approved the use of fungicide Acrobat MZ on a temporary basis. 
Acrobat -- which protects healthy plants, but does not cure diseased 
plants -- costs between $20 and $30 per acre and has to be applied 
every five to seven days. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be an economic disaster if we have to spray ... every  
five days from now until August,'' Moss said. ``Even if we control 
it, it could dramatically drive up our cost of production. We're 
hoping we can make one or two applications and have a normal 
crop.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blown in from Latin America and the Caribbean, where tobacco is  
a winter crop, the spores invade Florida, Georgia and Texas first 
and then spread farther north. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is more serious than usual this year because blue  
mold was discovered in March, a month early, said Charles E. Main, 
leader of the school's North American Blue Mold Forecast Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``When that happens it gives the disease more time to go farther  
and cause more damage,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The center provides three forecasts a week from March through  
September to give growers an early warning. If growers spray 
fungicides before the spores arrive, they can minimize losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the latest forecasts show the spores traveling from  
western Cuba to the Florida Panhandle, from Statenville and 
Moultrie, Ga., into South Carolina and from Mexico into Texas, 
Oklahoma and Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	If Georgia and Florida growers don't attack blue mold  
aggressively, it intensifies problems farther north, possibly 
moving the disease through Pennsylvania, Missouri, Wisconsin, Ohio, 
Connecticut, Massachusetts and, ultimately, Canada.

<HEADLINE> Golfer Irwin Hopes To Shake Slump  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. (AP) -- Hale Irwin believes his golf  
game may finally be coming around -- and just in time, too. 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin, the three-time defending champion in the 60th annual PGA  
Seniors' Championship, hopes to shake a slump when the tournament 
opens Thursday at the PGA National Golf Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin is 24th on the senior money list with $129,690 in five  
starts after finishing on top in 1997 and 1998. He has consistently 
ranked among the putting leaders but is not even in the top 10 this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing wrong physically, just a few mental  
problems,'' Irwin said. ``I've got to get out of the mechanical 
mode, going from A to B to C to D, and back into the `let it 
happen' mode. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it's coming around. I've been here since Sunday, and  
hopefully after four days of work I'll be ready to start playing 
good golf again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin won the past three years with scores of 280, 274 and 275  
on the par-72 Champion course. That's 8-, 14- and 13-under-par. His 
margins of victory were 2, 12 and 7 shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Irwin became the first player to win the championship  
three consecutive years, and he equaled Eddie Williams' record of 
three consecutive titles in 1942, 1945 and 1946. Williams' run was 
interrupted by World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	This week Irwin could match the record of four consecutive  
titles in a major championship, set by Walter Hagen when he won the 
PGA Championship in 1924-27. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think about that unless someone brings it up,'' Irwin  
said. ``I would never want to compare myself with Walter Hagen, but 
I am delighted to have the opportunity to be a footnote in 
history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The field of 144 pros 50 and older will compete for $1.75  
million and a first prize of $315,000. Among those entered are 55 
PGA of America club professionals, former major champions, past 
U.S. Ryder Cup team players and top performers on the senior tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Past champions in the field include Raymond Floyd (1995), Lee  
Trevino (1992 and 1994), Gary Player (1986, 1988 and 1990) and 
Arnold Palmer (1980 and 1984). The most significant absentee will 
be 1991 champion Jack Nicklaus, still recovering from hip 
replacement surgery in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the favorites is Bruce Fleisher, who won the first two  
senior tour events of the season, at Key Biscayne and Sarasota. He 
lives at nearby BallenIsles Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	The course will play a little longer this year at 6,754 yards.  
Because of a warm winter, there is more grass on the greens, which 
will make putts a bit slower. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be a little more difficult,'' Irwin said. ``It won't  
be the same PGA Seniors we have played the last three years. I just 
hope my game will be ready for the challenge.''

<HEADLINE> Wedding Websites Step Up Marketing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- More and more couples planning a marriage are  
becoming wedded to the Web. 
</P>
<P>
	Couples can do much of their research and planning -- from  
picking invitations to booking their honeymoons -- right from their 
own homes. 
</P>
<P>
	That means no more schlepping to the department store to  
register for gifts or sending out mass mailings to inform guests of 
time or location changes. 
</P>
<P>
	But competition in the Internet wedding world is heating up. As  
the space gets more crowded, many bridal sites are intensifying 
their marketing and merchandising strategies to woo shoppers their 
way. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest move comes from theknot.com, one of first online  
wedding sites. Later today the company is expected to announce that 
it will get an important boost with a $15 million investment from 
the TV retailer QVC. That will give theknot.com thousands of new 
products and a powerful new way to promote them. 
</P>
<P>
	``There isn't going to be a single wedding site that will  
attract all couples,'' said Kate Delhagen, an analyst with 
Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. ``But they are working hard 
now to get a reputation and become an early leader, just like 
Amazon.com did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's still plenty of room to grow.  
</P>
<P>
	While thousands of couples have turned to these sites, the  
online market is still only a mere fraction of the $35 billion 
spent on weddings each year in the United States. Theknot.com, for 
instance, only expects sales of $4.5 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts anticipate sales to jump sharply in the next few  
years, with much of the gain fueled by an increase in guests buying 
wedding gifts online. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Cassar, an analyst with the Internet research firm Jupiter  
Communications, called the wedding site idea ``an incredible 
niche'' that ``has the potential to be the fastest growing space 
online. But they need to increase the amount of commerce that is 
generated on their sites.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While many hope for a rise in gift buying in the future, right  
now the race is on to lure the bride and groom. 
</P>
<P>
	Theknot.com sees its huge gift registry as an enticing factor.  
Under the deal with QVC, theknot.com gets access to more than 
100,000 new products -- up from the 2,500 now on their site. 
Theknot.com will also promote itself on QVC, the No. 1 television 
retailer, and its Internet arm, iqvc. 
</P>
<P>
	``The challenge in the registry business that you have a  
two-step selling process: One to sell bride and groom and then to 
sell through to the guest,'' David Liu, chief executive of the New 
York-based theknot.com. ``We think this relationship will give us a 
great venue and opportunity to market and reach all of those 
consumers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other wedding sites are taking different approaches. The  
weddingchannel.com is aligned with Conde Nast, the publisher of 
Bride's magazine, while weddingnetwork.com is the official site for 
Modern Bride magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Della &AMP; James, a new wedding site, is expected to link up with a  
number of large retailers when it is launched later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	All the exclusively online sites face a growing challenge from  
traditional retailers, like Macy's and Bloomingdale's, which have 
just begun to enter the Internet market. These merchants benefit 
from having both stores and online capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is definitely room for different approaches and  
different personalities in this online space,'' said Delhagen. 
``But the department stores are coming, and while they are late to 
this party, they are powerful.''

<HEADLINE> Senior Tour Caddy Killed by Car  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. (AP) -- The caddy for Senior PGA Tour  
golfer Dale Douglass was killed Tuesday night after being struck by 
a car while crossing U.S. Highway 1 in Juno Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul ``Cowboy'' Dayhoff, 55, of Dallas, had caddied for Douglass  
the last 12 years and was in the area to work the PGA Seniors' 
Championship, which starts Thursday at PGA National. Douglass 
withdrew from the tournament Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been together since the summer of '87,'' Douglass said.  
``Cowboy's always been very popular with everybody. 
</P>
<P>
	``The galleries looked for him. He liked to interact with  
spectators and he'd always go around in a cowboy hat. He looked his 
part. I'm going to miss him dearly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dayhoff was returning to his hotel after eating dinner with Lee  
Trevino's caddy, Ralph Hackett. He was struck by a car driven by 
John McCarthy as he tried to cross U.S. 1. No charges were filed 
against McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
	Dayhoff is survived by his wife, Karen.

<HEADLINE> Forklift Philanthropist Keeps Going </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Matel ``Mat'' Dawson drives an old car and lives  
in a one-bedroom apartment. At 78, he still works for Ford Motor 
Co. -- just like he has for the past 59 years. 
</P>
<P>
	He drives a forklift, soaks up as much overtime as possible and  
pulls down around $100,000 a year. Just so he can give most of it 
away. 
</P>
<P>
	With a $200,000 donation to Wayne State University on Tuesday,  
Dawson has now donated more than $1 million to schools and 
charities since 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get joy, happiness out of this,'' he said at a news  
conference, nattily dressed in a pinstriped suit with a pink 
boutonniere. ``I can go home and sleep good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dawson got as far as the seventh grade in Shreveport, La.,  
before coming to Detroit in 1940. He didn't become a philanthropist 
by winning a lawsuit, hitting the lottery or collecting an 
inheritance. 
</P>
<P>
	All he's done, he said, is work, work overtime, save and invest.  
</P>
<P>
	``No matter how much you make or how little you make, you've got  
to save a little of that,'' he said. ``I was raised like that, to 
help others. I have more than enough myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Dawson, who is divorced and has one daughter, ``more than  
enough'' doesn't include vacations -- he said making money is more 
enjoyable. He drives a 1985 Ford Escort and his apartment is in 
down-on-its-heels Highland Park, where Henry Ford built his Model T 
factory. 
</P>
<P>
	``A big house, a big car, that doesn't excite me,'' Dawson said.  
</P>
<P>
	Dawson earns about $100,000 a year through his base salary of  
$23.47 an hour, plus overtime from working 12-hour days. He runs a 
forklift and is classified as a ``rigger'' -- a skilled tradesman 
available for a variety of jobs at the Rouge assembly complex in 
Dearborn. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1994, years after he could have retired, Dawson began giving  
his money away. The first recipient was the United Negro College 
Fund, which got $50,000 then and has received $180,000 more since 
then. 
</P>
<P>
	He has given $200,000 to Louisiana State University at  
Shreveport; $112,000 to churches in Detroit and Louisiana; $20,000 
to the NAACP; and $10,000 to community colleges. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest beneficiary by far has been Wayne State, which with  
Tuesday's gift has received $431,500. The latest gift, like a 
$200,000 Dawson donation in 1996, will go toward scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
	Dawson ``stands as an example to all others who thought they  
didn't have enough to give,'' Wayne State President Irvin Reid 
said. Turning to Dawson, Reid said, ``Your money is very important 
to us, but your example is even more important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dawson said he will remain at Ford and continue his blue-collar  
philanthropy as long as he stays healthy. Next year he plans to set 
up a $100,000 scholarship fund in Shreveport in honor of his 
grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't say I want to give it all away,'' Dawson said. ``But  
I'll give the bulk of it away.''

<HEADLINE> Minn. Faculty Accused in Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- The former head of Minnesota's academic  
counseling unit says some faculty members pressured by the 
basketball program were willing to help keep players eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	In documents provided to the Saint Paul Pioneer Press, Elayne  
Donahue said faculty members gave players final grades before their 
course work was completed and that grades sometimes were changed 
years after players enrolled in courses. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the new accusations:  
</P>
<P>
	--Academic counselor Alonzo Newby engineered last-minute switches  
in the grading method for two of Antoine Broxsie's fall 1997 
courses, ensuring Broxsie would remain academically eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	--Academic counselors reported concerns that one professor was  
told to give player Kevin Clark a ``B-'' in a course so he could 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	--Coach Clem Haskins visited instructors on behalf of at least  
two players and gave one teacher free tickets to a basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
	--An administrator expressed concern that he was being pressured  
to accept an athlete who did not meet requirements into the 
self-designed study program. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark said Tuesday night he doesn't remember taking the class  
and can't comment because ``the school won't let us.'' Athletic 
director Mark Dienhart said Tuesday night that Schoemann 
``investigated the allegation and was unable to find substantiation 
to justify the claim.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two law firms hired by the university continue to investigate  
charges of academic fraud after allegations by former university 
employee Jan Gangelhoff. She said she did more than 400 pieces of 
course work for 20 players from 1993 to 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents include four memos describing last-minute changes  
that gave Broxsie nonletter grades in algebra and climatology 
courses in the fall of 1997, guaranteeing he would remain eligible. 
</P>
<P>
	Newby allegedly contacted Broxsie's academic adviser, Mary Ellen  
Shaw, seeking a petition to change from letter grades, according to 
an account written by Jennifer Franko, executive secretary in the 
General College Academic Support Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Shaw nor Franko returned repeated telephone calls. Newby  
declined to comment through his attorney. Broxsie's attorney, Phil 
Resnick, said he could not comment until he has reviewed the memos.

<HEADLINE> Military Expert Advice on Hill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen got a hearty,  
knowing laugh at a NATO dinner last week in Brussels, Belgium, when 
he noted that one of his guests, Sen. John McCain, had made a great 
sacrifice to come to Europe for briefings on the bombing campaign 
against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first day in a long time the Arizona Republican  
hadn't been able to get on network television, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, a GOP presidential hopeful, is a former Navy pilot who  
spent 5 1/2 years in a North Vietnamese prison camp. He's been before 
the public constantly since the Kosovo crisis began, critiquing the 
operation and insisting that ground forces should be considered. 
</P>
<P>
	But then, the 106th Congress is hardly short on military  
expertise. 
</P>
<P>
	More than usual, ``a lot of the current members are close to  
military people in the Pentagon and elsewhere,'' said former Rep. 
Lee Hamiliton, an Indiana Democrat who was chairman of the House 
International Relations Committee before Republicans gained control 
in 1994. He's now director of the Woodrow Wilson International 
Center for Scholars. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Armed Services  
Committee, was Navy secretary in the Nixon administration. He 
spends hours each day getting private updates from generals and is 
often seen at the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	His predecessor, Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., is a retired  
general in the Army reserve who took part in the D-Day invasion of 
Normandy as part of the Army's 82nd Airborne Division. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ike Skelton of Missouri, senior Democrat on the House Armed  
Services Committee, has flown in the cockpit of the B-2 stealth 
bomber. His district includes Whiteman Air Force Base, home of the 
B-2 fleet. He frequently talks to pilots and crew members. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposed to sending U.S. troops to Bosnia, Skelton has forcefully  
urged Clinton to consider using ground forces in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Murtha of Pennsylvania, ranking Democrat on the  
Appropriations national security subcommittee, won a Bronze Star 
and two Purple Hearts as a Marine in Vietnam and has long-standing 
and close ties to the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., a member of the Foreign Relations  
Committee, is a war hero who lost part of his leg in Vietnam. Sen. 
Max Cleland, D-Ga., an Armed Services Committee member, lost both 
legs in Vietnam as a young Army captain and headed the Veterans 
Administration in the Carter administration. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Randy Cunningham, R-Calif., a member of the House Armed  
Services Committee, was a ``top gun'' flight instructor during a 
20-year Navy career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe that we in Congress ought to be crafting  
specific military solutions,'' said Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn. 
He said it's hard enough for NATO's commander, Army Gen. Wesley 
Clark, to deal with 19 NATO nations -- let along having to worry 
about legislative generals. 
</P>
<P>
	And how did Dodd spend his spring break? He visited NATO in  
Brussels and a refugee camp in Macedonia -- and held a news 
conference on his return to outline his view of next steps. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C., chairman of the House Armed Services  
Committee, led his own delegation to the Balkans and has criticized 
the bombing campaign. ``From the very beginning, I have been 
against this type of operation,'' Spence said Tuesday. Still, he 
added, ``We are there now for better or worse -- and we have to 
support our military people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are too many armchair quarterbacks who call the game  
before the coin is tossed,'' suggested Sen. Joseph Biden of 
Delaware, senior Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Biden himself is the sponsor of a resolution to authorize the  
president to use ``all necessary force,'' including ground troops, 
and considers himself a student of the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	Biden recalls sitting down in 1993 with Yugoslav President  
Slobodan Milosevic, looking him in the eye and telling him: ``I 
think you are a war criminal.'' He said the Serbian strongman 
looked back strangely and said something like, ``have a good senior 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., a Foreign Relations Committee member  
wounded twice in Vietnam as an Army infantryman, also was among 
those pressing for ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
	But after a White House meeting Tuesday, Hagel said he was  
content for now to allow military leaders to call the shots. 
</P>
<P>
	``The military needs some time to conduct this war,'' Hagel  
said. ``I don't want this thing run by a bunch of politicians.''

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Dole Touts Her Credentials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- For the 4,000 midshipmen of the U.S. Naval  
Academy, Elizabeth Dole ticked off her travels through Bosnia and 
Beijing and endorsed ground troops in Kosovo -- all part of her case 
for succeeding President Clinton as their commander in chief. 
</P>
<P>
	``Credibility counts. And if you have any question about that,  
look at the U.N. weapons-inspections mess in Iraq, or today's 
tragedy in Kosovo,'' Mrs. Dole told the rapt assembly of men and 
women in their summer whites. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole called on Clinton to ``use all the power necessary''  
to defeat Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's campaign against 
Kosovo. She announced she was leaving Thursday for the Kosovar 
refugee camps in Macedonia and Albania to ``let the refugees know 
that we care and hear their plea.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole's speech, which her press release dubbed ``Hawkish  
World View,'' aimed to underscore her GOP presidential credentials 
and create enough of a national stir to attract contributors. 
</P>
<P>
	Without naming him, Mrs. Dole primarily took aim at Clinton:  
``We've been let down by the people we should look up to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The midshipmen in Alumni Hall responded with snickers.  
</P>
<P>
	On Yugoslavia, she said: ``If the NATO commanders and the Joint  
Chiefs of Staff say that ground troops are required to accomplish 
our goals, then my answer is 'yes.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the Joint Chiefs of Staff nor NATO commanders have made  
that assessment. 
</P>
<P>
	In a question-and-answer session, one midshipman asked  
pointedly, ``Are you willing to send your own sons and daughters to 
bleed in Kosovo, ma'am?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole, who has no children, said yes then stammered to  
repeat her line about approving troops if recommended by NATO and 
military brass. 
</P>
<P>
	For all the jabs at Clinton, the unnamed target between the  
lines of Mrs. Dole's speech was Texas Gov. George W. Bush, 
considered her strongest competition for the 2000 GOP nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush has been criticized for what the Wall Street Journal's  
editorial page called a ``vague and tepid ... almost Clintonian'' 
statement on Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	One senior Dole adviser said she wanted to emphasize her  
experience on foreign policy at the expense to Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	But when one questioner pressed Mrs. Dole on her vague call for  
the defense of Taiwan against China, she said she needed time to 
study. ``I am not yet an announced candidate, much less the elected 
nominee of the party,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sounding like the Cold War-era Ronald Reagan whose name she  
invoked, Mrs. Dole spoke expansively about the immediate need to 
deploy a missile-defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	And if it was built at the expense of education funds?  
</P>
<P>
	``If indeed our country is vulnerable to rogue nations  
developing nuclear weapons that can strike the Untied States, then 
there's not going to be much opportunity for education,'' she said. 
``We have to protect ourselves -- that's first.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She walked the midshipmen through her resume of travels as  
Reagan's transportation secretary, President Bush's labor secretary 
and as head of the American Red Cross: 
</P>
<P>
	``I went to the Croatian-Bosnian border. ... ''  
</P>
<P>
	``I found myself in Poland ... meeting with Solidarity labor  
leaders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I represented the United States in tough aviation and maritime  
negotiations in Beijing. ...'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Annapolis, a commuter's drive outside the Beltway, Mrs. Dole  
sought attention from Washington's national press corps on the hot 
issue of Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the foreign policy debate, there's a huge void out there --  
a void being filled right now only by John McCain and Pat 
Buchanan,'' said Consultant Scott Reed, who managed Bob Dole's 1996 
presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to talk about issues to generate political excitement  
so people will give you money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Dole's supporters privately are grousing that she's been  
unable to build on momentum from her January debut and subsequent 
outings in New Hampshire and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	Her speech Wednesday came in advance of a planned fund-raiser  
here later this month, the first in a series. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the  
campaign reviewed Republican fund-raising prospects after Mrs. Dole 
banked a disappointing fraction of the $6 million that Bush raked 
in during the first three months of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	The conclusion: Bush has already locked up many of the  
fund-raising sources in the establishment GOP, forcing Mrs. Dole to 
seek alternative streams, such as women's networks, this adviser 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Key Republicans in Iowa and New Hampshire also fault the Dole  
campaign's organization for sometimes-ineffective efforts to follow 
up promises of support. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign was overtaken by the ``big wave'' of enthusiasm in  
January, and ``it's been difficult for them to get ahead of the 
curve,'' said Steve Duprey, chairman of the Republican State 
Committee in New Hampshire.

<HEADLINE> Morals Clause for Olympic Sponsors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The IOC plans to introduce a ``morals clause'' in  
future Olympic sponsorship contracts which would allow sponsors to 
walk out in the event of ethics scandals. 
</P>
<P>
	The change stems from the Salt Lake City vote-buying scandal,  
according to IOC marketing director Michael Payne. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at the UK National Sponsorship Conference, Payne said  
the IOC would ``look to introduce some form of morals clause that 
will in future give our partners an `out' if there is an ethical 
lapse and we don't move to fix it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC has come under pressure from its top corporate sponsors  
in the wake of the scandal over more than $1 million in improper 
inducements accepted by IOC members during Salt Lake's winning bid 
for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The sponsors, who pay up to $50 million for exclusive Olympic  
advertising rights, have expressed concern that the scandal would 
tarnish their investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne said the scandal had ``threatened the very existence of  
the IOC.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If the IOC did not act decisively and quickly, then the  
institution was going to be in danger of collapsing,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Payne said the action the IOC has since taken to clean house  
and initiate reforms has ensured that the committee would emerge a 
``much, much stronger and better organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not sure that today, people fully appreciate the  
magnitude of the steps that have been taken, and the change 
underway within the IOC,'' Payne said. ``But in time, people will 
look back and see this time as a defining moment in Olympic 
history, where, in the end, an awful lot of good will come out of a 
very difficult and ugly period.''
