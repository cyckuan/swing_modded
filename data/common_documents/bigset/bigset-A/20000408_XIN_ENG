SINGAPORE, April 7 (Xinhua) -- A recent government survey shows
Singapore companies raised 1.4 billion Singapore dollars (820
million U.S. dollars) in venture capital (VC) funds in 1999, 300
million Singapore dollars (176 million U.S. dollars) more than the
1.1 billion Singapore dollars (650 million U.S. dollars) raised in
1998.
</P>
<P>
The figure brought to 10.2 billion Singapore dollars (six
billion U.S. dollars) the cumulative total of VC funds Singapore
manages as at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by Singapore's Economic Development Board
and the National Science and Technology Board to track the
investment and fund rasing activities of Singapore-based VCs for
the calendar year 1999, said Singapore-based VC investors
committed around 1.35 billion Singapore dollars (790 million U.S.
dollars) in 423 projects, 46 percent higher than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The survey said investments into Singapore accounted for 413
million Singapore dollars (243 million U.S. dollars) out of the
total investments worldwide by Singapore-based VCs.
</P>
<P>
The survey estimated that there were at least 375 VC-funded
companies in Singapore with more than 60 VC-funded companies
having gone public in the city state.
</P>
<P>
The survey findings also show that more Singapore-based VCs
have stepped up investments further afield with investments into
the U.S. increasing slightly to 19 percent in 155 projects.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, technology-based companies made up
more than half of all investment in 1999, both in terms of
investments into Singapore and worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Singapore currently houses about 90 fund management groups (
both international and homegrown) and they employ more than 370
investment professionals in Singapore.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Committed to Friendship With China: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Girija
Prasad Koirala said here Friday that he and his government are
committed to promoting the friendly relationship with China and
will not allow anyone to conduct anti-China activities in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
He said so during a meeting with Fu Quanyou, Chief of General
Staff of People's Liberation Army (PLA) of China, who arrived here
Thursday for a six-day visit to Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Refuting the myths that Tibet is backward and under-developed,
the prime minister praised the great development Tibet has seen
under the leadership of the central government of China.
</P>
<P>
"I was quite impressed by the great changes and fast
development of Tibet when I visited there years ago," said the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Koirala said the "one country, two systems" policy pursued by
China in taking back Hong Kong and Macao is a wise policy which
will help China to succeed in its reunification in near future.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also stressed the need to promote trade and
economic relations with China, especially with Tibet, which
borders Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Fu Quanyou told Koirala that China will stick to the "one
country, two systems" policy and will go all out for a peaceful
reunification of the country.
</P>
<P>
The PLA head said a good and friendly relationship between
China and Nepal is not only in the interest of the two countries,
but also in the interests of the stability of Asia as well as the
world.
</P>
<P>
"Economic development is impossible without a peaceful and
stable situation, therefore, peaceful co-existence is even more
important to China and Nepal, both of which are developing
countries," he said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanians Urged to Donate Safe Blood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanians were urged on
Friday to donate safe blood to alleviate shortage in most of the
country's hospitals.
</P>
<P>
During the celebrations to mark the World Health Day under the
theme " safe blood starts with me, blood saves lives", the United
Nations resident coordinator Sally Fegan Wyles said it was
important for Tanzanians to know about safe blood and blood
donations as well as the importance of caring for life and health.
</P>
<P>
"Safe blood is that which does not contain viruses, parasites,
drug, alcohol, chemical substances or other extraneous factors
that might cause harm, danger or disease to recipients," Wyles
told hundreds of city residents, students and members of
diplomatic missions attending the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
According to her, Tanzania is facing an acute shortage of
blood. She quoted statistics as saying that only 70,000 units of
blood were donated yearly countrywide, which could only meet one
third of the requirement.
</P>
<P>
However, the spread of HIV/AIDS in the country has made the
situation even worse.
</P>
<P>
A report released by the Christian Medical Center in northern
Kilimanjaro region said out of 10 people who donated blood in the
hospital, six were HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
"We call on all citizens, leaders, civil societies,
organizations, government and development partners to support and
advocate for volunteering HIV testing," said Wyles.
</P>
<P>
U.N. will launch a volunteering HIV testing exercise in Dar es
Salaam next week as a contribution not only to blood safety
initiative but also to the whole issue of this killing disease.

MUSCAT -- An official of the Omani ministry of oil and gas said
Oman started exporting the liquefied natural gas (LNG) on Friday,
with the first shipment bound for South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The Arab daily "Alhayat" on Saturday quoted the Omani official
as saying the shipment left the port of "Oman's LNG Company"
located in the eastern Sour city, which has signed a 25 year
contract to sell 4,1 million tons of LNG annually to the Korean Gas
Company. The Omani company had already signed similar contracts
with U.S., Japanese and Indian firms.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the biggest investment company in Oman said this
move is part of a plan aimed at diversifying the national economy,
far from the oil revenues which account for 65 percent of the total
income.
</P>
<P>
IRAQ -- Statistics released by the U.N. showed that the Iraqi
monthly oil exports dropped to 400,000 barrels, the lowest since
last December when oil shipments were unstable due to some
differences with the U.N..

However, the world organization did not say why this decline
took place.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian FM Calls for Israeli Withdrawal From South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, April 8 (Xinhua) -- In a meeting with U.N. chief's
personal envoy Terje Roed Larsen here on Saturday, Jordanian
Foreign Minister Abdel Ilah Khatib reiterated the call for Israel's
withdrawal from all Arab occupied lands including south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Larson arrived here earlier in the day to brief Jordanian
leaders on his efforts to help create a favorable condition for
Israeli troops withdrawal from South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the envoy also briefed Khatib on U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan's talks with Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy, held in Geneva on Tuesday on the Lebanese issue.
</P>
<P>
Levy pledged during his talks with Annan that Israel would
cooperate with the 4,500-strong U.N. peace-keeping forces stationed
in South Lebanon during its troop withdrawal scheduled for July.
</P>
<P>
Larsen arrived here from Syria where he had talks with Syrian
Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh on the creation of suitable
circumstances to implement U.N. resolutions 425 which called on
Israel to unconditionally withdraw its troops from South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon, where Larson had visited before his trip to Syria, and
other Arab countries had warned that Israeli troops' pullout from
Lebanon should be part of a broader settlement, which also covers
the return of the Golan Heights to Syria and the meeting of the
Palestinian refugees' demand to return home.
</P>
<P>
Larsen added Jordan to his regional tour as the kingdom has been
a major peace broker between Israel and Arabs since it signed a
peace treaty with Israel in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom takes peace and cooperation as the corner stone of
its foreign policies, and has pronounced that it supports all
efforts by all parties which would contribute to a just, durable
and comprehensive peace in the region.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Denounces U.S.-British Air Raids on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League on Saturday denounced
the recent air raids by warplanes of the United States and Britain
on Iraqi civilian and service facilities, which caused heavy
casualties.
</P>
<P>
The air raids were carried out without the authorization of the
United Nations Security Council and therefore were "unjustifiable"
and "a flagrant violation" of the Iraqi airspace, the league said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The pan-Arab forum said that "it is following with deep concern"
the continued U.S.-British airstrikes against Iraqi targets, a move
which has killed and wounded many innocent people and damaged vital
economic facilities.
</P>
<P>
It called for an end to the raids, urging efforts to resume
cooperation between Iraq and the U.N. within the context of
commitment to the implementation of the relevant Security Council
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, U.S. and British warplanes attacked southern Iraq,
leaving 14 innocent people dead and 19 others wounded, which was
one of the heaviest casualties Iraq has suffered since the Western
allies launched the Operation Desert Fox airstrikes against Iraq in
December 1998.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led Western allies imposed two no-fly zones in northern
and southern Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War to allegedly protect the
Kurds and the Shiite Muslims in the two regions from possible
persecution by the Iraqi government. Baghdad has never recognized
the no-fly zones, which are not covered by any U.N. Security
Council resolutions.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian military is assembling
a rapid-response team so as to be able to move anywhere in the
world within 48 hours, the country's Ottawa Citizen reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Operations Group will comprise of 800 troops of army, navy
and air force with planned tasks ranging from reconnaissance work
to setting up a communications and command base, according to the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
To be commanded by 1st Canadian Division's Chief of Staff Col.
Jim Calvin, the rapid-response team will be assigned two units:
the Canadian Forces Joint Headquarters and the Canadian Forces
Joint Signal Regiment, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The team, to be based in Kingston, Ontario, becomes operational
on June 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Armed forces has a disaster-assistance team,
which provides humanitarian assistance but is not configured for
hostile environment, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, we'll never have to use it for that, but if there
was a major outbreak of hostilities, possibly even a war somewhere,
and we had this deployment capability, it would all go up," Carl
Doucette, planner of the new organization, was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's PAC Tries to Unite With Other Political Parties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Stanley Mogoba, president of
the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) of South Africa, Saturday asked
delegates to its national congress to closely cooperate with other
political parties in a bid to avoid political oblivion.
</P>
<P>
Mogoba said in his report to the congress that the PAC should
"listen to our members and explore some working relations" with
other political parties left of the ruling African National
Congress (ANC).
</P>
<P>
Talks were continuing with the Azanian People's Organization
(AZAPO), although they were progressing "very slowly," he said,
adding that the congress "should give us a lead so that we can
take these talks forward."
</P>
<P>
In his report, acting Secretary-general Ike Mafole said talks
were also continuing with the Socialist Party of Azania (SOPA).
</P>
<P>
"These talks, if successful, should lead to the two parties
cooperating closely in matters of common interest ," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said preparations were underway for a summit between PAC and
AZAPO delegations led by their respective presidents.
</P>
<P>
The PAC delegation was working very hard to ensure that the
agreements were concluded soon so that the local government
elections could be approached as a united front, the so-called
Azanian Front, according to the South African Press Association.
</P>
<P>
Neither the PAC, AZAPO nor SOPA did well in the 1999 elections,
with the three failing to muster more than one percent.
</P>
<P>
The PAC has three members in Parliament and AZAPO only one.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts said then that the second democratic
elections spelled the end for black opposition parties and that
they faced the choice of uniting or facing political oblivion.
</P>
<P>
Mafole said the party wanted a mandate to continue these talks
"because alone there is not much we are going to achieve".
</P>
<P>
"Our survival as a political and ideological force lies in our
entering or forming alliances or a united front so that we can
impact on the political arena in this country," he said.

</P>
<P>
The statement said the working group was charged to
investigate:
</P>
<P>

adversely influence the incidence of malaria;
</P>
<P>
-- the harmonization of treatment and prophylaxis protocols,
vector control and the use of insecticides, taking into account
the national scientific evidence and prevailing circumstances;
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Seeks to Drag GCC into Early Warning System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Secretary of
Defense William Cohen on Saturday urged all Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) states to join a U.S.-proposed early warning
mechanism, allegedly built to protect them from any possible
missile attacks.
</P>
<P>
Cohen told reporters at Kuwait's Udairi Range north of here that
his talks in Kuwait and other Gulf states are centering on a "
cooperative defense initiative" designed to deter any chemical or
biological attacks on these states and the U.S. forces in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who arrived in Kuwait from Bahrain early in the day for a
two-day visit, watched a joint Kuwaiti-U.S. military exercise code-
named "Eager Mace 2000" at the range. The annual war games started
on April 1 and will end on April 25.
</P>
<P>
While speculating a potential missile threat from Iran or Iraq,
Washington has in the past two years been seeking to share the
system with the GCC states, namely Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
But reactions to the initiative from the GCC countries have so
far appeared to be lukewarm.
</P>
<P>
"It is something very important throughout the Gulf region to
make sure that all of us including the U.S. forces are prepared to
deal with chemical and biological attack," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the "preparations include an early warning system
and we hope that all of the Gulf states participate in it."
</P>
<P>
Cohen flied to Qatar on Wednesday, the first stop of his present
Gulf tour, after concluding visits to Nigeria, Egypt, Israel and
Jordan.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges Iran to Release All Iraqi POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has urged Iran to cooperate
with it and release all the remaining Iraqi Prisoners of War (POWs)
still held in Iranian prisons, an official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Iraqi News Agency (INA), Fahmi Al-Qaisi,
head of the Iraqi-Iranian War Victims Committee, said that Iran
still holds more than nine thousand Iraqi POWs, as documented by
the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), in addition to
thousands of more Iraqi POWs concealed by the Iranian side from the
ICRC.
</P>
<P>
The official urged Iran to repatriate all the remaining Iraqi
POWs according to relevant U.N. resolutions, and provide evidence
of the Iraqi Missings in Actions (MIAs) during their eight-year war
beginning from 1980.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is ready to negotiate with Iran, either in Baghdad or
Tehran, to seek a solution to the issue that has been a major
obstacle to the normalization of the bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Iraq claims that Iran still holds more than 13,000 Iraqi POWs,
while Tehran says that more than 2,800 Iranian POWs are still held
in custody by the Iraqi authorities.
</P>
<P>
However, both sides have repeatedly declared that all of the
POWs of the other side have been set free.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Iran started to exchange POWs in recent years to
improve relations.
</P>
<P>
In October last year, Iran unilaterally declared to set free 276
Iraqi POWs and in April 1998, the two sides exchanged more than 310
Iranian POWs and 5,500 Iraqi POWs.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Court Rejects Appeal by Imprisoned Journalists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 8 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian court on Saturday
rejected an appeal by three journalists jailed for libeling Deputy
Prime Minister Youssef Wali, the country's Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The journalists from the bi-weekly opposition, Islamist journal
al-Shaab, were sentenced to imprisonment last week after being
found guilty of libeling Wali, who is second in command of the
ruling National Democratic Party and also minister of agriculture
and land reclamation.
</P>
<P>
They appealed the ruling on the grounds that they were not
present at the final hearing of the trial and the announcement of
the verdict, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo Criminal Court rejected their argument and found their
absence from the earlier hearing "a fraudulent attempt to get round
the verdict," it said, adding that the court had agreed to hear the
appeal but found the content "unconvincing."
</P>
<P>
Al-Shaab editor Magdi Hussein and reporter Salah Bedawi were
jailed for two years, and the political cartoonist, Essam Hanafi,
was given a one-year sentence for a series of articles accusing
Wali of "treason" and "collaborating with the Zionist enemy,"
Israel.
</P>
<P>
All the three defendants and another journalist were fined 20,
000 Egyptian pounds (5,570 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The journalists still can forward an appeal to Egypt's highest
court to reverse the ruling.

ANKARA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Diplomatic sources here said that
intense work and his wife's serious illness might have prompted
Polish Ambassador to Ankara Miroslaw Palasz to commit suicide early

The ambassador, who was taken to Bayindir Hospital Medical
Center in Ankara on Friday when his own illness had become grave,
died of a trauma in his head after jumping from his hospital room

<HEADLINE> Canada, U.S. Building Largest Fuel-cell Power Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Canada and the United States are
investing a total of 18 million Canadian dollars (about 12.4
million U.S. dollars) to build the world's largest fuel-cell power
plant in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
The prototype project will use solid oxide fuel-cell technology
to convert chemical energy directly to electrical energy. The
systems can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50 percent,
the local press service said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"This project is a first in Canada and representative of co-
operative support for advanced, clean-energy technologies like
fuel cells," Canadian Defence Minister Arthur Eggleton was quoted
as saying at the launching of the project in Toronto Friday.
</P>
<P>
The minister, who stood in for Minister of Natural Resources
Ralph Goodale, described the project as "innovative, effective and
environmentally sound forms of power generation that promise to
lead to Canadian jobs, cleaner air and reduced greenhouse gas
emissions."
</P>
<P>
Canada expects the solid oxide fuel-cell technology to help
reduce emissions by about eight megatons while creating over 1,000
jobs by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The project is jointly funded by the Canadian government, the U.
S.Department of Energy and the Florida-based Siemens Westinghouse
Power Corp., which has been developing solid oxide fuel-cell
technology for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The plant is being incorporated into the existing technology
facilities of Ontario Power Generation Inc., which is a leading
North American power generator with more than 30,000 megawatts of
installed generation capacity, according to the local press
service.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- A three-day meeting of the Joint
Political Committee (JPC) set up under Lusaka agreement ended here
Saturday with a call for the United Nations to implement its
resolution on peacekeeping in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC).
</P>
<P>
A press statement issued at the end of the meeting said: "The
committee welcomed the adoption by the U.N. Security Council of
Resolution 1291, authoring the expansion and extension of the
Mandate of the U.N. Observer Mission in the DRC (MONUC)."
</P>
<P>
It called upon the U.N. to ensure the speedy implementation of
the provisions of the resolution including the deployment of
peacekeeping forces in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The JPC assured the U.N. of the readiness of all parties "to
cooperate fully with the MONUC."
</P>
<P>
Special Representative Kamel Morjane to the DRC of U.N.

<P>
The JPC meeting also appealed to the international community to
give adequate support to the Joint Military Commission which is
suffering for chronic shortage of fund and logistic support.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's School Education Yields Good Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government policy of
free primary education for all has resulted in a big increase in
enrolment, an official in charge of education said here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mnaki Mlambo, acting director of Zimbabwe's schools and
non-formal education, revealed an increase in enrolment of 188
percent in primary schools from 819,586 in 1979 to 2,460,323 in
1999.
</P>
<P>
The secondary school enrolment rose from 74,321 in 1979 to
834,880 in 1999, she said at a function in Harare in commemoration
of the Global Action Week for Education.
</P>
<P>
According to Zimbabwe Education Act (1987), every child in
Zimbabwe has the right to school education.
</P>
<P>
To this end, Mlambo said the government had spent substantial
amounts of money in building primary and secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
The number of primary schools rose from 2,401 in 1979 to 4,723
in 1999, and that of secondary schools from 172 in 1979 to 1,548
in 1999, she said.
</P>
<P>
Mlambo stressed education was a basic human right in Zimbabwe,
adding that the country was committed to Global Campaign for
Education.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the current harsh economic conditions, the
hidden costs through development levies and the impact of HIV/AIDS
were some of the factors that militated against children accessing
education.
</P>
<P>
Globally 125 million children are said to be out of school
while 150 million receive schooling of low quality at high cost
that they drop out due to limited financial resources.
</P>
<P>
Mlambo said some provinces in Zimbabwe were identified for a
pilot project to identify children in difficult circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Parents and the community should assist children to develop
well rounded persons with acceptable cultural values, she said.

<HEADLINE> Five Killed, Thousands Left Homeless in Flood in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Five people have been killed and
several thousand others left homeless this week in central and
western Romania, in the aftermath of the country's heaviest floods
in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Heavy downpour and melting snow made rivers to overflow their
banks, inundating households and farmland, disrupting road and
railroad traffic in many places, and causing damages amounting to
dozens of millions of U.S.dollars.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Mugur Isarescu called the army to move in and
pull stranded people to safety.
</P>
<P>
Army helicopters were ordered to fly to the insulated villages
to provide drinking water and food, while engineers were
dispatched in the field to make use of explosives to reroute
raging torrents from their devastating course.
</P>
<P>
The worst-hit counties were Alba, Arad, Bistrita-Nasaud, Bihor,
Brasov Caras-Severin, Hunedoara, Maramures, Mures and Timis.
</P>
<P>
Officials of relevant ministries and departments, such as the
Water, Forests and Environment Protection Ministry and the
Governmental Commission of Defense against Calamities, were on the
red alert around the clock in an attempt to contain the damage.
</P>
<P>
Though the weather was showing general signs of improvement,
rain and sleet would continue to fall in the hilly and mountainous
regions of western Romania, according to meteorologists.
</P>
<P>
Waterflows of the rivers would subside, but the lower sectors
of western rivers were expected to swell further, they said.

<HEADLINE> Bolivia Declares Emergency Amid Water Law Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LA PAZ, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Bolivian government Sunday declared
a state of emergency amid continuing violent protests by peasants
and laborers in the central city of Cochabamba and the capital
city of La Paz.
</P>
<P>
A water law that could force peasants to pay for water they
currently use for free, and a pending waterworks project in
Cochabamba that promises to hike drinking water rates, are the
core reason for the current wave of unrest.
</P>
<P>
The 90-day state of emergency, approved Friday evening by the
cabinet, will give President Hugo Banzer special powers to deploy
police and the military to deal with the crisis. The move has to
be passed by the Congress, where the ruling party controls the
majority.

<HEADLINE> Syria Reiterates Call for Full Israeli Pullback from Golan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Syrian Foreign Minister
Faruq Shareh on Saturday reiterated Damascus' stance that there
will be no just and comprehensive peace between Syria and Israel if
Israel fails to completely withdraw from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Syria's position is clear: without a full Israeli pullout from
the Syrian Golan Heights there would be no peace between the two
sides, Shareh told reporters after meeting Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
The Golan Heights, a strategic plateau of Syria, was seized and
occupied by Israel in the third Mideast War which broke out on June
5, 1967.
</P>
<P>
"Syria wants a just and comprehensive peace based on full
Israeli withdrawal to the pre-June 4, 1967 line," said Shareh, who
arrived here earlier for a brief visit.
</P>
<P>
While Israel bears responsibility for any steps it takes, the
United States will also bear an important part of the
responsibility for any support to Israel that does not lead to a
just, full and comprehensive settlement, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
A meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad in Geneva on March 26 failed to revive the
peace talks between Syria and Israel, which have been stalled since
January due to disputes over Israeli withdrawal from the Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
Syria rejected an Israeli proposal to retain part of the eastern
shore of Lake Tiberias (Sea of Galilee) after withdrawing from the
strategic plateau. It demands full Israeli pullout.
</P>
<P>
Clinton angered Damascus by saying that the ball was in the
Syrian court and that it was up to Syria to present new peace
proposals.
</P>
<P>
"We denounced and were surprised at the claim that the ball was
in the Syrian court," Shareh said, adding, "We said that the ball
had been in the Israeli court. If we want to throw the ball it will
fall also in the U.S. court as we have replied to the Israeli ideas
when President Clinton presented them."
</P>
<P>
Shareh said he delivered to Mubarak a message from Assad on
developments in the peacemaking process and a reported forthcoming
Israeli withdrawal from Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel has said it will pull its forces out of a self-declared
security zone in south Lebanon by July even without a deal with
Syria, which has some 35,000 troops in Lebanon and wields great
influence on Beirut, to make Syria lose one of its main means of
pressure for the return of the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Lebanon refuse to pledge any security guarantees
following the Israeli pullout from south Lebanon, saying that
Israel must accept responsibility for any move it makes.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with a
self-proclaimed aim of protecting its northern border areas from
cross-border guerrilla attacks. Since then, the Lebanese Hezbollah
guerrillas have been spearheading a war to oust the Israeli
occupation forces.

<HEADLINE> Ghana's President Announces General Amnesty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's President Jerry John
Rawlings has granted general amnesty to convicts who have served a
third of their jail- term ranging between 10 and 20 years,
reported Ghana News Agency Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Agency quoted Interior Minister Okaija Adamafio as saying
in the capital Accra that those prisoners affected by the amnesty
would have their sentences reduced by half, except those convicted
for offences of rape, robbery and narcotics.
</P>
<P>
Adamafio said in an official statement that the grant also
covered a number of first offenders serving sentences of less than
10 years who have served one third of their sentences, adding that
over 1,000 prisoners in this category would soon be released.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a special pardon has also been granted by the
President to two ex-soldiers, Captain Edward Adjei Ampofo and
Sergeant Oduro Frimpong, who were convicted in 1983 and 1985
respectively and sentenced to death for subversion.
</P>
<P>
The two subverters had already been benefitted from a previous
amnesty in 1997 when the death sentence passed on them was
commuted to life imprisonment. They have each served over 16 years
in prison, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
President Rawlings has also directed a further review of cases
of senior military and non-commissioned officers, some of whom
remained in exile over several years after they had been charged
for treason, said the statement.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- All the nine parties to the
19-month-long armed conflict in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC) Saturday afternoon signed an agreement on cessation of
hostilities and creation of a disengagement zone in their latest
move toward restoration of peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
The disengagement zone, to be created from April 14 would be 30
km wide and orders are expected to reach the ground before the
above date, Acting Chairman of the Joint Military Commission
Timothy Kazembe told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"You cannot expect the orders to reach the ground so easily.
The army commanders will issue their orders before the April 14,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not comment on the question of what would be
the punishment for the new violations if any.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Military Commission has been here for a three-day
meeting. They finally presented their disengagement plan to the
Joint Political Committee which is charged with the
responsibility of overseeing the whole implementation process of
Lusaka Cease-fire Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan State Minister for Regional Cooperation Amama Mbabazi,
who is also the chairman of the Joint Political Committee, hailed
this as a great achievement at the end of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
All the parties to the DRC conflict penned a cease-fire
agreement in Lusaka, Zambia, last July and August. However,
repeated cease-fire violations have left the peace accord not as
binding as expected.

<P>
BANGKOK, April 8 (Xinhua) -- A second-half goal by Ri Man Chol
gave the Democratic People's Republic of Korea a 1-0 victory
Saturday over Chinese Taipei in their last Asian Cup Group 8
qualifying match.
</P>
<P>
The victory gave DPR Korea a one-point edge over hosts Thailand
in the standings. The Thais, facing arch-rival Malaysia in the
subsequent match, needed at least a draw to wrest back the top
spot and a guaranteed berth in Lebanon. Malaysia defeated
Thailand, 3-2, in their first-leg encounter last month in Kuala
Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
The DPR Korea-Chinese Taipei match saw both sides scoreless in
the first half. Chinese Taipei played more aggressively than ever
before, but they still had to stay at their own half on defense.
</P>
<P>
Ri Man Chol's long-range shot deflected off Chinese Taipei's
Chang Kuo Chen and bobbled slowly past their keeper, that put the
Koreans one goal ahead, in the 55th minute.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Taipei tried desperately to score but failed on several
occasions to convert chances to a goal.
</P>
<P>
A downpour two hours before the match made the play more
difficult.

NANJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Two 5,000-year-old sites belonging

A score of Chinese archeologists gathered at Dakan Village,

<HEADLINE> China will not Yield on Matter of Principle: Official (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The "One China" principle is an
issue of right and wrong, and China will by no means compromise
and give in on this matter of principle, a senior Chinese official
in charge of Taiwan affairs said here today.
</P>
<P>
Some people in Taiwan's industrial and commercial fields openly
clamor for "Taiwan independence" and advocate the "Lee Teng-hui
Line", which preaches the breakup of the motherland. It has
exerted a bad influence, said Li Bingcai, deputy director of China
's Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council and Taiwan Work
Office of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they scrabble for profits by engaging in business
and economic operations on the mainland of China. Such a situation
will not be allowed to continue, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the people in the industrial and commercial
circles of Taiwan stand for developing cross-straits relations,
and oppose "Taiwan independence", indicating their strong desire
for peace and stability, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"We encourage them to make investments and conduct other
economic activities on the mainland. We will continue to implement
the policy of giving preferential treatment to Taiwan investors
and adopting an appropriately relaxed policy, and protect their
legitimate rights and interests in accordance with the law," Li
said.
</P>
<P>
The mainland of China enjoys political and social stability,
and steady economic growth. The recently-launched strategy of
speeding up economic development in the western part of China
holds out great opportunities for Taiwan compatriots who wish to
invest in and conduct business activities on the Chinese mainland,
he said.

<P>
By the end of 1999, the trade volume between the two sides of
the Taiwan Straits totaled 160.4 billion US dollars, and Taiwan's
share of this trade gave it a huge favorable balance, enabling the
island province to upgrade its industrial structure and maintain
economic stability.
</P>
<P>
China pursues a consistent policy of encouraging Taiwan
compatriots to invest in the mainland of China. To implement this
policy, The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress
and the State Council have approved the "Law of the People's
Republic of China on Protection of Investment by Compatriots From
Taiwan" and "Detailed Rules on Implementation of the Law on
Protection of Investment by Compatriots From Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
People's congresses and governments at all levels in China's
provinces and autonomous regions have also worked out their own
regulations in this regard, and set up special organs to deal with
complaints arising from problems concerning investment by Taiwan
compatriots.
</P>
<P>
The reason for drawing up such laws and regulations is that
Taiwan is an inalienable part of China. The people on both sides
of the Taiwan Straits are Chinese. Promotion of cross-straits
economic exchanges tallies with the common aspirations and
fundamental interests of the people on both sides of the straits,
Li noted.
</P>
<P>
"We will stick to the eight-point principle on developing cross-
straits relations and promoting the peaceful reunification of
China proposed by Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China. We will continue to
encourage our Taiwan compatriots to invest and engage in economic
activities on the Chinese mainland, and safeguard their legitimate
rights and interests in accordance with the law," he said.
</P>
<P>
The people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits feel the need to
promote cross-Straits relations and realize direct links in trade,
transportation and postal services between the two sides. China
expects that more Taiwan compatriots will come to the mainland of
China for investment and other types of economic cooperation, he
concluded.

BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Airlines has joined the
Star Alliance, the largest of its kind in the world, becoming the
third Asian member of the alliance after Thai Airways and All
Nippon Airlines, a representative of Singapore Airlines announced
here today.

<P>
GCC secretary general, Jamil al-Hujailan, said in a statement
that the meeting of the ministerial council would discuss important
topics related to the joint cooperation of the GCC member states.
</P>

held in Riyadh, and the decisions taken by the joint working
committees in the economic, media, and environmental areas.

HANOI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The number of elephants in Vietnam
has over the past 10 years declined sharply, causing a major
challenge to the country's wildlife preservation.
</P>
<P>
The Flora and Fauna International, Vietnam's Forest Inventory
and Planning Institute and Institute of Ecology and Biological
Resources recently conducted a survey in Central and South Vietnam,
where elephants live in the forests, according to a report of
Vietnam News Agency Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that the number of wild elephants in Vietnam
has reduced to 111 at present from around 2,000 in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Wildlife preservationists cited reasons for the situation,
including the elephants' habitats being narrowed by men's forest
encroachment and the hunt for ivory by the locals.
</P>
<P>
They warned that Asian elephants will be extinct in Vietnam in
the third millennium unless measures are taken soon to preserve
them.

<TEXT>
<P>
Local newspaper The Guardian quoted Saturday the general
manager Patrick Griswold as saying that about 200 workers on the
production line will be affected.
</P>
<P>
He said with a capacity of turning out a monthly average of
25,000 tyres worth over two billion Tanzanian shillings (about 2.5
million U.S. dollars), the company had a pile-up of at least
25,000 units of tyres now.
</P>
<P>
Griswold said that three major problems, tax evasion among
private importers, importation of sub-standard tyres and give away
prices being offered by importers, forced his company to face an
unfair competition in the liberalized market.
</P>
<P>
"We shall remain closed for a month until the relevant
authorities review the existing tax rates on locally manufactured
tyres," he said,
</P>
<P>
A joint venture based in Arusha, northern Tanzania, The General
Tyre (East Africa) is owned by Continental General Tyre
International holding 23 percent of shares and the Tanzania
government holding 74 percent of shares.
</P>
<P>
The general manager said since the introduction of Value Added
Tax (VAT) in 1998, the sales of products have dropped from an
average of 20,000 units of tyres per month to 8,000 units.
</P>
<P>
Local manufacturers currently pay 25 percent duty on imported
raw materials plus another 20 percent as VAT before they mark up
their profit on a final product.
</P>
<P>
Griswold said that the government, especially the Ministry of
Finance and the Tanzania Revenue Authority, needed to review the
existing taxes for local manufacturers so that they can fairly
compete in the market.

MAPUTO, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano on Friday said he knew nothing about any negotiations
with the former rebel movement Renamo (Mozambican National
Resistance) that might lead to new general elections, Mozambique
News Agency reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama Wednesday claimed that

Chissano, however, said he had not met with Dhlakama recently,

He likewise knew nothing about any negotiations aimed at
discussing holding new elections. Renamo has claimed that the
December elections, which it lost, were fraudulent, and has been
insisting that there should either be a recount or fresh
elections.
</P>
<P>
Chissano declined to make further comments on the matter, and
clearly left the door open for some kind of discussion with
Renamo when he said " it all depends on what Renamo means by
negotiations".

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Begins Final Troop Withdrawal From S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Nigeria contingent serving in
the West African Peacekeeping Force or ECOMOG had restarted its
final troop withdrawal from Sierra Leone, the force's spokesman
Lieutenant-Colonel Chris Olukolade confirmed Friday.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here Saturday from Freetown quoted Olukolade
as saying in Sierra Leone's capital that the final phase of
Nigeria troop's withdrawal is expected to end by mid-April.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the troops would be conveyed back to Nigeria
in at least four small batches.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria started withdrawing its troop, reportedly 12,000 men
strong, immediately after the signing of Lome peace accord last
July between Sierra Leone's government and rebels.
</P>
<P>
But it suspended the withdrawal several times upon requests
from Sierra Leonean government as well as the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
With the finishing of deployment of a UN peacekeeping force in
the war- torn country, Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo is
rapidly seizing the opportunity to have his presidential campaign
promise materialized, said observers in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria reportedly had to spend nearly a million U.S. dollars a
day to maintain peace in Sierra Leone before the UN peacekeepers
coming in.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Lifts House Arrest of Zhivkov, Post-Mortem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The appeal court of Sofia has
decided to lift the house arrest decree on Todor Zhivkov, the
former leader of Bulgaria who died in August 1998, newspaper
reports said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The court decided on March 27 to cease the trial of Zhivko for
"channeling money to developing countries," bringing an end to the
house arrest verdict 19 months after his death, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Zhivkov, former chairman of the Council of Ministers and of the
Socialist Party who ruled the country for 35 years, was sentenced
to seven years in jail in 1992 for power abuse and was later
placed under house arrest.
</P>
<P>
He was accused of spending public funds on luxury apartments,
cars and entertainment for his family and close aides.
</P>
<P>
In August 1996, the Bulgarian Supreme Court Criminal Committee
acquitted Zhivkov of the crimes. But he remained under house
arrest on the charge of channeling millions of dollars to
developing countries and incurring great financial losses to
Bulgaria.

ANKARA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel

<P>
The presidents of Turkey, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan,

Demirel will speak at the summit, during which multilateral
cooperation in all fields between Turkey and countries in Caucasus
and Central Asia will be discussed.

to the Mediterranean Sea.

The sixth summit is expected to sign the "Baku Communique," a
document foreseeing cooperation among the Turkish-speaking

ANKARA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkey sent a diplomatic note to the United States on Friday,
reacting against the seminar on "Kurds' Search for Identity" to be
held in Washington, between April 17-18 with the contribution of
the U.S. State Department.
</P>
<P>
As supporters of the outlawed separatist Kurdistan Workers'
Party were invited to the seminar, where "Kurdish national anthem"
will be played, Ankara gave a harsh note to the U.S., saying that "
this does not fit into friendly Turco-U.S. relations."
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- Forest fire which broke out in 81 places throughout Turkey
were taken under control on Friday with the help of rain.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the fire, lasting four days, destroyed 5,
019 hectares of forest area.
</P>
<P>
Sabah (morning):
</P>
<P>
-- The Turkish Treasury Ministry said on Friday that Turkey's
foreign debt increased to 111.2 billion U.S. dollars as of the end
of 1999, up from 102.7 billion dollars in 1998. The increase
stemmed from private sector's debts.

<P>
NEW DELHI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- India would make a test flight
of its first geosynchronous satellite launch vehicle (GSLV) in the
second half of this year, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We are developing GSLV to put INSAT class of satellites into
orbit," PTI quoted Chairman of India Space Research Organization (
ISRO) K. Kasturirangan as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, we will have its first test flight in the second
half of this year," he told the local station of All India Radio
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
After two successful test flights earlier, India could now put
its own satellite into orbit with this kind of vehicle and it
would be unnecessary to go abroad to do it, he added.
</P>
<P>
The eminent Indian scientist said India had indigenously
developed its launch capability through the Polar Satellite Launch
Vehicle for putting remote sensing satellites into the orbit.
</P>
<P>
"We are capable of launching remote sensing satellites," he
said, adding, "We have demonstrated it successfully five times now.

<HEADLINE> Tension Still High Between Pakistan, India: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Tension remains high between
Pakistan and India after the visit of U.S. President Bill Clinton
to this area earlier, Pakistan Foreign Office spokesman Tariq
Altaf said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Altaf blamed the tension
on what he called India's continuing "propaganda against Pakistan.
"
</P>
<P>
He charged that New Delhi's propaganda is aimed at maligning
Pakistan's image and diverting international attention from the
Indian army's "atrocities against the Kashmiris."
</P>
<P>
He criticized the Indian government's rejection of Pakistan's"
public offer of dialogue" which was also "formally conveyed to the
Indians."
</P>
<P>
"We think, by rejecting dialogue, they are going against the
trend of the times and against the will of the international
community," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton had, during his stay in the subcontinent in late March,
tried to persuade India and Pakistan to resume their dialogue to
cool down the heat of trading harsh words between the two South
Asian rivals but failed.
</P>
<P>
Altaf also brushed aside India's accusation of infiltration
across the Line of Control (LoC) which divides Pakistan and India
in the disputed area of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"Parroting allegations of infiltration will take them nowhere,"
he said. "We have repeatedly offered to mutually agree on
mechanisms which would permit monitoring of the LoC. That is a
serious approach."

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Israel Reportedly Ready on Water Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Israel appear to be ready
to strike a deal on water sale, reported Turkish Daily News on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"We are about to complete our study on the water issue, and we
have received several proposals from shipping companies while a
Turkish company will present its proposal in the coming few days,"
informed sources was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is proposing to sell 50 million cubic meters of water
from its Manavgat River, southeast Turkey, to Israel each year.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli delegation of experts has been in Ankara and Manavgat
to carry out feasibility studies on the project in recent months.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet will reportedly take up the issue for
discussion and evaluate Ankara's proposal later this month.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel both hold that the Manavgat project, known
as "water for peace project," ought to include other states in the
region. But Turkish officials said that Jordan and Palestine will
not be involved at an initial stage.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Turkey last month, King Abdullah of Jordan
discussed the water issue with Turkish leaders within the framework
of a planned Turkish-Israeli water deal.
</P>
<P>
But the Monarch reportedly told the Turkish authorities that the
price Turkey was charging for water was too high and Jordan could
hardly afford it. Instead, he requested that the water be given to
Jordan free of charge or for a symbolic price.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government is in favor of the deal despite the
expense of the project, and they are seeking the most efficient and
hygienic method of transporting the water.
</P>
<P>
The Israelis prefer a port-to-port shipping line to a pipeline
to be laid under sea.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Scores Tremendous Successes in Blood Transfusion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe Friday joined the rest of
the world to commemorate World Health Day, a day on which
countries take stock of what they have achieved in promoting
quality health for their people.
</P>
<P>
This year's commemoration was held under the theme "Safe Blood
Starts With Me --Blood Saves Life", placing the responsibility of
blood safety into the hands of every individual.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has, despite the HIV/AIDS pandemic, made a number of
achievements in the field of blood transfusion and this is
something to be happy about despite the gloomy picture of the
health delivery system.
</P>
<P>
The country is ranked among the best transfusion services in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Addressing guests at the World Health Day 2000 commemoration in
Harare Thursday, Medical Director of the National Blood
Transfusion Services (NBTS)
</P>
<P>
Macleod Chitiyo attributed the success to a clear policy and
strategy for blood donor recruitment based on a strong, efficient
and safe system of collecting and processing blood and its
products.
</P>
<P>
Commending Zimbabwe's efforts, WHO country representative Deo
Barakamfitiye said of the 191 WHO member states, only 29 percent
had policies and plans supported by a legal framework to ensure
blood safety within national blood transfusion services.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is among the first countries in the world to introduce
HIV screening for all blood donations.

<P>
NAIROBI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Kenya and Tanzania police have
agreed to work together to combat escalating crime and drug
trafficking along the border of the two countries, local media
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The two sides signed a pact in the Kenyan capital Nairobi
Friday at a meeting of top police officers, respectively led by
Kenya's Director of the Criminal Investigations Department Francis
Sang and his Tanzanian counterpart Rajabu Adadi.
</P>
<P>
Police from the two countries will be deployed at all major
border points to deal with drug offences, car-jacking, bandits and
other criminals across the border.
</P>
<P>
Sang said the meeting deliberated on cross-border theft of
motor vehicles and motor cycles, illicit trafficking in firearms
and smuggling.
</P>
<P>
The incessant banditry activities, theft of electric cables and

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Announce New Oil Marketing Regulations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambian government will soon
announce new and stringent measures which oil marketing companies
would have to follow to meet international standards, Deputy
Minister of Energy Celestino Chibamba has said.
</P>
<P>
He said all those who desired to venture into the petroleum
sub-sector would be required to show commitment and justify their
participation.
</P>
<P>
"This is a lucrative business which cannot be left or given to
business houses on a silver platter. We feel that we must attract
a huge capital investment to create and reward a competitive
economic atmosphere," Chibamba was quoted by Saturday's Zambia
Daily Mail newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister disclosed that the Energy Regulation Board
(ERB) would make the announcement, saying all transporters,
including oil marketing companies would soon be given a time frame
to buy new tankers which should conform to international
standards.
</P>
<P>
"It is very sad to note that business people just go to oil
company to scoop fuel and come and sell and make huge but
unjustified profits in leaking tankers which have continued to
pose a health hazard and contribute to environmental degradation,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The ERB will set highly acceptable standards and bench marks to
be met by would-be investors in this sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government as a major stakeholder reserved the
right to retain certain strategic responsibilities in the oil
marketing industry and ruled out wholesale privatization.
</P>
<P>
He said it was not strange for the Zambian government to retain
an interest for economic and social reasons, in certain strategic
industries under the government ownership.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Drought-Stricken Regions Get Emergency Relief Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Some 20,950 tons of grain is
being distributed to the famine victims in Somali State, Ethiopia,
the Federal Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Commission
(DPPC) has said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to emergency relief grain, the local government and
non- governmental organizations have deployed at least 22 water
tanks to provide water to areas hard hit by drought, according to
the commission's statement available on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Somali State, bordering with Somalia, is one of the Ethiopian
states that are the hardest hit by the current drought.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources from Jijiga, capital of Somali State, told
Xinhua by telephone Saturday that due to lack of water in the
region, the local government has to make ration in distribution
of water.
</P>
<P>
Residents in the Jerer Valley and the Ogaden region are
rationed with about 0.14 liter of water daily, the sources said,
describing that water has become, in some sense, more important
than grain.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Senior Official Pledges to End High-Level Graft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Director Aaron Ringera of the
Kenya Anti- Corruption Authority has pledged that he will put an
end of high-level corruption in the country, the People daily said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Justice Ringera made the remarks in the capital Nairobi Friday
when he spoke at the closing ceremony of a week-long seminar to
train prosecutors for the authority.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that his authority would arrest and prosecute
"all big fish" implicated in the graft once the Economic Crimes
Bill is passed in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Once enacted, the new law will give the authority the autonomy
to tackle the deep-seated graft and take action against the
perpetrator, the director said.
</P>
<P>
Being committed to the rule of the law, the anti-corruption
authority " is not just after small fish, any fish netted will be
roasted irrespective of size," Ringera pledged.
</P>
<P>
Ten Kenyan civil servants were this week charged in court with
 corruption and abuse of power, five of them being taken to court
by the anti-corruption authority.
</P>
<P>
Tom Owuor, Chairman of the Advisory Board of the Kenya
Anti-Corruption Authority, said at the event that the "small
fish" are currently being used as a bait to catch the larger
ones.
</P>
<P>
Owuor also assured that Kenyans should believe that the
authority under the leadership of Ringera will put the graft in
the country to an end.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Oil States Get 13% Derivation From Oil Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian government Friday assured
the retaining of 13 percent crude income by the country's oil
producing states, reported the Guardian, a leading Nigerian
newspaper Saturday.
</P>
<P>
President Olusegun Obasanjo said Friday at a jubilant reception
in Uyo, capital of the west African country's eastern Akwa Ibom
State.
</P>
<P>
Oil producing states, including Akwa Ibom, which are mostly in
the southeastern part of the country, has long been agitating for
a larger share in the crude revenue.
</P>
<P>
The president advised beneficiary states to ensure wise use of
the fund especially in the areas which suffer immensely from
ecological and other attendant effects of oil exploitation.
</P>
<P>
He, however, urged these states to explore other areas through
which they could boost their revenue generation besides crude
oil.
</P>
<P>
The president said it was likely the states have other
resources in abundance, especially solid minerals, which could
also be a source of huge revenue.
</P>
<P>
He said beneficiaries of the derivation formula would not be
from oil producing states alone, as provision had also been made
for those with other kinds of mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
He also pledged to ensure equity and justice in the country, as
they are vital tools for the pursuit of national cohesion and
peace. He attributed past incidents of unfair treatment and
marginalization of certain groups or states to "aberration"
caused by decades of military misrule.
</P>
<P>
The eastern states, dominated by Igbo population, are often
among the poorest in the west African country, despite their huge
oil reserve.
</P>
<P>
This is partly due to the domination of the northerners in the
federal government after the civil war in late 1960s, in which
the pro-independence eastern states were defeated.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Repeals Money-Losing State News Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian parliament has
approved a law to officially abolish the national news agency
Shihata, transferring its powers and functions to the Information
Services (Maelezo) of the government.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly Friday endorsed the Tanzania News Agency
(Repealing) Act of 2000 on repealing the Tanzania News Agency Act
of 1976 under which Shihata was established in 1976.
</P>
<P>
The new act grants Maelezo powers "to control and regulate the
collection, distribution and dissemination of news and news
materials in Tanzania."
</P>
<P>
Moving the bill in the Parliament which is in session in
Dodoma, the designated new capital in central Tanzania, Home
Affairs Minister Muhammad Seif Khatib said the Shihata staff to be
retrenched would be paid their benefits right away.
</P>
<P>
Khatib, who was until recently a Minister of State in the Prime
Minister' s Office for policy and information, said Shihata had to
be disbanded because it was operating at a loss.
</P>
<P>
"Until last year the national news agency was yet to be paid 76
million Tanzanian shillings (about 95,000 U.S. dollars) by its
clients," he said. " It had assets worth 50 million Tanzanian
shillings (about 62,500 dollars) only, a factor which even
discouraged would-be partners."
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa was appointed by the then
president Julius Nyerere the first director of the Shihata when it
was founded in 1976.

<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- A cold front from Siberia
approached central Mongolia and the northern part of Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region this morning, forming a strong wind there.
</P>
<P>
According to the Central Meteorological Observatory, the strong
cold current is moving southeastward at a speed of 50-60 kph. and
a dust storm has buffeted central Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
The cold wave is expected to arrive at the Sino-Mongolian
border tonight and a strong wind with maximum force of seven will
hit northern China tomorrow morning, the meteorologists said.
</P>
<P>
It is unknown whether the forecast rain tonight will prevent a
floating dust storm or not.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: How CITES Works </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CITES was adopted in 1973 and came into force in 1975. To date,
150 countries have signed the treaty, making it one of the world's
most important agreements on conservation and sustainable use.
</P>
<P>
International trade in wildlife is big business, estimated to
be worth billions of dollars annually and to involve more than
350 million plants and animals every year.
</P>
<P>
Along with the loss of habitat and increased local exploitation
of wildlife resources, unregulated international trade can pose a
major threat to the survival of endangered species.
</P>
<P>
The convention promotes the protection of certain species by
forbidding international trade or allows regulated trade. The
convention accords varying degrees of protection to over 30,000
plant and animal species depending on their biological status and
the impact that trade may have upon them.
</P>
<P>
Species threatened with extinction are protected by
international trade ban. The species are listed in Appendix I of
the Convention, including all the great apes; various big cats
such as cheetahs; snow leopards and tigers;
</P>
<P>
numerous birds of prey; cranes; and pheasants; all sea turtles;
many species of crocodiles, tortoises and snakes; and some cacti
and orchids.
</P>
<P>
And other species may become endangered with extinction if
trade is not carried out in a sustainable manner. These species
are listed in Appendix II and include all those primates, cats,
cetaceans, birds of prey, parrots, crocodiles and orchids which
are not listed in Appendix I.
</P>
<P>
The convention requires member countries to set up necessary
national legislation to issue permits for trade in species listed
in the CITES Appendices. Member countries must also designate a
scientific authority to provide scientific advice on imports and
exports.
</P>
<P>
The member countries are also required to assist in enforcing
CITES. This is done in close cooperation with customs, police or
similar Agencies.
</P>
<P>
The CITES Secretariat, located in Geneva, is responsible to
oversee the implementation of the convention at the global level.
It also organize the meetings of the Conference of the Parties
every two and a half years, where parties amend the Appendices
based on proposals submitted by parties.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Continue Ban on Ivory Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has differed with four
African countries in the region and resolved to continue with the
ban on ivory trade as a way of preserving the elephant population
in the country, Zambia Daily Mail newspaper reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has differed with Namibia, Zimbabwe and Botswana which
have lifted their respective bans while South Africa is also in
the process of joining the three.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement released by Tourism Ministry on
Friday, Zambia entered in 1989, with reservations, a resolution to
ban the trade in ivory at a meeting held in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
It said Zambia later in 1997 formally withdrew its reservation
and upheld the ban on the trade.
</P>
<P>
"This decision was based on the fact that the country's
elephant population had suffered severe depletion and a few areas
formerly designated range have been reduced or eliminated," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Zambia could not cooperate with the four African countries on
suspending the ban because such decisions would have a direct
effect on the country because of the geographical location, it
added.
</P>
<P>
Zambia, India and Kenya have come out against the lifting of
the ban.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Railways to Be Leased Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambian government is to lease out
Zambia Railways on a 25-year period to private investors in a move
aimed at making the company more viable, Commerce Trade and
Industry Minister William Harrington has announced.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet has with immediate effect directed the Zambia
Privatization Agency (ZPA) to advertize to would-be investors
interested in the railways, Zambia Daily Mail newspaper reported
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Harrington as saying Zambia's privatization
program was a resounding success having recorded only three
percent failure rate out of more than 230 state-owned enterprises
sold since the privatization program began in July 1992.
</P>
<P>
He said the record was overwhelming, especially considering
that other countries that had embarked on privatization had
recorded above 15 percent failure rate.
</P>
<P>
He said the three percent recorded failure was a result of the
company's failure to continue with operations largely because of
lack of funds and mismanagement.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Withdraws Support Of Zimbabwe's Land Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States Friday withdrew
its assistance to Zimbabwe's land reform program over the
occupation of commercial farms by Zimbabwean war veterans,
Spokesman for the Department of State James Foley said, according
to The Herald, Zimbabwe's biggest newspaper, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Foley said the U.S. Agency for International
Development had committed over one million U.S. dollars to
support Zimbabwe's land resettlement program.
</P>
<P>
"That program has broken down in recent weeks, as war veterans
and their supporters illegally occupied hundreds of commercial
farms in clear violation of Zimbabwean law," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The United States government has joined other donors in
suspending assistance to Zimbabwe's land reform and resettlement
program," he said.
</P>
<P>
Foley said the U.S. government supports "rational, sustainable
and equitable land reform in Zimbabwe and believes land
redistribution can be a win/win situation for all Zimbabweans".
</P>
<P>
"We cannot continue to fund this program while government
sponsored occupations are allowed to erode the rule of law,
undermine investor confidence and reverse the progress made in
improving race relations in Zimbabwe," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that his government "strongly condemns the violent
attacks on occupied farms and against legal and peaceful political
demonstrations".
</P>
<P>
"Zimbabwe's future and reputation are threatened by this
display of political intolerance," he said.
</P>
<P>
Foley urged the Zimbabwean government to "restore the rule of
law and fulfill its responsibility to protect the political and
human rights of all Zimbabwean citizens".

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Malaysia's Telecom Market Opens to Greater Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 8 (Xinhua) -- With the confirmation that
Malaysia's Time Engineering Bhd (Time) and Singapore
Telecommunications Ltd (SingTel) are to form strategic partnership,
Malaysia's telecommunications industry now opens to greater
competition, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
Time, one of the six licensed telecom companies in Malaysia,
confirmed Friday that it had signed a "non-legally binding
agreement" with SingTel, which will see the latter buy shares in
Time and its two subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
SingTel will buy 108.22 million shares or a 14.5 percent stake
of Time for 649 million ringgit (170.789 million U.S. dollars) and
also purchase a 20 percent stake each in Time's subsidiaries Time
Dotcom Bhd and Time Online, an internet service provider, for
undisclosed price.
</P>
<P>
A binding agreement is expected to be signed between the
parties within a month, Halim Saad, executive chairman of Renong,
the parent company of Time, said in a statement Friday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said as strategic investor, SingTel, Singapore's
largest telephone company, will have "significant active
participation in the management" of Time and its concerned
subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
An analyst said SingTel's entry into Malaysia's
telecommunications market brings along greater competition in the
industry as it will be a strong competitor to Telecom Malaysia Bhd,
Malaysia's largest listed company which has more than 4 million
lined subscribers, a 95 percent share in the market.
</P>
<P>
The immediate effect of the deal was that Telecom Malaysia's
share fell by almost 6 percent on worries that SingTel may eat
into its earnings as competition intensifies.
</P>
<P>
The general concern is that SingTel will be able to channel
Malaysia's international traffic through Singapore. Such a move
may hamper the Malaysian government's efforts to position Malaysia
as a regional telecommunications hub, an analyst pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Another analyst said the inclusion of SingTel into Time would
on the other hand help the latter gain ground in the local telecom
market, threatening Telecom Malaysia's dominant market position.
</P>
<P>
Telecom Malaysia quickly reacted with its Chief Executive Wira
Mohd Said saying his company has "strategies and contingency plans
in place" to deal with the competition.
</P>
<P>
Before Time, four of the six licensed telecom companies in the
country already have foreign participation.
</P>
<P>
Telecom Malaysia is the only one said to be unlikely to need a
foreign partner.
</P>
<P>
According to regulations governing telecommunications, foreign
investors are allowed to have up to 61 percent equity stake in a
local telecom company but this amount should be reduced to 49
percent over a five-year period.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government encourages local telecom industry to
rationalize itself as studies show that the market with a
population of some 22 million people could only support three
strong players with impunity.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has set very specific target as far as
telecommunications is concerned. It wants a telephone penetration
of 45 lines per 100 inhabitants by the year 2020, which is the
standard in industrialized countries, against the present 22 lines
per 100 inhabitants.

MANILA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- A fast ferry, making its maiden
voyage, sank off Punta Gorda in Misamis Oriental, the Southern
Philippines, Saturday morning, but all the passengers and crew
members were rescued.
</P>
<P>
According to the local ABS-CBN television, the fast ferry
Tropical Queen sank at around 09:00 (01:00 GMT) on its way from
Misamis Oriental to Camiguin, in northern Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
About 30 minutes after the ferry left the port, an explosion
was heard in the engine room. The crew, however, were unable to
control the flames due to defective fire fighting equipment.
</P>
<P>
But all the 48 passengers and nine crew members were later
rescued by the Philippine Coast Guard and some volunteers.

ZAGREB, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Russian Economics Minister
Andrei Shapovalyants said Friday that his country is going to
strengthen economic cooperation with Croatia by building a oil
pipeline and increasing natural gas exports.

The pipeline will connect the two countries via Belarus,
Ukraine and Hungary.

Shapovalyants declared the project at a meeting of the joint
commission of economics, trade, science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Last year Russia exported 1.2 billion cubic meters of natural
gas and 4 million tons of oil to the former Yugoslav republic,
said Shapovalyants, adding Russia will raise its natural gas
exports in the future to balance increased medicine imports from
Croatia.
</P>
<P>
The Russia minister also expressed the hope that the two
countries will continue to work closely in military technology and
ship-building.
</P>
<P>
Shapovalyants' counterpart, Goranko Fizulic, echoed him, saying
Croatia will seek deeper economic cooperation with Russia, its
traditional trading partner.

<HEADLINE> EU's Anti-Racism Watchdog Launched in Vienna </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- European Monitoring Center on
Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC), an anti-racism watchdog of the
European Union (EU), was founded in Vienna Friday.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address, EUMC chairman Jean Kahn deplored the
political landscape in Austria. "Unfortunately there is a party in
the Austrian government that has used racism as propaganda."
</P>
<P>
The inclusion in the ruling coalition of the far-right Freedom
Party in Austria has sparked controversy across Europe and
triggered political sanctions by the other 14 EU members.
</P>
<P>
Kahn said his center will serve as the "eyes and ears" of
Europe to watch for racism tendencies in all EU member countries.
</P>
<P>
President of EU Commission Romano Prodi, President of the
European Parliament Nicole Fontaine, and Austrian President Thomas
Klestil as well as some 500 delegates from EU countries attended
the opening at the Hofburg Palace in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
Fontaine reiterated her firm anti-racism stance, saying the
European Parliament will not tolerate and will never give up in
its fight against racism and xenophobia.
</P>
<P>
Klestil lamented that his country's image was being tainted by
the current crisis. "Too often a picture of this country is
painted in which an objective observer can only see a distortion
of reality," he said, noting that millions of immigrants have been
living peacefully with Austrian people during the past decades,
and currently some 10 percent of Austria's population are
foreigners.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the Vienna-based EUMC provides opportunities
for the outside world to know Austria objectively.
</P>
<P>
The EU decided to base the EUMC in Vienna several years before
the unexpected political change in Austria.
</P>
<P>
The appearance of Austrian Foreign Minister Benita Ferrero-
Waldner, who was not invited, at the opening ceremony, caused
quite a stir.
</P>
<P>
She defended herself that in the capacity of a foreign minister
of a full EU member state, she does not need any invitation to
attend such a ceremony.
</P>
<P>
But it was clear she was not welcome. "We decided not to invite
government representatives for the reason that it would have meant
including members of the Austrian government," Bob Purkiss, vice
chairman of the center, said before the ceremony, to the applause
of delegates.
</P>
<P>
The EUMC was composed of anti-racism experts from EU member
countries, as well as observers from the European Parliament, the
Commission of the European Union and the Council of Europe.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Rejects U.S. Pressure on Telecom Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Mexico Friday rejected U.S.
pressure to speed up the pace of opening its telecommunications
market, insisting the opening must be done in a gradual manner.
</P>
<P>
Mexico has promised to open the market, but this must be done "
in agreement with the timetable established," said minister of
communications and transportation, Carlos Ruiz Sacristan.
</P>
<P>
The minister was speaking clearly in response to Tuesday's
sanction threat from U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky.
</P>
<P>
It is up to the Mexican government to decide how to proceed
with the opening-up. The United States has no right to interfere,
Ruiz said.
</P>
<P>
In an annual "Foreign Trade Barriers" review of its 54 major
trading partners released on March 31, Barshevsky accused Mexico
of failing to control Telmex, the former Mexican state phone
monopoly.
</P>
<P>
The report accused Telmex of setting discriminatory rates and
rules against American competitors.
</P>
<P>
On April 4, Barshefsky said she viewed the situation very
serious and gave Mexico until July 28 to reform.
</P>
<P>
If the reform remains unsatisfactory, she said, the Clinton
administration will take Mexico to the World Trade Organization (
WTO) for trade abuse.
</P>
<P>
"We, as regulating authority, will do what is better for the
country, and in fact we have already started a procedure about the
Telmex dominance," said Ruiz.
</P>
<P>
"What matters is that things come out well in Mexico and we
have a gradually growing competition," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Federal Telecommunications Commission also
said the Mexican government has always abided by WTO telecom rules.
The commission announced on April 2 that it will apply regulations
to Telmex to counteract its dominance.
</P>
<P>
Telmex represents 25 percent of the value of capital moved in
the Mexican Stock Exchange and has 10.2 million, or nearly one
ninth of the Mexican population, as its users.
</P>
<P>
In the 434-page U.S. government trade review report, many
countries were named for criticism in nearly every trading sector.
Apart from Mexico, the United States also complained about telecom
barriers in South Africa, Japan, Germany, Canada, Britain and
Israel.

<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of today's major
Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>
"People's Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- A frontage commentator's article says implementation of the
government strategy of speeding up economic growth in the western
part of China should have a new mode of thinking, which should not
be divorced from reality, but be a correct choice in accordance
with the changes of subjective conditions and the present and
future development.
</P>
<P>
-- Spokesmen for both China's Taiwan Affairs Office of the
State Council and Taiwan Work Office of the Central Committee of
the Chinese Communist Party issued a joint statement on Friday
criticizing Annette Lu's remarks on "Taiwan independence."
</P>
<P>
They said Lu's remarks during an interview with a Hong Kong
media organ has challenged the One China policy and has provoked
animosity between the people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits.
This shows that Lu is an "extremist and typical 'Taiwan
Independence' element," they said.
</P>
<P>
-- Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo urged local governments, departments
and units to join hands to detect hidden dangers and strengthen
management to prevent major accidents, ensure the safety of life
and properties, and create a sound social environment for pushing
forward the reform, opening up and modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
-- A spokesman for the mainland-based Association for Relations
Across the Taiwan Straits pointed out that Annette Lu's recent
statements have exposed the disgraceful face of a small group of "
Taiwan independence" advocates. Their aim is to split China, and
they have maliciously attacked the mainland as well as all the
Chinese people. There is no doubt that their schemes backfire.
</P>
<P>
The paper's overseas edition reports that more than 1,000
neighborhood communities where people enjoy a relatively
prosperous life and have decorum have been built along both banks
of the Pujiang River in Shanghai, China's largest industrial
center.
</P>
<P>
 "Xinhua Daily Telegraph"
</P>
<P>
-- Xinhua News Agency issued a commentator's article Friday
strongly refuting Annette Lu's statements for advocating "Taiwan
independence". The article says that the allegation is aimed at

territory, and that the people of Taiwan are an inseparable part
of the Chinese nation.

<P>
"Beijing Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- President of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS)
Li Tieying Friday visited the Legend Group, seeking technological

Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Feature: Asian Airlines to Fly in Clearer Sky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Airlines (PAL) posted a
net income of 98 million pesos (2.4 million U.S. dollars) in
January this year, the second month for the national flag carrier
to make profit after losing money for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
PAL, Asia's oldest airline, was on the brink of liquidation
last year because it failed to service 2.2 billion dollars in
debts.
</P>
<P>
Although the airline has not come out of the wood, the worst of
its crisis seems over with a rehabilitation plan. With a better
financial position, PAL restored in March the thrice-a-week direct
flights between Cebu, the Central Philippines, and Hong Kong which
was suspended in June 1998 when it was experiencing financial and
operational difficulties.
</P>
<P>
PAL's story shows that aggressive restructuring and regional
economic rebound have provided opportunities for Asian airlines
for a quick recovery from a financial crisis which started in July
1997.
</P>
<P>
Compared with PAL, Cathay Pacific Airways performance was more
remarkable. Cathay reported a 2.19 billion Hong Kong dollar (281.4
million U.S. dollars) profit for 1999, compared with a 547 million
Hong Kong dollar (70 million U.S. dollars) net loss a year ago.
</P>
<P>
"What started happening in June 1999 (when load factors started
improving) came faster and harder than we expected," bringing "a
very pleasant surprise," said Cathay's Chairman James Hughes-
Hallett.
</P>
<P>
For other airlines in the region, the situation has also
improved. It was estimated that Singapore Airlines' profit for the
1999-2000 fiscal year ending in March, went up 16.5 percent from
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that passenger traffic growth is helping Asian
airlines recover from the regional crisis. During the first 11
months of 1999, the 18-member airlines of the Association of Asia
Pacific Airlines carried 10 percent more passengers than during
the same period of 1998, and planes were 70 percent full.
</P>
<P>
The strong demand for new passenger planes also reflected the
optimism of some Asian airlines about their future. At the
Singapore air show in 1998, when the Asian crisis reached its
height, aircraft suppliers could hardly get any orders.
</P>
<P>
But when the six-day air show opened in Singapore earlier this
year, the atmosphere was totally different. Many airline
executives were interested in buying new planes. Hong Kong Dragon
Airlines ordered 10 planes from Airbus Industries, while Singapore
Airlines and Malaysian Airlines expressed interest in buying over
100 new planes between them.
</P>
<P>
"The mood is definitely more upbeat. I've had more discussions
in one day than I did at the entire show two years ago," said
Airbus Senior Vice President John Leahy.
</P>
<P>
The encouraging change is also a result of restructuring,
including cost-cutting measures, by Asian airlines in the past
three years. During the course of the crisis, some Asian airlines
canceled a number of flights and laid off workers, while others
even sold planes.
</P>
<P>
PAL trimmed its 13,000-strong work force to 8,000 and cut its
fleet from over 50 planes to 22. Cathay Pacific laid off 1,000
people, downsized its fleet and consolidated its operations.
</P>
<P>
However, the positive changes in the operations have not
prevented Asian airlines from undertaking further restructuring.
Thai Airways expected its partial privatization by November this
year with a foreign strategic partner.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government now owns about 93 percent of the airline
but this will be reduced to about 70 percent in the first stage of
a privatization program. Singapore Airlines is one of several
airlines that have expressed interest in taking a stake in Thai
Airways. Other airlines showed interest include Air France,
Lufthansa and UnitedAirlines.
</P>
<P>
The Japan Airlines plans to cut 500 to 700 additional jobs by
the end of 2002-2003 business year. The reduction is in addition
to a previously announced plan to cut the number of ground staff
by 10 percent, or 3,500 from 1999-2000 to 2001-2002. The plan aims
to accelerate its restructuring given the difficult conditions it
will face with high competitions.
</P>
<P>
To consolidate their operations, Asian airlines are also now
seeking global alliances. Malaysian Airline System officials said
recently that they are moving closer to an alliance with Northwest
Airlines. Singapore Airlines will join the biggest alliance, Star,
in April.
</P>
<P>
With further restructuring and changes in the regional economic
situation, Asian airlines are expected to fly higher in a clearer
sky this year, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> China Launches Massive Gas Development in East China Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The China National Offshore Oil
Corp (CNOOC) gives priority to developing offshore gas in the East
China Sea and started drilling in the Shaoxing 6-1 structure in
the Xihu Depression of the sea areas today.
</P>
<P>
According to CNOOC vice-president Dai Huandong, the basin of
the East China Sea which covers a total area of 250,000 sq.km.is
rich in oil and gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
And the Xihu Depression in the basin is particularly rich in
gas resource with proven and probable gas reserves topping 150
billion cubic meters. Experts expect the total gas resources in
the Xihu Depression to hit one to two trillion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
In addition to gas, the Xihu Depression is also rich in oil
resources with total resources at 1.2 billion tons. However, the
present proven and probable oil reserves stand only at 40 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
The vice president said that CNOOC will invest 400 million yuan
this year in drilling 5 wells and conducting a 5,000-km-long 2-D
seismic data collection. Dai added that the gas development in the
East China Sea is important for providing clean energy sources for
Shanghai and the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang which are
economically-developed coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
China started oil and gas development in the East China Sea in
early 1980s. So far, some 48 wells have been sunk and four oil and
gas fields as well as 6 oil and gas-bearing structures have been
discovered.
</P>
<P>
CNOOC, Shanghai and the China Star Oil Corp co-developed the
Pinghu oil and gas field in the basin in 1998 which has started
gas supply to Shanghai, with initial annual gas production
capacity topping 400 million cubic meters.

Chinese Scientists Found Aerolites, Ancient Soil at South Pole
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists found 28 pieces of aerolites, ancient soil,
and a number of samples of snow and ice cores during China's 16th
scientific expedition to the South Pole.
</P>
<P>
The 157-day expedition ended Tuesday when the icebreaker Snow
Dragon carrying the Chinese scientists arrived at Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Ten scientists climbed up the nearly 3,000-meter-high Grove
Mountain at the South Pole, and drew world's first map of the
mountain on a scale of 1:25,000 with advanced methods including
Global Positioning System.

China to Build Largest Geological Information System
</P>
<P>
China has started to build the country's largest basic
geological information system with a group of data banks.
</P>
<P>
The system, to be completed in 2008, will include data banks
of 1:50,000 digital grid maps, core topographical maps, geographic
names, digital altitude model maps, land-cover maps and other data
banks.

"Condensed Water" First Found in Taklimakan Desert
</P>
<P>
Chinese scientists have found that there exists "condensed
water" in the Taklimakan Desert of the northwest Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Scientists Wang Hong, Li Fenglin from the Geology and Minerals
Institute of Tianjin made the discovery when they were exploring
waters in the dry land.
</P>
<P>
Also called "suspended water", the "condensed water" is
believed to come into shape when evaporated water from the water-
able aquifer meets cold air at the ground surface of the desert.

</P>
<P>
Yan Xiaojun, director of the Gene Diagnosis Technical Research
Institute affiliated with the No. 4 Medical College of the Chinese
People's Liberation Army, told Xinhua that it is more efficient

<P>
BEIJING, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The following are highlights of
major science stories released by Xinhua in the past week:
</P>
<P>
New Technology Used to Find Disease-Related Gene
</P>
<P>
Scientists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) have used
a gene-removal technology to discover a gene related to a common
respiratory disease found among newly-born babies.
</P>
<P>
A research group at the Shanghai Institute of Cell Biology
under the CAS removed the NDST-1 gene from laboratory mice, and
after this gene was removed the mice developed the syndromes of
this respiratory distress.
</P>
<P>
Respiratory distress is a common disease among human new-borns,
and genetic studies of the mice will help scientists find cures
for this disease.
</P>
<P>
World's Biggest Chinese Book Website Launched
</P>
<P>
A new website claiming to be the world's biggest for Chinese
books has been launched by several Chinese students studying in
Silicon Valley in California in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The site, called Bookoo, differs from similar sites in that it
will sign contracts with writers and publish their books on-line.
By paying the authors, the Bookoo company is thus licensed to
digitize their works.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of well-known writers had decided to work with Bookoo
before the website was opened. Insiders say this will be helpful
for protecting on-line intellectual properties and stopping
illegal digital copies.
</P>
<P>
China to Enhance Computer Security Protection
</P>
<P>
China has unveiled a new set of regulations that will help
strengthen the security protection of its computer information
systems.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Ministry of Public Security and the State Bureau of
Quality and Technical Supervision jointly issued the rules that
will come into effect on January 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
The rules, called classification standards of computer
information system security protection, will help to tackle
computer-related crimes such as hack attacks, computer viruses and
the spread of harmful information, officials said.

Habitats of Giant Pandas Shrinking: Survey
</P>
<P>
Habitats of giant pandas in China are shrinking and
degenerating, latest surveys made by China's State Forestry
Administration (SFA) and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) have shown.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted in Qingchuan County of southwest China's
Sichuan Province, the home to the rare black and white bear, found
that the habitat area was only two thirds of that a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
Another investigation launched by the Sichuan Provincial
Department of Forestry and the WWF in 1998 in Pingwu County also
disclosed serious problems in panda protection, such as
degeneration of habitats and the decline of population density of
pandas.

<HEADLINE> Keegan: "Leeds UEFA Cup Match Was Wrong" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- England manager Kevin Keegan said
that Leeds' UEFA Cup semi-final against Galatasaray should have
been called off after the murder of two English fans.
</P>
<P>
The Elland Road side crashed to a two-goal defeat at the Ali
Sami Yen Stadium, the night after Leeds fans Christopher Loftus
and Kevin Speight were stabbed to death in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
Keegan backed the opinion of some critics that to continue with
the match was not in the best interests of football.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think the game should have been played, because I don'
t think players can go out and play and frankly Leeds didn't play,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Leeds chairman Peter Ridsdale had decided to proceed with the
tie despite objections from supporters of the West Yorkshire club.
</P>
<P>
But Keegan did not condemn Ridsdale's decision to go ahead with
Thursday's match.
</P>
<P>
"It was such a difficult time that you really, sometimes, don't
know which way to go," he said. "You can make arguments all the
way along, but nobody is going to come up with something
satisfactory to everyone."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Ridsdale admitted that he was unable to force
Galatasaray into an official minute's silence following the deaths
of two English fans on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Leeds United were the only team that wore black armbands. That
's the only thing I could control," said Ridsdale. "I don't want
to talk about why the Galatasaray players didn't wear them or why
there was no minute's silence."
</P>
<P>
He refused to discuss the matter any further, while manager
David O'Leary confined himself entirely to commenting on the match
itself.

<HEADLINE> Motor Racing Official Reveals F1 Team Cheating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Motor racing's top official, Max
Mosley, revealed that an unnamed F1 team used banned technology
during the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
According to the BBC report on Friday, Mosley, president of the
world governing body of the sport FIA, said:"I am not going to
name the team, but they were prepared to do something which was
quite clearly outside the rules."
</P>
<P>
"We became aware of it over the winter, but we do not have 100%
proof at the moment. When we do we will have a word with them. But
I do not believe it materially affected the course of the
championship," he said.
</P>
<P>
The team in question is believed to have used a form of
traction control - a device that makes the car easier to handle -
which was banned in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Mosley said the FIA were taking action before the British Grand
Prix at Silverstone to prevent other teams using traction control
technology.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing worse in any form of motor sport than when
you have a culture of infringement of the rules," he said. "Our
fundamental task is to make sure racing is fair. We are determined
to stop it because it is an unpleasant culture."
</P>
<P>
He said that the FIA had been forced to act because Formula One
teams could not be relied upon to police themselves. "We have got
to stop assuming that major companies would not be involved in
actions that were against the rules," said the president.

LONDON, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The death tally at this year's
Martell Grand National meeting rose to five when Toni's Tip

The Ferdy Murphy-trained gelding died instantly after suffering
spinal injuries.
</P>
<P>
The opening day of the meeting was marred by the deaths of four
horses.
</P>
<P>
The deaths are likely to prompt further alarm among animal
rights campaigners already staging protests outside bookmakers
ahead of Saturday's big race, even though only one of the deaths
occurred over the Grand National fences.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urged to Ensure Success of Second Round of Israeli-Palestinian Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, April 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. must
effectively participate in the second round of
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations to ensure that
this round make substantial progress, the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) said in a
statement on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued at a weekly cabinet
session of the PNA chaired by Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat in the West Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the Palestinian leadership
also expressed concerns over the fate of the
Palestinian refugees in Lebanon after a planned
Israeli pullout from south Lebanon by July with or
without a peace agreement with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Those Palestinian refugees are the guests of
the Lebanese government and Lebanese people and
their presence in the country is temporary, said
the statement.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, while expressing welcome to the Israeli
troops withdrawal from Lebanon, offered his
protection to the Palestinian refugees living
there.
</P>
<P>
"I say to our people in Lebanon, the Lebanese
and Palestinians there, we are with you and we
will not allow anybody to touch you in anything,"
Arafat said Thursday at a rally of his Fatah
movement in the West Bank city of Nablus.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians only accept the U.N. Security
Council Resolution 194 which grants the
Palestinian refugees the right to return to their
homeland.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian refugees will not hinder the
Lebanon government's exercise of its sovereignty
over south Lebanon after Israeli pullout, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are about 40,000 Palestinians
living in refugee camps across Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators began a new
round of talks Friday at Bolling Air Force base in
southeast Washington to continue discussions on
solving the most thorny final-status issues with
an aim to draft a framework agreement by May
before reaching a permanent peace treaty by
September.
</P>
<P>
Their first round of talks, held in the base on
March 21-28, failed to produce any tangible
results on all the issues discussed.  The
failure has raised doubts among the Palestinians
about the seriousness on the part of Israel in
reaching an agreement on the third stage troops
withdrawal from the West Bank and meeting the May
deadline for a draft peace agreement, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
This setback will affect the Middle East peace
process as a whole, therefore, the Palestinian
side called on the U.S. administration to be
committed to pushing forward the talks
effectively, the statement addeds.
</P>
<P>
Should the second round of talks fail to make
any headway, the whole talks will turn out to be a
waste of time and lose its credibility, the
statement warned.

and "a flagrant violation" of the Iraqi airspace, the league said
in a statement.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Adams Warns of Return to Violence in N.Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams
Saturday warned that Northern Ireland could face a return to
violence unless the fledgling power-sharing executive was restored.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Sinn Fein conference in Dublin, Adams said
British Prime Minister Tony Blair should order Northern Ireland
Secretary Peter Mandelson to reinstate the institutions he
suspended in February amid deadlock over the issue of paramilitary
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"There is the possibility that all of the good work of recent
years could be frittered away. Worse still there could be a slide
back to conflict," he told delegates gathered in Dublin for the
two-day conference.
</P>
<P>
Adams said the decision to suspend the devolved executive had
been the biggest mistake Labor had made since it came to power in
1997.
</P>
<P>
He said the government should not have made the decommissioning
of terrorist weapons a precondition for power sharing, and again
insisted that Sinn Fein - the IRA's political wing - could not
force the IRA to hand over its weapons.
</P>
<P>
Earlier at the Alliance Party conference in Belfast,Mandelson
repeated hints he might restore the institutions ahead of
decommissioning, but called on the Irish Republican Army(IRA) to
make its intentions clear.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson said that an IRA signal of peaceful intent would be
more valuable than a token gesture on decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
He told the Alliance conference that a more imaginative
approach to the weapons issue was needed and said the IRA needed
to create a climate of "confidence" for the power-sharing
institutions to be restored ahead of disarmament.
