<HEADLINE> S'pore Has to Modify or Change Economic Policy:DPM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 27 (Xinhua)-- Singapore Deputy Prime Minister
Tony Tan said Monday there are needs for Singapore to modify or
change present economic policies in its endeavor to take the best
chance of surviving and prospering in the new economic world.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to officers of the Singapore Administrative Services,
Tan said if Singapore is to compete effectively in the new economy,
it must be prepared to discard practices and models which have
been successful up till now and replace them with new models and
new practices.
</P>
<P>
He listed the promotion of economic growth, determining workers
compensation and revising labor practices as three major areas
which may need a radical change in thinking and practices.
</P>
<P>
"Our present strategy of allocating resources to promote
certain sectors will not be as effective as before in promoting
economic growth," he said.
</P>
<P>
Turning to workers compensation, he called for giving workers
stock options in their company, allowing companies the flexibility
to hire workers when needed and laying them off when their
operations change.
</P>
<P>
In Singapore today, he said, workers are paid for their working
in cash through salaries and bonus, and present labor practices
are designed towards ensuring an employee's loyalty to a company.
</P>
<P>
In order to create a responsive capital and labor market to
allow innovation and entrepreneurship to thrive, Tan said, the
government must remove regulatory obstacles that impede
enterprises and innovation and change policies which impede new
activities from flourishing.
</P>
<P>
He said it was time for the Singapore government to take the
major step of making large policy changes and implementing them
with a minimum of social unrest and unhappiness.

Minister Somsavat Lengsavad that Vietnam attaches importance to

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President Leaves for Israel on State Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
left here Tuesday on a state visit to Israel, the first such by a
Cyprus president since the island won independence in 1960.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before departure, Clerides said his visit was aimed at
promoting the island's role in the area, and creating better
relations with neighboring nations to help consolidate regional
peace.
</P>
<P>
In response to reporters' questions, the president was critical
of Israel's close military links with Turkey, which has occupied
the northern third of Cyprus since 1974, when it invaded in the
wake of an abortive Greek Cypriot coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Turkey signed a controversial military cooperation
agreement in February 1996, setting off a wave of anger across the
Arab world and sending alarm to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
But reports said the two countries have lately agreed on the
main points of a deal under which Israeli Military Industries would
modernize the firing and steering systems of US-built M60-A3 tanks
as well as upgrade their armour.
</P>
<P>
Although the military cooperation agreement between Israel and
Turkey does not seem to pose any danger for Cyprus, Clerides said,
such agreements should not be made.
</P>
<P>
Instead of promoting peace in the region, the agreements create
blocs, he said.
</P>
<P>
But he added Cyprus government has looked into the issue and
found that "there is no intention on behalf of Israel for this
agreement to be used against Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Rather, the agreement may possibly be targeting a countries or
countries in the Persian Gulf, he hinted.
</P>
<P>
As for the Palestinian issue, the president said Cyprus'
position is that "the (Palestinian) refugees must return to their
homes, human rights must be implemented, they must have a home, an
area to administer and of course they must have help to solve their
economic problems."
</P>
<P>
Clerides was accompanied on his visit by Foreign Minister
Ioannis Kasoulides, government spokesman Michalis Papapetrou and
other officials.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Continue Helping Solve Afghan Crisis: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Iran will continue its efforts to
find new strategies to solve the crisis in neighboring Afghanistan,
the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) quoted a senior official as
saying Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
To find a solution to the long-term Afghan crisis, Iranian
President Mohammed Khatami, who currently heads the Organization of
Islamic Conference (OIC), has taken appropriate measures, said
Mohammad Ebrahim Taherian, director of Afghan affairs at the
Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to IRNA, Taherian said that Khatami's major
efforts included sending a OIC delegation to Afghanistan's
neighboring countries and Saudi Arabia late last year.
</P>
<P>
The delegation has succeeded in winning consent of belligerent
groups and parties in Afghanistan for sitting down to negotiate,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a meeting is soon to be held in Jeddah, Saudi
Arabia, to follow up goals of the delegation. However, he did not
say whether the meeting would be attended by all Afghan political
groups.
</P>
<P>
The official said that international organizations should take
due role of the Afghan people into consideration and be serious in
solving the Afghan problem on the basis of their commitments.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of nearly 1.4 million Afghan refugees staying in
Iran, Taherian said that any planning and treatment with the
refugees should be in conformity with respect for Islamic and human
dignity.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Iran's reopening of a common border market
after issuing economic sanctions against the Taliban rulers aimed
solely at soothing the pains and hardship of Afghan people and did
not violate the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan has been engaged in bloody civil war since 1992
after Islamic guerrillas toppled the former pro-Soviet government.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, President Burhanuddin Rabbani's government was ousted
by the Islamic fundamentalist Taliban militia, who is now
controlling more than 90 percent of the country's territory.
</P>
<P>
Military clashes are still continuing between the Taliban and
the Northern Alliance headed by Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Iran maintains that the Afghan crisis should be solved through
peaceful negotiations between different political and ethnic groups
in the country so as to set up a broad-based government.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Zambia Sign Energy Cooperation Protocol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Egypt and Zambia signed on Tuesday a
protocol on cooperation in the fields of electricity and non-
conventional energy, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Minister of Electricity and Energy Ali el-Saeedi and
Zambian Minister of Energy and Water Resources David Savi, who is
here heading a technical delegation for a visit, signed the
protocol.
</P>
<P>
The protocol stipulates that Egypt and Zambia will exchange
expertise and information on constructing power stations on the
basis of the build-own-operate-transfer system, under which a
station will be transferred to the state after it is built, owned
and operated by a private investor for dozens of years.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Egyptian experts will help Zambia assess water
energy resources and how to make use of them in generating
electricity from water falls.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, Egypt is to offer Zambia necessary
technical aid to carry out rural electrification projects.

<HEADLINE> Israel Continues Attacks in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes continued air
raids on suspected Hezbollah guerrilla hideouts in south Lebanon on
Tuesday, without inflicting casualties, the National News Agency of
Lebanon reported.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli fighter jets fired six air-to-surface missiles at
the western sector of south Lebanon and bombed several villages in
the same region. In Jerusalem, the Israeli military confirmed the
strike. Meanwhile, Israeli planes hovered over Nabatiye and
Iglem Tufaah, creating fearful blare over the regions, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-styled 15-kilometer-deep security zone
in 1985 in south Lebanon with a claimed aim of protecting its
northern border from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian- and Syrian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, is
spearheading a guerrilla war in the zone to oust the Israeli troops
and their ally South Lebanon Army from south Lebanon, the last
active Arab-Israeli battlefront.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Israeli cabinet approved Prime Minister
Ehud Barak's plan to withdraw Israeli troops from south Lebanon by
July with or without a peace agreement with Syria, the main power
broker in Lebanon. But Hezbollah repeatedly claimed that they will
not cease fire until the completion of the Israeli pullout.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says Ball in Syria's Court to Move Mideast Peace Forward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on
Tuesday admitted failure of his talks with Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad and said the ball is in Syria's court to kick off a new
round of negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"I went to Switzerland to meet President Assad to clarify to
him what I thought the options were and to hear from him what his
needs are, and I asked him to come back to me with what he though
ought to be done," Clinton told reporters at a White House photo
session with visiting President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
But because of "significant differences" between Syria and
Israel, and Clinton just could not narrow them as President Assad
insisted his requirement of complete withdrawal from the Golan
Heights, captured by Israel during the 1967 Mideast War, the White
House said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the ball is in Syria's court now. "I'm going to
look forward to hearing from him," he added.
</P>
<P>
But he still sounded an optimistic note over the Middle East
peace process as a whole, saying: "I think you will continue to
see progress at least on the Palestinian track."
</P>
<P>
"Of course I hope we'll have some progress on the Syrian one as
well, as well as in Lebanon," he added.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Says Hopeful over Mideast Peace Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak said on Tuesday that he was still hopeful about the Middle
East peacemaking despite President Bill Clinton failed to narrow
differences between Syria and Israel in his talks with Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad in Geneva on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot say that's a failure," Mubarak told reporters before
his talks with Clinton at the White House.
</P>
<P>
"No progress from the Israelis and the Syrians doesn't make us
pessimistic," he said. "We have to make much more effort so as to
reach peace, and an agreement could be signed for the welfare of
the whole area."
</P>
<P>
Before his meeting with Clinton, Mubarak held talks with
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright for about 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told reporters that the ball is now in Syria's court
for resuming negotiations with Israel, which broke down in January
as both sides insisted their priorities in two rounds of talks in
Washington and Shepherdstown, West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
"The ball's in his (Assad's) court now and I'm going to look
forward to hearing from him," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he went to Geneva on Sunday to clarify to Assad what
his options were and to hear what were the needs from Syria. But
he failed to narrow "significant differences" between Syria and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Still, Clinton showed some optimism over the Middle East
peacemaking as a whole, saying: "I think (the Israelis) are making
very serious efforts on all tracks and I think you will continue
to see progress at least on the Palestinian track, and of course I
hope we'll have some progress on the Syrian one as well, as well
as in Lebanon."

<HEADLINE> An Important Visit of Arafat to Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Chairman of the Executive
Committee of the Palestinian Autonomic Territories Yassir Arafat
will end his visit to Germany on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
His visit to Germany is very successful. During his stay in
Berlin he has met with many German politicians. German Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder had assured Arafat during their meeting that
German Government would firmly back the aim of Palestinians to
found their own state in their territories. The Palestinian state
is expected to be proclaimed this autumn.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder stressed that the declaration of the EU. summit
which was held just one year before in Berlin is still effective
that the EU. backed firmly the founding of own state of the
Palestinians and thought that the Palestinians had right to
establish their own state in their region.
</P>
<P>
Besides German Chancellor Arafat had had meeting with German
Federal President Johannes Rau, German Parliament President
Wolfgang Thierse, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, German
Finance Minister Hans Eichel and the former German minister for
development aid and the expert for the affairs of the Middle East
Hans-Juergen Wischnewski.
</P>
<P>
In Arafat's opinion the negotiation which was held in
Washington must be finished at latest till September 13th. He
pointed out at press conference that he had to postpone
proclamation of the founding of an own state because he was under
the pressure of different sides.
</P>
<P>
Arafat called Germany and other EU's nations to join in the
peace process of the Middle East. In his opinion the EU. should
play a very active role in it. But Schroeder stressed that Germany
must take its steps within the frame of the EU. and the European
cannot play as a leading role in the peace talks of the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
At his meeting with Hans-Juergen Wischnewski Arafat conferred
the order "Bethlehem 2000" to the famous SPD-politician in order
to commend his contributions for promoting the peace case of the
Middle East. Arafat praised Wischnewski as "friend of all Arabs".
</P>
<P>
In Berlin Arafat had visited the Federal Printing House where
since 1994 passports, credentials, papers, certificates and stamps
were printed for Palestinians and up to now already more than 13
million exemplars had been made.
</P>
<P>
Arafat travelled to Stuttgart on Tuesday and continued his
visit. In Stuttgart he met with Prime Minister of the state of
Baden-Wuerttemberg Erwin Teufel. Teufel showed also his support
for the Palestinian people and set a high value on Arafat for his
contributions for the peace process of the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Teufel had assure Arafat that Baden-Wuerttemberg will for
Palestine with more economic aids, especially through training of
Palestinian teachers.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made a speech in the American Chamber of Commerce. He
expressed that Palestine will extend its economic and trade
relations with Germany and welcome German companies to invest in
Palestine.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda to Stop Cult Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government will
forbid all cult activities in the country after the incident of
cult mass deaths in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda News Agency quoted Minister of Justice and Institutional
 Relations Jean de Dieu Mucyo as saying on Tuesday, "unless steps
are taken to prevent this we could easily have the same problem as
the Ugandans have had."
</P>
<P>
The minister said that most of the cult leaders in his country
are propagating dubious teachings for their personal gains. He
stressed that those sects should be stopped.
</P>
<P>
"In my experience with the present Rwandan society, I have come
across so many court wrangles between sect leaders over property
and finances in their churches," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mucyo reiterated that prefects and other local authorities
should be very keen on knowing and following up all religious
sects' activities in their areas of jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
Rising death toll of Ugandans that perished in the Kanungu
inferno, in what at first seemed to be a religiously motivated
mass suicide, has caused fear and apprehension in various circles
of the Rwandan society.
</P>
<P>
"We are worried that such happenings may creep into our society
because we already have a myriad of religious sects that prevent
their followers to hold identification documents and doing any
gainful work," said an official from the Presbyterian Church.
</P>
<P>
Some sects in Rwanda are encouraging their followers to cut
down coffee trees and not to drink cow milk.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the beginning of 1999, many religious sects have

<HEADLINE> Two Burundi Rebel Groups Invited to Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Two main armed rebel groups
not included in the 20-month old Burundi peace talks have been
invited to take part in the next round of negotiations to be held
in Tanzania's north town of Arusha next month.
</P>
<P>
Addressing delegations representing 19 Burundian warring
parties involved in the peace talks at a plenary session held in
Arusha on Tuesday, the Burundi peace facilitator, former South
African President Nelson Mandela said the inclusion of the rebels
is crucial and asked the participants not to object to their
presence.
</P>
<P>
Two main armed rebel groups, the CNDD-FDD ( the National
Defense Council of Democracy-the Defense Force of Democracy) and
PALIPEHUTU-FNL (the Liberation Party of Hutu People- the National
Force of Liberation), the splinter groups of pro-Hutu CNDD and
PALIPEHUTU parties respectively, have not been involved in the
talks to date.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he was deeply impressed by views of the rebel
leaders, five top military officers and the Burundi defense
minister when he met them separately in South Africa this month.
</P>
<P>
"I was tremendously impressed by their respective views on the
Burundi crisis, not only that they support the Arusha process, but
they are in favor of an early resolution of the conflict," he told
the delegates, including Burundian President Pierre Buyoya.
</P>
<P>
The session was also attended by speaker of the Burundi
National Assembly Leonce Ndikumana and two ex-presidents Syvestre
Ntibantunganya and Jean-Baptiste Bagaza.
</P>
<P>
He asked the delegates once again to show seriousness to end
bloodshed in Burundi, adding that they must avoid petty issues and
rise to the occasion.
</P>
<P>
"The real challenge ahead of us all," Mandela said, "is to
agree on who is going to lead the transitional government and what
is the period of the transitional government."
</P>
<P>
The peace mediator also disclosed that he will travel to
Burundi after the government fulfills some conditions, which
President Buyoya later clarified were dismantling of the
regroupment camps and release of political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Mandela asked the delegates to support a draft compromise
proposal prepared by the facilitation team.
</P>
<P>
He gave the delegates three weeks to peruse the draft documents
and make necessary amendments.
</P>
<P>
However, he said not all amendments will be accepted, "only
those amendments that are genuine will be accommodated."

<HEADLINE> Palestinians in Gaza Strip Commemorate Land Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 Palestinians
demonstrated here Tuesday against Israeli settlement activities in
the occupied territories to mark the Palestinian Land Day.
</P>
<P>
In response to the call of the Palestinian People's Party (the
former Communist Party), the protesters gathered in three places
near Israeli settlements in the cities Gaza, Khan Yunis and Rafah.
</P>
<P>
The protesters held high banners reading "No Peace with
Settlement" and "No Peace with Land Usurpers." They tried to come
close the checkpoints of the Israeli army but were pushed back by
Palestinian police.
</P>
<P>
The protestors then dispersed peacefully.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was held the backdrop that Palestinian and
Israeli negotiators were talking in the U.S. on final-status issues
to thrash out a peace deal before the September 13 deadline.
</P>
<P>
There has been no report of remarkable progress. Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, who was on a trip to Europe to rally support
for his planned declaration of Palestinian statehood by September,
has accused Israel of "wasting time."
</P>
<P>
Since the Middle East peace process was kicked off in the early
1990s, Israel has surrendered most of Gaza strip and about 40
percent of the occupied West Bank to Palestinian rule in light of
the "land-for-peace" formula.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian people, especially the Israeli Arabs, about 1
million of whom live in Israel, annually commemorate the killing by
Israeli forces of six Arabs during demonstrations in 1976 to
protest against Israeli confiscation of their lands.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Confidence Lowers Again in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumer confidence lowered
again in March in the wake of higher interest rates and oil prices,
the Conference Board said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board, a New York-based prominent research group,
said in a survey that its Consumer Confidence Index slipped to 136.
7 in March from the revised 140.8 in February for the second
consecutive month. The index dropped to 140.8 in February from the
record high of 144.7 in January.
</P>
<P>
"While optimism about current economic conditions continues at
high level, consumers have turned cautions about prospects for the
next six months," said Lynn Franco, Director of the Conference
Board's Consumer Research Center.
</P>
<P>
Franco said, "analysts are waiting to see if a further erosion
in confidence triggers a slowdown in consumer spending. As for now,
a moderate cutback in consumer spending is unlikely to stifle
still-strong economic growth."
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised interest rates five times since
last June in an effort to cool off the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
The consumer confidence index is closely watched because
consumer spending makes up about two-thirds of the U.S. economic
activity.

<HEADLINE> Interview: South Summit to Charter a New Course for Developing Countries (by Gu Zhenqiu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Group of 77 (G-77),
which groups 133 developing countries, is working hard to
designate the upcoming South Summit, first in the body's 36-year
history, as an opportunity to strengthen cooperation in the
developing world and enhance partnership with developed countries
to promote development at a time when many developing countries
are being marginalized in the globalization process.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua on Monday afternoon, the chairman
of G-77, Arthur Christopher Izuegbunam, said, "For the first time,
we are going to have a summit, and heads of state are expected to
charter a new course hopefully" for developing countries in a
world in which there is a very big development gap between the
South and the North.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state are expected to ponder over the economic
issues, the new economic order for the developing countries and
the impact of the globalization, he said.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging the reality that many developing countries are
being marginalized in the tide of globalization, the G-77 chairman,
also the Nigerian permanent representative to the United Nations,
said, "We are trying to limit the pains of marginalization," and "
we must find a way to stand relevant."
</P>
<P>
The G-77 is scheduled to convene the first South Summit in
Havana, capital of Cuba on April 10-14 in what will be the South's
largest gathering of heads of state or government.
</P>
<P>
Top on the agenda will be globalization, knowledge and
technology, the South-South cooperation and the North-South
relations.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries face today the challenge of formulating a
common vision and constructing a platform for collective action in
order to achieve a comprehensive formulation and forceful
articulation of their shared concerns and objectives.
</P>
<P>
"The Havana Summit is a unique opportunity to renew the South's
commitment to South-South cooperation and define an action plan
with clear targets and a time frame for its effective
implementation," he said.
</P>
<P>
From the South Summit will emerge two final documents, the
first, a forward-looking declaration will set out a vision and
broad strategy for the future while the second action-oriented
document will clearly define measures, targets and time frame for
implementation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming Summit also hopes to set an agenda that puts
developing nations in the mainstream of the global economic and
technical revolution.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries should take advantage of South Korea's
computer expertise and the high-tech equipment manufactured in
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore because it is likely to cheaper,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"But the fundamental thing is that you have to have power to
run a computer," he said, adding that these basic development
issues will be also on the summit's agenda.
</P>
<P>
"The South-South cooperation is not only a G-77 issue, but also
a developing country issue," he said, "We will see how best we can
also cooperate among ourselves."
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, cementing "the South-South cooperation" is
critical "because the cost of doing business with the North is
increasing," he said. "We will find new ways cooperating with the
North," which is well advanced in information and technology.
</P>
<P>
Historically, poorer nations in the Southern hemisphere have
traded with richer countries in the North, rather than with each
other.
</P>
<P>
To promote that cooperation, the G-77 is developing a
directory of projects in member countries that could be used by
other nations, he said. It will be updated annually.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Havana Summit is also expected to focus on ways
to strengthen the North-South cooperation because "the South can
not do without the North" in the world where interdependence is on
the rise, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the ties with China, also a developing country, he said
that G-77 has very close relations with China, Mbanefo said. "
China is taking the Summit very seriously."
</P>
<P>
On the G-77 role in the United Nations, he said that G-77
countries unite as one and speak in one voice in the U.N. affairs,
such as the scale of assessment and contributions.
</P>
<P>
"We are all involved in trying as much as possible to
coordinate the position among G-77 countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
The G-77, founded on June 15, 1964 by 77 developing countries,
is the largest Third World coalition in the United Nations and the
largest grouping in the South. It provides the means for the
developing world to articulate and promote its collective economic
and interests and enhance its joint negotiating capacity on all
major international economic issues in the United Nations system,
and promote economic and technical cooperation among developing
countries.

<HEADLINE> Simitis Plans to Reshuffle Cabinet After April Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 ATHENS, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis said Tuesday that he will reshuffle the cabinet if the
ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) wins the April 9
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Athens radio station "Flash," Simitis
said that there is a need for renewal of the present cabinet.
</P>
<P>
New faces are needed in his cabinet along with the older, more
experienced ones, he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier expressed his confidence once again that PASOK
will win the forthcoming elections, the 10th since the restoration
of democracy in Greece in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Simitis urged citizens not remain indifferent and to vote for
PASOK.
</P>
<P>
Although a total of 34 political parties have so far decided
to participate in the elections, it will take place mainly between
the ruling PASOK and the main opposition New Democracy (ND).
</P>
<P>
The results of recent nationwide polls show that the ruling
party-led by Simitis enjoys a slim lead over ND and is expected to
emerge victorious in the elections.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Agency Appeals for Food Aid to Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations World Food
Program (WFP) announced here Tuesday that it is urgently seeking
16 million U.S. dollars for a new operation to provide food aid to
350,000 people living in some 50 regroupment sites in Bujumbura
Rural, Burundi.
</P>
<P>
WFP has been providing food to regroupment sites in the area
since October 1999. However, a deteriorating nutritional situation
earlier this year prompted the agency to expand the operation to
ensure that more food reaches the hungry families in the ad-hoc
sites.
</P>
<P>
WFP said in a news release that food aid needs could grow, if
the June harvest in Bujumbura Rural fails because regrouped
populations have limited access to their land.
</P>
<P>
The agency's emergency operation to assist regrouped
populations in Bujumbura Rural will provide nearly 27,000 tons of
food over the next six months to 350,000 people, at a cost of just
over 16 million U.S. dollars, WFP said.
</P>
<P>
Last month, in addition to its emergency food distributions to
the regrouped, WFP distributed an additional 2,000 tons of food in
Bujumbura Rural to ensure that the families have enough food to
eat during the planting season and avoid the hunger-driven
temptation to consume the seeds needed for planting.
</P>
<P>
"We're doing everything possible to help families plant for the
next harvest, because if that fails, WFP will be faced with trying
to feed everyone through to next year," said Thomas Yanga, WFP's
representative for Burundi.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Northern Border Post Reopened for Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Angola has reopened its northern
border post Quimbata to facilitate trade between its people and
merchants from the neighboring Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC), informed sources said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The reopening of the border post followed an announcement made
by a military official last weekend saying that all the northern
boder areas are under the control of the government troops.
</P>
<P>
According to Afonso Cuca, government administrator of the
Maquela do Zombo district where Quimbata is located, the DRC
traders have been encouraged by the announcement and the
cross-border trade, which had been " interrupted for more than
three years due to the lack of security," is unregulated for the
time being.
</P>
<P>
Maquela do Zombo is the northernmost district of the Uige
Province and is located about 400 kilometers northeast of the
Angolan capital Luanda.
</P>
<P>
The local government is going to hold a "high-level meeting"
with the DRC authorities to "discipline border trade", Cuca said.
</P>
<P>
"The food and health situation of civilians in Maquela do Zombo
will be improved substantially," the administrator said, adding
that the area is still cut off from humanitarian aid provided by
the Angolan government and non-governmental organizations, as
roads leading south to the Uige city are either mined or seriously
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
In the past year, the Uige Province has been the site of
numerous battles between the Angolan government troops and the
rebel soldiers of the National Union for the Total Independence of
Angola (UNITA) led by Jonas Savimbi.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Optimistic Over IMF Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
said on Tuesday that Kenya would hopefully have access to funds
provided by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) in the very near future.
</P>
<P>
"Over the next few months, I hope that we will reach an
agreement with our development partners for economic assistance in
various areas," he said at the opening of the Fourth Session of
the Eighth Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government is engaged in the final round of talks
with the World Bank and the IMF, whose funds would enable Kenya to
tackle more effectively the problems of poverty and low rates of
economic growth, said Moi.
</P>
<P>
The president appealed to Kenyan politicians to unite to combat
poverty and unemployment instead of politicizing it.
</P>
<P>
"No one should exploit the sufferings of those who are poor to
gain political mileage," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Moi, the unemployment situation in the East
African country had worsened and the incidence of poverty in the
rural areas increased over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
He pledged to create a leaner, more efficient government that
is conducive to economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The issue of corruption is a major concern and the government
would soon introduce far-reaching measures to control the conduct
of public officers, he said.
</P>
<P>
He assured that his government is fully committed to
transparency and accountability.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Employment in Non-Agricultural Sector Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Total employment in South
Africa's non-agricultural business sector fell by 2.5 percent in
December 1999 over a year ago, official statistics released on
Tuesday show.
</P>
<P>
On a quarter-on-quarter basis, the formal non-agricultural
business sector had shed 43,280 jobs in the fourth quarter of
1999. At the end of December 1999 there were 4.792 million people
employed in this sector, according to Statistics South Africa's
(SSA) quarterly Survey of Total Employment and Earnings (STEE).
</P>
<P>
The jobs were shed mainly in the community, social and personal
services industry which includes the government sector, the mining
and quarrying industry and the manufacturing industry, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, there were several employment sectors such as
agriculture, restaurants and bars, non-banking financial
institutions, real estate and business services which were
excluded from the STEE. Jobs could have been found or created in
sectors not covered by the survey.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Droughts Send Thousands of Somalis out for Living </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of families in
Somalia's border regions with Ethiopia are leaving their native
villages to the main towns in search of food and water after the
continuous droughts have deprived their herds and farms.
</P>
<P>
According to local authorities, eight children have died of
hunger or related disease such as tuberculosis and diarrhea since
Monday in Huddor district alone.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Moallim Meris, district commissioner of Huddor town,
told the reporter that the arrivals of the destitute families are
now adding to the burden on Huddor town where the
engine-water-pumped well is still functioning.
</P>
<P>
He said that several villages have been deserted after their
motorized water wells were destroyed by the civil war and the
hand-dug shallow water wells dried up owing to persisting
droughts.
</P>
<P>
There are quite a large number of people and herds dying of
starvation and famine in the remote villages and countryside, the
commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
"There are also entire families who are missing after they left
their villages and could not probably make it to the towns," said
Meris, who characterized the situation as desperate and the worst
experience they have ever seen since the Daba-Dher in the country
in 1974.
</P>
<P>
There has been no enough response from the international aid
agencies, the business community in Huddor town Monday provide
food and shelter for hundreds of people scattered in the town.
</P>
<P>
The women organization of the town, in collaboration with the
business community, were also collecting donations for the
starving people.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone paid what he could, some have offered money, others
dry food, but still some more have offered cooked meals," said
Hajiyoh Owliyoh Mohamed Yarow, a well-known old lady who advocates
for the women and children.
</P>
<P>
The women group, headed by Yarow, organized a large rally in
which people worshipped to God to alleviate them the droughts and
bring about peace and rains for the subsistence farmers and
herdsmen who dominate the region.
</P>
<P>
Similar difficulties are also being reported in the neighboring
regions of Bay and Gedo where the communities are mainly nomads
and subsistence farmers.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, rains are being expected in 30 days at most and
some of the farmers, especially those who could afford, have
already begun preparing their lands for the coming season.
</P>
<P>
However, the majority of the farmers are far behind the ability
to prepare for farming after they have been displaced by the
droughts.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Cabinet Okays Establishment of Regional Computer Programming Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti cabinet has
approved an agreement to establish a regional computer programming
center here, said a cabinet official Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The center, co-financed by the Arab Fund for Economic and Social
Development and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), aims
to expand Kuwait's role in making computer programs, Minister of
Education and Higher Education Youssef Hamad Al-Ibrahim told a news
briefing.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ibrahim said Kuwait signed the agreement on setting up the
center in December 1991, but he didn't mention why the cabinet had
delayed its approval for so long.
</P>
<P>
The center will be established in the Kuwait Institute for
Scientific Researches (KISR), the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It is considered as the second of its kind in the Middle East
region, as there is a similar one set up in Egypt in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the Arab Fund and the UNDP have allocated
5 million Kuwaiti dinars (16.5 million U.S. dollars) to finance the
center's work in the first five years, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he added, the Kuwaiti cabinet decided at its Sunday's
meeting to set aside 100,000 Kuwaiti dinars (330,000 dollars) to
facilitate the building of the center and 30,000 dinars (99,000
dollars) for its annual operation and maintenance.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Encourages Logistics Outsourcing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government has
mounted an effort to encourage companies to move toward logistics
outsourcing by introducing an IT Action Plan for the logistics
industry.
</P>
<P>
The three-year plan, launched Tuesday by Minister of State for
Trade and Industry and Communications &AMP; Information Technology Lim
Swee Say, provides a framework for the adoption and deployment of
IT and e-commerce technologies across the transport and logistics
industry to achieve intra-company integration, inter-company
connectivity and international linkage.
</P>
<P>
The plan comprises eight key programs spanning areas such as
integrated inventory management, development of track and trace
capabilities, integration of work flow and supply chain activities,
optimization of logistics planning and modeling and development of
e-commerce portals.
</P>
<P>
Lim told the opening ceremony of Logistics Asia 2000 &AMP;
Manufacturing Solution seminar that the logistics industry
currently contributes more than seven percent of GDP in Singapore
and against the bedrock of e-commerce and e-business a steady
trend towards logistics outsourcing has presented tremendous
growth opportunities to the logistics industry.
</P>
<P>
"Undoubtedly, e-logistics will be the industry's next frontier,
" he stressed, adding that the government will encourage Singapore-
based logistics companies to harness technology, and re-strategize
and reposition themselves.
</P>
<P>
The IT Action Plan, formulated by Singapore's Info-
Communications Development Authority and Trade Development Board
in close collaboration with various agencies, is supported by a
budget of 20 million Singapore dollars (12 million U.S. dollars)
through various government funding schemes.

DHAKA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina Tuesday laid emphasis on exporting non-traditional items to
boost the country's export earnings.
</P>
<P>
Presiding over a meeting of the National Committee on Export,
Hasina urged the entrepreneurs to look for new exportables and

She called for diversification of jute products and exporting
quality products to fetch foreign markets. She also stressed the
need for exports of poultry.
</P>

She urged the entrepreneurs at the private sector to set up
institutions for software industries, noting that her government
has given a number of incentives for this thrust sector.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Commerce Minister Abdul Jalil said export earnings
from July to February during the current fiscal year (1999-2000)
stood at 3.695 billion U.S. dollars, a 9.88 percent increase over

</P>
<P>
But the figure is still 3.40 percent short of the target fixed

Tennessee and dragged it into Georgia.

There are no signal lights or bars at the railroad crossing,

The reports quoted witnesses as saying that the weather was
mostly clear, although there were a few sprinkles at the time of

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Speeds up Infrastructure Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia is making great
effort to improve infrastructures in the capital Addis Ababa and
other regional towns under a five-year construction plan adopted
in 1996, a senior official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Addis Ababa administration has invested more than 600
million birr (about 75 million U.S. dollars) in road and power
constructions in the city, Minister of Works and Urban Development
Haile Asegide told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Of the total investment, about 459 million birr (67.25 million
dollars) are being used in the construction of Addis Ababa ring
road, he said.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the 33.49-kilometer Addis Ababa ring road
kicked off on March 26, 1998. The majority part of the road is due
to be operational at the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
By the time the ring road project completes, the traffic
problem in the capital will be eased remarkably, he said.
</P>
<P>
Haile attached importance to the role of private sector in
speeding up infrastructural construction in the country, with
nearly 1,100 private contractors getting involved in various
projects.
</P>
<P>
Haile also spoke highly of China's involvement in Ethiopia's
economic construction.
</P>
<P>
Two Chinese companies, China Road and Bridge Corp and China
Wanbao Engineering Corp, are doing 50 percent of Ethiopia's road
program. The latter is also undertaking two power projects in
Tisabay and Fincha, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We feel that they are doing quality work," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Tisabay is some 580 kilometers northwest of Addis Ababa while
Fincha is about 200 kilometers west of the capital.
</P>
<P>
Referring to future economic cooperation between China and
Ethiopia, Haile said Ethiopia has a lot to learn from China,
especially in the fields of housing and transport.

ADDIS ABABA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Virgin forest in the Bale and
Borena regions in southern Ethiopia has been seriously destroyed
by bush fires, a local newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
More than 500-year-old trees as well as coffee and bamboo trees

<P>
In addition, the bush fire has greatly reduced the number of
the animals in the fire-affected regions, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to early reports, of the 580,000 hectares of forest
in Bale and Borena regions, 70,000 hectares have been burned to
ashes.

<HEADLINE> Putin Extends Russian Defense Minister's Office Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian President-Elect Vladimir
Putin has ordered Igor Sergeyev to stay in the post of defense
minister for the next term, one year, beginning April 2000, said
Putin's Press Secretary Alexei Gromov on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to Russia's law on "Military Duty and Military
Service," marshals, army generals and colonel generals, officers
can serve in the military until they are 65 years of age.
</P>
<P>
However, after a top military commander reaches the age of 60,
the Russian president, who is also the commander-in-chief of the
armed forces, must extend the term of service annually if he
decides to keep him in the military. Igor Sergeyev will be 62 on
April 20.
</P>
<P>
His term of service has been extended twice by Former Russian
President Boris Yeltsin in 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
Also on Tuesday, Sergeyev informed Putin of the federal forces'
plans in Chechnya in carrying out the anti-terrorist operation and
assisting the families of the servicemen killed in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said that "in the most dramatic period from March 20-
27," federal troops ensured security during the presidential
election and prevented rebel attempts to foil voting.
</P>
<P>
The federal forces are now carrying out a search and
reconnaissance operation in the mountains, he said. Sergeyev said
that Putin also discussed the financing of the Black Sea Fleet and
the situation in Kosovo with him.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 28 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin
said Tuesday that the newly formed Socialist government will
continue to cut taxes for people of all social walks.
</P>
<P>
While answering questions at the National Assembly, Jospin said
the government will effectively pursue the policy of tax cutting
while trying to make it benefit "all categories of the population.
"
</P>
<P>
He announced earlier this month a reduction of 40 billion
francs (about 6 billion U.S. dollars) in taxes this year and
cutting more taxes in 2001 and 2002.
</P>
<P>
Jospin nominated Laurent Fabius, a former Socialist prime
minister widely considered as liberal, as Minister of Economy,
Finance and Industry on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the reshuffle of the government, in which four
ministers were sacked, does not mean a change of government.
</P>
<P>
"The great priorities (of the government) remain the same:
growth and the fight against unemployment," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the newly formed government will help "
amplify the movement of reforms" of the state administration.

<P>
MOSCOW, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian President-Elect Vladimir
Putin will not reshuffle the cabinet before his inauguration,
which is scheduled for early May, Russian First Deputy Prime
Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Putin has asked the cabinet ministers "not to worry and not to
let their attention wander from their every-day duties," Kasyanov
told reporters after his meeting with Putin in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
"More than a month remains before the inauguration. Every
effort must be made to fulfill the tasks set, particularly in
economic and social spheres," Kasyanov quoted Putin as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said he and Putin discussed Russia's current economic
situation and the implementation of the government budget in the
first quarter of 2000, both agreeing that the economic situation
is "not bad at all."
</P>
<P>
"Russia is observing the parameters of the credit and monetary
policy and the tax collection plan," said Kasyanov, adding that
Putin sees no necessity to change the composition of the cabinet
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed prospects for the second quarter, Kasyanov
said, and the plan for April is balanced enough to allow the
economy "to take small steps forward."

<HEADLINE> WTO Members Agree on Timetable for Agriculture Negotiations in First Phase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Members of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) have reached swift agreement on the timetable
for the first phase of new negotiations on further liberalizing
agriculture, the WTO said in a press release here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Following the first special session of WTO's agriculture
committee on March 23-24, WTO Director-General Mike Moore said
that the meeting was "constructive and businesslike" and reached
consensus swiftly.
</P>
<P>
According to the decisions made at the meeting, WTO members
will submit proposals setting out negotiating objectives by the
end of this year, with a little flexibility for those who cannot
meet that date or want to make additions. The committee will take
stock of the proposals in March, 2001, so they must have arrived
in time for all members to examine by that meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meetings in the first phase will take place in June,
September and November in 2000 and March 2001 with the possibility
of an extra meeting in January 2001.
</P>
<P>
"This is the WTO working at its best," said Moore, "The hard
bargaining still lies ahead, and I'm sure that will be much more
difficult. But the goodwill shown at this meeting is a good omen
for the future."
</P>
<P>
As members did not reach consensus about the chairperson of the
agriculture committee, the first meeting on March 23-24 was
chaired by Roger Farrell of New Zealand, chairman of the Goods
Council, to which the agriculture committee is a subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
"It's also clear that delegations have not allowed their
differences over picking a chairperson to obstruct the
negotiations," Moore added.
</P>
<P>
According to the WTO, General Council Chairman Kare Bryn and
Farrell are continuing consultations with member governments on a
chairperson for agriculture. Bryn has said that he hopes to have
an agreement by the next meeting on June 29 and 30.
</P>
<P>
The WTO secretariat has been asked to compile the factual
information on what's been happening in agriculture and the
effects of the current round of reductions in subsidies and
protection and has also assigned a set of tasks for the meeting in
June.

<TEXT>
<P>

Some audit bureau leaders of Binzhou in Hunan province
misappropriated public money to travel abroad in the name of

<HEADLINE> Scholars Optimistic about China's 7% Annual Growth Rate (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Delegates to the China
Development Forum today voiced their optimism over China's
achieving a seven percent annual growth rate in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Dwight Perkins from Harvard University described this
target as "encouraging." Although China is facing numerous
problems such as a surplus of goods and rising unemployment, the
target of seven percent annual growth is "realistic" so long as
China continues its reform, he said.
</P>
<P>
Perkins stressed the significance of China's entry into the
World Trade Organization (WTO), as the entry will pressure China
to deepen its reforms.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Lawrence Lau from Stanford University said he is less
optimistic over the seven percent annual growth rate. He praised
the policy of developing the west and the urbanization as "
directing the flow of capital." He also called for equal
development opportunities for medium and small enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Both professors, however, put forward suggestions that they
think are of paramount importance for China at the moment. One is
the establishment of an efficient and fair regulatory system; the
other is establishing corporate governors in enterprises to make
enterprises genuinely independent.

Li Shantong of the Development Research Center of the State
Council, agreed that only accelerated reform realize the seven
percent annual growth target.
</P>
<P>
"If economic restructuring has been successfully done, an even
higher growth rate might be possible," she said.
</P>
<P>
"China's fairly high savings rate, China's WTO entry and its
labor force will lend impetus to the economic development of China
in the next decade and after," she said.
</P>
<P>
Li's colleague, macro-economy expert Mi Jianguo, told reporters
that the macroeconomic indices of the first two months, including
the index for investment in fixed assets and the consumption index,
were healthy.
</P>
<P>
"China's economy is proceeding into a new period of stable
development," he said. However, how long this period will last
depends on if economic opportunities are fully realized, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mao Yushi, a distinguished Chinese economist, called for the
establishment of efficient capital market and legal system to help
transfer personal savings into investment. His remarks caused
quite a sensation at the Forum.

<P>
Tang said that the both sides have further strengthened mutual
understanding and cooperation on international issues and regard
one another as trusted friends.
</P>
<P>

policy to develop and improve friendly cooperation with Latin
American and Caribbean countries.

China is willing to join hands with those countries for long-
term stability and friendship and develop and promote a long
lasting partnership in the 21st century.

have made great progress in economic, trade and scientific
exchanges. The volume of trade between China and Latin America has
grown to nearly 8 billion U.S. dollars from less than 2.3 billion
U.S. dollars in 1990.

<HEADLINE> China to Celebrate Centennial Discovery of Dunhuang Caves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- China plans to celebrate the
centennial of the Dunhuang rock caves, exhibiting replicas of
stolen treasures for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Culture, Gansu provincial government and the
State Administration of Cultural Heritage (SACH) will organize
centennial celebrations in July. An international academic
symposium and a weekly tour of the Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang will
also be held.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing today, Li Zhong'an, Gansu's vice governor,
said that the celebrations will include a commemorative meeting,
relic exhibitions, art performances and tourist activities.
</P>
<P>
Dunhuang has 492 caves, with 45,000 square meters of frescos, 2,
415 painted statues and five wooden-structured caves. The Mogao
Grottoes contain priceless paintings, sculptures, some 50,000
Buddhist scriptures, historical documents, textiles, and other
relics that first stunned the world in the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
The Mogao Grottoes were listed on the World Heritage List in
1987. More than 200 scholars from abroad will take part in the
celebrations in July.

<P>
Many pavilions, towers, temples, pagodas, palaces, courtyards,
towns and bridges in the murals provide valuable materials for the
study of Chinese architecture. Other paintings depict Chinese and
foreign musical performances, dancing and acrobatics.
</P>
<P>
The "Cave for Preserving Scriptures", was discovered by a
Taoist monk Wang Yuanlu in 1900. The cave contains more than 50,
000 sutras, documents and paintings covering a period from the 4th
to the 11th centuries. It was one of China's most significant
archaeological finds. These precious relics are of great
historical and scientific value.
</P>
<P>
In 1961 the Grottoes were listed by the State Council as one of
China's key historical and cultural sites. Repairs were carried
out from 1963 to 1965.
</P>
<P>
Between 1906 and 1919 the Dunhuang grottoes was looted. Much of
the Hand-copied ancient books, manuscripts, literary works,
Buddhist and secular decorative art works, and ancient manuscripts
were removed by Aurel Stein, Paul Pelliot, Sergei Feodorovich
Oldenburg and other archaeologists.
</P>
<P>
Chinese scholars such as Luo Zhenyu and Wang Guowei cultivated
the study of Dunhuang culture by publishing a number of books in
1910. The Dunhuang Art Academy was established by Chang Shuhong
later.

<HEADLINE> Israel Air Force F-16 Fighter Crashes, Pilots Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The pilot on the crashed Israel
Air Force (IAF) F-16D fighter Monday night was identified as Major
Yonatan Begin, grandson of late Prime Minister Menachem Begin,
Israel Radio reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Naval vessels and Air Force helicopters are continuing combing
the presumed water area of the crash. They believed the debris of
the plane might lie at the seabed as deep as several hundred meters
below the surface, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Several pieces of wreckage had been found and were being
examined by search teams. However, Major General Eitan Ben Eliahu,
commander of IAF, stated that it was too early at this stage of the
search to make a definitive identification.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year-old married airman with a daughter is grandson of
Menahem Begin, who was Israel's prime minister from 1977 to 1983
and won a Nobel Peace prize for signing a historic peace treaty
with Egypt in 1979. Begin died in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Yonatan's father Benny Begin was a former Knesset (parliament)
member and held a post in Benjamin Netanyahu's government from 1996
to 1999.
</P>
<P>
Yonatan and his co-pilot Lieutenant Lior Harari, 23, took off
from the force base in Ramat David Monday night for a routine
training flight in the two-seater warplane.
</P>
<P>
About 8 p.m. local time (GMT1800), the plane lost contacts with
the control tower and disappeared from the radar screen about 20
kilometers off the coast of Atlit, a town 70 kilometers north of
Tel Aviv. As such it is believed that the plane had plunged into
the Mediterranean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Emergency procedures were immediately implemented and navy and
air force search teams carried out an extensive search to locate
the plane and its crew.
</P>
<P>
General Eliahu appointed a commission Monday night to
investigate the incident.
</P>
<P>
The last contact about 10-15 seconds prior to disappearance of
the place showed no problems on the jet and the weather conditions
and visibility were good at the time, according to air force
officials.
</P>
<P>
Apparently, something occurred too quickly for the crew to give
a report or gain control of the craft, and even leave no time for
the airmen to eject themselves from the aircraft, these officials
said.
</P>
<P>
They believed the plane might go into a tailspin and struck the
water at high speed, but it cannot be determined what took place
until the craft is located.
</P>
<P>
The incident was the latest in a series of crashes involving the
U.S.-made multi-purpose F-16 fighter jets in the IAF. They are also
the world's most prolific fighters. 
</P>
<P>
An F-16 crashed in the Negev desert on February 2 during a
routine training mission, apparently due to the failure of its
engine.
</P>
<P>
Israel has signed a deal with the U.S. earlier this year to
purchase 50 F-16 fighters with an option to buy a further 60. The
air force expected the ordered fighters to start their service as
of 2003.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Commits 400 Mln Dollars to Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Tuesday that the World Bank (WB) has committed 400 million U.S.
dollars to help the Philippines finance six development projects
within the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Socio-economic Planning Secretary Felipe Medalla told reporters
that the loan-commitment was part of the results of the country's
programming discussions with the WB.
</P>
<P>
Medalla said these projects, aimed at reducing the country's
poverty, are in various stages of preparation and will be firmed
up in next year's programming discussion.
</P>
<P>
He said consensus on the priority projects proposed for WB
assistance was facilitated by using the Medium Term Philippine
Development Plan 1999-2004 and the WB Country Assistance Strategy
as the guiding framework.
</P>
<P>
This would ensure that programs and projects are supportive of
government development priorities and the WB's priority areas of
assistance in the country, said Medalla.
</P>
<P>
WB Country Director Vinay Bhargaya said the amount of 400
million dollars that would be provided to the Philippines were
only for the highest priority projects intended to reduce poverty
and increase growth.
</P>
<P>
Bhargaya said the WB would consider lending up to 1.2 billion
dollars in the next two fiscal years up to June 2002 should the
government use it and if the portfolio and macroeconomic
performance remain satisfactory.

<HEADLINE> WFP Appeals for Aid to Flood Victims in Madagascar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. World Food Program (WFP)
Tuesday launched an international appeal for five million U.S.
dollars to help feed tens of thousands of people affected by
floods in Madagascar.
</P>
<P>
WFP seeks to provide emergency food rations to an estimated
129,000 people for the next four months to help them rebuild
their lives, the agency said in a news release reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The appeal includes 1.9 million dollars to support the airlift
 operations which remain crucial to bringing food to many towns
and rural communities still isolated because of flood waters,
said WFP.
</P>
<P>
WFP said that floods, devastated the Indian Ocean island of
Madagascar in mid February and early March, have contributed to
the death of some 200 people and damaged tens of thousand of
homes.
</P>
<P>
The floods also destroyed rice farms and granaries, fruit trees
and cash crops, leaving families with only a few days of food
stocks. In northeastern Madagascar, farmers in one of the largest
rice-growing districts lost almost 80 percent of their
production.
</P>
<P>
Five days after the tropical storm struck Madagascar, WFP
launched an airlift to deliver a one-month supply of food aid to
more than 20,000 people affected by the floods in northeast and
east of the country.
</P>
<P>
According to government estimates, half a million people have
been affected by the floods which washed away roads and bridges,
cutting off at least 40 towns and rural communities.

<HEADLINE> CIS Joint Command-Staff Exercises Start in Tajikistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 28 (Xinhua) -- A CIS (Commonwealth of Independent
States) joint command and staff exercise called "Southern Shield-
2000" started in Tajikistan on Tuesday, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The maneuver involves large army and security forces from
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistank, and
operational groups from the U.S. and Belarussian defense
ministries, said Russian Lieutenant-General Leonid Maltsev,
commander of the exercise and also deputy chief of the CIS
military cooperation staff.
</P>
<P>
During a news conference in the Tajik capital of Dushanbe,
Maltsev said the exercise will continue until April 6 and is aimed
at perfecting coordination in security operations and in combating
terrorist groups in the Central Asian region.
</P>
<P>
"The exercises are an answer to potentially real developments
in the situation in the region, in particular, to last year's
invasion of Kyrgyzstan by bandits that took hostages," said
Maltsev.
</P>
<P>
Along with a plan of action in an imaginary counter-terrorist
operation, the participating states will conduct a teamwork drill
complete with a live-fire practice at training grounds in
Tajikistan and Uzbekistan on April 2-3, said the joint press
center from the exercise headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the CIS collective air defense system will join the
exercise on April 5-6 with over 60 air targets.
</P>
<P>
Maltsev said the military cooperation of CIS states "is based
on reciprocal interests of states, coincidence of their political
will, and in keeping with norms of international law."
</P>
<P>
He described the exercise as "a weighty contribution to the
prevention of expansion of international terrorism into Central
Asia."

<HEADLINE> France's New Minister Promises Reform of State Administration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Laurent Fabius, who was appointed
the Minister of Economy, Finance and Industry on Monday by French
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, said on Tuesday that he would start
the reform of state administration from his ministry.
</P>
<P>
"The state should know how to reform itself and the reform will
begin from this house," he said when taking over the ministry from
his predecessor, Christian Sautter, at the big compound of the
ministry by the Seine River in Bercy, southeast Paris.
</P>
<P>
Sautter resigned from his post after failing to reform the
fiscal services launched early this year, because of strong
opposition from trade unions.
</P>
<P>
Fabius, whose nomination was widely welcomed in France and
among international financial circles, said that France's economic
growth is making reform of state administration inevitable.
</P>
<P>
"There is first of all the growth without which nothing can be
done... But a lasting growth should allow one to foresee a number
of reforms in the years to come," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister is faced with two major tasks: cutting taxes
starting from next year as was announced by Jospin on March 27,
and reform of the fiscal administration.

<P>
STOCKHOLM, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Two cargo ships collided
Tuesday off the coast of the Southwestern Sea of Sweden, with five
people reported missing and one ship submerged.
</P>
<P>
A German container ship collided Tuesday morning with a smaller
Danish-owned ship near the city of Kullen due to poor visibility,
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The Danish-owned ship, flying a Liberian flag and carrying 600
tons of hydrochloric acid and 10 tons of its own fuel, sank
quickly into the sea after the collision, said Swedish and Danish
rescue officials.
</P>
<P>
Only slight damage was reported to the German ship, and its 13
crew members are safe, while seven Polish crew members aboard the
Danish-owned ship have been rescued from the water, they said.
</P>
<P>
Investigations are underway to determine whether there was a
leak of hydrochloric acid.
</P>
<P>
Sweden's environmentalists said the environmental pollution
caused by the leak of hydrochloric acid could be more serious than
that caused by the oil leak.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Sees Robust Growth in Exchange Fund in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Monetary
Authority (HKMA) said Tuesday that Hong Kong witnessed a fast
growth in the Exchange Fund last year, with an increase of over 10
percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive of the HKMA Joseph Yam said that at the end of
1999, Hong Kong's Exchange Fund had a total assets of 1,014.4
billion HK dollars (130.05 billion U.S. dollars), representing an
increase of 10.1 percent over a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
During the year, the accumulated surplus of the Exchange Fund
grew by 20.2 percent from 242.3 billion HK dollars (31.06 billion
U.S. dollars) at the end of December 1998 to 291.3 billion HK
dollars (37.34 billion U.S. dollars) at the end of December 1999.
</P>
<P>
Total investment income of the Exchange Fund was 104.8 billion
HK dollars (13.43 billion U.S. dollars), an increase of 11.2
percent over a year ago and which reflects high returns on the
Hong Kong equity portfolio in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Profits for the year, after deducting for the interest payable
on fiscal reserves placed with the Exchange Fund and other
expenses, was 49.0 billion HK dollars (6.28 billion U.S. dollars),
compared with 52.2 billion HK dollars (6.69 billion U.S. dollars)
reported last year.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the operating results of the Exchange Fund for
1999, Yam said the 20 percent increase in the accumulated surplus
was encouraging, particularly in a very difficult year when rising
interest rates resulted in volatile financial conditions.
</P>
<P>
Yam cautioned that financial markets in 2000 will be even more
difficult. "The momentum behind inflationary expectations appears
to be building as the continuing strength in the U.S. economy is
accompanied by cyclical recovery elsewhere in the world," he added.
</P>
<P>
Uncertainties over the magnitude of interest rate rises will
contribute to increased volatility in bond and equity markets, Yam
said.
</P>
<P>
The investment performance of the Exchange Fund in 2000 will no
doubt be affected, but the HKMA will remain vigilant to changing
market conditions in its prudent management of the Exchange Fund,
Yam concluded.

<HEADLINE> HK Customs Officers Smash Pirated Disc Factory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Customs officers have
smashed a pirated optical discs underground factory and a storage
center in Yuen Long in the New Territories.
</P>
<P>
The officers of the Hong Kong Intellectual Property
Investigation Bureau seized more than 520,000 pirated CDs and 215
staplers, worth about a total of 14.6 million HK dollars (1.87
million U.S. dollars), in a series of anti-piracy operations on
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Three men, aged between 38 and 43, were arrested in connection
with the two cases, the officers said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Copyright Ordinance, anyone found selling
pirated articles is liable to prosecution. The maximum penalty for
the offense is a fine of 50,000 HK dollars (6,410 U.S. dollars)
per disc plus four years' imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Anyone operating a CD factory without a valid license in Hong
Kong is in breach of the Prevention of Copyright Piracy Ordinance.
The maximum penalty for the offense is a fine of 1 million HK
dollars (128,205 U.S. dollars) and four years' imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Customs officers seized 16.5 million pirated optical
discs, worth 290 million HK dollars (37.18 million U.S. dollars),
and arrested 2,701 people.
</P>
<P>
In the first two months of this year, the officers seized 1.69
million pirated optical discs with a market value of 32 million HK
dollars, and arrested 544 people.
</P>
<P>
"Our on-going anti-piracy operations signify the determination
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government in the
protection of intellectual property rights here in Hong Kong," a
spokesman for the Customs and Excise stressed.

<HEADLINE> TB:Roundup: Macao SAR Takes on New Outlook (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since the founding of the SAR, police authorities have exerted
greater efforts in cracking down upon crimes while tightening
discipline among the police.
</P>
<P>
Edmund Ho Hau Wah, chief executive of the Macao SAR, also made
it clear earlier this month that the Macao SAR government
definitely would not allow organized gangs to win over the
monopoly of the gambling business in Macao and develop themselves
inside the business.
</P>
<P>
In the past three months, the number of serious criminal cases
has actually dropped. In comparison with the past, more criminal
cases have been cracked, often rather quickly. Most residents
share the feeling that public security has been greatly improved.
</P>
<P>
With regard to economic development, signs of booming have
emerged. According to figures released by the Statistics and
Census Services of the Macao SAR government, the consumer price
index for February rose 0.34 percent and the sluggish consumer
market seems to be revitalized.
</P>
<P>
In January, the volume of export reached 1.9 billion patacas (
237.5 million U.S. dollars), an increase of 22.4 percent over the
same month of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate has dropped from the highest level of 6.9
percent at the end of last year to 6.5 percent. More job
opportunities have made people see a more promising future.
</P>
<P>
Recently, two companies have removed their regional
headquarters from Hong Kong to Macao, and a foreign bank is
conducting talks with the Macao SAR government to set up a branch
here.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is the sector which is recovering the fastest. In
January this year, visitors to Macao in tour groups scored a sharp
increase of 38.7 percent over the comparable figure of last year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, business people in both Macao and the inland areas
of China are exploring great potentials of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"The new political, social and economic outlook demonstrates
that the newly-founded Macao SAR has great vitality, and the
notion of 'a better tomorrow' is coming true from mere expectation,
" said Tong Chi Kin, a senior member of the Macao Legislative
Council.

the service sectors increased in December 1999 compared with a
year earlier, according to the figures released Tuesday by the
Census and Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
The number of vacancies in almost all the economic sectors
surveyed registered double-digit increases in December 1999 over a

vacancies last December was most significant in the transport,
storage and communications sector, the figures showed.

For all the sectors surveyed taken together, there were around
28,550 vacancies in December, up considerably by 27 percent over a
year earlier. Of this total, 25,280 were in the private sector and
3,270 in the civil service.
</P>
<P>
The figures showed that the wholesale, retail and import and
export trades, restaurants and hotels sector and the financing,
insurance, real estate and business services sector recorded
relatively larger growth in employment.
</P>
<P>
Yet employment of manual workers at construction sites and
employment in the manufacturing sector decreased modestly.
</P>
<P>
In terms of employment size, the wholesale, retail and import
and export trades, restaurants and hotels sector remained the
largest, with 1,002,300 persons engaged in December 1999.
</P>
<P>
On a year-on-year comparison, the growth in employment in
December was most significant in the wholesale, retail and import
and export trades, restaurants and hotels sector, followed by the
financing, insurance, real estate and business services sector,
the community, social and personal services sector, and the
transport, storage and communications sector.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Dunhuang Mogao Grottoes (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Located in the northwest China's
Gansu Province, Dunhuang town was once an important cultural and
trade route along the Silk Road linking Central Asia with China.
</P>
<P>
Dunhuang attracts visitors mainly because it is contains some
of the most priceless of Buddhist art in the world-- the Mogao
Caves.
</P>
<P>
The Mogao Grottoes of Dunhuang, popularly known as the
Thousand Buddha Caves, were carved out of the rocks stretching for
about 1,600 meters along the eastern side of the Mingsha Hill, 25
km southeast of Dunhuang.
</P>
<P>
A Tang Dynasty inscription records that the first cave in the
Mogao Grottoes was made in 366 A.D. The United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) listed the Mogao
Grottoes on the World Heritage List in 1987.
</P>
<P>
Despite erosion and man-made destruction, the 492 caves are
well preserved, with frescoes covering an area of 45,000 square
metres, more than 2,000 colored sculptured figures and five wooden
eaves overhanging the caves.
</P>
<P>
According to archaeologists, it is the greatest and most
consummate repository of Buddhist art in the world.

<HEADLINE> TB:Roundup: Macao SAR Takes on New Outlook (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Macao Special Administrative
Region (SAR) of China has witnessed social stability, better
public security and signs of economic revitalization since it was
founded on December 20 last year.
</P>
<P>
In the past 100 days since Macao's return to the motherland,
the "return effect" can be seen everywhere. In fact, it is
believed to be the leading cause of the SAR's new outlook of
thriving.
</P>
<P>
"All people (in Macao), on our own initiative, are readjusting
the role we play now that we have truly become the masters of our
own fate," said Florinda da Rosa Silva Chan, secretary for
administration and justice of the Macao SAR government.
</P>
<P>
In government departments, the dilatory style of work is being
replaced by a faster tempo of life and higher efficiency, and
every person strives to contribute to the overall development of
the newly-founded SAR, Florinda said.
</P>
<P>
As soon as a policy was worked out, the SAR government would
receive streams of suggestions and comments put forward by local
residents as well as civil servants, she said.
</P>
<P>
In the past dozen days, Macao residents have been engaged in
heated discussions about the first government report of the Macao
SAR. Some newspapers have devoted whole pages to the advices and
comments from people of various social sectors.
</P>
<P>
Analysts noted that the residents of Macao have shown
unprecedented enthusiasm for participating in the affairs in the
SAR as such affairs tend to become rather open and accessible to
the public.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several years, poor public security has been a
headache affecting the normal life of the residents. What was
worse, it directly harmed tourism, one of the major economic
pillars of Macao.
</P>
<P>
As Portuguese rule of Macao was ending, there had been rampant
activities of gangs who scrambled for profits derived mainly from
the gambling business.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Parliamentary Election Results Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 28 (Xinhua) -- All 220 members of Iraq's new
National Assembly (parliament) have been chosen through the
elections on Monday, with President Saddam Hussein's eldest son
Uday getting the majority of votes, announced a senior Iraqi
official on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Among the 220 elected, 143 are from the ruling Socialist Arab
Baath Party, 23 are its supporters, and the other 55 are
independents, announced Justice Minister Shebib Lazim Al-Maliki.
</P>
<P>
Uday got more than 200,000 votes, the highest among the elected
members, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Among the 25 female candidates running for seats in the next
parliament, 18 got elected, Maliki said.
</P>
<P>
There are altogether 250 seats in the National Assembly, 30 of
which are allocated for the Kurds-populated areas in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
These 30 seats are directly decided by the president, said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
Some 88.6 percent of the eligible voters took part in the voting
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The elected members of the new National Assembly will hold a
meeting early next month to elect a speaker, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The voting was held on Monday to choose from a total of 512
candidates.
</P>
<P>
The country was divided into 54 constituencies, with each
consisting of a number of polling centers.
</P>
<P>
Elections were not held in the northern provinces where the
Kurds live. The United States and its Western allies set up two no-
fly zones in northern and southern Iraq allegedly to protect the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
Baghdad's persecution.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi election laws require that all candidates must defend the
constitution and believe in the principles of the July 17
Revolution of 1958 which established the republic.
</P>
<P>
Four parliamentary elections have been held in Iraq, with the
last one in March, 1996.

<P>
CAIRO, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- German tourism giant TUI will promote Turkish Magic
Life hotels owned by Gulet based in Vienna, Austria, as part of an
alliance between the two companies, reported the Anatolia News
Agency on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Cem Kinay and Oguz Serim, two Turkish entrepreneurs, set up
Gulet as a tour operator in 1987 and started hotel business with
the all-inclusive Magic Life chain in 1990.
</P>
<P>
A total of 18 hotels belong to the Magic Life hotels chain which
spreads throughout Turkey, Greece, Tunisia and Austria with 4,500
employees and an annual turnover of 500 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Following a calamitous year for the tourism sector in 1999,
Turkey has been campaigning in Europe for the past month and a half
to attract more European visitors.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Japan's International Cooperation Bank is lending 200
million dollars to Turkey, reported Turkish Daily News on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The loans will be used for assisting the re-establishment of
production and exportation capacity of small and medium-sized
companies in the Marmara region which was devastated by the August
17 quake last year and for compensating the losses suffered by
industrial complexes in the region.
</P>
<P>
The money will be delivered by the Turkish Industrial
Development Bank and Industrial Investment Bank in three years and
will be repaid in eight years.
</P>
<P>
ALGERIA -- Algerian export volume rose by 27 percent in 1999 to
11.9 billion dollars from 9.4 billion dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian economic daily Al Alam El Yom on Tuesday quoted a
report issued by the Algerian Cenrtral Bank as saying this increase
in the export volume is attributed to the rebound of oil prices in
the world market.
</P>
<P>
Oil and gas account for more than 90 percent of total exports in
Algeria.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT -- Khaled el-Sehly, chairman of the board of Development
and Investment Sahel Group, expected that Kuwaiti capital will
continue to flow into foreign markets due to the current economic
crisis in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Al Alam El Yom on Tuesday quoted el-Sehly as saying that huge
amounts of money took their way to the world and neighboring
markets as a result of the current economic recession and the
problems facing the Kuwaiti Stock Market, but he did not mention
any specific figures.
</P>
<P>
El-Shely said the emigrating Kuwaiti capitals are not the real
cause of the economic crisis, indicating that the main reasons
include the issue of privatization which drew about 1 billion
dollars from the markets.
</P>
<P>
SANAA -- Yemeni Minister of Planning and Development Ahmed
Mohammed Soufan said Yemen's economy grew by 4.5 percent in 1999
and is expected to further grow by about 5.5 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Al Alam El Yom quoted the Yemeni minister as saying that the
economic growth has become possible due to the economic reform
program launched in 1995, sponsored and supported by the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
He said the rate of inflation was 4 percent in 1999 against 10
percent in 1998, predicting that it will drop to 2 percent by the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The Jordanian government on Monday signed an agreement
with Japanese contracting company Sumoto to rebuild King Hussein
bridge, a key outlet of Jordan to Israel and Palestinian
territories, and the road leading to the bridge.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed in Tokyo by Jordanian Minister of
Public Works and Housing Hosni Abu Ghida and a representative of
Sumoto company. The project was valued at 13.58 million U.S.
dollars, Jordan's official news agency Petra said.
Abu Ghida was quoted as saying that Sumoto company presented the
lowest price, and the bridge will be accomplished by the end of
December this year.
</P>
<P>
The new King Hussein Bridge will contribute to developing
social, economic and tourist activities in the Middle East,
especially between Jordan and the Palestinians, the minister was
quoted by Petra as saying.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Police Recommend Netanyahu's Indictment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police recommended
Tuesday that former prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu be indicted
over corruption charges in a bribery and theft case.
</P>
<P>
Investigators recommended that Netanyahu be charged with
accepting a bribe, fraud, breach of trust and obstruction of
justice, the police said in a statement. His wife, Sarah, could be
charged with theft and attempted fraud.
</P>
<P>
It is up to the state attorney to decide whether to put the
Netanyahus on trial.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the indictment recommendation, Netanyahu's office
dismissed the allegations as baseless and accused police of acting
in bad faith.
</P>
<P>
The recommended criminal charges followed a seven-month
investigation on suspicions that Netanyahu and his wife had
illegally accepted free services from a private contractor and kept
official gifts after he left office last July.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the police said the contractor, Avner Amedi,
had not billed the couple for service in both his official and
private residences while he was in office and accepted instead a
promise that Netanyahu would ensure he receive proper compensation.
</P>
<P>
The police started the investigation last October after Amedi,
who realized that Netanyahu was no longer able to fulfill his
promise after leaving office, sent a bill worth 110,000 U.S.
dollars to the Prime Minister's Office for the services.
</P>
<P>
During the investigation, in which 100 people were questioned,
the police also found that Netanyahu had kept scores of valuable
gifts including paintings and silver and gold objects which he
received as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli laws, the gifts should have been handed
over to the state after Netanyahu left office in July, two months
after he was trounced by Ehud Barak in the national elections.
</P>
<P>
The police also recommended related charges be brought against
Moshe Leon, ex-director-general of the premier's office, and Ezra
Seidof, head of a services department in Netanyahu's bureau.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time in the last three years that the police
recommended criminal charges against Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the police recommended that Netanyahu be charged with
fraud and breach of trust for appointing a crony as attorney
general in an alleged attempt to influence a corruption
investigation against one of his political allies.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors dropped that case after failing to find sufficient
evidence to support the charges.
</P>
<P>
The investigation over Netanyahu was one of a series of scandals
facing Israeli politicians in the last several months.
</P>
<P>
After concluding investigation on President Ezer Weizman over
charges that he had accepted large sums of money from a French
businessman, police are currently probing Barak over campaign
financing and Transport Minister Yitzhak Mordechai over sexual
harassment charges.

SINGAPORE, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Share prices tumbled on weak
market sentiment following the sharp hike on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index finished 9.44 points lower at
2,207.63 points in moderate trading.
</P>
<P>
The total turnover contracted to 440.61 million units worth 642.
11 million Singapore dollars (about 374.43 million U.S. dollars).
Losers led gainers by 180 to 146 with 94 counters remaining
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
CEI, which manufactures mainly printed circuits boards, topped
the volume list as it registered a turnover of 36.30 million units.
It was followed by Goldtran which had 28.60 million shares done.
Kyosha was the next with 25.83 million counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Creative 50, the sound card maker, clinched the top gainer spot
as it rose by 40 cents to end at 64.00 Singapore dollars. Horizon
picked up 29 cents to finish at 3.26 Singapore dollars. C&AMP;C, a car
distributor, edged up 27 cents to close at 5.05 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
PacCent led losers of the day incurring a loss of 200 cents to
close to 25.70 Singapore dollars, reportedly due to its
cancellation of a plan to include a ferry terminal in its Cyber
Port project. SPH and SPH 100 sank 60 cents to finish at 28.80 and
28.70 Singapore dollars respectively. Venture retreated 50 cents
to end at 24.90 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the market took off on a firm note but soon
succumbed to selling pressure which hit property and banking
stocks.
</P>
<P>
Some dealers noted that Creative 50 were still going strong
prompted by foreign houses' further buy recommendation and the
key reasons for its continual good showing was investors'
confidence in the counter which has U.S. stake.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- A ranking Philippine police
official said Tuesday that some 6,000 anti-riot police will be
deployed in connection with the projected transport strike in
Metro Manila on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Reynaldo Wycoco, officer-in-charge of the Philippine National
Police (PNP), said all 14,000 policemen in Metro Manila have been
placed on red alert but only 6,000 will be deployed to contain
possible disturbance during the transport strike.
</P>
<P>
Wycoco appealed to rally participants to follow the law during
demonstrations. "We will tolerate the actions of the strikers only
within the bounds of the law," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Some transport sectors will stage a rally to protest the price
increase of gasoline and other fuel products.
</P>
<P>
PNP officials have held talks with rally leaders in the past
few days and told them to keep their lines or communications open
to ensure proper coordination.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has put all its military and police
forces all over the country on a high state of alert in
anticipation of possible attacks by New People's Army (NPA) rebels
during the observance of their 31st founding anniversary on

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 28 (Xinhua) -- President of the European Union
Commission Romano Prodi congratulated Vladimir Putin on his win in
the Russian presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement Tuesday, Prodi expressed his warmest
congratulations to Putin on his election victory as Russian
president and the broad popular support he received.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure that your presidency will give renewed momentum to
the democratic and economic transformation processes in Russia and
do believe that you will initiate economic policies that will lead
to growth and prosperity in Russia," said Prodi.
</P>
<P>
He said a European Union (EU) troika, consisting of some past,
present and future presidents of the 15-nation bloc, will visit
Moscow as soon as possible to show the EU's commitment to a
partnership with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said that a strong EU-Russian partnership requires a
permanent and open dialogue between the leadership of both sides.
</P>
<P>
Putin won 52.5 percent of the votes in the presidential
elections to beat arch-rival Gennadi Zyuganov who managed to gain
29.4 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said that he expected to meet Putin very soon during a EU-
Russia summit scheduled for May in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
However, he reiterated EU's concerns over the situation in
Chechnya, saying he hoped that progress could be made on this
highly sensitive issue in the "very near future."

<HEADLINE> Head of UK Nuclear Plant Doubts Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The head of Britain's troubled
Sellafield nuclear reprocessing plant Tuesday admitted its future
was in doubt.
</P>
<P>
Director Brian Watson said a series of safety scares and
scandals, culminating in an international attempt to close it down,
had jeopardized the plant's status.
</P>
<P>
"We recognize from events over the last few months that we have
moved into a situation of loss of confidence," he told BBC's radio
program.
</P>
<P>
"To be frank we are very open to look at any option, if that is
what we need to do to restore confidence in our activities."
</P>
<P>
His comments came after Irish Energy Minister Joe Jacob
revealed that the site could be forced to close within three
months.
</P>
<P>
It would call for reprocessing at the Cumbrian plant to be "
terminated immediately," said Jacob.
</P>
<P>
Denmark has written a similar proposal calling for the
suspension of the plant.
</P>
<P>
If either proposal gets the necessary backing from the 15
signatories of the Ospar (Oslo-Paris Commission), a group that
includes Britain and seeks to protect the marine environment of
the northeast Atlantic, who will meet in Copenhagen in June, the
British government would be legally bound to act.
</P>
<P>
Jacob said he believed the moves were the "beginning of the end
" for Sellafield, formerly known as Windscale.
</P>
<P>
Fears have been raised over the future of Sellafield's local
economy in the event of closure.
</P>
<P>
Police were investigating alleged sabotage at the plant after
equipment was deliberately damaged.
</P>
<P>
A report by the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII) in
February revealed safety records had been systematically falsified.
</P>
<P>
The operators of the plant are also being prosecuted over a
leak of concentrated nitric acid last March, which injured two
employees.

<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The German car maker BMW admitted
on Tuesday that its engagement with the British carmaker Rover was
a big failure, resulting in about 5 billion marks (2.4 billion
dollars) losses last year, the first heavy loss in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The takeover of Rover was a big mistake by the company, said
Joachim Milberg, the chief executive of BMW at a press conference.
The BMW had learned very important lessons from the failure how
mergers can have a paralyzing effect, he said.
</P>
<P>
But Milberg also pointed out that BMW had "created an
outstanding foundation for above-average profitable growth in the
future," saying that the company was now making a fresh start
after the decision to sell Rover to the British risk venture
company Alchemy.
</P>
<P>
According to Milberg, car sales of the BMW increased 4 percent
to 302,000 units in the first three months this year.
</P>
<P>
The BMW announced three weeks ago its withdraw out of Rover
which it took over in 1994, drawing heavy criticism from Britain.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Having failed to prod Syrian President Hafez Assad to soften
his stand on negotiations with Israel, the Clinton administration
will return the focus of Middle East peacemaking to the
Palestinians in an attempt to bring new pressure on the Syrian
leader, White House officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
-- With much of the world pleading for cheaper gasoline, OPEC
oil ministers meeting in Vienna Monday failed to reach agreement
on how much more oil they should produce to calm jittery world
markets and relieve worries in the West about a fresh burst of
inflation.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- After weeks of sinking ratings in the polls, French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin announced a shake-up in his cabinet Monday,
including appointing one of his main rivals, former Prime Minister
Laurent Fabius, to the important post of finance minister.
</P>
<P>
-- Vladimir V. Putin, on the day after his decisive electoral
victory, told his cabinet Monday that he wanted an economic
program ready by the time he is sworn in and appoints his new
government in early May.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton's South Asia trip produced
little progress in resolving the enmity between nuclear-armed
neighbors India and Pakistan, or in restarting Israel-Syria peace
talks. The lack of results raises the question of whether his
leverage is fading with 10 months left in office.
</P>
<P>
-- In the Internet's latest triumph on the Wall Street, Cisco
Systems surpassed Microsoft Monday to become the company with the
highest market value in the world, at 555.44 billion U.S. dollars,
as the networking-equipment maker's stock price rose.

<HEADLINE> China Must Find Its Own Development Path: Forum Participants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and overseas business
experts and executives gathered at the March 27-28 China
Development Forum said that China needs to find its own path of
economic development, rather than follow the models of other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Seiichi Kondo, deputy secretary-general of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), said that China
should learn a lesson from Japan's model of building global giant
corporations, which were very successful from the 1970s to the mid
1980s, but suffered major setbacks by "overlooking the global
trend."
</P>
<P>
Andrew Barsony, deputy director of the Center for Cooperation
with Non-Members of OECD, said that OECD respects the unique
situation of each member or non-member partner, and is committed
to offering development experience and suggestions to China in
accordance with its national conditions.
</P>
<P>
"The corporate reform of China's state-owned enterprises is a
good choice," he said.
</P>
<P>
China's large state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are at present
incapable of competing with the world's top multinational
corporations, concluded Peter Nolan, professor at Cambridge
University. However, many of China's numerous small- and medium-
sized companies are more at home with international competition
because they are more flexible, less burdened with social
obligations, and enjoy a wealth of human resources, he said.
</P>
<P>
China's accession to the WTO will provide enormous
opportunities for these smaller businesses, and they should grasp
the benefits of the information revolution in order to sharpen
their competitive edge and gain a greater share of the
international market on the basis of what they already have.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Junkuo, senior research fellow at the Development
Research Center under China's State Council, agreed that some of
China's small- and medium-sized businesses are already equipped
with the capacity to compete in the world market, and that China
should also open internal competition with its accession to the
WTO. "Internal and foreign competition alike will build their
competitiveness in the world market," he said.

<HEADLINE> Dialogue Is Crucial in Resolving Sino-European Human Rights Differences (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Dialogue is the only correct way
in dealing with human rights differences between China and the
European Union, said Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan.
</P>
<P>
In his talks with Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini today,
Tang said that dialogue on human rights based on equality and
mutual respect between China and Italy has yielded positive
results since 1997. He hopes that Italy will continue to play an
active role in this respect.
</P>
<P>
Dini said the international community should recognize the
progress China has made in human rights, adding that Italy will
continue to advocate human rights dialogue with China.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, Tang said the elections in Taiwan were
just a regional election in China, noting that whoever is in power
can never alter the fact that Taiwan is part of Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
He highly praised Italy's adherence to the one China stance,
and said he hopes that Italy will keep a vigilant eye against
separatist activities that threaten to divide China.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government will continue to observe the one China
stance. Italy has no official relations with Taiwan and will not
seek such relations, Dini stressed.

<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Foreign delegates to the China
Development Forum (CDF) today said that China will keep its
promises and abide by the rules of the World Trade Organization (
WTO) after its becomes a member.
</P>
<P>
Maurice Greenberg, chairman of the board of directives of the
American International Group, said that "China belongs to WTO, and
with 20 percent of the world population, China must be a member of
WTO." Greenberg said that he is working hard to push the bilateral
deal between the United States and China through because "it is in
the interest of the world."
</P>
<P>
He believes that China's entry into the WTO will bring
opportunities and challenges, accelerate technology changes in
China, and finally help China's economy score a great leap-forward.
</P>
<P>
Seiichi Kondo, deputy secretary-general of the Paris-based
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, said that
entry into WTO will bring fierce competition. Many enterprises may
go bankrupt and unemployment may rise. "However, I am fully
confident that China will be responsible in carrying out its
promises," he said, adding that "I have met with many Chinese
leaders, and was impressed by their erudition and far-sightedness.
"
</P>
<P>
Prof. Peter Norlan from Cambridge University said that China's
entry into the WTO will help China to expand its markets, and take
advantage of information technology. It will also help China to
become increasingly more competitive on the international market.
</P>
<P>
Norlan pointed out in particular that the WTO entry will
benefit small and medium-sized enterprises. "They will enjoy equal
opportunities and embrace an era of major development."

China is entering its last phase in its effort to enter the

<HEADLINE> China Develops Eco-Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- China has made substantial
achievements in eco-agriculture in the past two decades, according
to a national conference on eco-farming.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the first day of the conference, the vice-minister
of agriculture, Zhang Baowen, said that in the early 1980s China
initiated experiments in eco-farming to deal with the situation of
deteriorating environment.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, several central government departments formed a
national leading group on eco-agriculture and set up 51 state-
level eco-agriculture pilot counties. Over six billion yuan has
been invested in the pilots counties, generating about 13.7
billion yuan. Local farmers have benefited a lot from the projects.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 49 percent of wheat straw has been used as
fertilizer by local farmers, an increase of 15 percent over that
before the pilot counties were launched. People in the 51 pilot
counties have also increased the use of aerial, liquid and solid
wastes.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, China has over 200 eco-agriculture experimental
counties appointed by government organizations in 30 provinces,
municipalities and ethnic autonomous regions.

Over the past two decades, China has established over 2,000
pilot areas for eco-agriculture in over 200 counties.
</P>
<P>
Substantial economic, environmental and social results have

<HEADLINE> Ministry Plans to Increase Assistance to University Students in Need </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Education recently
worked out a plan to increase subsidies to university and college
students from poor families to discourage them from dropping out
of school, according to a national education work conference held
in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Many university and college students can not afford school fees.
In recent years, local banks have begun granting student loans. As
of the end of last year, almost 10,000 students from 54 schools,
in eight pilot cities, had signed agreements on borrowing student
loans, totaling 400 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, officials from the Ministry urged to
further develop and improve student loans. More efforts should be
made to increase public awareness about policies and measures
concerning the loans.
</P>
<P>
Universities and colleges involved in the experiment are urged
to give greater priority and care to students from poor families.
A Student Loans Management Center will also be set up.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Finance Minister Shah A.
M.S. Kibria said here Tuesday that the government's pro-poor and
anti-corruption strategies and fiscal policies reflected its
commitments to good governance.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an opinion-sharing conference titled "Pre-Paris

<P>
The meeting was jointly sponsored by the Bangladesh government
and the World Bank to hear the views of the civil society leaders
on major development issues before the upcoming Paris meeting of
the Bangladesh development partners to be held on April 13-14.
</P>
<P>
Kibria said the government's commitment to good governance is
also reflected in reforms in legal framework for speedy delivery
of justice, strengthening law enforcement capacity, enhancing
people's participation in local self-government system, reforming
public administration institutions and improving service delivery.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister observed that major objective of these
efforts is to ensure high growth and enhance its poverty reducing
capacity.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Australia Wants to Question Denmark on Pork Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government plans
to question Denmark about whether it is subsidizing pork exports
to Australia, Agriculture Minister Warren Truss said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Australia's processed pork imports from Denmark have risen to
record levels in the last 12 months, soaring to 2.3 million
kilograms in February this year, from 75,649 kilograms in March
last year.
</P>
<P>
Truss said Australia was an attractive place to sell processed
pork, as prices here are among the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
"I have sought further details about the conditions under which
Danish producers are sending pork to Australia, and I have
requested that the issue be placed on the agenda for forthcoming
European Union (EU) discussions," Truss said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"If there is any question of Danish product coming into
Australia under specific export subsidies, I will be protesting
very strongly to both Denmark and the EU and looking at what
action the Australian industry can take," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said Australian pork exports were at record
levels, thanks to exponential growth in Singapore, making the
industry better able to cope with increased imports.
</P>
<P>
"From being worth next to nothing around a year ago, exports to
this competitive and discerning market (Singapore) are now worth
over 55 million Australian dollars (36.3 million U.S. dollars) a
year," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But we cannot sit back and think the job has been done," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The government was working towards further agricultural trade
reform, but real change could only happen in the longer term
through a new round of comprehensive negotiations, Truss added.

<HEADLINE> Manila Unfazed About Assassination Plot Against Estrada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
reassured the public Tuesday that there is no cause for alarm over
a reported plot to launch a "tactical offensive" against President
Joseph Estrada.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said that it is standard
procedure on the part of the president's security detail to
undertake tighter precautions if it receives such reports.
</P>
<P>
"We haven't seen anything unusually large. You take precautions,
but there's nothing unusually large about this," Zamora said in a
radio interview.
</P>
<P>
National Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre said in a separate
series of radio interviews that the reported slay plot against the
president is still an intelligence report subject to verification.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre also belied reports that the Philippine National Police
and Armed Forces of the Philippines are on "high alert" because of
the slay plot.
</P>
<P>
Rather, he said, the police and the military are on alert
against any attacks that may be perpetrated by the New People's
Army, which marks its 31st anniversary on March 29.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports indicated that a hit man belonging to the
country's leftist movement posing as a reporter of a newspaper
will attempt to take the life of the president, in a bid to
advance his group's cause and sow destabilization.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Senate Passes Augmented Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Senate Monday approved
the long- delayed year 2000 budget with significant augments which
also needs the House of Representatives' approval before becoming
law, the Post Express newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The approved budget bill totaled some 683 billion naira (6.83
billion U.S. dollars) as against the 470 billion naira (4.7
billion dollars) originally submitted by President Olusegun
Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
A breakdown of the sectorial allocation shows that the
country's power sector gets the lion's share of 57.23 billion
naira (572 million dollars), underscoring the importance the
Nigerian government has attached to improving its power supply.
</P>
<P>
Education places second with a 53.626 billion naira (536
million dollars) share, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The Senate said in a report passed with the bill that the
executive could still submit request for more funding through
supplementary appropriation bill if necessary, despite the hike.
</P>
<P>
The boost of the allocation was apparently made against the
background of the price soar on world oil market.
</P>
<P>
The Senate said in the report that it amended the budget bill
on a basis of a revenue from oil at 20 dollars per barrel as
against the 18 dollars per barrel benchmark in the original budget
bill.

<HEADLINE> 2,000-Year-Old Tomb Not Necessarily Imperial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- A 2,000-year-old tomb currently
being excavated in western Beijing may not necessarily be an
imperial tomb, as no evidence to this effect has been discovered
so far, according to one archeologist.
</P>
<P>
Wu Menglin, a renowned archeologist living in Beijing, said it
is too early to identify the tomb from the Western Han Dynasty (
206 B.C.- 24 A.D.) as an imperial one, or even one of a king,
since there is no convincing evidence such as written documents
and materials that could prove the identification of the buried.
Also, there were no gravestone epitaphs during the Western Han and
Eastern Han (25-220) dynasties.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists have unearthed a dozen wood poles believed to be
the frame of the tomb, and part of the outer coffin has also been
unearthed.
</P>
<P>
They said the tomb is smaller than expected with a north-to-
south length of 16 meters and an east-to-west width of 13 meters.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Cultural Heritage Administration began excavating
the tomb at the site near Laoshan in the Shijingshan District of
Beijing on February 24.
</P>
<P>
Grave robbers have tried many times to loot the tomb but
failed to get any precious item, according to the State
Administration of Cultural Heritage.

<HEADLINE> BOC Group's Restructuring in Full Swing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of Bank of
China (BOC) Group announced Tuesday that the group's restructuring
is now in full swing with its 12 member banks in Hong Kong to be
merged into a brand new gigantic bank.
</P>
<P>
"Restructuring would be our first and foremost task this year,"
Liu Jinbao, chief executive of the BOC's Hong Kong-Macao Regional
Office, told a press conference here when delivering a report on
the 1999 annual results of the group, which is the second largest
banking group in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In order to strive for further prodigious, speedy and promising
development, the existing structures, mechanism and management
modes of the group need to be improved, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
"This means not only simple organization merger and
restructuring, but also a comprehensive reform of the entire
management system and operation mechanism," Liu noted. "This would
mark a milestone of profound strategic significance in the history
of the Bank of China."
</P>
<P>
The restructuring objective is to transform the BOC Group into
a bank with more solid strength, strong foundation, more efficient
operation, more effective management systems, better quality
service and high profitability, he stressed. The group has more
than 400 banks and branches in Hong Kong and Macao.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, the group will concentrate on developing
electronic banking and electronic business in 2000, including the
Intown Virtual Credit Card, the first Internet card it launched
recently, and the iT's Internet Banking to be launched in July.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that amid the sluggish economic activity and fierce
competition in the banking sector, the operating income of the
bank group in 1999 reached 22.848 billion HK dollars (2.929
billion U.S. dollars) in 1999, growing by 8.27 percent, with
operating profit before provisions amounting to 16.853 billion HK
dollars (2.16 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, Liu said that due to the influence of the aftermath
effects of the Asian financial crisis, the group's non-performing
loans continued to increase and the subsequent provisions made in
1999 reached 11.075 billion HK dollars (1.419 billion U.S. dollars)
, increasing by 83.6 percent from 1998, and representing two
thirds of the profit before provisions.

<HEADLINE> Information Industry to Grow 20 Percent Yearly in Next Decade, Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Wu Jichuan, Chinese Minister of
Information Industry, said today at the China Development Forum
conference that China's information industry is expected to
maintain an annual growth rate of 20 percent over the next decade,
three times the projected growth rate of China's GDP for the same
period.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the information industry accounted only for 3.4
percent of China's total GDP, but contributed 10 percentage points
to GDP growth.
</P>
<P>
As the representative of new productivity, Wu said, information
technology and the Internet constitute a new growth point for the
national economy, and will also push forward the upgrading and
renovation of traditional products.
</P>
<P>
As China steps up the strategic restructuring of its economy,
information technology should be actively applied to every sector
and every industry, Wu proposed.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his belief that with the increasingly wide-spread
application of information technology and the development of e-
commerce, the information industry will become a major force
behind China's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Recent targets of the Ministry of Information Industry include
rejuvenating the sectors of electronic digital products,
communications, and software, as well as launching a campaign to
get the government, industries and households on-line.
</P>
<P>
Wu also stressed the importance and urgency of developing e-
commerce.
</P>
<P>
The number of China's Internet users has witnessed a growth
rate of one hundred percent every half year for the last two years,
while the use of the Internet has transferred from simple web-
surfing to e-commerce, he said. "We may say that China is on its
way to embracing the web economy."

Zhu said, expressing satisfaction over this.
</P>
<P>
Although China and Micronesia are far apart and have different
national conditions, they share many common interests in both
regional and international affairs, he said, noting they are both
developing countries of the Asia-Pacific region and shoulder the
common task of developing their economies and upgrading the lives
of their people.

<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- China's medicine industry will
maintain double-digit growth this year, with its annual profit
growth rate expected to reach 11 percent, according to a
nationwide survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the China Economic Situation

medicine manufacturers are optimistic about prospects for this
year, especially the first quarter, because of last year's high
growth rate for production and sales and profits.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the industry generated a total output value of 194.6
billion yuan, a sales value of 143.8 billion yuan, and a profit of
10.5 billion yuan, up 14.4, 14 and 26.5 percent from the previous

<HEADLINE> Australia's Public Universities Seek Private Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Australia's public universities
now received less government funding and were increasingly looking
to private sources, the head of the country's universities vice-
chancellors' committee said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee (AVCC) Executive
Director Stuart Hamilton said the committee had established a new
protocol to deal with the receipt and management of private gifts.
</P>
<P>
"Universities are very keen to do what they can to establish
fertile soil for the growth of greater private giving to Australia
's universities," Hamilton said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"With falling levels of government funding per student,
universities are hoping to encourage private benefactors, big and
small, to help bridge the gap needed to maintain the sector's
quality and reputation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hamilton said that most of the non-government money to the
universities came from the pockets of students, with the rest
coming from industry sources.
</P>
<P>
"However, consistent with recent government initiatives, we need
to gradually move the community towards being more receptive to
the idea of private giving to universities," he said, adding "
Hopefully this new protocol will encourage private benefactors to
come forward."

<HEADLINE> Mozambican President Reiterates Support for Peace in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano has reaffirmed his full support for the peace in Angola
and said his country will work for this end, according to
Tuesday's Angolan official newspaper Jornal de Angola.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican head of state made the remarks when meeting with
the delegation of the Fund of the Angolan President Eduardo dos
Santos (FESA) that was in Maputo for giving over 120 tons of
assorted goods to the flood-displaced Mozambican victims.
</P>
<P>
According to Chissano, Mozambique will continue to make effort
to promote peace in Angola, saying that the lack of peace in
Angola has been hindering an effective cooperation between the two
Portuguese-speaking African countries, respectively located in the
southwest and the southeast of the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Chissano expressed satisfaction at the assistance extended by
Angola to the victims of the ferocious floods which hazed the
southeast African country since February and affected some two
million people, stressing that the aid came from a country that is
also facing difficulties and humanitarian crisis due to the civil
war.
</P>
<P>
"We did not dare to make any direct contact with the Angolan
authorities asking for help as we know well the tremendous
difficulties facing the country", he said.
</P>
<P>
Chissano said that his country is in a situation of mourning
and sadness, but not in despair, adding that as soon as the
calamity is over, the people will mount effort to retrieve what
they have lost.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Warring Towns Laud President's Peace Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of war-ravaged Ife and
Modakeke communities in southern Nigeria Monday lauded President
Olusegun Obasanjo's mediation in the crisis, saying an end to the
age-long disagreement was in sight.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper Tuesday quoted
Orayemi Orafidiya, an Ife traditional ruler, as berating past
governments for their inability to end the crisis, while saying
Obasanjo's peace efforts were likely to achieve the desired peace.
</P>
<P>
He said that "now we have a president who has the courage to
speak the truth and we have a governor who can also speak the
truth no matter who is offended. No government either military or
civilian has ever done it this way."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the 27-member peace committee inaugurated by
Obasanjo "will have the opportunity to look at all cases. In the
past, there was nothing like that. We will accept any outcome of
the committee verdict."
</P>
<P>
Olaniyan Alawode, a traditional ruler of Modakeke, also
expressed the same feeling.
</P>
<P>
The violence between the two towns in the country's southern
Osun State first erupted on March 3 over a land ownership dispute
between two Yoruba communities, causing great casualty and
property damage.
</P>
<P>
President Obasanjo paid a visit to the two towns last week and
held talks with the leaders of the two communities.
</P>
<P>
The two towns of Ife and Modakeke were traditionally thought to
be the heartland of Yoruba, one of the three dominate
nationalities in the Africa' s most populous country. President
Obasanjo himself is a Yoruba.
</P>
<P>
The communities living in the two towns have a long-standing
rivalry over land ownership and political supremacy in the area
that has sporadically erupted into violence since 1997.

<HEADLINE> Growing Imports, Strong Pound Add Weight to UK's Deficit in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Surging consumer demand for
imports and the impact of a strong pound left Britain with its
biggest current account deficit last year in almost a decade,
according to the latest official figures.
</P>
<P>
Despite the strength of the service sector and Britain's
sizable earnings from its overseas assets, a 700-million-pound (1.
12 billion U.S. dollars) deficit in 1998 was turned into a 12.8-
billion-pound (20.39 billion dollars) shortfall last year, the
highest since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said Britain's economy
expanded 0.8 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, while the
annual growth rate was up from 2.9 percent to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Final domestic demand growth -- which the Bank of England has
already cited as a cause for concern -- in the year to the fourth
quarter was revised upwards from 4 percent to 4.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, there were some hints that the economy may be starting
to cool off, as higher interest rates in the autumn prompted
individuals to increase the proportion of their disposable incomes
saved rather than spend.
</P>
<P>
On the trade front, the ONS reported that Britain's deficit in
goods stood at 26.6 billion pounds (42.36 billion dollars) last
year, its highest on record. The shortfall was offset, however, by
traditional strength in invisible trade.
</P>
<P>
The surplus on services was worth more than 13 billion pounds (
20.70 billion dollars) and the surplus on investment income worth
almost 8 million pounds (12.74 million dollars), according to the
ONS.
</P>
<P>
An unexpectedly hefty 3-billion-pound (4.78 billion dollars)
surplus on investment income in the last few months of the year
meant that the overall deficit of 2.8 billion pounds (4.50 billion
dollars) in the fourth quarter was 1 billion pounds (1.59 billion
dollars) less than most analysts had been braced for.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts stressed that the flows were very erratic and
could not be relied upon to continue at the current rate.

NATO vehicles through the northern Greek port of Thessaloniki on
their way to the Yugoslav province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Chanting anti-NATO slogans, protesters started to spray paints

On March 19 and 20, nearly 3,000 NATO troops, along with
military vehicles, passed through the Thessaloniki port on their
way to Kosovo for the participating in a military exercise,
codenamed the Dynamic Response 2000.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Two Missing Following Israeli F-16 Fighter Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The pilot and navigator of an
Israel Air Force (IAF) F-16 fighter are still missing till Tuesday
morning after their plane crashed into the sea Monday night, an IAF
report said.
</P>
<P>
The two airmen left their air force base in Ramat David for a
routine training flight with the two-seater warplane. About 8 p.m.
local time (GMT 1800) Monday night, the plane lost contacts with
the control tower.
</P>
<P>
As the site where it disappeared from the radar screen is about
20 kilometers off the coast of Atlit, a coastal town nearly 70
kilometers north of Tel Aviv, it is believed that the plane had
plunged into the Mediterranean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Emergency procedures were immediately implemented with navy
vessels and air force helicopters carrying out an extensive search
in the presumed area of the crash.
</P>
<P>
By Tuesday morning, no debris had been found. Although chances
are slim for finding the two alive, search teams have been
continuing efforts to locate the plane and the crew.
</P>
<P>
Major General Eitan Ben Eliahu, commander of IAF, Monday night
appointed a commission to investigate the accident, which remains a
mystery according to air force officials.
</P>
<P>
The disappearance was not preceded by any radio transmissions
indicating problems on board. All attempts to contact the plane's
crew failed.
</P>
<P>
Apparently, the airmen failed to eject themselves from the
aircraft for unknown reasons, some air force sources said, adding
that the plane might go into a tailspin and struck the water at
high speed. Anyway, it cannot be determined what took place until
the craft is located.
</P>
<P>
The incident was the latest one in a series of crashes involving
IAF F-16 fighter jets. 
</P>
<P>
A F-16 crashed in the Negev desert on February 2 during a
routine training session, apparently due to engine failure.
</P>
<P>
Israel has signed a deal with the United States earlier this
year to purchase 50 F-16 fighters with an option to buy a further
60. The air force expected the 110 F-16 aircraft to enter service
as of 2003.

<HEADLINE> Australian Govt Unveils Welfare Reform Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Australia's welfare recipients
will be expected to do more to earn their benefits and payments
will be more tightly targeted under a draft report released by the
federal government Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited recommendations of the government-appointed
Welfare Reform Reference Group set out broad directions rather
than specific recommendations.
</P>
<P>
But at its heart lay an extension of Prime Minister John Howard
's idea of mutual obligation, whereby welfare recipients are
required to participate in work or education programs, or risk
cuts to benefits.
</P>
<P>
The report also stressed the importance of a simpler welfare
system and paves the way for a change of the current system of
pensions and allowances into a single benefit for working-age
people.
</P>
<P>
The reform group's draft, however, also noted the difficulties
involved in such a change given the size and complexity of the
country's welfare system.
</P>
<P>
"It would be either very costly or leave large numbers of (
mostly pension) recipients worse off," the report noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the welfare group noted a blowout in the cost and
extent of the social security.
</P>
<P>
The draft called for spreading the cost of welfare delivery
between government, business and the not-for-profit sector, and
better incentives to encourage those on benefits to take up work.
</P>
<P>
The report did not, however, outline specific measures to curb
growth in the number of the country's Disability Support Pension
recipients and sole parents of school-age children on benefits -
two groups that were in its sights.
</P>
<P>
The reform group's final report is due by the end of June this
year.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Tourism Eyes Young Japanese Women Travelers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest
economic and financial city, has targeted young and single
Japanese women for its latest tourism promotion campaign.
</P>
<P>
According to an ongoing tourism working conference, Shanghai's
tourism department conducted a survey on Japanese travelers going
abroad and found that single women between the ages of 20 and 30
are the most active travelers in Japan.
</P>
<P>
Cultivating this potential customer resource should become a
top priority for Shanghai tourism, those attending the conference
agreed.
</P>
<P>
Japan is Shanghai's biggest tourism market, and since 1984,
Japanese visitors to Shanghai have consistently made up 40 percent
of foreign tourists to the city.
</P>
<P>
But the number of Japanese visitors to Shanghai dropped to 509,
000 in 1998 from 600,000 in 1997 due to the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the number dropped further to 500,000, causing local
tourism officials to seek new ways of promoting the industry.
</P>
<P>
According to sources with the meeting, the local tourism
department decided this year to carry out promotion activities
aimed at young and single Japanese women.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Shanghai's tourism industry recovered last
year with the number of tourists increasing to a record 1,656,800,
up 8.49 percent compared with the 1998 figure.

Sun told today's press conference that Berger, as a guest of
the Chinese government, is expected to arrive in Beijing tonight,
and during Berger's stay here, senior Chinese leaders will meet
with him, and Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan will hold talks with
him on Sino-U.S. relations and other issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question concerning some countries' intention to
invite Chen Shui-bian, who recently won the election in Taiwan,
for a visit, Sun said that the Chinese government firmly opposes
any form of official contact with Taiwan by any country which has
established diplomatic relations with China.
</P>
<P>
He said that adhering to the one China policy is of vital
importance to the healthy development of relations between China
and any other country.
</P>
<P>
He noted countries concerned have made solemn international
commitments to the Chinese government on the Taiwan issue, and "we
ask them to adhere to the one China principle with practical
actions and observe the commitments they have made to the Chinese
side."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reiterated that there is but one China in the
world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
This is a fact that has been recognized by the international
community, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Sun also said that the Chinese government and people firmly
oppose Lee Teng-hui's splittist activities during his visit to
other countries in any capacity after he stepped down as the
chairman of Kuomintang and leader of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
This is because that Lee has long engaged in activities to
damage the relations between China and other countries and to
split the motherland.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States' attempt to
attack China on its human rights record at the upcoming UN Human
Rights Commission conference in Geneva is doomed to fail just as
it did before.
</P>
<P>
Such attempts have failed many times, said Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi at a regular press conference here
this afternoon when answering a question on the anti-China motion
the United States is expected to put forward at the commission
conference.
</P>
<P>
Rather than attack China, the United States should seriously
review its own human rights record, "which is really bad in some
aspects," Sun said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Unites States has used double standards on
the human rights issue.
</P>
<P>
The UN Human Rights Commission conference should be a forum for
countries to make discussions and dialogue on an equal footing
rather than the site for political confrontation or for some
countries' domestic political struggle between different parties,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Sun urged the U.S. side to give up being confrontational and
return to dialogue with China on the human rights issue.
</P>
<P>
On the China tour of Samuel Berger, U.S. President Bill Clinton
's Adviser for National Security Affairs, Sun said that Samuel
Berger is due in Beijing tonight for discussions with senior
Chinese officials on Sino-U.S. relations and other issues of
common concern.

<HEADLINE> Ministry Calls for Reform of Memorial Rites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Civil Affairs has
urged the reform of funeral and memorial services on eve of the
upcoming Qingming Festival in early April, the traditional Chinese
festival for remembering and tending to the graves of deceased
relatives.
</P>
<P>
The ministry published a circular recently asking localities to
advocate new burial methods, such as planting a memorial tree
along with the ashes of the dead and other methods that help save
land.
</P>
<P>
According to the circular, various kinds of publicity efforts
should be made to boost reforms of funeral and memorial services
during Qingming, also known as Tomb-Sweeping Day which falls on
April 4 this year. Community organizations for weddings and
funerals should be mobilized to enhance the reform, it says.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has also ordered local government departments in
charge of media, public security, industry and commerce, and land
resources to crack down on manufacturers and dealers of
feudalistic and superstitious goods used for funeral services.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, public funeral facilities are urged to
improve their services and push forward the reforms.

<HEADLINE> Ban on Entry of Greek Orthodox Leader Routine: Turkish Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Turkish authorities have confirmed
a press report about a ban on the entry of Greek Orthodox
Archbishop Christodoulos into Turkey, but said it is a routine
procedure.
</P>
<P>
Unidentified Foreign Ministry officials said that some
foreigners' names, including the archbishop, were placed on an
Interior Ministry list and these people were not allowed to enter
Turkey, reported Turkish Daily News on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They explained that the list was prepared to prevent criminals
committing crimes ranging from prostitution to drug smuggling from
entering Turkey. Though Christodoulos' name was taken off the name
list in 1999, but the ban on his entry is still valid, they added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the archbishop's support for the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party is the main reason behind the ban. He was
also said to have sung a song at a meeting of clerics last year "We
will take Istanbul one day."
</P>
<P>
The ban report has touched off an angry reaction from Greece
over the weekend. Foreign Minister George Papandreou declared that
Greece would take all the necessary steps to coordinate its efforts
in this regard with other European countries.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou also expressed concern that improving Turkish-Greek
relations may deteriorate with this latest development.
</P>
<P>
"The spectacular change in Greek-Turkish relations has irritated
certain circles in Turkey who want to undermine this development,"
the Greek minister said.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, locked in disputes over Cyprus and the Aegean
Sea, have cashed in on mutual sympathy produced by devastating
earthquakes in their two countries last summer in a process now
dubbed earthquake diplomacy. The rapprochement was furthered by
exchange of high-level visits, which yielded nine agreements
covering various political and economic fields.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Greek Foreign Ministry warned that such an action
on Turkey's part would harm Turkey's path towards European Union.
</P>
<P>
Greece's drop of opposition has eventually cleared the way for
Turkey's accepting as a candidate for membership of the 15-member
club of the rich European nations at the EU summit in Helsinki last
December.

economy.
</P>
<P>
Radikal (Radical):

dollars in compensation to its former owners, both individuals and
companies.

<HEADLINE> Brunei Proposes to Set Trade Committee with Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Brunei has proposed to set
up a joint trade committee with Malaysia to focus on the expansion
of trade between the two countries, Malaysian International Trade
and Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
She said Malaysia welcomes Brunei's proposal and would follow
up on the proposal, aimed at enhancing trade cooperation between
both countries.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysia-Brunei trade relation is relatively problem free,
the minister said at a joint press conference with Brunei Minister
of Trade and Primary Industry Abdul Rahman Taib after their
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Rahman said on the occasion that Tuesday's meeting focused on
the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) preparation as Brunei
would host the APEC leaders informal meeting in November this year.
</P>
<P>
He said among sectors Brunei planned to focus on this year
would be the small and medium enterprises (SMEs), human resources
development and information technology and communications.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah said that Malaysia hoped that Brunei, as the host,
would launch concrete programs for the benefit of the small and
medium scale industries (SMIs).
</P>
<P>
The SMI programs could be for financing, information technology-
related fields such as e-commerce, e-business, and human resource
development, she said.
</P>
<P>
Total trade between Malaysia and Brunei in 1999 stood at 854.5
million ringgit (about 224.868 million U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Former President Soeharto Urged to Meet Attorney's Summon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Following a decision of the
Attorney General's Office to summon former president Soeharto,
Speaker of the House of Representatives Akbar Tandjung Tuesday
urged the former strong man to comply with such a request.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Tandjung said: "There are again no
reasons for Soeharto not to meet the attorney's call. He is quite
healthy to face questioning. We hope he will appear on Thursday (
at the Attorney General's Office)."
</P>
<P>
On Monday the Attorney General's Office issued a summon for
Soeharto after the former president was declared fit to face
questioning by an independent medical team. Soeharto is due to be
questioned on Thursday at 09:00 a.m. (local time) as a suspect in
case of corruption, collusion and nepotistic practices during his
32 years' rule.
</P>
<P>
But Juan Felix Tampubolon, a Soeharto's lawyer, said that there
is yet a decision on whether his client will appear at the
Attorney General's Office or not.
</P>
<P>
"It clearly depends upon the state healthy condition of Pak
Harto (Soeharto). We have no decision on that matter," Tampubolon
told Xinhua, admitting he has received a letter from the Attorney
General's Office.
</P>
<P>
"We are still considering (whether Soeharto will meet the
attorney's summon or not)," he said, adding that his client still
has a trouble in communication.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Director of the Center for Legal Aid and Human
Rights Assistance (PBHI) Hendardi said that investigation into
Soeharto will be the starting point for the Attorney General's
Office in combating corruption in the country.
</P>
<P>
"This investigation is a very important move that has to be
carried out by the Attorney General's Office. That (investigation)
will be very significant to be completed. It just likes the first
step in its bid to curb rampant corruption, collusion and
nepotistic practices in this country. If the attorney general
fails to examine Soeharto, it will likely damage all the
government policies in combating rampant corruption," he told
Xinhua Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> 2 Killed, 7 Injured as Filipino Newsman Ambushed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Two people died, seven others were
injured on Monday night when armed men fired at the vehicle of a
known radio commentator in Cotabato city in the southern
Philippines, said a police report reaching here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the target of the ambush was Zamzamin
Ampatuan, a staunch critic of the separatist Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF).
</P>
<P>
The ambush occurred at a time when Cotabato city was
experiencing a blackout amid heavy downpour, said the report,
adding that one of the fatalities was an army trooper while the
other was a member of the armed group.
</P>
<P>
Ampatuan was among the seven people who suffered bullet wounds
in the exchange of gunfire between the perpetrators and his
security escorts, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The incident was the second attempt on the life of Ampatuan who
cheated death on February 27 when a bomb blasted his van in the
city of Cotabato and wounded five people.
</P>
<P>
Ampatuan said that Monday night's incident, like the first, is
the handiwork of the MILF.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the MILF was possibly hurt by his criticism on
their abuses of the Muslim community while pushing for their cause
through the use of Islam religion.
</P>
<P>
However, Mohaqher Iqbal, the MILF information officer, denied
the organization has something to do with the ambush, saying that
"there are armed groups who wanted to sow intrigues for Muslims to
fight Muslims."
</P>
<P>
Iqbal added that if indeed some of the MILF guerrillas
conducted the ambush, it was on their own accord and not of the
organization.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Economy Still in Depression </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's economic slowdown is
expected to continue in the short term due to the on-going
drought, according to Economic Review for March by the Central
Bank of Kenya.
</P>
<P>
It will take long time to see the effect of the economic
reform, including privatization of state-owned corporations and
streamlining of the government, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth plummeted to 1.3 percent in 1999 from 1.8
percent in 1998 and 2.3 percent in 1997, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the poor performance in the past three
years to poor infrastructure, high cost of credit, security
concerns and inefficient government institutions.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, the leading sector of the economy which accounts
for 24.6 percent of Gross Domestic Product, grew by 1.3 percent
in 1999 compared with 1.5 percent in 1998, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
The output of tea, a major foreign exchange earner, declined by
15.47 percent to 248,820 tons in 1999 from 294,265 tons in 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, the output of coffee, another major export crop,
increased by 25.3 percent to 64,293 tons in 1999 from 51,317 tons
in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Stupa Found in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, March 28 (Xinhua) -- An ancient stupa has been found at
the Yingpan Ruins in Lop Nur, a desolate wasteland in northwest
China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologist Wang Binghua announced his discovery of
the stupa during his expedition to Loulan, one of the busiest
commercial cities on the ancient Silk Road which served as a
transportation hub for the flow of goods from China to the West
over 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the partly collapsed stupa, five meters tall, has a
square-shaped foundation and a cylindrical top.
</P>
<P>
The adobe stupa is an example of Hindu architecture of the
second and third century, he added.
</P>
<P>
Buddhism entered China from India via Xinjiang in the first
century, and that is why many Xinjiang stupas are in the Indian
style, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Seven other similar stupas have also been found scattered
around the ruins and are considered examples of early Buddhist
architectures of the time when the religion was first introduced
into Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
The Yingpan Ruins were discovered in the early 20th century.
Chinese archaeologists began excavations in 1994 and found many
ancient tombs dating back to the Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-24 A.D.).
</P>
<P>
In the tombs, burial objects such as clothing, wood, bronze,
and lacquer ware, and gold and silver ornaments have been
unearthed.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Anti-China Motion on Human Rights Doomed to Fail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States' attempt to
attack China on its human rights record at the upcoming UN Human
Rights Commission conference in Geneva is doomed to fail just as
it did before.
</P>
<P>
Such attempts have failed many times, said Chinese Foreign
Ministry spokesman Sun Yuxi at a regular press conference here
this afternoon when answering a question on the anti-China motion
the United States is expected to put forward at the commission
conference.
</P>
<P>
Rather than attack China, the United States should seriously
review its own human rights record, "which is really bad in some
aspects," Sun said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Unites States has used double standards on
the human rights issue.
</P>
<P>
The UN Human Rights Commission conference should be a forum for
countries to make discussions and dialogue on an equal footing
rather than the site for political confrontation or for some
countries' domestic political struggle between different parties,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Sun urged the U.S. side to give up being confrontational and
return to dialogue with China on the human rights issue.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is ready
to tap the rich and colorful resources of ethnic culture in the
country's vast western areas as part of the efforts to implement
its "great strategic plan to develop the west."
</P>
<P>
The State Ethnic Affairs Commission and the government of
Yunnan Province in southwest China will host a six-day exposition
of ethnic clothing and accessories in Yunnan's capital city of
Kunming beginning in July, Li Jinyou, vice minister in charge of
the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The exposition is expected to promote the production and
marketing of ethnic dresses and decorations on a large scale," he
told a press conference in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The exposition will feature clothes and adornments of all 56
nationalities in China, as well as their history.
</P>
<P>
China's Han ethnic majority will also be included in the
displays.
</P>
<P>
"Each ethnic groups in China has a distinctive traditional
culture of its own, and China's west is home to most of the ethnic
minorities and rich in ethnic culture," the vice-minister said,
adding that "their colorful and enchanting clothing and
decorations are a major part of the Chinese culture."
</P>
<P>
Yunnan Province is where 26 ethnic groups originated and home
to 15 unique ethnic groups, and is thus the ideal place for the
exposition, he said.

fashion shows staged, fashion designing and model competitions
featuring ethnic styles and related symposiums will also be held
during the exposition.

<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- China is currently encouraging
farmers to grow more high-quality rice, beans, cotton, and wheat
rather than high-yield but low-quality crops.
</P>
<P>
Han Deqian, vice minister of science and technology, said here
today that the country's agricultural development will put an
equal emphasis on both high-yield and high-quality, in a bid to
have farmers realize greater income and raise the market
competition capacity of their products.
</P>
<P>
Han made the remarks at a meeting for the promotion of 31
quality crop seeds held here today.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will allocate 150,000 yuan (19,200 U.S.
dollars) for each research unit which cultivates one kind of the
new crop seeds.
</P>
<P>
So far, wheat for baking, and quality rice, beans, and cotton

<HEADLINE> Vice Premier on Development of Western Region (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Vice Premier Wu Bangguo said
China's northwestern areas can play a big role in implementing the
central government's strategy to develop the economically backward
western region of the world's most populous nation.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remark while visiting Shaanxi, Qinghai, and Gansu
provinces and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region in the northwest
from March 19-28.
</P>
<P>
During his tour, the vice premier inspected 11 enterprises and
talked with local officials on a number of key issues including
economic reform, unity among people of different ethnic groups,
and social stability.
</P>
<P>
The strategy of developing the western region on a large scale
is a great decision made by the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) with Jiang Zemin at the core, with overall
consideration of the entire situation facing the new century, Wu
said, noting that it is a strategic plan for realizing the third
phase of the country's modernization drive and is of great
economic and political significance.
</P>
<P>
China's western region has laid a sound foundation for further
development over the past five decades, especially the past two
decades of reform and opening, the official said. The Party
Central Committee's decision has been made at the proper time and
is in accordance with the reality, he added.
</P>
<P>
Wu, who is also a member of the CPC Central Committee Political
Bureau, urged the northwestern areas to unify their thinking and
action with the decision and arrangement of the central leadership,
and fully recognize and tightly grasp this rare historic
opportunity.

<P>
While increasing the sense of urgency and mission, the western
region should also be clear about its development gap with other
parts of the country caused by historic factors, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
It calls for the efforts of several generations to bring about
complete changes in the western region, he said.
</P>
<P>
The western region should recognize the reality, make overall
plans, work in accordance with the local situation, utilize local
advantages, give priority to practical results, and try hard to
take the road of large-scale development with local
characteristics and in line with the requirements of a socialist
market economy, according to the vice premier.
</P>
<P>
Wu called on local people to push forward the large-scale
development of the western region strictly in accordance with the
unified plan of the Party Central Committee, make substantial
efforts, further broaden their sight, and aim at a higher level.
</P>
<P>
At present and in the coming few years, the western region
should make greater efforts to develop infrastructure and
strengthen environmental protection in order to lay a solid
foundation for large-scale development, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He warned local officials against setting up overlapping
projects and developing at a low level. New projects should only
be built after acquiring a clear understanding of market demands
and with priority mainly attached to improving economic quality
and efficiency, so as to bring the entire economy to a higher
level.
</P>
<P>
The western region should try harder to readjust its industrial
structure, upgrade local industries, introduce advanced technology,
and develop hi-tech sectors on a selective basis, he noted.

<P>
The living standards of local people should be improved
substantially through the large-scale development of the western
region, so that they can really understand the correctness of the
Party Central Committee's decision and the advantages of the
socialist system, the vice premier said.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned local officials to carefully guide, protect, and
display the enthusiasm of all circles to ensure the healthy
development of the west.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the funds and personnel that are badly needed by
the region to speed up local development, Wu pledged that the
central government will increase its investment and adopt
favorable policies and measures, while the developed eastern areas
of the country will also assist the west in various ways.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the development of the western region
fundamentally rests with the local people through self-reliance
and hard work to build a sound environment for investment and to
increase their ability to attract funds and professionals from
other parts of the country and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
The official urged local people to further emancipate their
thinking, renovate their ideology, accelerate the pace of reform
and opening, and strengthen the fields of science, technology and
education.
</P>
<P>
Wu said he pinned his hopes on local state-owned enterprises in
implementing the strategy and said that these firms should play a
leading and driving role in boosting local development.
</P>
<P>
But the official emphasized that whatever the western region
does will depend on a stable social environment.
</P>
<P>
He urged local Party committees and governments at different
levels to give top priority to social stability, understand
correctly the relations between reform, development and stability,
well handle various kinds of contradictions and problems, and be
sure of maintaining social stability.

<HEADLINE> Manila Hopes to Forge Peace Pact with MILF by June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Tuesday that it remains optimistic that it can forge a peace pact
with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) before the June
deadline set by President Joseph Estrada
</P>
<P>
Secretary Orlando Mercado of the Department of National Defense
said the government is now preparing for the next round of talks
scheduled on May 2 despite sporadic clashes between the military
and members of the secessionist group.
</P>
<P>
"We are hoping that through the peace talks, there would be a
lasting solution to the problem in Mindanao," Mercado said in a
radio interview.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the president has already reassured the MILF
that his administration "remains committed to peace," but it also
determined to beat its "working deadline."
</P>
<P>
On his part, National Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre said
the Estrada administration is not giving up on the peace talks "no
matter how difficult it is."
</P>
<P>
He also said the government will continue to count on the
sincerity of the MILF leaders in pursuing a peace settlement
despite what he called "isolated" cases of fighting between the
military and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The same approach will be adopted in dealing with leftist
rebels, with whom the government is also conducting negotiations
at the local level, Aguirre said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the president assured the people that peace and
development remain his administration's ultimate goal for Mindanao
even as he remains determined in carrying out his directive to
crush armed groups engaged in terrorist attacks in the South.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia had registered some
227,000 telephone subscribers throughout the country by last
February, more than double the number recorded in fiscal year
1986/87, official sources said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to Worku Bogale, deputy chief of the strategic
planning division of the Ethiopian Telecommunication Corporation
(ETC), the country has made remarkable progress in the development
of telecommunication as compared with 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the great efforts made by the state-owned ETC,
subscribers have become easier to have access to telephone
services, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said in the past, many applicants, especially those in the
rural areas, had to wait for years before they got a telephone
line, but this process has been much shortened now.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the ETC has made a plan to install
at least 60,000 telephones annually throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Abdulahim Ahmed, chief of the public relation
section with the ETC, told Xinhua that his corporation has been
providing Internet services in the capital city of Addis Ababa and
other regional towns since January 1997.
</P>
<P>
The number of subscribers for the services has reached about
3,000 to date, he said, adding the ETC will have a one-megabit
server with the capacity to provide Internet services to 14,000
subscribers.

<HEADLINE> 66 More Bodies of Cult Members Found in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan police have exhumed
bodies of 66 members of a doomsday cult in Bushenyi District, more
than 300 kilometers southwest of the capital Kampala.
</P>
<P>
Police Deputy Spokesman Eric Naigambi told Xinhua on Tuesday
morning that the bodies were found in a mass grave behind the
house of Dominic Kataribaabo, one of the key leaders of the
Movement of the Restoration of Ten Commandments of God.
</P>
<P>
"There were altogether 66 bodies by last evening. Police there
did not give me the number of children involved. Some of bodies
have stab wounds while others have pieces of cotton tied around
their necks. The digging is still going on and Investigations into
the matter are still under way," he said.
</P>
<P>
Local police found the grave on Sunday and they stopped digging
when they uncovered the arm of a corpse to wait for investigators
and forensic experts. The digging started Monday when prisoners
were brought in to dig.
</P>
<P>
The police found corpses of 153 members of the same cult in
three mass graves on March 24 in Kashenyi Village in Rukungiri
District. They had apparently been poisoned, strangled or hacked
to death.
</P>
<P>
On March 17, over 530 members of Movement of the Restoration of
 Ten Commandments of God were burnt to death at the Kanungu church
in Rukungiri District and the police treated the case as a mass
suicide then.
</P>
<P>
But now the Ugandan authorities have feared that leaders of the
cult appeared to have systematically killed cult members for
months following the find of mass graves.

<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Trade negotiators of China and
the European Union began a new round of bilateral talks here
Tuesday afternoon concerning terms on China's entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (

</P>

China has completed its bilateral talks with 29 WTO members,
and there are only eight WTO members including the EU left without
a deal with China.

In January and February this year, China and the EU conducted
two rounds of talks in Brussels and Beijing respectively.
Important progress was made in those talks, according to sources
from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (
MOFTEC).

China's bid to enter the WTO and its predecessor has lasted for
14 years. After it reached a deal with the United States last year,
the process of negotiations has been evidently accelerated.

China has started preparations for its full WTO membership by
clarifying its relevant laws and regulations, and those against
the principles of WTO will be amended, said MOFTEC Minister Shi
Guangsheng earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Rises as Fighting Rages in northern S.Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The death toll of Sri Lankan
troops had amounted to 33 as heavy fighting was still raging in
northern Sri Lanka between government forces and separatist rebels
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), a military spokesman said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman J.D.A. Gunasekara said that 158 troops were injured
in the fighting which occurred since Sunday evening around the
Elephant Pass, the entrance to the northernmost Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
He didn't reveal the exact casualties of LTTE rebels, but said
a large number of rebels' dead bodies were observed at Pallai,
north of the Elephant Pass.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said government troops had destroyed a tank which
was used by the rebels during the attack.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued from its London office on Monday, the
LTTE rebels claimed that they had inflicted heavy casualties on
government troops by launching an overnight "massive sea and land
assault in the Jaffna peninsula."
</P>
<P>
However, Spokesman Gunasekara said the rebels' sea-borne attack
on the eastern coast of Jaffna peninsula had been repulsed by the
Sri Lankan navy which had sunk at least two rebel boats and badly
damaged another.
</P>
<P>
Government troops captured the Jaffna peninsula from the rebels
in 1996, but since then the LTTE rebels have been trying to seize
control of the military base at Elephant Pass, the first step to
retake their former stronghold of Jaffna.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan President Chandrika Kumaratunga is seeking to end
the long-running war by introducing a devolution package which
would give Tamil concentrated areas of the island more autonomy.
</P>
<P>
More than 55,000 people have been killed in the 17-year-old
civil war between government troops and the LTTE rebels, who are
seeking independence in the north and east of Sri Lanka.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's opposition United
National Independence Party (UNIP) members have rejected Kenneth
Kaunda's resignation as the party leader, describing his
retirement as an act of betrayal, Times of Zambia newspaper
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Party secretary for publicity and information Bwendo Mulengela
told reporters on Monday in Ndola, Copperbelt Province, that
Kaunda could not decide to retire without consulting members of
his party.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Mulengela as saying UNIP members had hinted that the
decision would leave the party in disarray since it was only
Kaunda who can ably lead UNIP.
</P>
<P>
He said most UNIP members have remained in the party solely
because Kaunda is at the helm and several members would quit the
party if Kaunda stepped down.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, 75, served as the president from Zambia's independence
in October 1964 to November 1991. He announced his retirement from
politics last Friday in Cape Town, South Africa, where he was
invited to address delegates at a workshop on the refugee problem.

<HEADLINE> Steel Sector Reports Economic Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- China's steel industry saw better
economic returns in February this year, as measures aimed at
cutting steel output began to take effect.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the State Administration of Metallurgical Industry
said sales revenues of large- and medium-sized iron and steel
companies increased by 13.5 percent compared with the same period
last year, reversing the situation of growing output value and
decreasing sales revenue in previous months.
</P>
<P>
China produced a total of 9.73 million tons of steel in
February, 90,000 tons less than the projected output.
</P>
<P>
To improve the sector's economic performance, China plans to
reduce steel production by some 10 percent this year. However, the
sector failed to meet the monthly quota in January, posing a
threat to the fulfillment of the annual goal.
</P>
<P>
Related departments made intensified efforts in this regard to
improve the sector's overall performance. As a result, the output
of over-supplied product varieties was curbed and outdated
technology phased out.
</P>
<P>
Pushed by price hikes for steel products on both the domestic
and world markets, large- and medium-sized enterprises registered
a pre-tax profit of 3.83 billion yuan in the first two months this
year, an upsurge of 49.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Steel exports witnessed an upswing as well, registering 175
million tons, nearly three times more than the figure of the
corresponding 1999 period.

<HEADLINE> Notice Urges Attention to Forest Fires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The State Administration of
Forestry today released a notice urging localities to act swiftly
and take every possible measure to prevent forest fires that may
occur during the upcoming Chinese holiday of Qingming, or tomb-
sweeping day.
</P>
<P>
Chinese people go outdoors and light fireworks and burn paper
made to resemble money on this day as an offering to the dead on
tomb-sweeping day, which falls on April 5.
</P>
<P>
The notice asks local governments and forestry departments to
make fire prevention their top priority and be on the alert with
around-the-clock watchmen.
</P>
<P>
It also asks forestry departments to strengthen their control
over possible fire sources and ban them all in forest areas. On
days when the weather poses high risk of fire, outdoor fires will
be banned, the notice said.
</P>
<P>
An official with the administration said that both north and
south China are in a period of high-risk for forest fires.
Statistics show that so far this year, the country has had 620
forest fires which killed 15 people and injured 14 others.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Economic activity in New
Zealand in the fourth quarter of last year increased 2.2 percent,
Government Statistician Len Cook said here Tuesday when releasing
the latest Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures of the country.
</P>
<P>
After the small dip in growth in the second quarter, New
Zealand economy recovered strongly in the second half of the year
and combined with the 2.5 percent rise in the third quarter, the
latest quarter's results show growth for the year 1999 reached 3.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
This is "the strongest annual growth rate" since 1996, Cook
said in a media release.
</P>
<P>
Most industries in New Zealand recorded increased activity with
the largest rises recorded in manufacturing, transport and
communications, construction, farming and wholesale and retail
trade, Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Business investment on fixed assets was up 7.5 percent for the
whole year of 1999 in spite of a fall in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after New Zealand released the growth figures in its
economy, international rating agency Standard and Poor's announced
it would not downgrade the country's triple "A" foreign currency
rating.
</P>
<P>
A downgrade had been widely tipped for the past 18 months and
was seen as a factor in holding the NZ dollar under 50 cents of
the U.S.dollar for months.
</P>
<P>
The NZ dollar reached 50.4 cents of the U.S. dollar Tuesday.

<P>
LOULAN (XINJIANG), March 28 (Xinhua) -- A 2,200-year-old
colored coffin was unearthed on Monday at the Yingpan Ruins some
200 km east of Korla City in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The light green coffin was buried in the period of the Han and
Jin dynasties (206 B.C.-420 A.D.) at the Yingpan Ruins in Lop Nur,
said Wang Binghua of the Xinjiang Research Institute of Cultural
Objects and Archeology.
</P>
<P>
The coffin bears designs of a black dragon and a white tiger,
and a rosefinch and black warrior, representing the four
directions in the culture of the Han Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
"This is unique among cultural objects found at the Yingpan
Ruins," Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He has inferred that the occupant of the coffin was the ruler
of a small kingdom. "Learning the status of the deceased is of
great significance for understanding the development of
civilization of that period and the rise and fall of cultural
exchanges between China and other countries along the ancient Silk
Road," he said.

<HEADLINE> New Global Peace Award for Military to Be Launched in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Worldwide Consultative
Association of Retired Generals and Admirals (WCARGA) has chosen
the Sri Lankan capital of Colombo to launch a new global peace
award radically different to existing peace awards.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed at the inauguration of the fourth biennial
meeting of WCARGA hosted here Monday by the Association of Retired
Flag Rank Officers of Sri Lanka (ARFRO), Official Daily News
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The new award targets the military for their knowledge in
peace keeping, peace building, including policing and law
enforcement,protecting the environment, tackling the results of
natural disaster and assisting refugees of internally displaced
people," WCARGA Administrator David Wardorp was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the existing peace prizes are seen as too electric and
lacking methodology as the winner-take-all approach of existing
peace prizes tends to limit exposure of admirable runners-up and
the winners' experience has little impact in other regions and
cultures.
</P>
<P>
Above all the existing peace prizes reward past action but not
new ideas and proposals which the new award encourages, said
Wardorp.
</P>
<P>
The WCARGA is a membership organization comprising of flag rank
officers. It focuses on the prevention of armed conflict and the
enhancement of stability and security not only through military
means.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Picks 6-Member Team For Davis Cup Tie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Tennis Association
(Pelti) announced on Monday it would send a six-player team to its
Davis Cup tie against Malaysia, including the controversial
doubles pairing of Bonit Wirayawan and Sulistyo Wibowo.
</P>
<P>
Pelti spokesman Benny Mailili said the organization registered
the squad with the International Tennis Federation (ITF). The
squad consists of Suwandi and Febi Widhiyanto in the singles, plus
Bonit/Sulistyo and Edy Kusdaryanto/Hendri Susilo Pramono in the
doubles.
</P>
<P>
The second round tie in Group II of the Davis Cup Asia Oceania
Zone will be played in Kuala Lumpur on April 7 to 9.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes when we put two reserve players' names on the list,
the ITF doesn't include them. However, it's necessary as we can
change the name one hour before the match if one of our players is
injured," Benny was quoted by the Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Benny's announcement ended the dispute which occurred last week
when Pelti decided to call Bonit and Sulistyo, who recently won
the Indonesia Future-1 and the Niaga Cigna tournaments despite
previous poor form.
</P>
<P>
Coach Deddy Prasetyo expressed optimism his squad would be able
to defeat Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
"In the Southeast Asian (SEA) Games, we beat Malaysia 3-0.
After the event, our players have competed in many tournaments. I
believe they can win the Davis Cup match 3-2," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia reached the second round after beating the
Philippines 4-1 in Manila in the tie played from February 4 to 6.

<HEADLINE> Canberra Assures Public on Genetically Modified Crops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government
Tuesday moved to quell fears about genetically modified crops,
outlining the ways the public could access vital information on
experiments.
</P>
<P>
The government said it is investigating reported breaches of
regulation in relation to genetically modified crop trials and is
moving to introduce stronger standards.
</P>
<P>
"The safety aspects of all genetically modified (GM) crop
trials have been rigorously assessed by the Genetic Manipulation
Advisory Committee," the Interim Office of the Gene Technology
Regulator said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Detailed information on GM trials and proposals for trials is
publicly available, in both printed information sheets and on the
website," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The office, which is part of the federal health department and
was set up to oversee the development and use of genetic
manipulation technologies, said anyone involved in the research,
development, trial or release of genetically modified organisms
must comply with its guidelines.
</P>
<P>
"If it is found that there has been a breach of the guidelines,
follow up action will be taken, after consultation with relevant
state and commonwealth agencies," the office said.
</P>
<P>
The statement followed alerts from the Australian GeneEthics
Network, the Organic Federation of Australia (OFA), grain farmers
and the Labor Party last week about possible cross contamination
of crops from GM crop trials.
</P>
<P>
One agriculture organization of the New South Wales state, in
southeast Australia, revealed last week secret trial plots of GM
crops were being grown in locations not even known by the state
government.
</P>
<P>
The OFA questioned the federal government's GM crops monitoring
process and suggested there is a black market trade in genetically
engineered seeds.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Acts to Combat Terrorism, Crime Wave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Two special police units have
been set up in Sri Lanka to wipe out terrorists and organized
underworld gangs operating in Colombo and its suburbs, police
sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The special units consisting of 180 policemen and policewomen
with excellent records were set up on Monday by Bodhi Liyanage,
deputy inspector general of police in Colombo, and will undergo
special training at the Katukurunda Special Task Force Training
Camp, 45 km south of Colombo, before assuming duties, said the
sources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministry of justice is in the process of
drafting stringent new laws to combat the growing wave of crime in
the war-torn island nation, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been racked by the 17-year-old civil war between
government troops and Tamil Tigers rebels who have been blamed for
a series of terrorist bombings in Colombo over the years.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Sri Lanka has been troubled by the increasing rate of
criminal activities, including abductions, rapes, murders and
robberies, especially in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Gamini Peiris said last week that thousands of
deserters armed with sophisticated weapons have compounded the
crime wave.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, regulations regarding the granting of bail and
sentencing will be further strengthened, he said, adding that
another new law will be introduced to allow the authorities to
confiscate property to prevent criminals from converting their
profits into legitimate wealth.
</P>
<P>
Around 6,000 fire arms including automatic weapons are believed
to be in circulation in the country, police sources said, adding
that even soldiers have been allegedly involved in organized
crimes.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, two army personnel attached to the Commando
Regiment were taken into custody for their involvement in a
botched robbery at a rural bank in suburban Colombo.

DHAKA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Japan will grant aid amounting to 2,
464 million yen (23 million U.S. dollars) to Bangladesh according

Since this grant is to be utilized by the government of
Bangladesh for import of commodities and equipment, especially for
power plant and much-needed investment programs such as chemicals,
lubricants machineries, cotton and vehicles, it will substantially
contribute to the development of various sectors of the
Bangladeshi economy and social welfare, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Welfare Reforms to Be Balanced: Australian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government's
plans for welfare reform would keep the social security safety net
but expect people to give something back, Prime Minister John
Howard said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Howard said the long-awaited Welfare Reform Reference Group's
initial recommendations are not about cutting out the safety net.
</P>
<P>
"We do believe in the principle of mutual obligation and that
is that if people are in need they should be helped, but in return
if they are able to do so they should give something back," he
told the ABC network.
</P>
<P>
"When the draft comes out later today people will see the
essential balance that on the one hand we support the safety net
but on the other hand, where it's appropriate, there will be this
principle of mutual obligation at work," he said.
</P>
<P>
The draft report, to be released by Family and Community
Services Minister Jocelyn Newman, is expected by many analysts to
call for the withdrawal of benefits from sole parents of school-
age children and disability support pensioners if they fail to
undertake career counseling courses.
</P>
<P>
The proposals are likely to spark months of debate over
welfare reform with the government expected to receive a final
report around June, the analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Regional Australia to Get Tax Cuts on Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Regional Australia would benefit
from close to 2 billion Australian dollars (1.32 billion U.S.
dollars) in tax cuts on fuel as world petrol prices rise,
Workplace Relations Minister Peter Reith said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are cutting the taxes on fuel and that's worth pretty close

</P>
<P>
"That's a fantastic effort and a tremendous reform for the
benefit of regional Australia," he said.
</P>
<P>
While the government has no control over increases in world
petrol prices, Reith said, "But where the governments have a role
is in the taxation of fuel ... and that's going to be a big boost
to regional Australia compared to what they otherwise would have."
</P>
<P>
"We are reducing taxes on fuel and that is a good measure,
particularly for regional and rural Australia," he added.
</P>
<P>
Oil-producing nations have ended the first day of talks on the

<HEADLINE> Jinchuan Becomes China's Leading Nickel Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Jinchuan City, in the Hexi
Corridor of northwest China's Gansu Province, turned out 40,000
tons of nickel last year, becoming China's leading nickel
production base.
</P>
<P>
According to national geological survey, Jinchuan has a nickel
reserve of 5.5 million tons, ranking first in China. However, the
annual nickel output in Jinchuan lingered around 6,000-7,0000 tons
for many years as a result of lacking advanced technology. The
reclamation rate of osmium, ruthenium, rhodium and other rare
metals was only 1-3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from across the country came here in 1978 to tackle
key technical problems and developed 200 technological research
results, of which 138 have been applied in nickel mining, ore-
dressing and smelting.
</P>
<P>
The types of valuable elements retrieved from smelting has
grown from seven to 14 kinds. The reclamation rate of rare metals
has increased by 26.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the city has produced 550,000 tons of nickel. In
addition to domestic supply, Jinchuan has exported its products to
a dozen of countries including the United States, Britain, Japan
and France.

</P>
<P>
The goods without any customs declaration papers range from
medicines, computers, home appliances to automotive parts and
components.
</P>
<P>
The ship was registered in Shantou, and the shipment was

HUHHOT, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Repairing work has begun on a 300-
meter-long section of the Great Wall in remote mountains of Urad
Front Banner, in north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The State Administration of Cultural Heritage has set aside 200,
000 yuan for the project.
</P>
<P>
This is the best-preserved section of the ancient Great Wall;
however, earthquakes and many years of natural erosion have
impaired the wall, which is 3.5 meters high, 4.1 meters wide on
the bottom and 1.5 meters on the top.
</P>
<P>
Workers will use 10,000 cubic meters of stone to repair the
wall.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists hope to know more about the history of the Qin
Dynasty (221-207 B.C) through unearthing work on some selected
spots of the wall, while local government expects overseas and
domestic tourists to visit the wall after it is repaired.

<HEADLINE> Greater Anti-dumping Efforts Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- A group of Beijing-based lawyers
have urged Chinese industrial leaders to adopt anti-dumping
measures to protect their enterprises after the country's entry
into the World Trade Organization (WTO), China Daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
After China enters the WTO, dumping charges will be a legal and
efficient means for Chinese industries to defend themselves, said
the lawyers.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation had registered five dumping charges against
foreign producers.
</P>
<P>
Among them, Chinese producers of newsprint, silicon steel and
tinsels have won suits against their foreign competitors. The
other two cases are still under investigation.
</P>
<P>
In four of the five cases, the Beijing-based Huangzhong Lawyers
acted as major agents of Chinese industries, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xuehua, director of the law firm, admitted that despite
some successful cases, anti-dumping consciousness of most Chinese
enterprises remains weak, and China's regulations related to anti-
dumping were far from adequate.
</P>
<P>
Wang's opinion was shared by Susan Ming, a foreign trade lawyer
with King &AMP; Wood Lawyers and Partners in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The lawyers suggested that the government should strengthen its
anti-dumping institutions and issue regulations that are easier to
implement.

JAKARTA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Badminton Association of
Indonesia (PBSI) has requested the National Sports Council (KONI)
provide fitness equipment in preparation for the Thomas and Uber
in Kuala Lumpur and the Olympic Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Tahir Djide, the association's official in charge of research

</P>
<P>
Tahir, who was speaking in his capacity as a physical trainer,
said the association still had time to use the machine to prepare
athletes for the Olympic Games slated for September 15 to October
1.
</P>
<P>
"As a physical trainer, I know that 87 percent of badminton
movement is based on leg power. The leg-press machine is to boost
their knee and hip power. Based on my experience, many athletes
have been injured during leg training without the machine," he was
quoted by the Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying.

Meanwhile, men's singles coach Agus Dwi Santoso complained
about the lack of facilities available to the association to make
video recordings of other countries' players in major

record any world class shuttlers' performances," he complained.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Pair on Edge to Win at Worlds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICE, France, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese pair skaters Shen
Xue and Zhao Hongbo displayed a flawless performance to take a
comfortable lead in their event at the World Figure Skating
Championships here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Standing at the leading place after short programme, the
Chinese duo, world runners-up last year, are one step away to
create a history to become the first pairs world champions from
Asia since the event was officiated at the championships in 1908.
</P>
<P>
With the disqualification of defending champions Elena
Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze of Russia after Berezhnaya was
tested positive for a banned substance at the European
Championships in Vienna last month, Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo
became the strongest favourites to win the event on the ice rink
of Nice.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese pair were nearly perfect in the routine performance,
which requires eight elements including a throw triple loop and
side-by-side triple toe loop to the music of "Firebird" by Igor
Stravinsky.
</P>
<P>
Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo, who did not win any Grand Prix stops
but won the grand finales, had seven 5.8 and two 5.9 for technical
merit and seven 5.8 for artistic presentation.
</P>
<P>
"We are feeling great at the performance," said Shen Xue, who
began to skate together with Zhao Hongbo in 1992.
</P>
<P>
"We are at the same form as we were at the grand finales in
Lyon," she added.
</P>
<P>
Another Russian pair, Maria Petrova and Alexei Tikhonov, who
finished second in this year's European championships to
Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze, were second in the short programme.
Third were Canadians Jamie Sale and David Pelletier.
</P>
<P>
The pairs free skating will be on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the men's event, Alexei Yagudin used a new routine to gain
an advantage over his rival Yevgeny Plushchenko in the qualifying
although they skated in different groups.
</P>
<P>
Seeking his third consecutive world title, Yagudin was
impressive in taking his group, nailing a quad and seven triple
jumps.Plushchenko showed the effort of skating early and was
beaten by Canadian Elvis Stojko in the other qualifying group.
</P>
<P>
Since losing his European title last month to Plushchenko,
Yagudin has changed his long program, that he showed for the first
time in competition Monday in the round that counts for 20 per
cent of the final score.
</P>
<P>
According to the rules, top 15 from each group advance to the
short programme, which will be held on Tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> Berezhnaya's Coach Learns a Lesson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICE, France, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian skater Elena
Berezhnaya's coach Tamara Moskvina said here on Monday that she
learned a lesson from Berezhnaya's case and that she would pay
some attention to medical terms in the future.
</P>
<P>
Berezhnaya, twice world pairs champion along with partner Anton
Sikharulidze were disqualified to defend their gold medals at the
world championships by the International Skating Union after
Berezhnaya was tested positive for a prohibited substance in the
category of stimulants at the European championships last month.
</P>
<P>
The skater has declared that she had taken this class of banned
substances inadvertently to treat bronchitis and the Russian
Figure Skating Federation also announced that both skaters waived
right to the analysis of the B sample as permitted by the ISU
regulation.
</P>
<P>
Moskvina, a renowned coach with more than 30-year experience on
ice, told a press conference that such a thing never happened
during her career in the past.
</P>
<P>
"I was very shocked and surprised when I was informed by the
Russian Federation on the evening of March 24. For 30 years as a
coach, I taught anyone to take drugs and drugs won't help us to
get good results. We have been regarding doping as a great
disgrace," she said.
</P>
<P>
Moskvina got to Berezhnaya for the details. "When I asked
Berezhnaya whether she had taken any drugs, she started to think
and said: 'yes'. She said she took from medicine from an American
in New Jersey to cure her bronchitis. We have given the doctor's
name to the ISU and ISU's medical commission chairperson Dr. Jane
Moran accepted our explanation," said Moskvina.
</P>
<P>
Moskvina also added that Berezhnaya and Sikharulidze will stay
in Nice for the world championships, "but now they are in Monte
Carlo for a sightseeing."
</P>
<P>
The humourous and smart coach explained their first feeling
after hearing the information. "We felt very ashamed at the first,
and we thought to climb up a mountain and jump into the Meditarian
Sea. But after a second thought, we know that we did nothing wrong,
so we did not
finish in the sea but in a restaurant," she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Belgian national coach Robert
Waseige on Monday called up Anderlecht defenders Glen de Boeck and
Bertrand Crasson for a friendly match with the Netherlands slated
for Wednesday.

international debut in 1993.

JERUSALEM -- The door of peace has not been closed despite no
breakthrough in the Sunday summit between U.S. President Bill
Clinton and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad in Geneva, Israeli
Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Talking to parliamentary members of the One Israel faction in
the Knesset (parliament), Barak said the outcome of the summit
between Clinton and Assad was expected, but his government is still
ready to restart peace talks with Syria if the Syrian side wants
todo so.
</P>
<P>
Barak refused to give more detail on how Israel could like to
offer to the Syrian side for restarting the peace talks, which has
been stalled since January after two rounds in the United States.

DAMASCUS -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad returned here
Tuesday afternoon from Geneva where he held an inconclusive summit
with his U.S. counterpart Bill Clinton aimed at restarting peace
talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two leaders reviewed the Middle East
peace process and the possibility of resuming the Syrian-Israel
talks that have been stalled since January this year.
</P>
<P>
But the summit failed to immediately revive the talks because of
what Syrian side said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's refusal
to offer a clear pledge to pull back his troops to the pre-June 4,
1967 borders. (Syria-Assad)

Shas's Council of Torah Sages held an emergency meeting Monday
night to discuss the party's future in the coalition after Israel's

Ovadia Yosef for his inciting remarks against Education Minister
Yossi Sarid.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the policymaking council after the meeting
stated that it condemned the attorney general's decision as a "
serious attack on the honor of a great Bible scholar, Rabbi Ovadia
Yosef" but the party will remain in the ruling coalition for now.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Minister Highlights Jordanian King's Role in Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Israeli Minister of Public
Security Shlomo Ben-Ami said Monday he believed the farsightedness
of Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein would play a key role in
reviving the peace process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in the Israeli embassy in Amman, Ben-Ami
said his talks with Abdullah was of special significance due to the
King's concern regarding the Middle East peace process and
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He said the farsightedness of King Abdullah would help activate
joints efforts by parties concerned to push forward the peace
process on all tracks, namely Israel's peace talks with the
Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Jordan takes peace as its strategic option in its foreign
policies, and it has been a key peace broker in the region after it
signed a peace treaty with Israel in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Abdullah and Ben-Ami, who is visiting Amman
for bilateral cooperation on combating drug trafficking, also
touched upon the peace process in the region after the summit
between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Syrian President Hafez al-
Assad in Geneva on Sunday failed to hammer out an agreement to
resume the stalled Israeli-Syrian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between Israel and Syria broke off in January after
Israel rejected a Syrian demand for a written commitment to
returning in full the Golan Heights it captured in the 1967 Middle
East war.
</P>
<P>
During his one day visit to Jordan, Ben-Ami also discussed with
Jordanian Interior Minister Nayef Kadi about promoting bilateral
cooperation in the security field, particularly in combating
narcotics smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Ben-Ami said Jordan and Israel had agreed to establish a joint
committee to follow up the joint efforts concerning security and
combatting drugs.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli minister left Amman Monday evening after his one-day
visit.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Holds Mini-Summit on Regional Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- Seven leaders of the 16-member
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) held a one-day
summit in the Nigerian capital Abuja Monday night to endorse
proposals to create a free trade area in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The mini-summit, called by Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo, reached consensus on the implementation of the agreement
signed earlier by Nigeria and Ghana, said sources reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also agreed on "concrete infrastructural programs"
to enhance the integration process of the sub-region, the same
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo, in his speech, said the summit was consistent with
Nigeria's resolve to accelerate regional economic integration
under the two-track approach, which allows member nations to
implement ECOWAS's decision at their own pace, as agreed by the
organization's 22nd summit in Lome last year.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Jordan`s Late King Hussein, Queen Noor Awarded Anti-Polio Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Jordan`s late King Hussein Ibn Talal
and his widow Queen Noor Al-Hussein were awarded on Tuesday the
Polio Eradication Champion Award by the Rotary International for
their service to wipe out the disease among children all over the
world.
</P>
<P>
Rotary International is a famous international charity
organization which has been campaigning to eradicated polio, the
shorthand for poliomyelitis, worldwide since the year 1985.
</P>
<P>
"This award is a tribute to His Majesty (late King Hussein) in
particular, for his efforts to promote the health and welfare of
children and to Jordan's successful immunization program, including
the eradication of polio," Queen Noor said in accepting the
awards .
</P>
<P>
Hussein, once the largest serving ruler of the Middle East, died
of lymphatic cancer in February 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Polio Eradication Champion Award is given to world leaders
by Rotary International for extraordinary services for medical care
of children.
</P>
<P>
President of Rotary International Carlo Ravizza said that "our
organization has presented this award to the late King for his
life-long commitment and dedication to the cause of improving the
lives of children not only in his country but the world over and to
Her Majesty (Queen Noor) for her commitment and for continuing to
carry on with the King's legacy."
</P>
<P>
With no reported cases of polio in the last four years, Jordan
is expected to be proclaimed polio free next year, Jordan`s
official news agency Petra said.
</P>
<P>
Rotary International has spent an estimated 400 million U.S.
dollars since 1985 in its worldwide campaign against polio.
</P>
<P>
Jordan has received half a million dollars from the the
organization over the past eight years and was removed from the

<HEADLINE> EU Urged to Define Policy on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
on Tuesday called on the European Union (EU) to clearly define its
policy on the Cyprus issue, Cyprus News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Clerides made the appeal while meeting with a delegation from an
university in Athens, Greece, an EU member.
</P>
<P>
There is a long way to go before a solution to the Cyprus issue
can be found, "because even Europe has not clearly defined its
policy as a whole as each member state has its own views," said the
president.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that what is needed is a unified European policy on
the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
invaded and occupied the northern third of the island country in
the wake of a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The international community, under the auspices of the United
Nations, has been making strenuous efforts for decades to reunite
the divided island through a bi-communal, bi-zonal formula.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the prospects of a possible third round of U.N.-
sponsored proximity talks on Cyprus, Clerides said Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash has set preconditions for substantive
negotiations on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Before the start of the first round of proximity talks last
December in New York, Denktash demanded recognition of his "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" which was set up on November 15, 1983
and only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The second round of talks were held last month in Geneva, with
no tangible progress made. The third round is expected to be held
in June in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
"If the Cyprus problem is not solved, the further perpetuation
of the problem, through the presence of Turkish settlers in
occupied Cyprus, a part of Cyprus will no longer be Cyprus but an
extension of Turkey within Cyprus," Clerides warned.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Meets UNDP President on Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Abdullah said that raising the income of Jordanians by achieving
sustainable economic growth was among his top priorities and served
as the main driving force for the efforts to create favorable
investment climate in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The king also affirmed his determination to improve the
administrative structure of the kingdom, and to reconsider policies
of primary and higher education to pave the way for sustainable
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Jordan achieved a 1.5 percent economic growth in 1999,
apparently recovering from a chronic economic recession since the
1990 Gulf Crisis.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom had been isolated by Arab countries for siding and
sympathizing with Iraq during the Gulf crisis triggered by Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Brown emphasized the UNDP's determination to
continue supporting King Abdullah's efforts designed to develop
basic and promising sectors such as tourism, software industries,
information technology, which will serve as a basis for
accomplishing comprehensive social and economic development in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The kingdom has mapped out a strategy to build itself into an
software and information technology center in the Middle East as
its labor force enjoyed higher education compared with other Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Abdullah, Brown also voiced his
appreciation Jordan's efforts to update laws and regulations needed
for stimulating economic growth after it was admitted into the
World Trade Organization in late 1999.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians Adjourn Bolling Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators adjourned one-week talks at Bolling Air Force Base,
southeast of Washington, on Tuesday and agreed to resume their
negotiations on April 6, the State Department said.
</P>
<P>
"Both delegations are now returning home for consultations.
they have agreed to resume their talks on April 6," spokesman
James Foley told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He described the session's atmosphere as "positive",saying the
two sides better understood each other after a week of exchanging
of ideas.
</P>
<P>
He said there were still "remaining gaps" between the two sides,
that was why they had to go back for consultations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Bill Clinton held talks with President
Hosni Mubarak of Egypt at the White House, discussing the peace
process in the Middle East after Clinton failed to draw Syria back
to negotiating table during his meeting with Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad in Geneva, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said he remained hopeful about the Middle East peace
process despite the failure of the Geneva U.S.-Syrian summit.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot say that's a failure ... No progress from the
Israelis and the Syrians doesn't make us pessimistic," he said. "
We have to make much more effort so as to reach peace, and an
agreement could be signed for the welfare of the whole area."
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that he may meet Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak soon after he returns home to Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Clinton told reporters before his meeting with Mubarak that it
was now up to Syria for the resumption of Syrian-Israeli
negotiations,that broke down in January as the two sides insisted
on their own priorities in two rounds of talks in Washington and
Shepherdstown, West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
"I went to Switzerland to meet President Assad to clarify to
him what I thought the options were and to hear from him what his
needs are, and I asked him to come back to me with what he thought
ought to be done," he said.
</P>
<P>
"So the ball's in his court now and I'm going to look forward
to hearing from him," he added.
</P>
<P>
Still, Clinton showed some optimism as he thought Israel was
serious about peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister Barak would like to do this as quickly as he
can. And I can tell you they have made very, very serious efforts
on all tracks," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think, we will continue to see progress, at least on the
Palestinian track. And of course I hope we'll have some progress
on the Syrian one as well, as well as in Lebanon," he added.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Boy's Relatives Refuse to Give Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Family spokesman Armando Gutierrez for the boy's relatives in
Flordia said that the authorities vowed to remove Elian from the
United States if an agreement wasn't signed this week, according
to an Associated Press report from Miami.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made by Gutierrez after he and lawyers for
the boy's U.S. relatives met with officials from the Justice
Department's Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).
</P>
<P>
Late Monday, the INS said in a letter to the family that it
will swiftly end Elian Gonzalez's right to remain in the United
States unless his Miami relatives promise to surrender the boy if
they lose their court fight to keep him out of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The INS said the boy's parole would end at 9 a.m. Thursday
unless the family provides a written guarantee to give up Elian.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting Tuesday morning, Gutierrez noted that no
agreement had been signed to let the boy return to Cuba if the
family loses the court fight, at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was quoted as saying that federal authorities "
don't want this kid here." "They have promised ...they will send
this kid back and that's why they have to abide by their agreement.
"
</P>
<P>
Elian, who is currently under the custody of his great uncle,
Lazaro Gonzalez, in Florida, was rescued on November 25 last year
from a shipwreck after his mother and 11 others died when the boat
capsized in the sea off Florida.
</P>
<P>
The INS ruled earlier this year that the boy belongs to his
father and should be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
However, the decision to return him was delayed after the boy's
great uncle Florida filed a political asylum for him. U.S.
District Judge K. Michael Moore ruled that only the U.S. attorney
general can grant political asylum to the boy.
</P>
<P>
The boy's father in Cuba, supported by the Cuban government,
insisted that his son should be returned to him while the boy's
great uncle, backed by some anti-Cuba politicians in the U.S.,
asked the boy to stay with him.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Texas Governor George W. Bush
Tuesday outlined his new education plan of "reading first" by
suggesting spending of 5 billion dollars over five years to
address reading problems of school children in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"America must confront a national emergency," Bush, the de
facto presidential nominee of the Republican Party, said in a
speech to the Asian-American business community at the suburb of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
"Too many of our children can't read," Bush said. "Our economy
is the envy of the world. unfortunately, our schools are not."
</P>
<P>
Bush's plan sets the goal that every American school child
should be able to read by the end of the third grade.
</P>
<P>
According to the Bush campaign, 68 percent of the fourth
graders in the nation's poorest school areas were not able to read
at a basic level in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Bush, who is making education a main campaign theme, said the
money would pay for diagnostic programs to identify troubled
children in kindergarten and first grade.
</P>
<P>
He also called for paying teachers a stipend of 230 dollars per
day to receive training in diagnosing student reading problems.
</P>
<P>
Under his plan, 900 million dollars will be spent annually on
literacy programs designed and implemented at the local level.

</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior Tanzanian police
officer Tuesday warned the young people against illegal emigration
to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Director of Criminal Investigation (DCI) in the Ministry of
Home Affairs Adadi Rajabu said that in most cases the Tanzanians
seeking good life abroad end up with untold sufferings.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters in his office here that police records show
that most Tanzanian young men escaped illegally into South Africa
found that it's hard to get a job.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the Tanzanians do odd jobs for survival in Capetown
and Johannesburg," he added, some of them are engaged in armed
robbery while most of those arrested by local police are used as
carriers in illicit drug trade.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on local reports that some 800 Tanzanians who live
in South Africa are engaged in criminal activities, the DCI
admitted the fact but arguing that the figure was exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
"My office is communicating with their South African
counterparts to establish the exact figure," he said, revealing
that most of the stowaways were using temporary permits.
</P>
<P>
"Since the middle of last year, however, the conditions and
regulations for issuing temporary permits have been tightened to
curb the problems," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Rajabu urged Tanzanian parents to be strict with their
children and not allow them to travel abroad without genuine
purpose.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Helps China Build Key Highway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved
Tuesday a loan of 200 million U.S. dollars to China for the
construction of the 238-kilometer inter-provincial highway to
connect Nanning, the provincial capital of Guangxi, to Shuiren in
the north, creating a key section of China's national trunk
highway system.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the Shuiren-Nanning Highway is the main
component of the Guangxi highway project. This new highway will
connect the relatively poor, land-locked interior provinces of
Guizhou, Yunnan, Sichuan, and the city of Chongqing to the
southern seaports of Beihai and Fangcheng in Guangxi and Zhanjiang
in Guangdong province, bringing a shorter and faster route to the
sea.
</P>
<P>
The new highway will give an economic boost to one of China's
poorest areas by promoting commerce, trade, and tourism in the
region, serving approximately 4 million people in its wider area
of influence, 80 percent of whom are ethnic minorities, according
to the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
"This project is designed to help reduce infrastructure
bottlenecks, address highway maintenance and safety issues and
channel the country's scarce resources to a relatively poor
province which has a per capita income of about two-thirds the
national average," said Supee Teravaninthorn, a senior transport
economist at the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The national trunk highway system as a whole connects inland
provinces with coastal provinces and China's borders. This system,
with which the World Bank is substantially involved in financing
and constructing, involves five north-south and seven east-west
corridors. The Shuiren-Nanning Highway section of the system is
expected to be completed by December 31, 2005.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project is 566.8 million dollars. The
World Bank's loan is being made at the bank's standard interest
rate for LIBOR-based U.S. dollar single currency loans with a
maturity of 20 years, including a 5-year grace period.

<HEADLINE> Nicaraguan Government Rejects Somoza's Son's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Nicaraguan President Arnoldo
Aleman rejected the visit to his country of Colonel Anastasio
Somoza Portocarrero, son of the former dictator Anastasiio Somoza
Debayle, official sources said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Nicaraguan Presidency said that Aleman who
is now in an official visit in France, considers Portocarrero's
visits as "bold and provocative" with "obscure and political
purposes promoted by a minority party."
</P>
<P>
The former colonel better known as "El Chiguin" and Somoza
Debayle's son, overthrown by Sandinistas in 1979, will arrive to
Nicaragua from Guatemala, where he has resided since his exile to
support the candidates in the municipal elections next November
for the National Liberal Party (PLN), according to his
representative Enrique Quinones.
</P>
<P>
Quinones, a former leader for the opposite army and supported
by the U.S. Army that tried to bring down the Sandinista's
government without success in the 1980s, said that Somoza will get
together with PLN leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Nicaraguan government spokesman announced that the
government and the people reject a visit by Somoza, "whom public
opinion blames as one of the main responsible people for the
destruction, suffering, rapes and bloodshed."
</P>
<P>
The report concluded that those accused of genocide and crimes
made against the people during Somoza's dictatorship "should face
justice anywhere and at any place, at any time and under any
circumstances, and going back to the past will never be tolerated.

<HEADLINE> NATO Chief Congratulates Putin on Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 28 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General George
Robertson congratulated Tuesday Vladimir Putin on his victory in
the Russian presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief said in a telegram that he hoped Putin would use
his "clear victory to strengthen democracy and to steer Russia
toward political and economic reform at home and closer
cooperation with its western partners".
</P>
<P>
He added that such a policy would be most likely to build
stability and prosperity in Russia.
</P>
<P>
NATO is ready to reinforce its cooperation with Russia, said
Robertson, on the basis of the NATO-Russia Founding Act, that was
signed in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
Robertson recalled that during his February visit to Moscow
Putin had indicated his readiness to broaden the dialogue with the
western military alliance.
</P>
<P>
"A relationship built on trust and close cooperation between
Russia and the west remains essential for stability in Europe and
beyond," said the NATO secretary general.
</P>
<P>
The Briton reiterated the concern expressed by the NATO allies
about the situation in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Robertson hoped that Putin would rapidly initiate a process to
seek an enduring political solution in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Putin won 52.5 percent of the votes in the presidential
elections held over the weekend, to beat archrival Gennadi
Zyuganov who managed to garner 29.4 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
The NATO-Russia relationship went sour after the western
military alliance brushed aside the Russians to launch air strikes
against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in March last year.
Russia recalled its permanent liaison officials from NATO
headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The freeze in bilateral relations witnessed real thaws in
February when the NATO chief visited Moscow, followed by the
resumption of the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council meeting in
Brussels.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Officials Return From Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 28 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consular officials have
returned back from a trip to Libya and will give a recommendation
to the Secretary of State on whether travel by American citizens
to the country is safe, the State Department said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of the trip was to assess local conditions ... and
to determine whether travel to Libya by American citizens
continues to put them in 'imminent danger,'" spokesman James Foley
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Imminent danger" is the criterion Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright uses to determine whether U.S. passport can be used for
travel to a given country, he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. consular officials arrived in Libya last Saturday.
They held talks with Libyan consular and police officials during
their visit.
</P>
<P>
"They're going to be drawing up their trip report. they're
going to be conferring with colleagues ... and eventually drawing
up a recommendation to the secretary," Foley said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials have said the visit to Tripoli was purely
technical. But observers here see it as a step toward more normal
relations.
</P>
<P>
Washington severed its diplomatic relations with Tripoli in
1981 and later imposed economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The bombing of Pan Am flight in 1988 over Lockerbie, Scotland,
made the relations even worse between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Libya agreed to hand over two suspects of the
Lockerbie bombing and the U.N. Security Council lifted sanctions
against Libya imposed in 1992. Since then, many foreigners have
travelled to the north African country while the United States has
remained where it was.
</P>
<P>
Hassouna Chaouch, Libya's Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs
and International Cooperation, said last Thursday that Tripoli
welcomed the U.S. delegation. "This is an important step we hope
will be followed by others. We consider that the negative chapter
in our relations is over," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Disappointed at Kosovo Albanian Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"That greatly disappoints us," State Department spokesman James
Foley told a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo Albanian groups agreed "freely" on March 23 to end
its insurgency in southern Serbia, Foley said. "We are indeed
disappointed in the failure of these parties to live up to those
commitments."
</P>
<P>
Foley made the remarks to respond to a report by The Washington
Post Tuesday that remnants of the former Kosovo Liberation Army (
KLA) seem determined to continue a challenge to Serb security
forces in the Presevo Valley, a predominantly ethnic Albanian
region in southern Serbia.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to stress to the Albanian leadership in Kosovo
that we are serious about the messages of zero tolerance for
violence and extremism," he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also said that the peacekeeping forces in Kosovo,
or KFOR, "has backed up these messages with appropriate concrete
action and remains capable of doing so as necessary in the future.
"
</P>
<P>
"We continue to call on all parties to act responsibly and to
refrain from any actions that might provoke violence and
instability in the region," he added.
