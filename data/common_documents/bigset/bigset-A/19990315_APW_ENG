<HEADLINE> Indian Artifacts Auctioned Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONROE, Conn. (AP) -- As auction-goers bid thousands of dollars  
for artifacts created long ago by members of her Schaghticokes 
Indian tribe, Paulette Crone-Morange's heart sank. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the pieces on sale from a private collection: a basket  
woven in the 1800s by Harry Harris, her great-grandfather. Ms. 
Crone-Morange watched helplessly as it was sold to another bidder -- 
she couldn't afford it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just don't have the money to purchase these things back,''  
Ms. Crone-Morange said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Poor in comparison to tribes like the Mohegans or Pequots, the  
Schaghticokes are hard-pressed to buy artifacts when they are sold 
from private collections. A recent increase in demand for Native 
American works has added to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The items auctioned off along with Ms. Crone-Morange's family  
basket came from the collection of the late Lyent Russell, a Yale 
professor who'd amassed hundreds of Native American artifacts prior 
to his death last year. His entire collection netted over $100,000 
at the November auction. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Crone-Morange, who traces her Schaghticoke heritage to 1687,  
did manage to buy six other baskets -- spending $1,700 of her own 
money. But five others were bid out of her price range and 
purchased by dealers and private collectors. 
</P>
<P>
	Watching collectors push the bidding up, Ms. Crone-Morange  
recalled her growing frustration. ``I'm getting angry, saying, 'But 
these mean nothing to you. This is our family,''' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Richard Velky, head of the 300-member tribe which has its  
offices in a small building in Monroe, said outsiders buying tribal 
artifacts amounted to ``purchasing bits and pieces of our soul.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If it was a crucifix, a torah scroll or a tombstone, I doubt  
these items would fall under an auctioneer's hammer,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to retrieve other lost artifacts, Schaghticoke tribal  
officials have asked people who own baskets or other tribal items 
to donate them to a future Schaghticoke museum, or at least to give 
the tribe first chance to buy them. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is our heritage. We have more interest in it than the  
dollars and cents the white man puts on it,'' Velky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribal members said they tried to contact Russell's daughter  
after his death to ask if she would donate or sell them the 11 
Schaghticoke baskets in her father's collection. They say she never 
responded. 
</P>
<P>
	But Russell's daughter, Carol Knight, said the tribe offered no  
money. ``My feeling is that my father bought them. He paid money 
for them,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight said the tribal member who asked her to donate the  
baskets claimed they were sacred tribal objects. 
</P>
<P>
	``But sacred objects, to me, are used in burial or religious  
activities,'' Knight said. ``These were not that. These were made 
for sale.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Falls vs. Yen, Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen Monday as Tokyo  
stocks rallied amid more indications the Japanese economy has begun 
a slow recovery from its worst recession in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also slid against the euro as Germany reported a  
greater-than-expected increase in manufacturing orders in January. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0935, up  
from $1.0901 on Friday. The dollar was quoted at 117.82 Japanese 
yen, down from 118.78 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders sent the dollar lower against the yen Monday after the  
Ministry of Finance reported that Japan's current account surplus 
for January rose 72.2 percent from year-ago levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The report helped lift Tokyo share prices, which also drew a  
boost from reports that Nissan Motor, suffering from a staggering 
debt load, is close to a deal that would allow French automaker 
Renault to take up to a 40 percent stake in Japan's No. 2 
automaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``A 290-point rise in the Nikkei overnight has underpinned the  
perception that the Japanese economy may have turned the corner,'' 
said Michael Lewis, currency economist at Deutsche Bank in London. 
Japan's benchmark Nikkei stock index rose 1.9 percent Monday to 
close at 15,779 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.4653 Swiss francs, up from  
1.4633, and 1.5266 Canadian dollars, up from 1.5235. The British 
pound fell to $1.6228 from $1.6313. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the countries participating in the euro no longer  
are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.7886 German 
marks, down from 1.7940; 5.9988 French francs, down from 6.0168; 
and 1,769.91 Italian lire, down from 1,776.20.

<HEADLINE> PC Bargains Bar Is Set Even Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Lately, PC retailing has adopted a new theme song, ``The Limbo  
Rock.'' That's because many sellers have lowered the price bar on 
some very good systems. 
</P>
<P>
	And it's sweet music indeed to the shopper looking for a first --  
or additional -- PC. 
</P>
<P>
	Consider Apple, not always a low-cost leader in the past. Its  
popular iMac was $1,299 before Christmas but is now $999. And some 
retailers are throwing in a color inkjet. 
</P>
<P>
	On the PC side, here's what a major New York area electronics  
retailer offers for $788: 
</P>
<P>
	IBM 400 megahertz Pentium II with MMX, 128 megabytes of RAM, a  
6.4-gigabyte hard drive, 40-speed CD-ROM, 56-kilobits-per-second 
modem, 17-inch monitor, 16-bit sound card and a Hewlett Packard 
420c color printer. A bonus package includes a joystick, Windows 98 
instructional video, multimedia speakers, a Seiko electronic 
organizer, some bundled software, and even a cell phone (if you buy 
a year's service). 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, bargains include a $688 Compaq with a 350-megahertz  
Pentium II chip, 64 megabytes of RAM and a 17-inch monitor. What's 
more, some systems at around $1,000 include DVD-ROM drives, which 
play full-length, full-screen movies as well as perform traditional 
CD-ROM chores. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of this is fueled by the pace of chip development, which  
puts the newest, hottest chip into the marketplace before the 
previous newest, hottest chip has had a chance to cool to room 
temperature. This may be tough on the nerves of manufacturers and 
retailers, but it's a boost for consumers, since even the 
``obsolete'' chip is often far more powerful than most ordinary 
applications can ever use. 
</P>
<P>
	Peripherals are also taking a price plunge. A 4,800-DPI (dots  
per inch) flatbed color scanner costs $28 after a $30 rebate. A 
40-speed CD-ROM runs $45-$80, 56-kilobit V.90 modems are below 
$100, and six-gigabyte hard drives go for around $150 -- offering 
roughly 300 times the storage at one-third the cost of the early PC 
hard drives. 
</P>
<P>
	A megabyte of memory once cost $40 to $50; now, $50 buys 32  
megabytes. 
</P>
<P>
	In the midst of all this consumer happiness, there are still  
some bumps in the road. If a deal seems too good to be true -- well 
below everyone else's -- it probably is, especially if it's from a 
new or unknown small retailer or mail-order firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The April issue of PC World magazine has an excellent article on  
stolen and counterfeit chips. It points out that what you think is 
a top-of-the-line chip might be an older one that has been 
relabeled. The article is worth a look. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the magazine itself is worth a look. PC World has been  
doing a solid, consistent job of seeing things from a consumer's 
viewpoint, with focused articles that explain the jargon clearly. 
The $5.99 cover price could jolt someone who remembers 5-cent comic 
books, but subscribers pay substantially less. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ex-Chicago Alderman Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Former Alderman Larry Bloom, known as a stickler  
for ethics while he served on the City Council, was sentenced 
Monday to six months in federal prison and fined $5,000 for 
cheating on his taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Bloom pleaded guilty in December to reporting $9,000 -- including  
a $6,000 payoff he took from a corrupt contractor -- as rental 
income in claiming a tax loss for his real estate company. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors dropped other corruption charges against him  
that arose in their City Hall investigation called Operation Silver 
Shovel. 
</P>
<P>
	Bloom was elected alderman as an anti-corruption candidate in  
1979 and ran unsuccessfully on the same issue for mayor in 1989 and 
city treasurer in 1995. He left the council that year. 
</P>
<P>
	He admitted that in 1994 he took $6,000 from the government's  
mole, John Christopher. In exchange for some of the money, Bloom 
agreed to help Christopher get city-funded services for 
rock-crushing business. 
</P>
<P>
	Bloom also admitted disguising the source of a $10,000 campaign  
contribution from Christopher on his campaign disclosure form.

<HEADLINE> Cold Virus May Cause Heart Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A respiratory virus responsible for the common  
cold can infect adult hearts in rare cases, causing damage that can 
lead to heart failure and sudden death, researchers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	The study linked some adenoviruses, which can cause upper  
respiratory infections, to a condition in adults called left 
ventricular dysfunction. Earlier studies found that some 
adenoviruses cause LVD in children. 
</P>
<P>
	The study's lead author, Jeffrey Towbin of Baylor College of  
Medicine in Houston, said less than 1 percent of those who get a 
viral infection with flu- or cold-like symptoms will be at risk for 
heart damage from infection. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients with LVD have a swollen left ventricle that is  
squeezing poorly, leading to disabling and eventually fatal heart 
failure and possibly sudden death. The symptoms can include fatigue 
or shortness of breath. 
</P>
<P>
	The heart condition can be revealed by a physical exam or chest  
X-ray. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have a cold and you get better and then, two to four  
weeks later, you feel bad again, it's probably worth contacting 
your physician,'' said Towbin, professor of pediatrics, molecular 
and human genetics and cardiovascular sciences. ``If you don't have 
fever or a runny nose again and if it persists more than a couple 
of days, there may be something going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study was published in today's issue of Circulation, a  
journal of the American Heart Association. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, there are two to eight cases of LVD per  
100,000 people each year, according to the heart association. An 
estimated 40 out of every 100,000 Americans suffer from the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	LVD can also be caused by heart disease, genetic defects, or  
tissue damage from using cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one study has shown that young adults who develop LVD  
have a 50 percent chance of dying in the next seven years, said Dr. 
Steven Lipshultz, chief of pediatric cardiology at the University 
of Rochester Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, researchers studied tissue samples from the hearts  
of 94 adults ages 17 to 76 whose LVD resulted from an unknown 
cause. They found genetic evidence of adenoviruses in 12 of the 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Lipshultz said the findings could lead to the development of a  
vaccine to protect the heart against adenoviruses. There is a 
vaccine for some adenoviruses, but it is not widely used and may 
not be effective against the types that cause LVD.

<HEADLINE> Sen. McCain Slams Clinton Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANHATTAN, Kan. (AP) -- Presidential hopeful Sen. John McCain on  
Monday charged that U.S. foreign policy is marred by incoherence, 
leaving the country vulnerable to aggression from China and without 
a long-term strategy for dealing with North Korea and Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's diplomacy is characterized by ``spasmodic,  
vacillating and reactive approaches to world problems,'' the 
Republican Arizona senator said while delivering the first major 
foreign policy speech of his emerging campaign for the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's disjointed foreign policy is most evident in America's  
relationship with China, McCain told an audience of about 800 
people at Kansas State University. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has sacrificed national security for the sake  
of engaging China, he contended, and he assailed the ``strangely 
relaxed attitude'' toward allegations that China stole classified 
nuclear weapons design information from the Los Alamos National 
Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
	He also criticized the transfer of satellite technology to  
China, saying it may be linked to allegedly improper Chinese 
contributions to Clinton's 1996 presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it is proven beyond a reasonable doubt, it will bring more  
of history's shame upon the president than his personal failings 
will,'' McCain said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said North Korea's nuclear ambitions represent the  
``greatest, most immediate danger to the United States and our 
closest allies in Asia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the United States has procrastinated in coming up  
with a strategy toward North Korea, allowing that country to 
maintain its nuclear weapons program and improve its missile 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain said America's relationship with Iraq lacks coherence as  
well. He advocated a ``rogue state rollback'' policy in which the 
United States would support forces trying to overthrow regimes in 
nations like Iraq and North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	However, McCain, who spent more than five years as a prisoner of  
war in Vietnam, said America should pursue diplomacy before 
resorting to force. 
</P>
<P>
	``The terrible losses incurred in war were once an experience so  
intensely personal that I will remember them all of my life,'' said 
McCain, whose military honors include the Silver Star and Purple 
Heart. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no decision with greater meaning or that should be  
made with greater reluctance than the president's decision to send 
Americans into conflict,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference following the speech, McCain said he  
planned to announce soon whether he would run for president, but he 
did not indicate a date.

<HEADLINE> Three Gene Research Sites Named </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- The National Institutes of Health on Monday  
named the three sites where researchers will participate in a 
project aimed at deciphering the genetic code hidden in genes. 
</P>
<P>
	Research of the human genome -- all of the DNA in our chromosomes  
-- will be conducted at the Washington University School of Medicine 
in St. Louis, Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and the 
Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	The project will help figure out the basic units of heredity. It  
will then focus on how genes determine physical characteristics, 
the way babies develop and what diseases people get. Finally, the 
project will focus on ways to prevent the estimated 4,000 genetic 
diseases in humans. 
</P>
<P>
	The three sites will share $81.6 million in funding over the  
next 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
	The NIH support, which comes from the National Human Genome  
Research Institute, will enable the sites to contribute to a 
working draft of at least 90 percent of the human genome by the 
spring of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Project researchers had originally hoped to sequence the genetic  
code of 3 billion chemical units by 2005. Because of technological 
advances, researchers say a complete sequence could be deciphered 
by 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The gene research project began informally in 1980. It was  
officially launched in 1990 with the backing of the NIH and the 
Department of Energy.

<HEADLINE> G.B., Cards Get Compensatory Picks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Green Bay Packers and Arizona Cardinals were  
awarded four compensatory picks in April's draft for losing free 
agents last year. 
</P>
<P>
	A total of 27 compensatory choices were awarded Monday to 16  
teams. The picks range from the 96th overall (third round) to Green 
Bay to the 254th overall, the final selection of the draft, to St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay also got the 133rd, 135th and 205th for losing seven  
free agents, including Edgar Bennett, Doug Evans, Craig Hentrick 
and Eugene Robinson. The Cardinals received Nos. 170, 204, 207 and 
241 for losing seven, including Kent Graham, Eric Hill and Michael 
Bankston in the 1998 free agency period. 
</P>
<P>
	Other teams getting compensatory selections were Dallas, Denver,  
Jacksonville, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, two apiece; and Atlanta, 
Baltimore, Buffalo, Cincinnati, Miami, Minnesota, New England, 
Tampa Bay and the New York Giants, one each. 
</P>
<P>
	Compensatory free agents are determined by a formula based on  
performance and salary. Since 1993, when they first were awarded, 
Dallas has received the most, 18.

<HEADLINE> Ill. Clinic Gets Suspicious Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- About 40 people were evacuated from a Planned  
Parenthood clinic in downtown Chicago Monday after workers received 
a suspicious package in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Bomb experts who X-rayed the package say it appeared to be a  
vial of liquid, said Lt. Gary Szparkowski, a police spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The vial was inside a sealed envelope and may have been leaking,  
he said. Police said it may take several days to determine the 
contents of the vial. 
</P>
<P>
	A portion of the street in front of the clinic was closed down  
for emergency crews, and about 40 workers were evacuated, he said. 
They were later allowed to return. 
</P>
<P>
	Szparkowski called the street closure and evacuation ``more  
precautionary than anything else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Steve Trombley, president and CEO of Chicago's Planned  
Parenthood, said he believed the package was linked to other ones 
received by clinics around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In February, Planned Parenthood clinics in Kansas City, Mo.,  
Manchester, N.H., Sioux Falls, S.D., and Burlington, Vt., and 
abortion clinics in Washington, Milwaukee, Cincinnati and Rapid 
City, S.D., reported receiving suspicious packages, many purporting 
to be the potentially deadly bacterium anthrax. The threats turned 
out to be false. 
</P>
<P>
	The mailing followed a bomb that exploded outside an Asheville,  
N.C., abortion clinic over the weekend.

<HEADLINE> La. Church Empty After Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GONZALES, La. (AP) -- It might have been any other Sunday at  
church. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of New St. John Fellowship greeted each other with warm  
handshakes. Children dressed in their best submitted to last-minute 
adjustments from their mothers. 
</P>
<P>
	But it wasn't a usual worship service. The congregation was  
gathered miles away from their usual home, leaving empty the little 
white church where three people died in a hail of bullets last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 members of the congregation shook off a damp winter  
chill and bad memories during the two-hour service at the Gonzales 
Civic Center. There were rollicking spirituals, tears and shouts of 
``Amen!'' and pastor Clarence Stephens' admonishment to members to 
keep the faith. 
</P>
<P>
	He likened the violence that interrupted Wednesday's Bible study  
to a storm sent by God as a test. 
</P>
<P>
	``A pre-warned storm shows how well you can prepare,'' Stephens  
shouted. ``But an unexpected storm -- follow me now -- an unexpected 
storm will show your true strengths and weaknesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shon Miller, in his 20s, from Gonzales faces charges of  
first-degree murder and attempted murder. Police said he burst into 
the church and opened fire into the pews, killing his wife, Carla 
Vessel Miller, 24, and son, Shon Jr., 2. 
</P>
<P>
	A 19-year-old church member, Vaniaro Jackson, also was killed,  
apparently a random victim. Carla Miller's mother, Mildred Vessel, 
53, ambushed in her car near the church before the other killings, 
also died. 
</P>
<P>
	Church leaders decided last week they would hold no more  
services in the building where the shootings occurred. They are 
raising money to complete electrical work and other interior 
details on a new building nearby, but that could take months. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the congregation was trying to adjust to new  
surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
	Brenda Larks had charge of the smallest children. There were 11  
of them, some toddlers, some as old as 7. Nine of them were in the 
church Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Larks led the children through Bible verses, then asked them  
what they should do in light of last week's violence. One said, 
``Pray.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's right,'' Ms. Larks said. ``Everybody that got shot --  
we've got to pray for them.''

<HEADLINE> Rudolph Not Ruled Out in N.C. Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Federal investigators said Monday that  
they have no evidence connecting fugitive bombing suspect Eric 
Rudolph to an explosion at an abortion clinic over the weekend, but 
they aren't ruling him out, either. 
</P>
<P>
	The bomb partially detonated on Saturday morning outside the  
Femcare Clinic in Asheville, about 75 miles west of the mountains 
where agents have been searching for Rudolph for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	No one was hurt in the blast, which caused little damage other  
than leaving black marks on the outside of the one-story brick 
building. 
</P>

	``We have no evidence, at this time, that this bomb is the work  
of Eric Rudolph,'' U.S. Attorney Mark Calloway said. ``It is too 
early, of course, to draw any conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Fox, an agent with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and  
Firearms, said the powerful bomb could have ``devastated the entire 
end of the building and gone into the building approximately 40 to 
60 feet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rudolph has been on the run since the January 1998 bombing of a  
Birmingham, Ala., abortion clinic that killed an off-duty police 
officer and severely wounded a nurse. He is charged in that bombing 
and three Atlanta attacks, including the 1996 Olympic bombing that 
killed one person.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Clinic Bombing Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- Authorities investigating the weekend  
bombing at an abortion clinic said today they have no evidence to 
link the crime to serial bombing suspect Eric Rudolph, but they're 
not ruling it out, either. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no evidence, at this time, that this bomb is the work  
of Eric Rudolph,'' U.S. Attorney Mark Calloway told a news 
conference at the Asheville federal building. ``It is too early, of 
course, to draw any conclusions. We are committed to following 
every lead to its logical end and go to wherever the evidence takes 
us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calloway this morning declined to answer specific questions  
about the makeup of the bomb, which partially detonated near a wall 
outside the Femcare clinic a half-hour before it opened Saturday 
morning. Nobody was injured and there was little damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether it has any similarities to previous bombings charged to  
Rudolph also remains unanswered. Authorities said the bomb would 
have caused extensive damage if it had detonated completely. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have devastated the entire end of the building and  
gone into the building approximately 40 to 60 feet,'' said Richard 
Fox with the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. ``... It 
was a considerably powerful bomb.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rudolph has been on the run since the Jan. 29, 1998, bombing of  
a Birmingham, Ala., abortion clinic that killed an off-duty police 
officer and severely wounded a nurse. Since then, he has been 
charged in that bombing and in three earlier Atlanta attacks, 
including the 1996 Olympic Park bombing that killed one person. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asheville clinic is about a two-hour drive east of the  
mountainous area where Rudolph is believed to be hiding in the 
rugged Southern Appalachians. 
</P>
<P>
	Calloway and Fox urged people with any information about the  
clinic to contact authorities. They wouldn't say if they have 
witnesses to the explosion or anyone who saw a suspicious vehicle 
outside the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
	Femcare was one of several clinics nationwide last month that  
received packages said to contain the potentially deadly bacterium 
anthrax. Nothing was found inside the packages sent to the clinics. 
</P>
<P>
	Two anti-abortion protesters holding signs picturing fetuses  
stood outside the federal building after the news conference, 
passing out literature. Femcare has been a regular locale for 
protests, but they have been regarded as peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's amazing how somebody could be trying to point their  
finger at us for this incident,'' said protester Meredith Eugene 
Hunt.

<HEADLINE> Banks' Profits Up 4.7 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's commercial banks had a seventh  
straight year of record profits in 1998 as earnings rose 4.7 
percent to $61.9 billion, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings at the country's 8,774 commercial banks were boosted by  
fee income, the FDIC said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Healthy, profitable banks support the economic growth and  
prosperity we enjoy today,'' FDIC Chairwoman Donna Tanoue said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The report came a day after news that Fleet Financial Group Inc.  
plans to acquire BankBoston Corp. for $16 billion in stock in a 
deal that will create the nation's eighth-largest bank and the 
dominant lender in New England. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDIC noted that U.S. banks' record profits last year came  
despite restructuring expenses related to mergers of some big 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	In the case of Fleet and BankBoston, the combined bank will be  
faced with overlapping branches and administrative operations, and 
executives said it may have to cut as many as 5,000 jobs from the 
banks' total work force of 59,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDIC said nationwide bank profits declined 2.5 percent in  
the fourth quarter of 1998 to $14.9 billion, weakened by continued 
lower earnings from foreign operations and the restructuring costs 
from mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	A basic yardstick of bank profitability -- return on assets -- was  
an average 1.11 percent in the October-December quarter, down from 
1.24 percent a year earlier. A majority of banks, 54.6 percent, 
reported lower returns on assets than in the fourth quarter of 
1997, the FDIC said.

<HEADLINE> Guilty Plea in Point Shaving Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *Pleads guilty in Arizona State point-shaving scheme    	
</P>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- A gambler who put up some of the money and helped  
pay a basketball player in a point-shaving scheme pleaded guilty 
today to a charge of conspiracy to commit sports bribery, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vincent P. Basso of Buffalo Grove, Ill., will face a maximum  
prison term of five years and a possible $250,000 fine when 
sentenced on May 24, the U.S. attorney for Arizona said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jose de Jesus Rivera also said Basso, who was indicted in  
January on charges of sports bribery, interstate travel in aid of 
racketeering and money-laundering, agreed to forfeit $27,000 as 
proceeds from illegal activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Basso admitted he worked with Joe Gagliano in Las Vegas to  
arrange that Stevin ``Hedake'' Smith shave points as Arizona State 
played Southern California in February 1994, Rivera said. 
</P>
<P>
	Outlining Basso's role for the first time, Rivera said Basso  
then helped bet $150,000 on the game, putting up $30,000 himself 
and agreeing to contribute $11,000 to help pay Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Basso did much the same thing with about the same amounts of  
money for a March 1994 Arizona State game with Washington, but 
Smith didn't protect the point spread and the gamblers lost their 
$145,000 wager, Rivera said. 
</P>
<P>
	Benny Silman, the alleged mastermind of the original scheme, is  
serving a 46-month sentence for getting Smith and ASU guard Isaac 
Burton to shave points in certain games so the team wouldn't beat 
the point spread. 
</P>
<P>
	The other 1994 games in question were those with Oregon State on  
Jan. 27 and Oregon on Jan. 29 
</P>
<P>
	Smith; Burton; Gagliano, a Phoenix investment adviser; Chicago  
trucking company executive Dominic Mangiamele and his son, Joseph, 
and Anthony Joseph Frank are awaiting sentencing.

<HEADLINE> Man Dies in Shootout at University </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TERRE HAUTE, Ind. (AP) -- A former student at Indiana State  
University was shot and killed Monday by school officers who said 
he fired at them in trying to flee the scene of an attempted 
burglary. 
</P>
<P>
	Zedrick S. Johnson, 29, of Terre Haute, was seen climbing over  
an entrance to a student housing area on campus Monday morning, 
police said. The residential area is closed for spring break, but 
is open to a few students living there. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they stopped Johnson and while questioning him, he  
told them he was carrying a gun. When they asked for the weapon, he 
ran, the officers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers caught up with Johnson in a back yard and he fired  
eight shots at them, they said. They returned fire, hitting Johnson 
six times. The officers were uninjured. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary findings by investigators indicated that the  
shooting was justified, police Chief Joe Newport said.

<HEADLINE> Spice Co. CEO McCormick To Retire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPARKS, Md. (AP) -- Charles P. ``Buzz'' McCormick, who twice  
turned around the fortunes of the spice company that bears his 
family name, plans to retire again. 
</P>
<P>
	McCormick, who will be 71 in May, will retire for the second  
time at McCormick &AMP; Co.'s annual shareholders meeting on Wednesday. 
He plans to pass the chairman's title to Robert J. Lawless, the 
company's president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	When McCormick first took the reins in 1987, few expected him to  
match the legacies of the first two family members who ran the 
company -- his great-uncle and company founder, Willoughby 
McCormick, and his father, Charles P. McCormick Sr. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was Buzz McCormick who steered the firm through two rough  
periods and likely ensured that it remained a Baltimore-area 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
	During his first tenure, he undertook a five-year restructuring  
plan that propelled McCormick &AMP; Co.'s shares to a sixfold increase 
-- a startling performance in the slow-growth food industry. 
</P>
<P>
	McCormick stepped down from active management with the title of  
chairman emeritus in 1993, but returned as CEO in October 1995 amid 
a ruinous price war with Burns Philp &AMP; Co. of Australia. After 
several years, McCormick &AMP; Co. won the price war, leaving Burns 
Philp nearly bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, McCormick stepped down as CEO in favor of Lawless, an  
insider with international experience.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets closed higher Monday,  
with the key index surging in Tokyo on reports that Nissan Motor 
Co. is about to forge an alliance with French carmaker Renault. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 290.74  
points, or 1.88 percent, to close at 15,779.60. On Friday, the 
average closed down 13.28 points, or 0.09 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices opened lower after the Japanese government released  
data Friday showing that the country's economy shrank 0.8 percent 
in the October-December quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	But the market soon shook off the grim news when troubled Nissan  
Motor's share price surged on speculation that the company is close 
to a deal with Renault. News reports said that the pact would allow 
Renault to take a stake of up to 40 percent in Nissan and supply 
three board members. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Nissan Motor, Japan's second largest automaker, said  
in a statement that the two companies are studying the possibility 
of a tie-up, but that no formal proposal for an alliance had been 
received from Renault. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 118.42 yen in the  
afternoon, down 1.62 yen from late Friday in Tokyo, and also below 
its late New York level of 118.78 yen on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Thai share prices also surged, with the main index rising 4.4  
percent in reaction to Friday's passage by the Thai senate of a 
long-awaited bankruptcy bill, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) index rose 15.09 points to  
360.88. 
</P>
<P>
	The bankruptcy bill is aimed at speeding up Thailand's  
bankruptcy process and making it easier for financial institutions 
to recover problem loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Bucking the trend was the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange, where  
shares finished sharply lower as concerns about the health of the 
Malaysian economy blunted relief over Prime Minister Mahathir 
Mohamad's victory in the Sabah state election, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Malaysian benchmark Composite Index slumped 2 percent, or  
10.34 points, to 518.45. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed at a 12-week high as continued  
buying in semiconductor stocks pulled the main index above the key 
6,500-point mark. The Weighted Stock Price Index rose 135.59 points 
or 2.1 percent, to 6,598.32. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: A surge in banks, energy and and utilities stocks drove  
the Australian share market to a new closing high Monday and its 
third consecutive record finish. The All Ordinaries Index rose 28.2 
points, or 1 percent, to 2,989.5. 
</P>
<P>
	HONG KONG: Share prices closed higher for the second consecutive  
session in light trading. The blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 35.10 
points, or 0.3 percent, closing at 10,836.86. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher in relatively  
light trading. The benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 10.22 
points, or 0.4 percent, to 2,166.76. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed lower in thin trading. The  
Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 3.96 points, or 0.2 percent, 
to 1,941.34. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed higher for the third consecutive day.  
The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 1.22 points, or 0.2 
percent, to 592.02. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed mixed in sluggish trading. The  
Straits Times Index rose 0.6 percent, or 8.45 points, to 1,494.19. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian share prices closed lower after the  
government's decision to close 38 banks on Saturday failed to lift 
market sentiment. The Composite Index fell 3.619 points, or 0.9 
percent, to 372.318.

<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Defying Japan's moribund economy, Tokyo stocks  
rallied today when Nissan Motor's share price surged on reports the 
automaker was close to a tie up with Renault. The dollar dropped 
against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 290.74 points,  
or 1.88 percent, to close the day's session at 15,779.60 points at. 
On Friday, the average closed down 13.28 points, or 0.09 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.42 yen in the afternoon, down 1.62 yen  
from late Friday in Tokyo, and also below its late New York level 
of 118.78 yen on Friday. The greenback ranged in value from 117.92 
yen to 119.45 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 129.44 yen, down  
from 131.35 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, share prices started lower after the  
government released data Friday showing that Japan's economy shrank 
0.8 percent in the October-December quarter of 1998, analysts said.

</P>
<P>
	Today, Nissan Motor said in a statement that the two companies  
are studying the possibility of a tie-up, but that no formal 
proposal for an alliance had been received from Renault. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sentiment has improved, making it difficult to sell,'' said  
Kazunori Shimono, manager of futures and options at Ryoko 
Securities, though there were no fresh factors other than the 
Nissan news. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancers overwhelmed retreaters 810 to 401, while 111 issues  
were unchanged. Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock 
Exchange was estimated at 741.49 million shares, down from 1.19 
billion shares Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section gained 15.57 points, or 1.30 percent, to 1,211.18 
points. The TOPIX closed down 0.57 points, or 0.05 percent, on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the foreign exchange market, the dollar remained under  
selling pressure against the yen after the Japanese currency moved 
higher against the euro on Friday, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar got a little help from Vice Finance Minister for  
International Affairs Eisuke Sakakibara, who said that excessive 
yen strength was not welcome, and that the Bank of Japan agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, overseas players and Japanese trust banks,  
heartened in part by strength in Japanese stock prices, sold the 
dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	``Market players have taken the view that there is room for the  
dollar to fall further,'' said Shuji Takano, assistant manager of 
foreign exchange at ABN AMRO Bank in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Also weighing on the dollar was the sharp rise in Japan's  
current account surplus for January. The Ministry of Finance said 
today that the nation's current account surplus for January rose 
72.2 percent from the year-earlier month to $6.82 billion, before 
adjustment for seasonal factors. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese  
government bond rose to 1.785 percent, driving its price down to 
100.11 yen. On Friday, it settled at 1.715 percent and its price 
stood at 100.67 yen.

<HEADLINE> Late Winter Storm Brings Disbelief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A late-winter blanket of wet snow pulled down power lines along  
the East Coast, closed schools and strained the backs of homeowners 
who had to shovel the stuff Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The same storm that had piled snow nearly 2 feet deep in the  
Missouri Ozarks over the weekend rolled across the East with snow, 
sleet, ice and rain Sunday night and Monday, making a mess of the 
morning commute just a week before the start of spring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope this is going to be the last for this season,'' said  
60-year-old Suk Chon, who got up at 4:50 a.m. to shovel his 
driveway in Edison, N.J., and then found his commuter train to 
Trenton was late. 
</P>
<P>
	The southwestern Pennsylvania city of Bedford got 18 inches;  
more than a foot piled up in southern Ohio and the hills of 
Virginia and West Virginia; 10 inches fell on parts of New Jersey 
and at Litchfield, Conn.; and by Tuesday morning up to 10 inches of 
snow were possible at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Airlines had scattered delays and cancellations. Overhead wire  
problems delayed morning commuter trains in the Philadelphia area, 
and fallen trees and power lines slowed rail service in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	The heavy, wet snow snapped power lines around the Philadelphia  
area, causing 75,000 customers to lost electricity. Tens of 
thousands more were blacked out in Connecticut, Maryland, 
Tennessee, West Virginia, New Jersey, New York's Long Island and 
Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	``No sense shoveling the driveway if it's all just going to  
melt, right? Do you think it's going to melt?'' John Plante, 29, 
asked passersby as he tried to decide whether to shovel his 
sidewalk in Mount Vernon, N.Y., or wait for rising temperatures to 
do the job. The mercury could hit 60 later this week. 
</P>
<P>
	He shoveled -- and then gobs of softening snow fell from roofs,  
trees and wires and undid all his work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought winter was a thing of the past. I guess I was  
wrong,'' Judy Azevedo said in East Haven, Conn., after spending 20 
minutes shoveling out her car. ``You know what they say, `Beware 
the Ides of March.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Pennsylvania's Legislature called off Monday's meetings in  
Harrisburg. Schools were closed in more than half of West 
Virginia's 55 counties. 
</P>
<P>
	The more than a foot of snow that fell on northern West  
Virginia's Preston County brought the total to more than 54 inches 
since March 1. Drifts stood 4 to 5 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the worst March we've had in years,'' Shelley Shaffer  
said in Manown, W.Va., where she was baby-sitting a granddaughter. 
``We're just going to watch and hope that it goes down -- and not up 
anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Hancock, Md., about 200 travelers spent Sunday night on Red  
Cross cots at a school. ``They were in the hallway, in the 
gymnasium, the auditorium, the cafeteria, anywhere they could find 
a spot,'' said Town Manager Louis Close.

<HEADLINE> The Boss, McCartney, Joel Inducted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Three singers who dominated radio in the 1970s --  
Bruce Springsteen, Paul McCartney and Billy Joel -- joined the Rock 
and Roll Hall of Fame on Monday along with Dusty Springfield, who 
died two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Elton John inducted Springfield, recalling how he joined her fan  
club and stuck her pictures on his bedroom wall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every song she sang, she claimed as her own,'' said John.  
</P>
<P>
	Joel gave a long hug to fellow piano man Ray Charles, who  
inducted him. Joel said he learned his music from Charles, Otis 
Redding, and Wilson Pickett. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I've been referred to as derivative, Joel said. ``I'm  
damn guilty. I'm derivative as hell. If everyone who is derivative 
was excluded from this institution, there wouldn't be any white 
people here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony at the elegant Waldorf Astoria Hotel was featured a  
reunion of Springsteen and his E Street Band, even though the band 
wasn't being inducted. 
</P>
<P>
	Springsteen thanked his grinning mother sitting in the audience,  
and his father, who died last year and inspired many of 
Springsteen's songs. 
</P>
<P>
	``What would I conceivably have written about with him? I miss  
ya dad,'' Springsteen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bono of U2 credited Springsteen's emergence in the mid-1970s  
with ``saving music from the phonies, saving lyrics from the 
folkies, saving black leather jackets from the Fonz.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCartney, who didn't attend when the Beatles were inducted in  
1988, appeared on stage with his daughter, Stella, and paid tribute 
to his wife, Linda, who died last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like my baby to share this with me,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Honoring McCartney, Neil Young said the first song he ever sang  
was a Beatles tune in his high school cafeteria. He praised 
McCartney's ability to carve out his own niche after the group 
broke up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Out he stepped from the shadow of the Beatles and there he  
was,'' Young said. ``It kind of blew my mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other inductees included ``Superfly'' singer Curtis Mayfield,  
already in the hall as a member of the Impressions; Del Shannon, 
who made ``Runaway'' a hit in 1961; and the gospel group The 
Staples Singers. 
</P>
<P>
	Blues artist Charles Brown and the Western swing band Bob Wills  
and His Texas Playboys were honored as early influences. Beatles 
producer George Martin was saluted in the nonperforming category. 
</P>
<P>
	Springsteen was judged rock 'n' roll's savior upon the release  
of ``Born to Run'' in 1975 and hit his commercial peak with ``Born 
in the USA'' in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	But the E Street Band won't join Springsteen as inductees. Under  
Hall of Fame rules, artists aren't eligible until 25 years after 
their first record, and the E Street Band didn't receive billing on 
a Springsteen record until 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a misguided policy,'' said E Street Band drummer Max  
Weinberg. 
</P>
<P>
	McCartney was the most commercially successful ex-Beatle, with  
hits like ``Silly Love Songs,'' ``My Love'' and ``Band on the 
Run.'' Linda McCartney was a member of his post-Beatles band, 
Wings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Piano Man'' Joel burst out of Long Island with a rocker's  
swagger and Tin Pan Alley songwriting skill. The wedding standard 
``Just the Way You Are,'' ``Uptown Girl'' and ``We Didn't Start the 
Fire'' are among his hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he continues to perform, Joel hasn't written a pop song  
in more than five years while he concentrates on classical 
composing. 
</P>
<P>
	British singer Springfield lost her long battle with breast  
cancer just before her induction. Her hits included ``You Don't 
Have to Say You Love Me.'' Her critical reputation deepened when 
she traveled to Memphis to record ``Son of a Preacher Man'' in 
1968. 
</P>
<P>
	The names of Hall of Fame honorees are on permanent exhibit at  
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum in Cleveland, which opened in 
1995.

<HEADLINE> Swingley Running Away With Iditarod </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHAKTOOLIK, Alaska (AP) -- Doug Swingley is surprising even  
himself in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley, of Lincoln, Mont., came to Alaska expecting to win his  
second Iditarod. But with this year's race more than three-quarters 
over, he's far ahead of everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley departed this Bering Sea coastal village today in his  
bid to make the 1999 Iditarod one of the most lopsided ever. He's 
headed for a stretch of trail that will take him across the sea ice 
of Norton Sound. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-time winner Martin Buser, from Big Lake, Alaska, was  
Swingley's closest competitor. But he was about 40 miles behind. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley, the Iditarod's 1995 winner, is running 12 dogs. Buser,  
who won the race in 1997, is down to nine. 
</P>
<P>
	The Iditarod's only five-time winner, Rick Swenson of Two  
Rivers, Alaska, pulled into Unalakleet today. He's driving 13 dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	The 90-mile run between Kaltag, the last checkpoint on the Yukon  
River, and Unalakleet, the first checkpoint on Norton Sound, is the 
longest in the 1,100-mile marathon from Anchorage to Nome. 
</P>
<P>
	The weather didn't make the crossing easy overnight. Swenson's  
sled was coated with ice when he arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	Swenson said bad weather was hampering visibility and several  
overflows on the trail dragged down his dogs and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to be here a few hours ago, but I'm glad to be here  
now,'' Swenson said after pulling into Unalakleet in third place. 
</P>
<P>
	Swenson covered that stretch of trail in 16 hours. That compares  
with about 10 hours for Swingley and 11 hours for Buser. Both of 
the leaders got through on the front end of a storm that might be 
slowing the other front-runners in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley hadn't relinquished the lead since arriving first into  
the race's midway point at the village of Iditarod. 
</P>
<P>
	Shaktoolik is about 170 miles from the finish line in Nome. At  
this pace, Swingley could arrive as early as Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the first dog death of the race occurred Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
	Jeremy Gebauer of Lincoln, Mont., who is running a team of young  
dogs from the Swingley kennel, pulled into the Anvik checkpoint 
Sunday with a dead dog in his sled, Iditarod officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gebauer, in his second Iditarod, said the 3-year-old male named  
Rodman died in harness less than a mile outside Anvik. 
</P>
<P>
	Race marshal Mark Nordman flew from Unalakleet to Anvik to  
discuss the circumstances of the dog's death with Gebauer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on my review of the situation, I have found no signs  
which should prohibit Jeremy from continuing his race,'' Nordman 
said in a written statement. Gebauer rested several hours in Anvik 
before heading up the frozen Yukon River. 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-nine teams were still on the trail today, down from the 56  
which started the race March 6. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner gets $54,000 from the $450,000 purse. Prize money is  
paid to the first 20 finishers.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Relations With Olympics Rocky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- America made the Olympics rich, and  
now America insists the Olympics make sweeping changes. 
</P>
<P>
	As they prepared Monday for a watershed assembly to deal with  
the corruption and fallout of Salt Lake City's winning bid for the 
2002 Winter Games, IOC officials chafed under strong criticism from 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Friction between the International Olympic Committee and its  
most important and powerful member nation is nothing new. The last 
two decades have been filled with clashes, from the White House-led 
boycott of the 1980 Moscow Games to the trashing of dorm rooms by 
U.S. pro hockey players at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano. 
</P>
<P>
	But three months of finger pointing primarily by U.S. interests  
and a relatively light rebuke for the U.S. Olympic Committee for 
its role in a scandal in its own back yard has the IOC fed up. 
</P>
<P>
	President Juan Antonio Samaranch has told friends and colleagues  
he is angered by the American onslaught. The IOC's latest internal 
investigation brought a sixth member expelled, a raft of warnings 
to others and a slap at the USOC for a lack of oversight in Salt 
Lake's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	And senior IOC officials have been outspoken in recent days  
about what they see as American interference in the international 
committee's affairs, especially in a scathing report by former 
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell 
</P>
<P>
	``We respect the Mitchell commission's work, but we are not  
prepared to shape our reforms to such statements or comply with the 
wishes of the international press,'' executive board member Kevan 
Gosper of Australia said. 
</P>
<P>
	The financial success of the 1984 Games in Los Angeles helped  
save the Olympics and make them a billion-dollar business. Now the 
flip side of that success, the accountability and responsibility of 
staging the world's biggest and most influential sports event, is 
being felt, and that, too, is born in the USA. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsors with $50 million contracts, most of them American  
based, have led the call for radical changes to the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. newspapers and broadcast networks have been relentless in  
criticizing the IOC and Samaranch for leading the Olympics down a 
gift-lined path. The New York Times has written five editorials on 
the scandal since it broke in late November, an unusually high 
number for one nonpolitical event. 
</P>
<P>
	And even the USOC, the IOC's branch office in the United States,  
has turned to the attack. It's independent ethics panel placed most 
of the blame for the scandal on the IOC, and last week USOC 
president Bill Hybl said he hoped that ``the IOC will match our 
commitment and action when it votes on reforms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch is incensed by the American line.  
</P>
<P>
	According to colleagues of the IOC leader who spoke on the  
condition of anonymity, Samaranch told friends last week that the 
United States had caused trouble throughout his more than 18 years 
in power. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited the Moscow boycott, the conflict-of-interest scandal  
involving former IOC member and USOC president Robert Helmick and 
the fact that an American city, Salt Lake, produced the biggest 
corruption case yet, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC also remains troubled by the 1996 Atlanta Games, where a  
bombing in Centennial Olympic Park killed one person and the five 
rings were surrounded by a tacky midway of beer stalls and T-shirt 
vendors. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, U.S. drug policy director Barry McCaffrey was among  
the most outspoken critics of the IOC at an international drug 
summit last month, saying the Salt Lake scandal had compromised the 
committee's leadership in the doping fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the USOC's leadership has taken shots at Samaranch.  
In addition to Hybl's statement, executive director Dick Schultz 
said he was uncertain the IOC was prepared to make the changes it 
should. 
</P>
<P>
	Schultz and Samaranch have become close since Schultz joined the  
USOC in 1995, in part because Samaranch does not feel Schultz is 
angling for an IOC membership. But even their friendship has its 
limits, and Schultz was upbraided by the IOC boss in January after 
saying he saw signs of a ``palace revolt'' against Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	Other IOC officials have been upset by the lack of heat directed  
at the USOC for the Salt Lake scandal. One high-ranking member said 
the USOC should change its initials to TNOC, for ``Teflon National 
Olympic committee. Nothing sticks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hybl said the USOC accepted part of the blame for Salt Lake's  
sins and had adopted changes recommended by the ethics report. 
</P>
<P>
	Gosper, increasingly at the front in the IOC's scandal defense,  
was angered by parts of that report that said the IOC has fostered 
a ``culture of improper gift-giving'' that led to Salt Lake's 
million-dollar scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	``We reject out of hand that allegation,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Gosper also questioned the USOC's recent request that the White  
House make the IOC subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, 
which forbids bribing of overseas governments. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think it applies,'' Gosper said. ``While efforts to  
confront bribery and corruption are appropriate, don't believe, in 
this case, that the mechanism is right.''

<HEADLINE> Buddy Holly's Survivors Sue MCA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUBBOCK, Texas (AP) -- Relatives of Buddy Holly sued MCA Records  
Monday, alleging that the company hoarded royalty payments, forged 
contracts and illegally produced albums without family consent. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages but Attorney Kevin  
Glasheen described it as a multi-million-dollar case. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's bad form to steal from a dead man, but unfortunately in  
the music industry it happens,'' Glasheen said. ``The problem is 
that MCA, just like a lot of people who owe money, won't pay it 
until they have to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles-based MCA Records, one of the nation's largest  
recording companies, did not return calls from The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit, filed in state court, charges that the contracts  
providing for royalties to Holly's heirs are legally questionable 
and should be redone. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs are Buddy Holly's widow, Maria Holly; his brothers,  
Larry and Travis Holley; and his sister Pat Holley. Buddy Holly 
dropped the 'e' from his last name, and his wife took the new 
spelling. Maria Holly lives in Dallas and Larry, Travis and Pat 
Holley live in Lubbock. 
</P>
<P>
	``The so-called recording agreements relied on by MCA are void  
and unenforceable and in certain circumstances, outright 
forgeries,'' the lawsuit says in reference to a contract that 
appears to be signed by Maria Holly and another contract signed by 
a manager the family claims had been fired by Holly. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit alleges MCA conned Holly's parents into signing an  
agreement for rights to Holly's music, even though recording 
officials knew ``the parents had no authority to contract for those 
recordings. 
</P>
<P>
	MCA also has ``grossly underpaid the fair market value of the  
royalties,'' the family alleges in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, after Buddy Holly died, the record company went  
through a lot of manipulations with his former manager to issue a 
lot of recordings,'' Glasheen said. ``MCA had agreed to pay the 
family additional royalties, but then wanted to add additional 
terms to the agreement.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Holly had several hit songs before he died in a plane crash at  
age 21 in 1959, including ``That'll Be the Day,'' ``Peggy Sue'' and 
``Maybe Baby.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Foreign Policy Ranked No. 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans rank President Clinton No. 1 among  
postwar U.S. presidents on foreign policy success, up from eighth 
place in the middle of his first term, according to a poll released 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, conducted every four years by the Gallup  
Organization for the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations, shows 
support for a strong defense and for efforts to fight terrorism and 
prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Less support is expressed for deployment of U.S. forces abroad.  
And, although the poll finds that more Americans measure strength 
in terms of economic than military power, there is less 
apprehension over economic competition from Japan or Europe than in 
previous surveys. 
</P>
<P>
	Mirroring high public satisfaction with the economy, the survey  
shows widespread contentment in the conduct of U.S. foreign 
affairs, despite rising Republican challenges to Clinton on his 
dealings with the Kosovo crisis, China's human rights performance, 
North Korea's weaponry programs, faltering Middle East peace 
efforts, Iraq's intransigence and other foreign policy issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey shows no indication that ordinary Americans view any  
of these as critical issues. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked to list the two or three biggest foreign policy  
problems facing the country, the most common response among the 
public, at 21 percent, was: ``I don't know.'' That was followed by 
mainly global issues: terrorism (12 percent), the world economy (11 
percent), balance of payments (10 percent) and the Middle East 
situation (8 percent.) 
</P>
<P>
	Gallup, which has conducted the survey in a similar manner since  
the 1970s, interviewed 1,507 men and women in October and November. 
The margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
Separately, the pollsters interviewed 379 policy leaders, including 
members of Congress, administration officials, international 
business figures and members of the news media. 
</P>
<P>
	In the leaders poll, which is less scientific but has included  
the same types of people every four years, the biggest problems 
cited were the world economy (21 percent), Iraq (18 percent), arms 
control (15 percent), Japan and the Asian economic crisis (13 
percent) and dealings with Russia (13 percent). 
</P>
<P>
	The survey was published today in the journal Foreign Policy.  
</P>
<P>
	Richard Haas, foreign policy director for the Brookings  
Institution, said the assessment of Clinton's foreign policy 
success reflects the prosperous times for Americans more than any 
real achievement abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people feel content with the world as it is, but  
history has a different standard,'' he told reporters at the 
presentation of the report. He said Clinton has missed several 
opportunities to develop a coherent post-Cold War strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton soared past Presidents Kennedy, Nixon, Truman,  
Eisenhower, Reagan, Bush and Carter, ranked in that order in 1994, 
to top the poll of presidents with ``very successful'' foreign 
policy performance since World War II. Only Presidents Ford and 
Johnson had trailed Clinton in the 1994 poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress also got improved marks, with 43 percent of those  
surveyed saying its role in foreign policy is about right, the 
highest number since the surveys began in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite general satisfaction with the direction of U.S. foreign  
policy, the survey revealed concern for the new century: 53 percent 
said they believe there will be more bloodshed and violence 
worldwide, with 19 percent predicting less. In the leaders survey, 
however, 40 percent said they believe there will be less violence 
and only 23 percent predicted more. 
</P>
<P>
	In the public poll, 84 percent listed terrorism as the most  
critical threat to the United States, up 15 points from the last 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions in the poll also ranked countries that respondents  
believe are vital to U.S. interests and gave each a ``thermometer 
rating'' on the respondent's warm or cold feelings. 
</P>
<P>
	Topping the list of vital countries was Japan, followed by  
Russia, Saudi Arabia, China and Israel. Among leaders, the ranking 
was China, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Canada, Saudi Arabia and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	On the thermometer, with 50 degrees being neutral, Canada topped  
the chart for the fifth survey in a row at 72 degrees and Iraq hit 
the bottom with 25 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, concern for foreign policy issues ranked below key  
domestic problems in the poll. The biggest concerns cited by the 
public were crime, Clinton's personal conduct, drug abuse and poor 
education. For leaders, top problems were education, 
dissatisfaction with government, immorality and the troubled Asian 
economy.

<P>
	Suddenly, Wally Szczerbiak goes to class and it's as if he never  
left the basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got in last night at 3 a.m. and there was a big welcome,''  
he said today. ``A lot of students were waiting for us. Today in 
class, I got a standing ovation when I walked in. The campus is 
buzzing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Szczerbiak and Miami of Ohio already have done better in the  
NCAA tournament than any team in school history. A 66-58 victory 
over Utah on Sunday marked the first time that the 10th-seeded 
RedHawks had won two games in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	After upsetting last year's title game runner-up, Miami (24-7)  
will play defending champion Kentucky (27-8) on Friday in St. 
Louis. The back-to-back games against Final Four teams give the 
RedHawks a chance to take their program to an unprecedented level. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's kind of interesting the way it works out,'' Szczerbiak  
said. ``To knock off the second-place team in the whole country and 
now to have the opportunity to knock off the best, that's an 
opportunity a lot of teams don't get. We want to make the best of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With coach Charlie Coles recovered from his cardiac arrest at  
last year's Mid-American Conference tournament and Szczerbiak back 
for his senior season, Miami expected big things from the outset. 
</P>
<P>
	The RedHawks broke into the Top 25 for the first time in 20  
years and won the MAC's regular-season championship. 
</P>
<P>
	They had to settle for an at-large bid after losing the MAC  
tournament title game to Kent in which Szczerbiak played despite a 
knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles gave his players the next two days off, a move that made  
all the difference. Szczerbiak's knee healed and the RedHawks 
pulled themselves out of their funk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach gave us two days off to totally get away from basketball  
and take our minds off the game,'' Szczerbiak said. ``That really 
helped everyone get better physically and refresh our minds. It was 
like basketball was fun again. It was enjoyable and we've carried 
that on through the NCAA tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Szczerbiak carried them through a first-round win over  
Washington, piling up 43 points of his team's 59 points. 
</P>
<P>
	He had 24 points in the victory over Utah, which didn't make the  
same mistake of leaving him open. Coles laughed Monday when asked 
if he thinks any other team will make that mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, no,'' he said. ``I hope people do, but I don't think so  
anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles decided to return to coaching this season after his  
near-death experience on court a year ago in part because he was so 
close to his senior class. Watching them in the NCAA tournament has 
been extremely gratifying. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been a team that's been through some heartaches  
together,'' Coles said. ``It means a lot, but it means more for me 
after a game like yesterday to see that they're really happy and 
we've got another game together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami played Kentucky in the second round in 1978 and lost  
91-69. Kentucky has won the last 17 games and leads their series 
19-4. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're very talented and very deep and like to dictate the  
tempo,'' Szczerbiak said. ``We're going to have to try to dictate 
our own tempo and slow the game down a little bit. If we can do 
that, we feel we can match up well.''

	``We've been a team that's been through some heartaches

we've got another game together.'' 
</P>

	Miami played Kentucky in the second round in 1978 and lost  
91-69. Kentucky has won the last 17 games and leads their series 
19-4.

	``They're very talented and very deep and like to dictate the

our own tempo and slow the game down a little bit. If we can do 
that, we feel we can match up well.''

<HEADLINE> HMO Group Requiring Outside Reviews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- HMOs must let patients appeal denials of care  
to outside experts if they want a seal of approval from the 
nation's largest accrediting group. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the latest in a string of private initiatives boosting the  
idea of external reviews, which both supporters and critics of 
managed care have come to support as a way to assure consumers they 
won't be unfairly denied treatment for financial reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Committee on Quality Assurance, which accredits  
about half of the nation's health maintenance organizations, plans 
to require these independent reviews beginning next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress is in the midst of considering regulations for HMOs,  
and mandatory external review is among the most popular provisions. 
Even business leaders who disdain federal mandates acknowledge that 
many consumer complaints could be resolved if they could be taken 
to independent experts who do not work for the HMO. 
</P>
<P>
	Some opponents of HMO regulations also have come to support  
external review as a way of arguing against more burdensome federal 
regulations, such as new rights to sue HMOs in court. 
</P>
<P>
	The accreditation group planned to release proposed details  
Tuesday for public comment, part of a set of requirements HMOs must 
meet in order to win accreditation. Many large employers look for 
the accreditation in choosing an HMO for their workers. The 
committee will issue final rules by July and they will take effect 
in July 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Other new proposals for accreditation include requiring HMOs to  
consult the proper specialists in reviewing complaints during the 
internal appeal that precedes any external review. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee also wants to require HMOs to allow patients to  
stay with their doctors during a course of treatment for up to 90 
days, even if the doctor is dropped from the health plan's network. 
</P>
<P>
	Virtually all HMOs allow patients to appeal decisions denying  
payment for care, but often the reviews are handled by people who 
work for the insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, though, some large insurance companies,  
including Aetna-U.S. Healthcare, have said they will allow their 
customers to appeal to outside boards that will have final say over 
what is covered. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last month, the HMO trade group, the American Association  
of Health Plans, said it will urge its members to adopt external 
appeals. The group also said it could accept federal legislation 
requiring it. 
</P>
<P>
	The quality committee said it hopes to move the debate along.  
``It's obviously something that's in the wind,'' said Margaret E. 
O'Kane, the group's president. 
</P>
<P>
	More importantly, O'Kane said, the group wants to assure that  
HMO appeal processes are done right. 
</P>
<P>
	``As usual, the devil is in the details,'' she said. ``We want  
to be sure that ... it's really an independent and credible 
process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The HMO trade group said it is also concerned about the details,  
though it supports the idea in concept. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is another important private-sector voice lending its  
support to the idea of outside review,'' said Susan Pisano, 
spokeswoman for AAHP. 
</P>
<P>
	About 18 states already require health plans operating inside  
their borders to offer external appeals, but those requirements 
only apply to plans regulated by states. Many large employers use 
health plans that fall under federal regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Committee for Quality Assurance accredits about 310  
of the nation's 630 HMOs and point-of-service health plans, 
including the largest. Those 310 plans serve about three-quarters 
of all Americans in HMOs.

<HEADLINE> Soybean, Grain Futures Drop / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Soybean and grain futures prices settled mostly  
lower Monday on the Chicago Board of Trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Dry weather in South America played a large role in pressuring  
futures prices, analysts said. Good weather would allow farmers 
there to harvest large corn and soybean crops in Argentina and 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	A strengthening Brazilian currency also could cause Brazilian  
farmers to sell quickly, further increasing the supply and causing 
worldwide prices to drop further, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Anemic corn and soybeans prices put some pressure on wheat  
futures early in the day -- though technical factors erased much of 
the losses by closing time. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for May delivery fell 1/4 cent to $2.72 1/4 a bushel; May corn  
fell 2 3/4 cents to 2.20 a bushel; May oats dropped 1 1/4 cents to $1.09 3/4 
a bushel, and May soybeans were down 3 1/2 cents to $4.71 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, beef and pork futures finished lower on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	April live cattle futures fell 0.80 cent to 66.35 cents a pound;  
March feeder cattle dropped 0.23 cent to 71.57 cents per pound; 
April lean hogs fell a cent to 41.07 cents a pound; and March pork 
bellies dropped 0.72 cent to 48 cents per pound.

<HEADLINE> Albanians Pledge To Sign Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After weeks of uncertainty, ethnic Albanians  
have pledged to sign a Kosovo peace agreement in Paris, National 
Security Council director Sandy Berger said today. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the commitment was made by Hashim Thaci, head of the  
Albanian delegation, in a letter delivered to the Clinton 
administration today. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly their acceptance of the agreement in full and their  
willingness to sign is an important development and tips the focus 
now entirely on Mr. (Slobodan) Milosevic to make a choice between 
peace and further bloodshed and conflict,'' Berger said at the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger's announcement came as rival Serb and ethnic Albanians  
renewed negotiations in Paris and as new violence flared in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Berger said the Kosovars' pledge was made after a telephone call  
Sunday evening between Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and 
Thaci. ``We have received this morning a letter signed by Mr. Thaci 
... saying that the Kosovars are prepared to sign the agreement, 
saying that in unequivocal terms,'' Berger said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a separate meeting with reporters, NATO Secretary-General  
Javier Solana said the Albanians were about to sign the self-rule 
proposal. ``I have no question about that,'' he said, shortly 
before going to the White House to meet with President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are going to put some conditions, most important of which  
is NATO deployment'' of a peacekeeping force if the Serbs concur, 
said Solana, here to plan for the NATO summit. 
</P>
<P>
	He gave no indication that Yugoslav President Milosevic would  
relent in his opposition to having foreign troops in the Serb 
province. In fact, Solana said he was ``very, very concerned with 
the situation in Kosovo,'' fearing that Milosevic would move 
against civilians in the province.

<HEADLINE> Ciena To Buy 2 Communications Cos. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINTHICUM, Md. (AP) -- Ciena Corp. is buying two optical  
communications companies for stock worth nearly $1 billion, the 
networking equipment maker announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lightera, based in Cupertino, Ca., builds optical switches and  
operating systems for fiber optic networks. Omnia of Marlborough, 
Mass., builds equipment that allows telephone companies to provide 
voice and data services through fiber optic networks. 
</P>
<P>
	Both are privately-held companies.  
</P>
<P>
	Ciena, based in Linthicum, Md., makes devices that enable fiber  
optic lines to carry more data. The company will issue 20.6 million 
shares to acquire Lightera and 16 million shares to acquire Omnia. 
</P>
<P>
	The deals come about six months after Tellabs Inc. called off an  
agreement to acquire Ciena, blaming a series of financial setbacks 
at Ciena. 
</P>

	Ciena's stock closed down $2.06 1/4 a share, or more than 7  
percent, at $24.75 in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The stock 
fell from a high of $92.37 5/8 last July to a low of $8.12 1/2 after the 
Tellabs deal unraveled.

<HEADLINE> Panel Wants Tougher Seat Belt Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- To prevent child deaths in car crashes, an  
expert panel recommended Monday that seat belt laws be strengthened 
and older children stay in booster seats longer before graduating 
to seat belts. 
</P>
<P>
	Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater had asked the panel to  
come up with recommendations for children aged 4 through 15 because 
so many die in auto crashes while riding unrestrained. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, car crashes killed 1,627 children in that age group. Of  
those, 1,015 were unrestrained. Properly used booster seats and 
safety belts would have prevented about 500 of the deaths, said 
Phil Haseltine, head of the panel of government, medical, industry 
and consumer safety experts. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a crash, unrestrained kids become missiles flying about the  
vehicle interior,'' Haseltine said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another problem is that children often are not secured by  
restraints appropriate for their ages and weights, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel said children who have outgrown child seats should use  
booster seats at least to age 8. Only 5 percent of children ages 4 
to 8 currently ride in booster seats, which allow lap and shoulder 
belts to be positioned properly over a child's hips and chest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parents frequently do not know what a booster seat is,''  
Haseltine said. ``Retail sales (of booster seats) are so low some 
manufacturers don't want to stock them on their shelves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christine Guarino of Germantown, Md., always placed her  
5-year-old son, Stephen, in a booster seat. In February, a dump 
truck tore into the right side of her minivan near Stephen. The 
crash left the boy's right leg resting against the truck's bumper, 
Mrs. Guarino said, but his booster seat protected him from injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was still in his car seat, safe as can be,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The panel also recommended that:  
</P>
<P>
	--States tighten seat belt laws and enforce them so that children  
must buckle up. 
</P>
<P>
	In all 50 states, laws require children to be restrained in  
vehicles but normally target children only to ages 4 or 5. In 
contrast, although the government recommends that all children 
under age 13 ride in back seats, most states lack seat belt laws 
requiring older children to be restrained in the back. 
</P>
<P>
	--A crash dummy representing a 10-year-old dummy should be  
developed to help understand child injuries better. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel said Congress should increase the federal motor fuel  
tax by one-half of a cent, generating $750 million to pay for 
research and other safety programs.

<HEADLINE> Burlington To Buy Denim Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- Textile giant Burlington Industries,  
which produces fabric for all the major jeans retailers, will now 
sew denim clothes as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's denim subsidiary announced Monday it has agreed to  
buy a new jeans sewing facility from Lucky Star Industries in 
Mexico for an undisclosed price. 
</P>
<P>
	While Burlington has contracted work with outside garment makers  
to turn their denim into clothing for retailers in the past, the 
plant would become the first Burlington facility to actually sew 
clothing in-house. 
</P>
<P>
	The plant in Aguascalientes, Mexico opened early last year and  
is expected to be in full production by the end of 1999. At full 
capacity it will employ about 1,200 people. The transaction is 
expected to be completed by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	Dutch Leonard, president of Burlington Global Denim, said the  
garments produced by Burlington products should compete effectively 
against Asian imports. 
</P>
<P>
	Less expensive Asian jeans sold in the U.S. in part prompted  
Burlington in January to announce denim plant closings in 
Mooresville and Hillsville, Va. The two plants were among seven to 
be closed nationwide in moves that will eliminate 2,900 positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Burlington Global Denim also produces denim at a plant in  
Stonewall, Miss., and another in Mexico.

	2nd Round of Kosovo Talks Open

<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- The second round of Kosovo peace talks opened today  
with little apparent hope of a deal between rival Serbs and ethnic 
Albanians. The failure of the talks could lead to NATO bombardment 
of Serb strategic targets. Three weeks after the first round of 
talks ended without a deal, the Serb and ethnic Albanian 
delegations entered a Paris conference center for separate sessions 
with mediators. Phil Reeker, chief spokesman for the conference, 
said this time, the meeting will last ``a few days at most.''

	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- The defense in the sex and  
corruption trial of ousted Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim 
rested its case today after the judge dealt it a stunning blow by 
refusing to hear crucial witnesses. Lawyers for Anwar had appealed 
to the trial judge to allow witnesses on the stand who claim they 
were tortured by police into testifying against the jailed 
politician. Defense lawyers said the witnesses, some of whom have 
served jail terms for allegedly having homosexual relations with 
Anwar, were ``tortured until they fabricated stories'' against him.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Music lessons coupled with a special computer  
program significantly increased the math skills of children at an 
inner city elementary school, according to a study. Learning piano 
and how to read music helped the children to recognize rhythmic 
values, note values -- such as an eighth note being half of a 
quarter note -- and identify letter names -- E, G, B, D, F -- from a 
note's scale placement, the researchers said. The computer program 
included spatial exercises such as assembling pieces of a puzzle 
and arranging geometric pieces in particular orders, according to 
the report in today's edition of Neurological Research.

	Death Toll at 28 in New Delhi Blaze  
</P>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- The death toll rose to 28 in a fire that  
swept through a New Delhi slum crowded with tinder-dry shacks and 
mounds of scrap collected by residents who scratched out a living 
selling paper and plastic to recyclers. Local news agencies today 
put the toll at 28, up from 22 a day before. Police were 
investigating the cause. Noxious smoke from burning plastic made 
yesterday's fire especially hard to control. In addition, 
firefighters had to bulldoze shacks along the slum's narrow lanes 
to make way for their trucks.

smokers could be at a higher risk of turning into criminals. 
Although such links have been studied in children and teen-agers, 
researchers say a study published in this month's Archives of 
General Psychiatry is the first to examine the relationship between 
mothers who smoke and the actions of their mature offspring. While 
stopping short of saying that babies whose mothers smoked while 
pregnant will become criminals, researchers say their findings are 
significant.

<HEADLINE> Montana Man Dominating Iditarod </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNALAKLEET, Alaska (AP) -- Were the 1999 Iditarod Trail Sled Dog  
Race a political campaign, the vanquished already would have made 
their concession speeches to Doug Swingley. 
</P>
<P>
	Short of a catastrophe in the next day, Swingley will claim his  
second Iditarod title. For everyone else, the race now is to decide 
where they fit in behind him. 
</P>
<P>
	Swingley, from Lincoln, Mont., crossed ice-covered Norton Bay  
and pulled into the village of Koyuk at 10:55 a.m. Alaska time 
(2:55 p.m. EST) Monday. Koyuk is about 170 miles from the 
Iditarod's finish line in Nome. 
</P>
<P>
	At his current pace, Swingley could reach Nome as soon as  
Tuesday evening and claim the $54,000 paycheck and new pickup truck 
that goes to the winner of the 1,100-mile race across the Alaska 
wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
	He was more than nine hours in front of Martin Buser of Big  
Lake, Alaska, who arrived in Shaktoolik at 9:20 a.m. with nine 
dogs. Shaktoolik, on the Bering Sea coast, is about 60 miles from 
Koyuk. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time a winner finished that far in front of the  
runner-up was 1992, when Buser reached Nome 10 hours ahead of 
four-time champion Susan Butcher. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's not many Iditarods where a guy finds himself this far  
out in front, and not having anybody breathing down his throat,'' 
Swingley said late Sunday just before leaving Unalakleet, 100 miles 
from Koyuk, with a team of 12 dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	Buser had an eight-hour cushion for second place, but third  
through 14th positions all were up for grabs Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	While the thrill's not the same as winning, there's a powerful  
incentive for mushers to move up. Third place pays about $41,000, 
while 14th pays about $11,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Rick Swenson of Two Rivers, Alaska, currently running third,  
said Monday he was feeling some pressure from behind. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're creeping up,'' he said, pulling on his heavy boots as  
a first step to leaving Unalakleet. ``You don't see them for days, 
and then all of a sudden they're right here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Jeff King of Denali Park, Alaska, was fourth  
into Unalakleet at about 10 a.m., 90 minutes after Swenson. Within 
the next 90 minutes came four other Alaskans -- Paul Gebhardt of 
Kasilof, John Baker of Kotzebue, Vern Halter of Willow and Bill 
Cotter of Nenana. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker, Halter and Cotter were among a group of nine mushers who  
struck out from Kaltag in quick succession starting at 11 p.m. 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The mushers were tested on the 90 miles of sometimes-nasty trail  
from Kaltag to Unalakleet. As if climbing through a mountain pass 
into a headwind wasn't tough enough, they also had to slog through 
a stretch of overflow -- slushy snow calf-deep on top of a 
frozen-over river. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the worst overflow I've ever been in my life,'' said  
King, who likened it to sticky concrete. ``The dogs wouldn't go on 
it because it was so slippery, so I'd go on it and I'd break 
through.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The overflow was the latest race challenge for the frontrunners.  
They hit badly rutted trail in the first 200 miles, followed by 
brutal cold, then cold along with a 20-mph headwind. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the overflow, Gebhardt said, ``I wouldn't call it icing on  
the cake because we still have to have a ground blizzard'' -- snow 
kicked up by strong winds that creates whiteout conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	While Swingley could be sleeping in a warm, comfortable bed by  
Tuesday, the back of the pack may have a week or more of mushing 
ahead of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Bringing up the rear was Shane Goosen, a rookie from Wasilla,  
Alaska. He was headed for Shageluk on Monday, about 500 miles from 
Nome.

<HEADLINE> Clinton-Congress Feud Fits Pattern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the long, unequal struggle between the  
White House and Congress over the power to send American troops to 
danger zones abroad, presidents insist they can act without asking. 
</P>
<P>
	And that they have done, since World War II.  
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's Kosovo peacekeeping mission fits the  
pattern, although it would begin with grudging House approval he 
didn't seek and didn't want debated in advance. The Senate may 
consider the Kosovo mission this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration was wary of House action, fearing that a  
rebuff would undermine Kosovo peace efforts in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	When he won, 219 to 191 Thursday night, Clinton said it was  
broad bipartisan support for the commitment he'd made a month 
before. It came with conditions -- including a report to Congress on 
how long the mission would last, a problem for Clinton since he set 
a deadline on another peacekeeping mission to the Balkans and 
couldn't meet it. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither the approval nor the conditions are binding. It's a  
message, not a law. 
</P>
<P>
	But the three-year peace deal that would put a NATO force in  
Kosovo, including 4,000 Americans, still hasn't been settled. The 
Yugoslav side in the civil war is resisting, and Clinton said 
Monday that unless the Serbs yield, there would be little option 
but to punish them with airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	All of this comes at a difficult point for Clinton, with  
Republicans bearing down on criticism of his foreign policy over 
Chinese nuclear spying, Iraq and deployments in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	But he isn't yielding on his war powers. ``Every president has  
reserved the right to both receive the ... support or endure the 
opposition of Congress, but not to give up the constitutional 
responsibility to deploy United States forces in peacetime,'' he 
said. ``And I think my predecessors were right about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congresses have tried, fruitlessly, to find a way to share that  
power in the era of undeclared wars. There's a system on the books 
requiring approval to keep Americans in areas of possible conflict 
for more than three months after a president orders them there, but 
it never worked. 
</P>
<P>
	Hence the debate.  
</P>
<P>
	``What we have continually done over the past six or seven years  
is when the president has moved troops into someplace, we have 
acquiesced, just nodded our heads and done it,'' House Speaker 
Dennis Hastert said. Congress later has to appropriate the funds to 
pay for the missions, but at that point, the argument is that to 
deny it would be to withhold support from American troops. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidents, Clinton included, promise to consult with Congress  
on military missions abroad. But not to seek clearance. Clinton 
ordered airstrikes against Iraq two days before he was impeached on 
Dec. 19, raids that delayed that vote and led the House to adopt a 
resolution backing U.S. forces in action. 
</P>
<P>
	When Clinton sent peacekeeping forces to Bosnia in late 1995,  
Congress approved in a resolution agreeing ``notwithstanding 
reservations'' and pointedly calling it the president's commitment. 
</P>
<P>
	That measure also cited Clinton's pledge to have the troops out  
in a year, which remains unmet, as the administration acknowledged 
when the deadline came and went. The force has been cut by about 
two-thirds, but more than 6,200 Americans are still there. 
</P>
<P>
	On Kosovo, Clinton is being more cautious, noting that he is in  
``sort of a double bind,'' given that experience and the demands 
for a deadline now. ``The exit strategy should be defined by the 
missions,'' he said, and added: 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't intend to make an open-ended commitment.''  
</P>
<P>
	That is not easily avoided when trying to make peace among the  
ethnic enemies of what was Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	In the House debate on Kosovo, one Republican invoked the  
judgment of British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, who said in 
1878 that Serbia, Bosnia, and other Balkan provinces were a region 
of ``political intrigues, constant rivalries, a total absence of 
public spirit, hatred of all races, animosities of rival religions, 
and an absence of any controlling power. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing short of an army of 50,000 of the best troops would  
produce anything like order in these parts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO would have more than 60,000 in those parts, with both a new  
Kosovo peacekeeping mission and the multinational force in Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Japan's EPA Optimistic on Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Though still mired in a severe slump, Japan's  
economy is close to bottoming out -- largely as a result of 
government support measures, the Economic Planning Agency said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In its March report on the economy, the EPA described overall  
conditions as ``extremely severe,'' but said the economy's 
``downward movement continues to slow to a halt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a big change,'' said Takashi Omori, director of the  
national economic division at the agency's research bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	The official optimism comes just days after the EPA announced  
Japan's economy shrank for an unprecedented fifth straight quarter 
in the last three months of 1998, confirming the country remains in 
its worst recession in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the severity of the gross domestic product data, the  
optimism of Tuesday's report was in line with growing notions among 
many officials and investors that the worst of Japan's economic 
malaise may be over. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA was joined Tuesday by the Bank of Japan, which also  
slightly upgraded its assessment of the Japanese economy in a 
monthly report, saying it ``appears to have stopped 
deteriorating.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The BOJ, however, said consumer sentiment remained cautious and  
corporate capital expenditures are expected to continue falling in 
the near term. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is still difficult to expect an immediate, self-sustained  
recovery in private demand,'' the central bank said. 
</P>
<P>
	One sign has been a recent jump in stock prices. With its close  
Monday at 15,779.60, the benchmark Nikkei stock index has risen by 
about 1,600 points in little more than a week, partly due to 
budding optimism. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to rising public works outlays resulting from fiscal  
stimulus packages, which the EPA said have made public investment 
``solid,'' government efforts to lower both long- and short-term 
interest rates have been successful, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the EPA's report Tuesday was cautious, generally  
balancing every optimistic sign with a dose of pessimism. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although some areas are bottoming out, we must watch  
cautiously before we can say that the economic situation will get 
better from now,'' Omori said. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA said personal consumption has almost stopped declining  
but remains weak due to ``sluggish'' income. Because many companies 
have recently cut back on overtime hours and reduced bonus 
payments, disposable income has fallen in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to a weak wage outlook, the employment situation  
remains severe, the EPA said. Despite signs that the recent decline 
in the number of employed workers may be leveling off, the jobless 
rate remains at a record-high 4.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA also noted that corporate bankruptcies are sharply down,  
reflecting the effects of a government-backed loan guarantee system 
for small- and medium-sized companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporate bankruptcies fell to 955 in February, down 40 percent  
from a year earlier and 5 percent lower from January. It was the 
first time in more than six years that the number fell below 1,000, 
according to private credit research agency Teikoku Databank Ltd.

<HEADLINE> Banks' Profits Up 4.7 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's commercial banks had a seventh  
straight year of record profits in 1998 as earnings rose 4.7 
percent to $61.9 billion, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. 
reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings at the country's 8,774 commercial banks were boosted by  
fee income, the FDIC said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Healthy, profitable banks support the economic growth and  
prosperity we enjoy today,'' FDIC Chairwoman Donna Tanoue said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The report came a day after news that Fleet Financial Group Inc.  
plans to acquire BankBoston Corp. for $16 billion in stock in a 
deal that will create the nation's eighth-largest bank and the 
dominant lender in New England. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDIC noted that U.S. banks' record profits last year came  
despite restructuring expenses related to mergers of some big 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	In the case of Fleet and BankBoston, the combined bank will be  
faced with overlapping branches and administrative operations, and 
executives said it may have to cut as many as 5,000 jobs from the 
banks' total work force of 59,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDIC said nationwide bank profits declined 2.5 percent in  
the fourth quarter of 1998 to $14.9 billion, weakened by continued 
lower earnings from foreign operations and the restructuring costs 
from mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	A basic yardstick of bank profitability -- return on assets -- was  
an average 1.11 percent in the October-December quarter, down from 
1.24 percent a year earlier. A majority of banks, 54.6 percent, 
reported lower returns on assets than in the fourth quarter of 
1997, the FDIC said.

<HEADLINE> Fleet Group To Acquire BankBoston </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Fleet Financial Group Inc. plans to acquire  
BankBoston Corp. for $16 billion in stock in a deal that will 
create the nation's eighth-largest bank and the dominant lender in 
New England. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, announced Sunday, will strengthen Fleet's  
international and investment banking business and give BankBoston 
the muscle it needs to compete against bigger financial 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	However, faced with overlapping branches and administrative  
operations, the combined banks may have to cut as many as 5,000 
jobs from their total work force of 59,000, executives said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The new bank, to be named Fleet Boston Corp., will initially be  
headed by Fleet chief executive officer Terrence Murray. After two 
years, Murray, 59, will be succeeded as CEO by current BankBoston 
chief executive Charles K. ``Chad'' Gifford, 56. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal must be approved by shareholders and regulators.  
</P>
<P>
	Eugene McQuade, chief financial officer for Fleet, said the two  
banks have had preliminary discussions with regulators and estimate 
the combined bank will have to divest about $13 billion of their 
$180 billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of the agreement, BankBoston shareholders will  
receive 1.1844 shares of Fleet for each BankBoston share they own. 
The transaction values BankBoston shares at $53.00, a 13 percent 
premium over Friday's closing stock price of $46.93 3/4. Shares of 
Fleet closed Friday at $44.75, also on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleet is the nation's ninth-largest bank with assets of $104  
billion. BankBoston is the 15th-largest bank with assets of $74 
billion.

<HEADLINE> Stojko Ready for World Skating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	When Elvis Stojko arrives in Finland for next week's World  
Figure Skating Championships, he expects to be at 99 percent of 
capacity. Considering where he has come from, that's encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
	Not so encouraging is that, even at 100 percent, he might not be  
able to handle a strong field of Russians. 
</P>
<P>
	Stojko, a three-time world champion from Canada, has competed  
only sporadically -- and not particularly well -- since severely 
tearing a groin muscle at the Nagano Olympics 13 months ago. That 
he is even back on the ice at all is a measure of his courage. 
</P>
<P>
	So give Stojko his due -- just challenging defending champion  
Alexei Yagudin and the other Russians will be a major achievement. 
</P>
<P>
	``My doctors say it usually takes two years to heal from that  
and I was back on the ice in six months,'' Stojko said Monday. ``It 
was a real struggle and it still is. The time I had off put me 
behind all season; I've been behind everybody and trying to catch 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	``But this season is not about the results, but where I want to  
be and making people understand how tough it is. This injury has 
taken other athletes out of their careers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stojko wouldn't let that happen. Sure, he could have turned pro  
and headed off to one of the tours. Indeed, he will skate in the 
John Hancock Champions on Ice show for most of the spring. 
</P>
<P>
	But he still feels an emptiness, partly from not winning Olympic  
gold -- Stojko was the silver medalist in the last two games -- and 
mainly from the way he was so limited on skating's biggest stage in 
Nagano. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it has helped being more mature,'' said Stojko, who  
finished third against a weak field at the Four Continents 
championship two weeks ago. ``You learn more patience and I know my 
body is healing better and faster when I am patient. The doctors 
said they were so surprised I was back on the ice in six months, 
and it was because of the patience. You learn from pushing too hard 
and learn your limit of where you can stress the point. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to really pace yourself, and on those days you feel  
good, you might start to push yourself and you can set yourself 
back. You are all pumped up during the season and you want to do 
it, and you have to back off and listen to your body and what it is 
telling yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stojko's body told him to ease into things, so he skipped  
several internationals, including the Grand Prix finals last week. 
He qualified for that event by finishing sixth in the points 
standings, with a fourth-place spot at Skate America and a second 
at Skate Canada. When fully healthy, Stojko might have won both 
competitions. 
</P>
<P>
	But the results weren't a disappointment to him.  
</P>
<P>
	``The public expects it and the critics expect it,'' he said of  
winning, ``but you put it aside and focus on what you have to get 
done. I had to, so to speak, get back on top of my game and feel 
good about skating. Then I can get back to the results. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can only do what you are capable of at this time.''  
</P>
<P>
	What is Stojko capable of in Helsinki?  
</P>
<P>
	``I will go for it,'' he said, ``and pull out all the stops.''

<HEADLINE> Sen. McCain Slams Clinton Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration's inability to run  
a foreign policy worthy of the world's only superpower has 
endangered national security and left the United States more 
vulnerable to aggression from China, Republican presidential 
hopeful Sen. John McCain said today. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first major foreign policy speech of his emerging  
campaign for the White House, McCain, R-Ariz., also lambasted the 
administration for a lack of long-term strategy in dealing with 
North Korea, Iraq and the recurring violence in the former 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's tendency has been to ``put off resolution of  
the most difficult problems, often substituting photo-op diplomacy 
for meaningful action,'' said McCain, a member of the Senate Armed 
Services Committee and decorated Vietnam War veteran. 
</P>
<P>
	``Often evident in administration policies is a mystifying  
uncertainty about how to act in a world where we are the only 
superpower,'' McCain said in a speech prepared for delivery at 
Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kan. ``Nowhere has this 
confusion been more evident than in our relationship with China.'' 
</P>
<P>
	America must engage China and work toward bringing it into the  
international community, McCain said, but ``we must also prepare 
for the other contingency, that China emerges as the primary threat 
to American interests and values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has sacrificed national security for the sake  
of engaging China, he contended, and that has ``left the United 
States more vulnerable to a ballistic missile attack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House has drawn fire recently over the  
administration's handling of allegations that China stole missile 
technology from a federal nuclear weapons lab in the 1980s. The 
issue has renewed questions about whether Clinton's policy was 
tainted by alleged illegal campaign contributions and the transfer 
of satellite technology that may have been used by the Chinese 
military. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, who is expected to formally declare for the GOP  
presidential nomination this spring, gave few specifics of what 
policies his administration would pursue. He did embrace a popular 
defense issue of the moment in Washington, calling for creation of 
a defense against ballistic missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	In a patriotic appeal, McCain called the United States ``the  
indispensable nation because we have proven to be the greatest 
force for good in human history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he said the United States should never cede its leadership  
in the world to the United Nations. ``It has its uses, but to 
confer on that diverse organization the leading responsibility for 
international stability, freedom and justice will quickly render it 
incapable of any task whatsoever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain called for a ``rogue state rollback'' policy, which, like  
the so-called Reagan Doctrine, would support ``indigenous and 
outside forces that desire to overthrow the odious regimes that 
rule'' Iraq, North Korea and other ``rogue'' nations. 
</P>
<P>
	And sounding a personal note, McCain said he would bring his  
experience -- as a Navy fighter pilot who was a prisoner of war in 
Vietnam for 5 1/2 years -- to the role of commander in chief. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have seen war. What are today horribly compelling televised  
images were once the whole of reality for me,'' he said. When 
American troops are lost in the service of foreign policy, 
``whether others were involved in the decision or not, the 
president will be lonely man in a dark room when the casualty 
reports come in.''

<HEADLINE> Japan Account Surplus Surges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's trade surplus climbed 72.2 percent in  
January compared to the same month last year, reflecting sluggish 
demand for imports as the country struggles to pull out of a 
prolonged recession. 
</P>
<P>
	The current account surplus -- Japan's broadest measure of trade  
-- jumped to a non-seasonally adjusted $6.78 billion in the first 
month of the year, the finance ministry said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the biggest surplus ever for January, beating the $6.53  
billion surplus at the outset of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, Japan said its current account surplus for all of  
1998 surged 38.7 percent to an unprecedented $133.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Economists say Japan's surplus, a constant source of friction  
with trading partners such as the United States, may continue to 
balloon as consumers shy away from imported goods amid the 
country's worst recession since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks to us premature to say that the surplus has peaked,''  
said Richard Jerram, an economist in the Tokyo office of ING Baring 
Securities (Japan) Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the pace of growth in the surplus is expected to slow  
over the next six months or so as the economy begins to bottom out. 
</P>
<P>
	``The very severe recession we saw in 1998 is easing,'' Jerram  
said, adding that this should boost demand for imports in the 
coming months. 
</P>
<P>
	Imports in January dropped 24.5 percent to $20.2 billion,  
offsetting a 10.9 percent fall in exports to $27.7 billion, the 
government said. 
</P>
<P>
	The surplus in trade and services alone soared by more than 20  
times the amount in January of 1998 to $3.57 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The current account, which measures trade in merchandise,  
services, tourism and investment, is calculated by determining the 
difference between Japan's income from foreign sources against 
payments on foreign obligations. It excludes net capital 
investment.

<HEADLINE> Girl's Tip Leads to Murder Arrests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Three men wanted for two rape-slayings were  
arrested after the 10-year-old daughter of one of the suspects 
recognized her father on television, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspects, including the girl's father, Ronald Hinton, were  
ordered held without bond Monday on charges of rape and murder. 
</P>
<P>
	The photo identified by the girl was taken by a surveillance  
camera at an automatic teller machine at the moment that one of the 
slain women's card was used. The photo was broadcast on television, 
and the girl told her teacher it was her father. School officials 
contacted police. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's fascinating that a very evil crime spree was basically  
stopped by something as innocent as a third-grader having a 
conversation with her teacher,'' said Assistant State's Attorney 
Thomas Epach. 
</P>
<P>
	Charged with first-degree murder, aggravated criminal sexual  
assault and home invasion were Hinton, 26, Ronald Sanders, 25, and 
David Wales, 26, all of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	All three are accused of raping and strangling Merceda Ares, 31,  
who was killed Feb. 13 in her apartment in Rogers Park, a 
neighborhood at Chicago's north city limits. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinton and Sanders are additionally charged with the rape and  
slaying of 36-year-old Keary Gagnier in Rogers Park in August.

	Hinton is accused of using an ATM card belonging to one of the  
victims. Police picked up Hinton over the weekend based on his 
daughter's statement, which led to the arrest of Sanders and Wales. 
Police said that all three suspects have given statements

<HEADLINE> No Consensus on NFL Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Before deciding whether to put a 32nd franchise  
in Houston or Los Angeles, NFL owners may have to amend their rule 
that requires a three-quarters vote for major decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The owners adjourned Monday with no consensus on where they  
would put an expansion team, or even if they would expand at all. 
The main obstacle, much as it was a decade ago during a seven-month 
debate over the commissioner's job, is the rule that requires 24 of 
the 31 teams to agree. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have 24 votes to go to 32 teams, we don't have 24  
votes to go to Houston and we don't have 24 votes to go to Los 
Angeles,'' said Jerry Richardson of Carolina, chairman of the 
league's expansion committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have 24 votes for Bob McNair, we don't have 24 votes  
for Michael Ovitz and we don't have 24 votes for Eli Broad. We 
don't have 24 votes for Carson and we don't have 24 votes for the 
Coliseum,'' he added, referring to three of the prospective owners 
in the two cities and the two Los Angeles sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The main dilemma, as set forth privately by some owners, is that  
everything the owners want is in Houston: an owner they like 
(McNair), a good stadium plan, and public and private financing in 
place. McNair also has guaranteed sellouts for the first five 
seasons in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	But what they really want is a team in Los Angeles, where there  
are 5.5 million television homes, compared to 4 million in Houston. 
But it's also where there are two separate ownership groups, 
financing remains uncertain, and there are two separate stadium 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the day, commissioner Paul Tagliabue said  
Richardson's committee would present its recommendation to the 31 
teams. He also said it was ``conceivable but unlikely'' that the 
owners would adjourn without a decision on expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	It seems more likely now that the expansion committee deferred  
its decision so that all 31 teams can have their say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just about everybody has a different point of view. It's a  
difficult situation,'' Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some team owners spoke strongly for LA, others for Houston,''  
said Joe Browne, the league's chief spokesman. ``The committee will 
take some of the views and discuss them during their meeting 
Wednesday morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are some owners who are in no hurry to expand.  
</P>
<P>
	One is Jerry Jones of Dallas, another is Red McCombs of  
Minnesota, who said: ``I see no clamor for a 32nd team. I think 
we're OK with 31.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Tagliabue and many owners point to the scheduling problems  
with an odd number of teams. Next season, with Cleveland rejoining 
the NFL as an expansion team, there will have to be a team with a 
bye each week of the season, including the first and last. 
</P>
<P>
	One answer would be awarding a team to Los Angeles and allowing  
McNair to find a team willing to move to Houston. He already has 
made overtures by letter to nine different teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we can keep Los Angeles hanging,'' said Ralph  
Wilson of Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I don't really care that much. I just want to see what's  
best for the league. By the time the stadium is built I'll be 90 
years old and probably won't care much where we play.''

<HEADLINE> Enzyme Found That May Feed Tumors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a dramatic advance in the understanding of  
cancer, researchers have found an enzyme that helps build the blood 
vessels that feed the growth of tumors, a major step toward finding 
new drugs to attack the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers at Duke University in Durham, N.C., report that they  
have found -- on the surface of cells inside blood vessels -- a type 
of enzyme, called ATP synthase. 
</P>
<P>
	The enzyme apparently provides the energy for the growth of  
blood vessels, said Dr. Salvatore V. Pizzo, a member of the Duke 
team and co-author of a study appearing Tuesday in the Proceedings 
of the National Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	Without such energy, he said, tumors can never grow beyond the  
size of a pin head. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers in many labs have recently been studying the growth  
of blood vessels that supply cancer tumors with oxygen and 
nutrients -- searching for possible ways to shut off that blood 
vessel growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The research intensified after Dr. Judah Folkman of Children's  
Hospital in Boston showed that a compound he calls angiostatin 
could stop tumor growth in mice by blocking the formation of blood 
vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, a number of compounds that can block blood vessel  
formation have been discovered. In fact, a separate paper in 
Proceedings on Tuesday reports on isolating such a substance from 
cartilage. Researchers have been able to isolate angiostatin, which 
also occurs naturally in the body, and synthesize it in 
laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	But exactly how angiostatin and similar compounds work has not  
been known. The Duke discovery may be the answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until now, people knew that angiostatin blocked blood vessel  
growth, but there was no obvious mechanism,'' said Pizzo. ``Now we 
know why it works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study ``is a big jump ahead,'' said Folkman, '' ... because  
it identifies a protein that binds (attaches to) angiostatin'' and 
suggests how angiostatin prevents blood vessel growth. The 
discovery puts researchers on track to isolate a compound from 
angiostatin that could work more directly to block blood vessel 
formation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery of ATP on the surface of endothelial cells, the  
lining of blood vessels, came as a surprise, said Pizzo. The enzyme 
was previously found only inside cells. 
</P>
<P>
	``ATP is what the cells use as a fuel, as an energy source,''  
said Pizzo. ``It is present inside the cell, in the mitochondria, 
and is the little energy factory for the cell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The enzyme apparently is activated when the blood's oxygen  
content is lowered. Nature may have designed ATP as a healing 
mechanism, to build new vessels so the body can repair tissue 
damaged by injury or disease, said Pizzo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tumors are that way,'' he said. ``Tumors tend to take  
advantage of a normal mechanism in the body and then exaggerate it 
to their own growth advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When tumors do form, cells in the center of the growth are  
deprived of oxygen. That may trigger the formation and action of 
ATP, said Pizzo. 
</P>
<P>
	With a better understanding of how ATP causes blood vessels to  
grow, researchers also might be able to use the enzyme to promote 
beneficial blood vessel growth, such as in heart disease or 
diabetes, Pizzo said.

<HEADLINE> Bank Merger Could Be Just the Start </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The merger between New England banking powerhouses  
Fleet Financial Group and BankBoston may be just a step on the way 
to the creation of a national institution. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though the $16 billion weekend deal will create the biggest  
bank in New England, some analysts said Monday that further mergers 
will be needed for the bank to compete with other much larger 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the final chapter of bank consolidation as a regional  
story,'' said Fred Breimyer, an economist with State Street Bank. 
``To go on, they have to go national.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleet's proposed acquisition got an unethusiastic reception on  
Wall Street. Fleet shares fell 5.7 percent, or by $2.56 1/4, to 
$42.18 3/4 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, where BankBoston 
nudged up less than 1 percent, or by 12 1/2 cents, to $47.06 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleet is the nation's ninth-largest bank, BankBoston the 15th.  
The merged institution, to be called Fleet Boston Corp., will still 
only rank as the eighth-biggest bank in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	With approximately $180 billion in assets, it will be less than  
a third the size of such giants as Citigroup and BankAmerica Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have staying power where they are, but I believe the bar  
for scale and scope of activities is going to continue to be raised 
over the next couple of years,'' said Scott Birbaum, a vice 
president specializing in banking at Mercer Management. 
</P>
<P>
	Size alone doesn't matter, Terrence Murray, Fleet's chairman and  
chief executive officer, said at a news conference Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's where your concentration is, your earnings, where your  
earnings growth is accelerating,'' said Murray, who will become the 
chairman and CEO of Fleet Boston Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleet brings to the table commercial and mortgage lending,  
discount brokerage, student loan processing and a large credit card 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
	BankBoston brings investment banking, corporate lending and  
extensive Latin American operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can do it all, and that's what we intend to do,'' said  
Charles K. ``Chad'' Gifford, BankBoston's chairman and CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	Gifford will become president of the merged institution, then  
succeed Murray as CEO after two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Combining the banks, which requires the approval of regulators  
and shareholders, is expected to save about $600 million in 
operating costs, but will also eliminate 5,000 of the two 
institutions' 60,000 positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Gifford said he hoped most of the positions would be eliminated  
through attrition. 
</P>
<P>
	Murray said the deal won't close until late 1999, and  
consolidation will take all of 2000. After that, he said, he 
expects the new institution will make strategic acquisitions. 
Analysts said the shopping list could include a mutual fund 
company, brokerage firm and insurance company. 
</P>
<P>
	But first, the combined bank would have to divest about $13  
billion in assets, mostly in Massachusetts, where the state has a 
deposit cap of $30 billion, $10 billion more than Fleet Boston 
Corp. is expected to have. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Reserve Bank and the U.S. Department of Justice will  
oversee the banks' divestiture plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the divestitures will take place in Greater Boston,  
where the two banks' branches and ATM locations overlap the most, 
as well as in Providence, R.I., and Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the community bankers are going to ask, 'How do I buy  
those three branches that I've had my eye on'?'' said James 
Dwinell, president of Cambridge Trust Co. 
</P>
<P>
	New England bankers welcomed Sunday's merger announcement  
because it means the region will continue to be home to a major 
financial institution. 
</P>
<P>
	``To not have a major regional or national bank headquartered in  
Boston would be kind of like losing the Red Sox,'' said James 
McDonough, president of Abington Savings Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal was praised even in Boston, where Fleet, a brash  
upstart out of Providence, R.I., moved across the street from 
BankBoston after a series of acquisitions and overshadowed the 
traditional, Brahmin bank that once served Paul Revere. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think in terms of New England being able to compete with  
other regions of the country and other parts of the world, it's 
important we have one of these world class financial 
institutions,'' said Gov. Paul Cellucci.

<HEADLINE> Kjus Wins World Cup Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIERRA NEVADA, Spain (AP) -- Lasse Kjus still isn't as popular in  
Norway as eight-time Olympic cross-country gold medalist Bjorn 
Daehlie, but he must be gaining on him. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus won his second World Cup overall title Sunday, edging  
childhood friend Kjetil Andre Aamodt by a scant 23 points -- after 
4 1/2 months and three dozen races -- in one of the tightest men's 
finishes on record. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus, who coughed and wheezed all winter with a chest infection,  
sped to a quick second leg in Sunday's giant slalom to grab seventh 
place -- he was 15th after the first leg -- in a time of 2 minutes, 
5.48 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Needing a second place to earn enough points to overtake Kjus,  
Aamodt got only fifth in 2:05.13. The result: Kjus 1,465 points, 
Aamodt 1,442. 
</P>
<P>
	A close finish and an even closer friendship.  
</P>
<P>
	Kjus and Aamodt were World Cup roommates for 10 years. Aamodt's  
father, Finn, was their first coach. They're both 28 and, with 
retired Marc Girardelli, they've each won a record 13 Olympic and 
World Championships medals. 
</P>
<P>
	Daehlie, the most popular athlete in Norway where Nordic skiing  
dwarfs alpine, has won a record eight gold medals -- more than any 
athlete in the Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I can do is congratulate Lasse,'' Aamodt said.  
``He has been the best skier all season. For what he did here and 
what he did in the Worlds (in Vail, Colo., a month ago), I can only 
take my hat off to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month in Vail, Kjus became the first man to win five medals  
in a World Championships, including gold in super-G (shared with 
Hermann Maier) and giant slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unbelievable to get this title,'' said Kjus, who won the  
same one in '96. ``It was great fun to have this close fight with 
Kjetil. I felt a lot of pressure in the second run because I had 
made so many mistakes on the first. But I risked it all because I 
had to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt and Kjus split as roommates on the World Cup circuit last  
year ``because we got like an old married couple,'' said Aamodt, 
who won the 1994 World Cup overall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd said about all two people could to each other in that  
time.'' Aamodt added. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kjus-Aamodt 1-2 was the closest men's overall finish since  
1991, when Marc Girardelli nipped Alberto Tomba by 20 points. But 
that was under a scoring system that awarded many fewer points -- as 
was the 1980 title when four points separated the winners. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the system begun in the 1991-92 season, the closest men's  
finish prior to Sunday's near dead heat was in 1993 when Girardelli 
edged Aamodt by 32 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The season's giant slalom went to Switzerland's Michael Von  
Gruenigen, who won in 2:04.33, followed by fellow countryman Steve 
Locher in 2:04.40 and Heinz Schilchegger of Austria in 2:04.44. 
</P>
<P>
	Von Gruenigen finished with 483 points to 410 for Austrian  
Stephan Eberharter and 371 for defending champion Maier. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier, who said he aggravated a back injury in Saturday's slalom  
and needed painkiller injections to ski Sunday, went out five gates 
from the finish on the first leg, losing his right ski in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	The defending overall World Cup and giant slalom champion, Maier  
was eliminated from the overall chase in Saturday's slalom, 
finishing behind Kjus and Aamodt with 1,307 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier blamed his bad back, picked up two months ago doing leg  
exercises with heavy weights, for crashing Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was disappointed about the situation and just didn't feel  
very coordinated,'' said the two-time Olympic champion. ``When I 
went out, I didn't even realize what had happened. My back was even 
worse today than it was yesterday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus' title capped a World Cup season dominated by Austrian  
women. They won all five titles, a feat last accomplished in 1987 
by the Swiss women. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexandra Meissnitzer took the overall and super-G, with Renate  
Goetschl winning the downhill and Sabine Egger the crystal globe in 
slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	Meissnitzer clinched super-G and Egger claimed her slalom title  
when the two races were canceled last week by high winds and 
snowstorms in Europe's southernmost ski resort. 
</P>
<P>
	On the men's side, the Austrians -- after sweeping all five last  
season -- got a super-G title from Maier and a slalom title from 
Thomas Stangassinger, at 33 the oldest skier on the circuit. Kjus 
won the overall and downhill, with Von Gruenigen taking the giant 
slalom.

<HEADLINE> UAL Corp. Predicts Higher Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- United Airlines' parent company issued a  
surprisingly rosy profit projection Monday saying 1999 will be a 
much better year then expected thanks in large part to improved 
domestic business. 
</P>
<P>
	In a filing Monday with the Securities &AMP; Exchange Commission,  
UAL Corp. officials said earnings share should be about $1.35 for 
the first quarter of 1999 and between $10 and $12 a share for all 
of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts polled by the research firm First Call had expected the  
earnings to be about $1.12 and $9.12, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	However, at least one analyst said the announcement was  
consistent -- and actually slightly lower -- than his expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd be disappointed if earnings came in below $1.45,'' Samuel  
Buttrick, an analyst with PaineWebber in New York, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Buttrick was, however, heartened by the company's expectations  
for all of 1999 as he had predicted UAL would earn $9. 
</P>
<P>
	``The good news is they're sticking to their guns,'' Buttrick  
said of UAL officials. ``This is the same forecast the carrier 
provided back in December.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After UAL officials released the earnings expectations, shares  
of the company's stock gained $6.68 3/4 to $73.75 on the New York 
Stock Exchange. Other airlines followed. 
</P>
<P>
	In January, UAL officials reported that fourth-quarter profits  
fell 18 percent as weak sales in Asia and domestic ticket pricing 
pressures combined to hurt the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
	But officials say domestic airline and Asia-Pacific markets are  
improving -- which they attribute, in part, to more confidence about 
the economy and higher fares. The latest of two fare hikes came 
over the weekend. Leisure fares have now risen 7 percent this year. 
Business fares are up 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials and analysts also said United Airlines benefited from  
the American Airlines pilots' sickout in February. 
</P>
<P>
	UAL said earnings are expected rise throughout the year, basing  
its prediction in part on modest increases in profits from flights 
in the Pacific region. 
</P>
<P>
	These profits will outweigh an expected decrease in Atlantic  
region profits, due to the fact that the industry has been adding 
planes in this region, UAL said. 
</P>
<P>
	A UAL spokesman said the company will release first-quarter  
earnings April 21.

<HEADLINE> Southwest Starts Long Island Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Southwest Airlines Co. has begun service in the  
New York area, one of the nation's busiest and most competitive 
markets for the airline industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas-based carrier started service Sunday from Long Island  
MacArthur Airport at Islip, N.Y., in its latest expansion into the 
northeastern corridor. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline analysts have said introduction of budget service in the  
New York area could translate into big savings for consumers. An 
unrestricted business ticket on shuttles by US Airways or Delta Air 
Lines from New York to Boston or Washington cost about $200 each 
way. Southwest is more likely to charge about $70 each way. 
</P>
<P>
	The first service to Islip brought more than 100 passengers from  
Tampa, Fla., to Long Island. 
</P>
<P>
	MacArthur is located about 40 miles east of New York's LaGuardia  
Airport.

<HEADLINE>  Sammy Sosa Hits Two More Homers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Sammy Sosa hit one that just kept going  
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the left-field fence at HoHoKam Park, about 360 feet away.  
</P>
<P>
	Over the 50-foot-high scoreboard, about 30 more feet back.  
</P>
<P>
	Over the back wall of the ballpark, about 10 feet behind the  
board. 
</P>
<P>
	Over four full rows of cars in the parking lot.  
</P>
<P>
	This is Arizona, where balls rifle through the thin Sonoran  
Desert air. But by any stretch, this was a moonshot, a 
450-foot-plus bomb of a home run that tied him for the spring 
training lead at five with -- you guessed it -- Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	Left fielder Tim Raines turned to the crowd on the berm behind  
the fence and started laughing. Then he shrugged his shoulders, as 
in: ``What was I supposed to do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When I hit the ball, I don't look how far it's going to go,''  
Sosa said after homering twice and driving in four runs in the 
Chicago Cubs' 10-7 win over the Oakland Athletics. ``I just let you 
people do that. I just try to make contact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Hernandez hit a pair of two-run homers off loser Kenny  
Rogers. Sosa followed Hernandez's first-inning homer with a solo 
shot to left-center. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez homered off Rogers again in the third, and Sosa hit  
his monster shot off Gil Heredia in the fourth, a three-run drive 
that made it 10-2. After blowing his traditional kiss in honor of 
his mother, Sosa bowed to the fans, a habit he picked up during 
last year's All-Star tour of Japan. He says he intends to bow after 
each home run this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got some balls up, and the Cubs didn't miss them,'' A's  
manager Art Howe said. ``Right-handed hitters had a field day today 
with the wind blowing to left field. They capitalized on every 
mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After thrilling the nation with their historic home-run race  
last summer, won by McGwire 70-66, the pair are dueling again this 
spring. McGwire and Sosa were tied at 3 before McGwire hit a pair 
against the Los Angeles Dodgers on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, but this is spring training,'' Sosa said. ``Ain't no  
competition. We're just going out trying to do our jobs and make 
fans happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers was tagged for six runs and eight hits in three innings.  
He's lost both his starts this spring, allowing nine earned runs in 
five innings, a 16.20 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody goes through this,'' he said. ``I feel like right  
now, my location, it's not very good.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Results of Kerry Wood's MRI exam won't be available until  
Tuesday. ... Miguel Tejada hit a two-run homer off Terry Adams in 
the eighth and Domingo Cedeno hit a two-run homer off Ray King in 
the ninth. ... Ben Grieve was 4-for-5 with an RBI. ... Winner Steve 
Trachsel allowed two runs and five hits in three innings.

<HEADLINE>  Sammy Sosa Hits Two More Homers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Sammy Sosa hit one that just kept going  
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the left-field fence at HoHoKam Park, about 360 feet away.  
</P>
<P>
	Over the 50-foot-high scoreboard, about 30 more feet back.  
</P>
<P>
	Over the back wall of the ballpark, about 10 feet behind the  
board. 
</P>
<P>
	Over four full rows of cars in the parking lot.  
</P>
<P>
	This is Arizona, where balls rifle through the thin Sonoran  
Desert air. But by any stretch, this was a moonshot, a 
450-foot-plus bomb of a home run that tied him for the spring 
training lead at five with -- you guessed it -- Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	Left fielder Tim Raines turned to the crowd on the berm behind  
the fence and started laughing. Then he shrugged his shoulders, as 
in: ``What was I supposed to do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When I hit the ball, I don't look how far it's going to go,''  
Sosa said after homering twice and driving in four runs in the 
Chicago Cubs' 10-7 win over the Oakland Athletics. ``I just let you 
people do that. I just try to make contact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Hernandez hit a pair of two-run homers off loser Kenny  
Rogers. Sosa followed Hernandez's first-inning homer with a solo 
shot to left-center. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez homered off Rogers again in the third, and Sosa hit  
his monster shot off Gil Heredia in the fourth, a three-run drive 
that made it 10-2. After blowing his traditional kiss in honor of 
his mother, Sosa bowed to the fans, a habit he picked up during 
last year's All-Star tour of Japan. He says he intends to bow after 
each home run this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got some balls up, and the Cubs didn't miss them,'' A's  
manager Art Howe said. ``Right-handed hitters had a field day today 
with the wind blowing to left field. They capitalized on every 
mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After thrilling the nation with their historic home-run race  
last summer, won by McGwire 70-66, the pair are dueling again this 
spring. McGwire and Sosa were tied at 3 before McGwire hit a pair 
against the Los Angeles Dodgers on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, but this is spring training,'' Sosa said. ``Ain't no  
competition. We're just going out trying to do our jobs and make 
fans happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers was tagged for six runs and eight hits in three innings.  
He's lost both his starts this spring, allowing nine earned runs in 
five innings, a 16.20 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody goes through this,'' he said. ``I feel like right  
now, my location, it's not very good.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Results of Kerry Wood's MRI exam won't be available until  
Tuesday. ... Miguel Tejada hit a two-run homer off Terry Adams in 
the eighth and Domingo Cedeno hit a two-run homer off Ray King in 
the ninth. ... Ben Grieve was 4-for-5 with an RBI. ... Winner Steve 
Trachsel allowed two runs and five hits in three innings.

<HEADLINE> Senators Oppose China's WTO Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After years of stalemate, the Clinton  
administration said Monday it is beginning to see progress in talks 
aimed at admitting China to the World Trade Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	But key senators warned Monday of strong congressional  
opposition to China's membership in the Geneva-based organization 
that sets the rules for world trade unless the Asian giant does 
more to lower barriers to sales of American farm and manufacturing 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our farmers will lose if we let China in the WTO with the  
attitude that we'll work out the details later,'' Sen. Charles 
Grassley, R-Iowa, told a panel of administration officials working 
on the issue. ``That's just what happened with Japan in the 1950s 
and we're still fighting for market access.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grassley, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee's trade  
subcommittee, summoned the administration officials before his 
panel to emphasize Congress' concern about the negotiations, which 
have dragged on for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Special Trade Negotiator Peter Scher said the U.S. team, led by  
U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, was encouraged by 
recent negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``During those meetings, China demonstrated a greater  
appreciation of what constitutes a commercially meaningful 
agreement for the United States,'' Scher told the senators. ``We 
are now engaged in a more substantial negotiation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the pace of talks has picked up in recent weeks, both  
Scher and Under Secretary of State Stuart Eizenstat stressed that 
the administration was not trying to reach an agreement in time for 
an April visit to Washington by Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to reporters in Beijing, Zhu said Monday that China was  
prepared ``to make the biggest concessions'' possible to gain 
membership in the 134-nation WTO, an economic prize China has long 
sought. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has the ability to block China's WTO  
membership until the country agrees to reduce barriers to American 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	The negotiations concern what concessions China will be willing  
to make to meet U.S. demands. America's trade deficit with China 
hit an all-time high of $57 billion last year, the largest 
imbalance the United States has ever suffered with any country 
other than Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Comments by various senators underscored their unhappiness with  
this widening deficit. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Kent Conrad, D-N.D., contended China was engaged in a  
``shell game and charade'' that is keeping American farm products 
out of the country, while Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., expressed fears 
that the administration might lower its demands to strike a deal 
with China. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the fight over WTO membership, U.S.-China  
relations are being roiled over allegations of new human rights 
abuses and charges that a suspected spy at the Los Alamos, N.M., 
national lab gave China sensitive nuclear weapons information. 
</P>
<P>
	To emphasize congressional concerns, two key senators sent a  
letter to colleagues seeking co-sponsors for legislation that would 
require congressional approval before the administration could give 
the go-ahead for China's membership in the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
	``The continuing problems with Chinese human rights violations,  
espionage and possible technology transfers suggest that this is 
not an appropriate time for China to enter the WTO,'' wrote Foreign 
Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and Fritz 
Hollings of South Carolina, the Commerce Committee's top Democrat,

<HEADLINE> Stocks Rise; Dow Up 67 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average resumed its  
advance on 10,000 today as a new round of corporate mergers sent 
stock prices higher. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow was up 67.44 at 9,943.79. The  
index of blue-chip stocks has flirted with 10,000 in recent 
sessions, coming within 42 points of that milestone Friday before 
giving up ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were mostly higher today.  
</P>
<P>
	After stocks sputtered in the first hour of trading, analysts  
said the market appeared to be awaiting a catalyst powerful enough 
to spark a strong run past 10,000. By midday, announcements of 
several big mergers provided that spark 
</P>
<P>
	The $16 billion acquisition of BankBoston Corp. by Fleet  
Financial Group Inc. added some punch to the financial services 
sector. Shares of BankBoston rose 1 1/16. Fleet, however, slipped 1 
15/16 to 42 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, chemical giant DuPont Co. said it will pay $7.7  
billion to acquire 80 percent of Pioneer Hi-Bred International 
Inc., the world's largest seed corn company. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline stocks benefited from a new round of fare increases,  
which will push up the price of a business fare about 1 percent and 
a leisure fare about 3 percent. UAL Corp., which also indicated its 
first-quarter earnings will top analysts' expectations, was up 4 3/4 
at 71 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil stocks were among the decliners today, having rallied Friday  
as world oil producers agreed to cut their output. Chevron was off 
9/16 at 84 1/8, and Exxon was off 1/4 at 73 11/16. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 10.12 at 1,304.71, and  
the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index was up 34.26 at 
2,415.79. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 7-to-6 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 325.6 million 
shares, slightly off Friday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 3.29 at 614.83, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was down 0.03 at 721.18. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks rallied sharply overnight in Japan, as the Nikkei reached  
its highest level since last summer, rising 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 0.2 percent,  
Britain's FT-SE 100 was down .1 percent and France's CAC-40 was 
down 0.4 percent.

<HEADLINE>  Calipari Fired by Nets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	John Calipari was fired today as coach of the New Jersey Nets, a  
once-promising team that quickly became one of the NBA's worst this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets, who traded for star guard Stephon Marbury four days  
ago, have lost seven straight games to fall to 3-17. Only the Los 
Angeles Clippers (1-19) have a worse record. 
</P>
<P>
	The dismissal had been expected ever since Calipari met with  
team owners Finn Wentworth and Lewis Katz on Sunday after a 102-76 
loss in Miami. Calipari didn't accompany the team to Toronto but 
traveled there separately Monday and met briefly with the players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't really dealt with what I feel,'' said Calipari, who  
also was fired as team vice president. ``I wish I had the 
opportunity to finish the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're with a good group of guys, it's the best thing in  
the world. But if you're with a few that are bad, it can be 
misery,'' he added, without specifying the ``bad'' players. 
</P>
<P>
	Calipari, in his third season with the Nets, had two years and  
$6 million remaining on his five-year, $15 million contract. He was 
offered a consulting job with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets also fired assistant coaches Johnny Davis, Kenny  
Gattison and Jack Haley. 
</P>
<P>
	Nets assistant Don Casey will take over as interim coach, with  
his first game Tuesday night against the Raptors. He was the head 
coach of the Clippers during the 1988-89 season and has spent the 
last three seasons as Calipari's top assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough,'' Casey said. ``Cal brought me in from Boston, he  
worked very hard with high energy and it just didn't work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A protege of Boston Celtics coach Rick Pitino, Calipari had been  
given power to change the Nets from a laughingstock into a winner, 
and made some progress. But the Nets never rediscovered the 
chemistry that made them one of the most exciting young teams in 
the league last season, although injuries hurt this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The problems began on opening night when point guard Sam Cassell  
severely sprained his ankle. He missed all but two games after that 
and the Nets' offense sputtered with Eric Murdock and later Doug 
Overton at the point. All-Star center Jayson Williams has played 
with a broken nose and a hand injury. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey made the playoffs for the first time since 1994 last  
season. Although the Nets were swept by title-bound Michael Jordan 
and the Chicago Bulls, they played well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud that this organization is now thought of as a  
legitimate organization that it's very close to being big-time,'' 
Calipari said. ``In two and half years, look where it is. Four or 
five years ago no one wanted to stay here and no one wanted to come 
here. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now you've got an organization that's primed and set to have  
success, and if it's not with me, I'm okay with that. I don't own 
the team. I accept that. But I think in the end we changed the 
losing culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Jordan's retirement, the Nets were seen as a potential  
successor as Eastern Conference champions. They featured an 
up-tempo style anchored by Keith Van Horn, Williams, shooting guard 
Kerry Kittles and Cassell, who was traded in the Marbury deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury was expected to lift the sagging team. He made a strong  
debut Sunday with 21 points and five assists, but it was not nearly 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should look in the mirror and see what we can do,'' Kittles  
said. ``This is a new start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers reported Monday the Nets were courting former Chicago  
Bulls coach Phil Jackson to coach the team. Todd Musburger, 
Jackson's agent, has said he did not know if Jackson was leaning 
toward returning to coaching next season, as he has said in the 
past, or sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	Calipari, who helped turn Massachusetts into a national power as  
a college coach, was hired by the Nets on June 7, 1996, taking over 
one of the league's worst teams. The Nets had gone 30-52 the 
previous two seasons under Butch Beard. 
</P>
<P>
	In two-plus seasons as Nets coach, Calipari had a record of  
72-112. After a 26-56 record in his first season, he guided the 
Nets to a 43-39 record last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this is the worse thing to happen to me and my family in  
our lifetime, I have been a very very blessed man,'' Calipari said. 
``I came in as a college coach and was given authority to turn 
around an organization, to build a team that we wanted on the 
floor. In short order we got to the playoffs and it looked like 
things were going to be bright, we hit a big bump in the road and 
could not overcome it, and I'm disappointed in that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A low point came in his first year, when he was fined $25,000 --  
the largest fine ever levied against a coach by the league -- for 
calling reporter Dan Garcia of The Star-Ledger of Newark a 
``Mexican idiot'' during a heated argument after a practice. The 
coach has since apologized, maintaining it was an ill-advised 
attempt at humor. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was hired, Calipari said, ``You can walk into this and  
say: `How do I want this situation viewed?' I have that 
opportunity. I want to bet on myself. I don't need to bet on 
anybody else. I know me. That's what I wanted to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his first pro job, he lost that bet.

<HEADLINE> Bond Market Open on Good Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. government bond markets will be open a  
half-day on Good Friday, a day financial markets typically are 
closed, to give investors a chance to react to the release of 
unemployment statistics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department is scheduled to release March employment  
figures April 2, which coincides with the Christian holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, bond markets have followed other financial markets  
in the United States and many other countries in closing all day on 
Good Friday. U.S. stock and commodity markets will be closed April 
2, although government offices and most banks will be open. 
</P>
<P>
	Bond markets, however, are especially sensitive to employment  
and wage figures in the report due April 2 because they can signal 
trends in inflation and interest rates. For that reason, the Bond 
Market Association on Monday confirmed an earlier decision 
recommending bond markets be open until noon EST on Good Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``These figures are particularly important to the market,'' said  
Scott C. Rankin, assistant general counsel at Bond Market 
Association. ``The market trades on those figures, so we thought it 
a prudent measure to allow an abbreviated schedule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Economists expect another strong employment report, which could  
prompt a selloff, said Mary Dennis, a senior economist at Merrill 
Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
	``The employment report traditionally has been the No. 1  
economic report to move the bond market,'' she said. ``Strong, is 
not good for the bond market, it could lead to a little bit of a 
selloff ... but any selloff would probably be seen as buying 
opportunity.''

<HEADLINE> Motorola, MIT To Create 'Smart' Lab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Kitchen computers that take drink orders  
like ``Tea, Earl Grey, Hot'' aren't just for futuristic spaceship 
captains anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Smart'' technology, which lets machines communicate not only  
with humans but with other devices to keep a whole household 
running smoothly, is on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology moved closer to daily life Monday as Motorola  
announced plans for a new partnership with the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	The company donated $5 million to the university to create the  
Motorola DigitalDNA Laboratory at MIT's Media Lab. The center will 
be a part of the Media Lab's new building, set to be completed in 
2003. 
</P>
<P>
	At the new lab, scientists will work on a whole new wave of  
smart product applications -- like clothing with computerized labels 
that can tell a washing machine which cycle to use. And dishwashers 
that communicate to other household appliances about noise levels 
and energy usage. 
</P>
<P>
	Such products would improve on appliances that have the capacity  
to be smart, but aren't linked with other machines by a 
computerized network. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wouldn't it be great for the consumer if smart products could  
be smarter and talk to each other?''' said Hector de J. Ruiz, 
president of Motorola's Semiconductor Products Sector. 
</P>
<P>
	Appliances able to chat with each other would make everyday life  
far easier, Ruiz said. For example, a home entertainment center 
with ``talking'' components would free users from having to 
struggle with several different remote controls or download each 
machine's specifications into a universal remote. 
</P>
<P>
	A refrigerator may someday read the bar codes of the products  
inside, so you could dial in on the way home find out if you're out 
of milk. 
</P>
<P>
	While the technology behind smart products has been available  
for years, few applications are available to average consumers at 
affordable prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Nelson, marketing director of the Semiconductor Products  
Sector, said Motorola has been working with MIT for five years. The 
new partnership however, stemmed from market surveys that found 
consumers think many technological advances are useless to the 
average person, and that many products are hard to use. 
</P>
<P>
	The partnership between Motorola -- one of the world's largest  
electronics companies -- and the 400-employee MIT Media Lab may help 
bring smart products to mass markets within the next decade, said 
Ruiz. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why should people have to read a 2-inch-thick manual to do  
something simple?'' said Ruiz. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, when ``networked'' homes are the norm, people will  
wonder how they ever lived without doors that recognize and open 
for specific people and thermostats that respond to voice commands, 
said MIT Media Lab Director Nicholas Negroponte. 
</P>
<P>
	``The front door can open as it sees you coming with a load of  
groceries,'' said Negroponte, who also serves on Motorola's board 
of directors. ``Or it can let the dog out but not let 10 dogs back 
in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such technology is already in use in Mercedes' new line of  
S-Class cars, which features a front passenger seat that 
automatically recognizes when a child safety seat is being used and 
reduces the air bag power. The line also features a chip-card key 
equipped with a profile of the driver. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's a teen-ager driving, (a parent) can program it to not  
go faster then 50 mph,'' Ruiz said. ``If you like country-western 
music and your child likes rock-and-roll, the car will know.''

<P>
	A winter storm that dumped close to 2 feet of snow in the East  
and mid-Atlantic states by morning worked its way into New England 
on Monday, while the rest of the country enjoyed mostly calm 
weather. 
</P>
<P>
	The heaviest snow Monday afternoon was in coastal areas of  
Maine. Lighter snowfall lingered in parts of New Jersey, Virginia 
and Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	The storm dumped close to 2 feet of snow in some areas,  
including Bedford, Pa., which had 18 inches of snow. The 
Pennsylvania cities of Lewistown and Somerset had 15 inches and 14 
inches, respectively. Berkeley Springs, W.Va., also had 14 inches 
while 12 inches was recorded in parts of New Jersey, Maryland and 
Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Accumulations up to a foot were reported elsewhere.  
</P>
<P>
	The storm, just days before the first day of spring, closed  
schools, knocked out power and delayed travel on roads and at 
airports. 
</P>
<P>
	The remainder of the country saw mostly quiet weather Monday,  
with clear skies in the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley, south and west 
through the Gulf Coast and Plains. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures rose in most areas, melting snow leftover from  
weekend storms. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the western United States saw calm, clear weather,  
except in southwestern California, where clouds and rain showers 
were reported. Some mountain snowfall also was reported.

<HEADLINE> Companies To Combine Voice, Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE (AP) -- A collaboration between four major high-tech  
companies will allow people to listen to their e-mail on the 
telephone and read their voice mail on the computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Nortel Networks, Hewlett-Packard Co., Intel Corp. and Microsoft  
Corp. said Monday that the new systems are the first marketable 
results of their efforts to converge computers and telephones. 
</P>
<P>
	Their products, unveiled at The Tech Museum of Innovation in San  
Jose, will allow business customers to combine voice traffic and 
corporate data in a single, digitized network. 
</P>
<P>
	The team effort is expected to help advance the introduction of  
corporate networks that use Internet protocols to combine voice and 
data in one transmission system. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers are probably going to take this for granted, much in  
the same way we take cell phones and Internet access for granted,'' 
said John Armstrong, a Dataquest analyst in San Jose, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Armstrong said the convergence of voice and data, and  
the fact that ``the blue chip companies of communication'' are 
working on it, is going to propel technology that has been talked 
about a lot but seen little in the general marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
	The products mark the first in what are expected to be a whole  
new line of systems that converge voice and data from the four 
large firms, as well as from competitors like Lucent Technologies 
and Cisco Systems. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts say that more than $2 billion will be spent by 2003 on  
systems that bring telephone and data lines together. 
</P>
<P>
	A large hurdle toward developing the systems has been voice  
recognition technology, a type of software that recently has

<HEADLINE> DeBartolo To Pay NFL $1M Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Edward DeBartolo Jr., already barred from running  
the San Francisco 49ers for his part in a Louisiana gambling 
scandal, will be fined $1 million and formerly suspended from the 
NFL for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement will be made Tuesday at the NFL owners'  
meetings by commissioner Paul Tagliabue, according to league 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue who announced in January that DeBartolo would not be  
allowed to run the 49ers in 1999, will also assess a $1 million 
fine against DeBartolo for his dealings with former Louisiana Gov. 
Edwin Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo pleaded guilty last year to one felony charge of  
failing to report an alleged extortion attempt by Edwards in 
connection with DeBartolo's bid for a riverboat gambling license. 
The judge imposed $2 million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo and his sister, Denise DeBartolo York have been at  
odds for more than a year over control of the team, in part because 
of Eddie's debts to the family-held corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	John York, Denise's husband, said Monday that she would continue  
to run the team this year. York, along with new team president Bill 
Walsh, are the chief representatives of the 49ers at these 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo relinquished control of the team in December 1997 when  
the NFL investigated the gambling scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	While his wife might be interested in selling her share to her  
brother, she has no plans to sell to a third party if he can't 
return as active owner. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's first and foremost is a separation of her interests  
with Eddie's,'' York told the San Jose Mercury-News earlier in the 
week. ``That does not mean she is out to hurt Eddie, but they need 
to be separated because their business interests are not the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 49ers are not for sale now. I can't tell you that that  
wouldn't change, but we don't have any intentions to sell the team. 
We are committed to running it because it is the most valuable 
single asset in the DeBartolo Corporation.

<HEADLINE> Reno Looks To Curb Internet Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new public-private alliance to curb Internet  
crime will help teach children ``that hacking is the same as 
breaking and entering,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Educating children about acceptable online behavior is among  
three initiatives under the Cybercitizen Partnership, an initiative 
of government and the high-tech industry to promote cyberspace 
ethics and help law enforcers track down online criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	``All children know it's wrong to break into a neighbor's house  
or read your best friend's diary. Unfortunately, fewer realize that 
it's wrong to break into their neighbor's computers and snoop 
through their computer files,'' Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cybercitizen Partnership also will feature a ``personnel  
exchange program'' between private business and federal agencies in 
which both will learn how the other responds to threats and crimes 
over the Internet. Companies can find out how best to help 
law-enforcement agencies, and government officials will learn what 
business interests and influences drive industry decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign also will create a directory of computer experts  
and computer security resources so that ``law enforcement will know 
where to turn,'' Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	The partnership was announced, along with Reno's comments,  
during a high-tech industry summit sponsored by the Information 
Technology Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	``A decade ago, cybercrime and cyberterrorism didn't really  
exist outside of Hollywood movies. Today, they are very real 
threats,'' Reno said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We cannot allow cyberspace to become the Wild West of the  
information age.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, a top Pentagon official warned members of the Senate  
Armed Services Committee about an electronic Pearl Harbor by 
cyberterrorists more likely to go after commercial targets than 
military ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre said he worries increasingly  
about the vulnerability of commercial and financial interests. 
</P>
<P>
	``This Pearl Harbor's going to be different,'' he said last  
Tuesday. ``It's not going to be against Navy ships sitting in a 
Navy shipyard; it's going to be against commercial infrastructure, 
and we don't control that. And there's been little progress on 
that.''

<HEADLINE>  Calipari Fired by Nets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	John Calipari was fired today as coach of the New Jersey Nets, a  
once-promising team that quickly became one of the NBA's worst this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets, who traded for star guard Stephon Marbury four days  
ago, have lost seven straight games to fall to 3-17. Only the Los 
Angeles Clippers (1-19) have a worse record. 
</P>
<P>
	The dismissal had been expected ever since Calipari met with  
team owners Finn Wentworth and Lewis Katz on Sunday after a 102-76 
loss in Miami. Calipari didn't accompany the team to Toronto but 
traveled there separately Monday and met briefly with the players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't really dealt with what I feel,'' said Calipari, who  
also was fired as team vice president. ``I wish I had the 
opportunity to finish the contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're with a good group of guys, it's the best thing in  
the world. But if you're with a few that are bad, it can be 
misery,'' he added, without specifying the ``bad'' players. 
</P>
<P>
	Calipari, in his third season with the Nets, had two years and  
$6 million remaining on his five-year, $15 million contract. He was 
offered a consulting job with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets also fired assistant coaches Johnny Davis, Kenny  
Gattison and Jack Haley. 
</P>
<P>
	Nets assistant Don Casey will take over as interim coach, with  
his first game Tuesday night against the Raptors. He was the head 
coach of the Clippers during the 1988-89 season and has spent the 
last three seasons as Calipari's top assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough,'' Casey said. ``Cal brought me in from Boston, he  
worked very hard with high energy and it just didn't work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A protege of Boston Celtics coach Rick Pitino, Calipari had been  
given power to change the Nets from a laughingstock into a winner, 
and made some progress. But the Nets never rediscovered the 
chemistry that made them one of the most exciting young teams in 
the league last season, although injuries hurt this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The problems began on opening night when point guard Sam Cassell  
severely sprained his ankle. He missed all but two games after that 
and the Nets' offense sputtered with Eric Murdock and later Doug 
Overton at the point. All-Star center Jayson Williams has played 
with a broken nose and a hand injury. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey made the playoffs for the first time since 1994 last  
season. Although the Nets were swept by title-bound Michael Jordan 
and the Chicago Bulls, they played well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm proud that this organization is now thought of as a  
legitimate organization that it's very close to being big-time,'' 
Calipari said. ``In two and half years, look where it is. Four or 
five years ago no one wanted to stay here and no one wanted to come 
here. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now you've got an organization that's primed and set to have  
success, and if it's not with me, I'm okay with that. I don't own 
the team. I accept that. But I think in the end we changed the 
losing culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Jordan's retirement, the Nets were seen as a potential  
successor as Eastern Conference champions. They featured an 
up-tempo style anchored by Keith Van Horn, Williams, shooting guard 
Kerry Kittles and Cassell, who was traded in the Marbury deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Marbury was expected to lift the sagging team. He made a strong  
debut Sunday with 21 points and five assists, but it was not nearly 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should look in the mirror and see what we can do,'' Kittles  
said. ``This is a new start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers reported Monday the Nets were courting former Chicago  
Bulls coach Phil Jackson to coach the team. Todd Musburger, 
Jackson's agent, has said he did not know if Jackson was leaning 
toward returning to coaching next season, as he has said in the 
past, or sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	Calipari, who helped turn Massachusetts into a national power as  
a college coach, was hired by the Nets on June 7, 1996, taking over 
one of the league's worst teams. The Nets had gone 30-52 the 
previous two seasons under Butch Beard. 
</P>
<P>
	In two-plus seasons as Nets coach, Calipari had a record of  
72-112. After a 26-56 record in his first season, he guided the 
Nets to a 43-39 record last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If this is the worse thing to happen to me and my family in  
our lifetime, I have been a very very blessed man,'' Calipari said. 
``I came in as a college coach and was given authority to turn 
around an organization, to build a team that we wanted on the 
floor. In short order we got to the playoffs and it looked like 
things were going to be bright, we hit a big bump in the road and 
could not overcome it, and I'm disappointed in that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A low point came in his first year, when he was fined $25,000 --  
the largest fine ever levied against a coach by the league -- for 
calling reporter Dan Garcia of The Star-Ledger of Newark a 
``Mexican idiot'' during a heated argument after a practice. The 
coach has since apologized, maintaining it was an ill-advised 
attempt at humor. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was hired, Calipari said, ``You can walk into this and  
say: `How do I want this situation viewed?' I have that 
opportunity. I want to bet on myself. I don't need to bet on 
anybody else. I know me. That's what I wanted to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his first pro job, he lost that bet.

<HEADLINE> Fla. Target of Affirmative Action </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) -- If California businessman Ward Connerly  
has his way, Florida could become the next state to abolish racial 
and gender preferences. 
</P>
<P>
	Connerly, who helped lead successful initiatives to end  
affirmative action in California and Washington, is leading the 
fight to roll back preference programs here because he says they 
foster resentment. 
</P>
<P>
	``People feel like they're the victim of reverse  
discrimination,'' Connerly said. ``That resentment is a very real 
problem we have to confront.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He plans to make three appearances today in Florida to announce  
his campaign, The Miami Herald reported in today's edition. 
</P>
<P>
	But while Connerly had the support of Republican Gov. Pete  
Wilson in California, local leaders oppose his efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Miami Mayor Joe Carollo called  
Connerly's movement divisive and said they will not support it. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's press secretary, Nicolle Devenish, said the governor is  
opposed to ``quotas and set-asides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, she said, ``we don't want to have a divisive political  
debate waged at a time when the governor's priority is improving 
schools and improving the lives of children, the elderly and the 
developmentally disabled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To get his measure on the November 2000 ballot, Connerly needs  
at least 435,073 signatures and is confident he could win public 
opinion at the ballot box. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami-Dade Mayor Alex Penelas has promised to lead a campaign  
against putting the measure on the 2000 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	Connerly, a black conservative, is a member of the University of  
California Board of Regents, which in 1995 voted to end racial 
preferences in college admissions. 
</P>
<P>
	He also pushed for Proposition 209, a 1996 ballot measure  
approved by voters that eliminated race and gender preferences in 
California's hiring, contracting and education. 
</P>
<P>
	A poll commissioned by Connerly within the past three weeks  
shows 80 percent of Floridians support his belief that college 
admissions and the awarding of state contracts should be 
colorblind, Connerly said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Florida is going to be a target for our national movement,''  
Ward Connerly told the St. Petersburg Times on Saturday. ``I have 
concluded there is a problem in Florida.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends at Record High 9,958.77 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Corporate mergers and big gains in airline  
stocks propelled the Dow Jones industrial average to a new record 
high close Monday, but the index stopped short of the eagerly 
anticipated 10,000 mark. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow rose 82.42 to 9,958.77, leaving it less than 42 points  
from 10,000. The index of blue-chip stocks, which has flirted with 
its next milestone over the past few sessions, came within 30 
points Monday before giving up ground. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market appears to be tiptoeing toward Dow 10,000,'' said  
Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	Market watchers were so attuned to 10,000 that the new record  
barely turned heads. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no special spark,'' said Rao Chalasani, chief  
investment strategist at Everen Securities in Chicago. ``But 
whatever was helping push the market last week is there again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those factors, analysts say, include low inflation and early  
hints of strong first-quarter corporate earnings. Additional 
momentum Monday came from announcements of several big mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	The $16 billion acquisition of BankBoston by Fleet Financial  
Group added some punch to the financial services sector. BankBoston 
gained a mere 1/8 to close at 47 1/16, and Fleet fell 2 9/16 to 42 
3/16. But the merger stimulated talk of further consolidation in 
the sector, and pushed up shares of industry powerhouses like J.P. 
Morgan, which rose 3 3/8 to 125 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	In another major deal, DuPont said it will pay $7.7 billion to  
acquire 80 percent of Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc., the 
world's largest seed corn company. 
</P>
<P>
	``These big deals are making investors feel very confident,''  
said Chalasani. ``It's a sign that there is money out there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the strongest sectors Monday was the airline industry,  
which implemented fare increases that will push up the price of a 
business fare about 1 percent and a leisure fare about 3 percent. 
UAL, which also indicated its first-quarter earnings will top 
analysts' expectations, was the biggest gainer, rising 6 11/16 to 
73 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline stocks' robust gains brought the Dow Jones  
transportation average to its highest close since last July. The 
index rose 137.14 points, a gain of 4.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil stocks were among the decliners after rallying Friday as  
world oil producers agreed to cut their output. Texaco slipped 
13/16 to 54 5/8 and Mobil fell 1 1/8 to 91 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	While Internet stocks have languished in recent sessions, they  
carried technology stocks higher Monday, outpacing the Dow. The 
Nasdaq composite index, driven by technology issues, rose 49.91 to 
close at 2,431.44. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts pointed out that despite the diversity of Monday's  
gainers, a relatively small number of stocks were flourishing. 
Throughout the day, advancing issues barely outnumbered decliners 
on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market has lifted of late thanks to the performance of a  
handful of stocks,'' Ackerman said. ``There are many players 
waiting for market to broaden, which would allow the smaller 
companies to reap some of these great gains.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the NYSE came to 724.6 million shares, well off  
Friday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 12.67 to 1,307.26, also a  
record. The NYSE composite index rose 3.68 to 615.22, and the 
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 0.30 at 720.91. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks rallied sharply overnight in Japan, as the Nikkei reached  
its highest level since last summer, rising 2 percent. The Japanese 
market has performed well all year, fueling hopes that the 
financial crisis that rippled throughout the world last year has 
ended. 
</P>
<P>
	European markets, however, were mixed. Germany's DAX index  
closed 0.2 percent higher, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 1.2 percent and 
France's CAC-40 rose 0.2 percent.

<HEADLINE>  MLB Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Kevin Appier and Alex Fernandez showed off their  
surgically-repaired right shoulders once again for scouts Monday, 
while Kerry Wood flew back to Chicago to check on his injured 
elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, last year's NL Rookie of the Year and a key to the Cubs'  
pennant hopes, had an MRI exam, not knowing how seriously his arm 
was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday was a rough day,'' Cubs manager Jim Riggleman said.  
``We just crossed some fingers and hoped the news was not going to 
be bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood's test results are not expected until Tuesday, the Cubs  
said. He missed the last month of the regular season with a sore 
elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	At Dunedin, Fla., scouts from more than a dozen major-league  
teams watched Appier struggle for the first time this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Appier, who missed almost all of last season with the injured  
shoulder, labored through a brutal first inning where he threw 29 
pitches and gave up two hits, three walks and two runs in the 
Royals' 6-5 win in 10 innings over a split-squad of Toronto Blue 
Jays. 
</P>
<P>
	But then he settled down the next three innings and gave up just  
one hit, making sure the dozen or so scouts who were on hand will 
be back to see the next outing of the Royals' career strikeout 
leader -- assuming a deal's not made before then. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first inning was ugly,'' said Appier, 31, whose $4.8  
million contract is too rich for the Royals to afford. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was getting way ahead of myself. I had trouble with my  
rhythm and my stuff was really erratic and inconsistent. After 
that, I made an adjustment and I was able to stay back and improve 
quite a bit. It improved a lot, but not all the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Winter Haven, Fla., Fernandez allowed six runs -- five earned  
-- in 1 2-3 innings as the Florida Marlins lost to the Cleveland 
Indians 13-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez, who missed the 1998 season following rotator cuff  
surgery, had allowed only one run in his first two starts this 
spring. The Indians strung together five consecutive two-out hits, 
including Omar Vizquel's two-run double and Jim Thome's home run. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians were among several teams with scouts at the game to  
mark the progress of Fernandez, who may be traded by the Marlins 
for younger, less expensive players if he proves healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	At Tampa, Fla., Joe Torre told his New York Yankees team that he  
would undergo surgery for prostate cancer on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Torre told the club he would be back ``soon,'' there's no  
telling when the World Series champions will have him in the 
dugout. Speculation has ranged from opening day on April 5 at 
Oakland to the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no clue,'' the 58-year-old Torre said. ``I will be  
taking a little extra time. I want to make sure when I come back, 
I'm strong enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre plans to leave the Tampa area on Wednesday. He expects to  
be in the hospital for 3-4 days after the surgery, and has not 
decided where he will recuperate. 
</P>
<P>
	At Vero Beach, Fla., Gary Sheffield, who said last week he is  
considering retirement, has left the Los Angeles Dodgers for a few 
days to take care of some personal business. 
</P>
<P>
	But the team said Monday that Sheffield had planned the trip  
more than a month ago and that it was unrelated to his comments 
this weekend about possibly ending his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Dodgers have known about this since before spring  
training,'' said John Olguin, a team spokesman. ``He'll be back 
Tuesday evening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other games:  
</P>
<P>
                        *Red Sox 13, Pirates 2    	
</P>
<P>
	At Fort Myers, Fla., Scott Hatteberg hit two three-run homers  
and Pedro Martinez struck out seven in four innings. 
</P>
<P>
                     *Devil Rays 9, Blue Jays (ss) 8    	
</P>
<P>
	At St. Petersburg, Fla., Jose Canseco hit two home runs,  
including a towering grand slam over the Florida Power Park 
scoreboard, against his former team. 
</P>
<P>
                       *Rangers 11, Phillies 10    	
</P>
<P>
	At Port Charlotte, Fla., Lee Stevens, filling in at first base  
for the injured Rafael Palmeiro, hit his third homer of the spring. 
Texas won despite closer John Wetteland getting shelled for six 
runs and six hits in the fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Cardinals 5, Braves 4    	
</P>
<P>
	At Jupiter, Fla., St. Louis scored four runs in the eighth to  
overcome its sloppiest performance of the spring. Mark McGwire went 
1-for-3. 
</P>
<P>
                          *Mets 1, Orioles 0    	
</P>
<P>
	At Port St. Lucie, Fla., Hideo Nomo and three relievers combined  
on a three-hitter and New York scored the only run on a wild pitch 
by Heathcliff Slocumb. 
</P>
<P>
                        *Dodgers 13, Astros 3    	
</P>
<P>
	At Kissimmee, Fla., Todd Hollandsworth went 3-for-4 with a  
two-run homer to lead Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
                    *Diamondbacks 11, Padres (ss) 2    	
</P>
<P>
	At Tucson, Ariz., Danny Klassen had two hits and three RBIs and  
Pete Incaviglia drove in two runs.

<HEADLINE> NY Railroad Mulls Cell Phone Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- The smoking car on trains is a thing  
of the past, but could the talking car be a feature of the future? 
</P>
<P>
	The Metro-North Commuter Railroad is considering designating  
separate cars for cellular phone users, who often intrude on the 
reading, sleeping and thinking of their fellow travelers by talking 
loudly into their little phones. 
</P>
<P>
	``For reasons that we can't figure out, people are hollering  
into their cell phones,'' Metro-North spokesman Dan Brucker said 
Monday. ``They're talking as if this were the beginning of the 
telephony age and you had to shout.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The railroad, which takes passengers between Grand Central  
Terminal and New York City's northern suburbs, lately has been 
averaging half a dozen complaints per week about loud phone calls, 
Brucker said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's happened to me a couple of times,'' James Said of White  
Plains said as he waited for a train to take him to work in New 
York. ``If the train is noisy and they have to shout, they're being 
obnoxious and they don't know it. You have to give them a look.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One woman complained to the railroad after finding herself  
surrounded by five people on cell phones. Another passenger 
resorted to turning on a tape recorder in front of a lawyer who was 
talking loudly to clients. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your attorney-client privilege is no longer privileged,'' the  
rider said. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the railroad is just asking cell-phone talkers to keep  
their voices down. But Brucker said one solution being considered 
is ``having a train car dedicated to cellular phone users -- an 
all-talking train car, the way we used to have a smoking car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, this raises little problems like free-speech  
issues,'' Brucker said. ``How do we enforce it, tell people they 
can't talk?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Nightingale of Greenburgh said he doesn't use his cell  
phone while riding the train to and from work in the city, but he 
stood up for the rights of those who do. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just talking,'' he said. ``Last time I looked you were  
allowed to talk on the train.''

<HEADLINE> Parental Kidnapping on the Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- At the National Center for Missing &AMP; Exploited  
Children, the number of reported cases of missing children has been 
holding steady in virtually every category: runaways, stranger 
abductions, kids who are lost. 
</P>
<P>
	There's one big exception: children taken by their own parents.  
</P>
<P>
	Parental kidnappings have been rising steadily, said Ben Ermini,  
director of the missing children's division at the Virginia-based 
center. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see the increase in the number of breakups in marriages, so  
naturally as that occurs there's going to be a custody issue 
involving children,'' Ermini said. 
</P>
<P>
	Though many cases are quickly solved -- some turn out to be  
misunderstandings about when a parent was to return a child after a 
visit -- several parental abductions have grabbed headlines in the 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	One is the case of Stephen Fagan, accused of kidnapping his  
daughters from Massachusetts in 1979. The now-adult children, 
Rachael and Lisa Martin, were taken to Florida and told their 
mother was dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Fagan maintains he took the girls to protect them from his  
former wife, a woman he described as an alcoholic and unfit mother. 
She denies the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnstable County officials are now searching for Julie Poner, a  
mother who disappeared more than a month ago with her 4-year-old 
twins just as she was to have turned them over to their father. 
</P>
<P>
	Ermini said the center only handles cases where the courts have  
established legal custody. In Poner's instance, a probate judge 
granted her ex-husband, Jiri, temporary custody of the twins -- a 
boy, Miro, and a girl, Allie. 
</P>
<P>
	In many cases of family abductions, the parent will argue that  
the child was taken for the child's own good. 
</P>
<P>
	Poner makes similar claims. In an interview with The Boston  
Globe last week, she said she feared her husband would have taken 
the children if she had not done so herself. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe I'm the only mother who had to break the law  
to protect her children,'' she said, speaking from an undisclosed 
location. ``The children are much better off and safer and more 
secure than they would be if they were with their father.'' 
</P>
<P>
	From investigators' point of view, however, Poner is now a  
criminal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our opinion on this is very simple: We're just trying to find  
her and bring her back,'' said State Trooper Bob Knott. 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent national study, published in 1990, showed that  
163,200 children are abducted by relatives each year. That's out of 
932,000 adults and children reported missing last year, but the FBI 
said that between 85 and 90 percent of those were missing 
juveniles, most of whom were runaways. 
</P>
<P>
	In the majority of parental kidnapping cases, revenge against a  
former spouse is a primary motive, said Trooper Sarah O'Leary, who 
works for the state police's Missing Child Clearinghouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if the child is well taken care of, the long-term  
psychological effects can be devastating, said Geoffrey Greif, 
associate dean at the University of Maryland School of Social Work. 
</P>
<P>
	Children who are taken by their parents may be told the other  
parent died, or that the parent doesn't love them anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	The children are frequently given new names, haircuts and  
clothing. They can't see their friends. They can't return to their 
school. They might even be discouraged from excelling in academics 
or sports because a star student athlete might have his or her 
picture in the local newspaper, Greif said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report just completed for the U.S. Department of Justice,  
Greif interviewed so-called ``searching parents,'' whose children 
had been taken but were eventually recovered. The interviews took 
place an average of 10 years after the searching parent and child 
were reunited. 
</P>
<P>
	One-third of the parents said their now-adult children were  
having ``significant problems'' a decade after the abduction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Parents act thinking that they're doing things in the best  
interest of their kids,'' Greif said. ``But they're not looking 
down the road.''

<HEADLINE> Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Kevin Appier and Alex Fernandez showed off their  
surgically-repaired right shoulders once again for scouts Monday, 
while Kerry Wood flew back to Chicago to check on his injured 
elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, last year's NL Rookie of the Year and a key to the Cubs'  
pennant hopes, had an MRI exam, not knowing how seriously his arm 
was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday was a rough day,'' Cubs manager Jim Riggleman said.  
``We just crossed some fingers and hoped the news was not going to 
be bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood's test results are not expected until Tuesday, the Cubs  
said. He missed the last month of the regular season with a sore 
elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	At Dunedin, Fla., scouts from more than a dozen major-league  
teams watched Appier struggle for the first time this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Appier, who missed almost all of last season with the injured  
shoulder, labored through a brutal first inning where he threw 29 
pitches and gave up two hits, three walks and two runs in the 
Royals' 6-5 win in 10 innings over a split-squad of Toronto Blue 
Jays. 
</P>
<P>
	But then he settled down the next three innings and gave up just  
one hit, making sure the dozen or so scouts who were on hand will 
be back to see the next outing of the Royals' career strikeout 
leader -- assuming a deal's not made before then. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first inning was ugly,'' said Appier, 31, whose $4.8  
million contract is too rich for the Royals to afford. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was getting way ahead of myself. I had trouble with my  
rhythm and my stuff was really erratic and inconsistent. After 
that, I made an adjustment and I was able to stay back and improve 
quite a bit. It improved a lot, but not all the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Winter Haven, Fla., Fernandez allowed six runs -- five earned  
-- in 1 2-3 innings as the Florida Marlins lost to the Cleveland 
Indians 13-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez, who missed the 1998 season following rotator cuff  
surgery, had allowed only one run in his first two starts this 
spring. The Indians strung together five consecutive two-out hits, 
including Omar Vizquel's two-run double and Jim Thome's home run. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians were among several teams with scouts at the game to  
mark the progress of Fernandez, who may be traded by the Marlins 
for younger, less expensive players if he proves healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	At Tampa, Fla., Joe Torre told his New York Yankees team that he  
would undergo surgery for prostate cancer on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Torre told the club he would be back ``soon,'' there's no  
telling when the World Series champions will have him in the 
dugout. Speculation has ranged from opening day on April 5 at 
Oakland to the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no clue,'' the 58-year-old Torre said. ``I will be  
taking a little extra time. I want to make sure when I come back, 
I'm strong enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre plans to leave the Tampa area on Wednesday. He expects to  
be in the hospital for 3-4 days after the surgery, and has not 
decided where he will recuperate. 
</P>
<P>
	At Vero Beach, Fla., Gary Sheffield, who said last week he is  
considering retirement, has left the Los Angeles Dodgers for a few 
days to take care of some personal business. 
</P>
<P>
	But the team said Monday that Sheffield had planned the trip  
more than a month ago and that it was unrelated to his comments 
this weekend about possibly ending his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Dodgers have known about this since before spring  
training,'' said John Olguin, a team spokesman. ``He'll be back 
Tuesday evening.''

                       *Rangers 11, Phillies 10    	
</P>
<P>
	At Port Charlotte, Fla., Lee Stevens, filling in at first base  
for the injured Rafael Palmeiro, hit his third homer of the spring.

runs and six hits in the fifth inning.

<HEADLINE> El Paso Energy To Buy Sonat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- El Paso Energy Corp. is buying Alabama-based  
Sonat Inc. for $3.5 billion in stock to create the largest natural 
gas pipeline system in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal allows El Paso Energy to ship gas from supply fields in  
California and Texas to growing markets in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	Armed with 40,000 miles of pipeline -- about 25 percent more than  
rival Enron Corp. -- El Paso Energy will be transporting nearly 
one-fourth of all the natural gas moved in the United States each 
day. It also gives the Houston-based company access to the 
expanding Florida electrical market. 
</P>
<P>
	``New gas-fueled power generation development is particularly  
active in these areas,'' said El Paso Energy chief executive 
William A. Wise. 
</P>
<P>
	El Paso Energy's Southern operations previously were centered  
around Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co., one of its five subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the stock swap, El Paso Energy will assume about  
$1.9 billion in Sonat debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The original value of the deal was $3.9 billion, but El Paso  
Energy shares tumbled $3.68 3/4, or 10 percent, to close at $32.06 1/4 on 
the New York Stock Exchange after the announcement. Sonat shares 
slipped 43 3/4 cents to $29.62 1/2 on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonat is currently based in Birmingham, Ala., and the  
headquarters of its interstate pipeline, Southern Natural Gas 
Company, will remain there. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonat chief executive Ronald L. Kuehn Jr. will become El Paso  
Energy's nonexecutive chairman until the end of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	El Paso energy had revenue of $5.78 billion last year, compared  
to $3.71 billion for Sonat.

<HEADLINE> Cubs Await Word on Wood's Elbow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- The Chicago Cubs anxiously awaited word on  
Kerry Wood, hoping Monday that tests will show there is nothing 
wrong with his elbow and he won't need season-ending surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	The NL Rookie of the Year headed back to Chicago at midday, and  
the MRI exam of his right elbow was scheduled for Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday was a rough day,'' Cubs manager Jim Riggleman said  
before Monday's 10-7 win over the Oakland Athletics. ``We just 
crossed some fingers and hoped the news was not going to be bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, the sensation who struck out a record-tying 20 against  
Houston last May in his fifth career start, missed all of last 
September because of a sore elbow, then returned for Game 3 of the 
division series against Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	He was hospitalized twice at the start of spring training for an  
upper respiratory and gastrointestinal illness, then threw just 10 
of 26 pitches for strikes Saturday against Anaheim in his 1999 
debut and wound up with elbow pain again that night. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago hopes the pain is from scar tissue, not ligament damage.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was real down yesterday, understandably so,'' Riggleman  
said. ``He's a young power pitcher, and I don't know a young power 
pitcher who hasn't gone through it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though he has less than a year of major league service,  
Cubs players already look to Wood as a leader. Mark Grace compared 
him to Curt Schilling, Randy Johnson and Kevin Brown, calling him 
``almost irreplaceable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Kerry is one of those guys that can win even when he doesn't  
have his good stuff because of his reputation,'' Grace said. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Trachsel, Kevin Tapani, Terry Mulholland and Jon Lieber  
are the other four starters in the Cubs' rotation. If Wood is 
sidelined, Scott Sanders or Kurt Miller are the most likely 
replacements. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to go out there and pick it up,'' Sammy Sosa  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood was examined Sunday in Mesa by Anaheim team physician Dr.  
Lewis Yocum, who endorsed the decision to have him go back home for 
an MRI and an exam by Cubs physician Dr. Micheal Shafer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a setback for him if it shows up a problem,'' Riggleman  
said. ``But it's all speculation at this point.''

<HEADLINE>  Holyfield-Lewis Judge Defends Call </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Eugenia Williams trained to be a  
boxer. But she wound up going to modeling school, took up karate, 
got a job at city hall -- and became a boxing judge. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, she's the one on trial. And the verdicts aren't good.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams, one of three judges for Saturday's heavyweight  
showdown between Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis, said Holyfield 
won. In doing so, critics say, she cheated Lewis of a unified title 
and gave the sweet science the foul smell of a fix. 
</P>
<P>
	Announcer Jim Lampley, who called the fight on pay-per-view,  
called the decision ``fraudulent.'' Lewis trainer Emmanuel Steward 
used the word ``fix.'' Lewis said he was robbed. 
</P>
<P>
	New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer called for an  
investigation, his spokesman blaming either ``incompetence'' or 
``tampering'' for the decision. New York Gov. George Pataki asked 
the state Athletic Commission to investigate the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is either biased, incompetent or worse,'' said HBO  
matchmaker Lou DiBella. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman at the eye of the storm spent Monday far from the  
glare of Madison Square Garden's ringside klieg lights, answering 
telephones at a cramped office in City Hall, where she works as a 
$39,200-a-year accounts clerk. 
</P>
<P>
	She had no apologies. No, she wasn't told to favor Holyfield.  
No, she wasn't biased. No, she isn't incompetent. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are entitled to their own opinion. I called what I saw.  
I have no problems with that,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A lifelong boxing fan, Williams trained to be a boxer as a  
teen-ager when she was growing up here. She quit because there were 
no opportunities for women fighters, turning to karate instead. She 
raised two children as a single mother and working her day job in 
the city's landlord-tenant relations office. 
</P>
<P>
	Active with amateur boxing programs at the Police Athletic  
League, she began judging amateur fights in 1983, then moved up to 
the pro ranks in 1989. Since then, she has judged more than 90 
fights, including 27 world title bouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who won't give her age, has attended clinics and  
seminars put on by the sport's sanctioning bodies at least once a 
year throughout her tenure as a professional judge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've worked with her many times, and I've never had a problem  
with her,'' said veteran judge Eva Shain of Fort Lee. ``I can't 
answer for what happened the other night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Lee, president and commissioner of the IBF, which appointed  
her to the $1,600 one-night gig, called Williams a top-flight 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
	``She has impeccable credentials,'' Lee said Monday. ``She  
attends the seminars and she takes an active part in them. I don't 
question her decision. She is a good professional. When I appoint 
her, I expect her to record what she sees. If she says that's what 
she saw, then I support her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What Williams apparently didn't see was the fifth round, when  
Lewis battered Holyfield mercilessly, landing 43 punches to 
Holyfield's 11. 
</P>
<P>
	She awarded that round for Holyfield, shocking most observers.  
</P>
<P>
	Williams scored the fight 115-113 for Holyfield. WBA judge  
Stanley Christodoulou of South Africa had it 116-113 for Lewis and 
WBC judge Larry O'Connell of Britain scored it 115-115. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone's jumping on poor Jean for the way she scored, but if  
you look at the British official, he scored two rounds even and if 
he hadn't scored the last round for Lennox Lewis, Evander Holyfield 
would have won the fight,'' Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
	So why did Lee join with the heads of the WBA and WBC in  
immediately ordering a rematch? 
</P>
<P>
	``The major concern we had was that we didn't get a unified  
title holder, which is what we wanted,'' said Lee. Asked if he 
thought Lewis won the fight, he said: ``I really didn't think so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Promoter Don King, who had the most to lose in a Holyfield loss,  
denied the fix allegation. ``Absolutely not. Why would it even be 
considered that I fixed the fight?'' he said on ABC's ``Good 
Morning America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, meanwhile, took the hubbub in stride.  
</P>
<P>
	``As long as you're honest, they can say what they want to say.  
I'm not the first (person) that disagreed with someone else. I 
guess I won't be the last.''

<HEADLINE> Balloon Team May Have Broken Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The Swiss-English balloonists trying to circle the  
world nonstop broke American millionaire Steve Fossett's distance 
record Monday and sped across the Pacific toward Mexico, their 
control center said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland and Brian Jones of England  
finally reached a jet stream southeast of Hawaii after a seemingly 
endless float above the Pacific and picked up speed toward Mexico, 
which they hope to reach Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The center's computers showed that sometime Sunday evening, the  
Breitling Orbiter 3 broke the 15,203-mile distance record claimed 
by Fossett before he ditched near Australia last August. Their 
record claim must still be verified by the International Federation 
of Aviation. 
</P>
<P>
	By Monday morning, Piccard and Jones had traveled 16,511 miles  
since leaving the Swiss Alps on March 1, according to their control 
center. It said if all goes well, they could be over Mauritania on 
the West coast of Africa by Friday, completing their world circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``Psychologically, the sight of the Mexican coast will be very  
important to the pilots, after having spent the last six days with 
nothing but water around them,'' said team meteorologist Luc 
Trullemans. 
</P>
<P>
	The balloon has been traversing the vast Pacific, sometimes  
slower than 30 mph, since it left China last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The balloon entered the mouth of the subtropical jet stream 370  
miles south of Hawaii at 8 a.m. EST. Winds as fast as 134 miles an 
hour will push it toward Mexico, where it will likely cross the 
coastline near Guadalajara, the center said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The winds will decrease momentarily over the Caribbean, but  
will become very strong again from the Bahamas onwards,'' the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Before entering the jet stream the team climbed onto the outside  
of their shiny red capsule to check systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``It took only two hours -- instead of six -- to undertake the  
necessary verifications and modifications,'' the statement said. 
``This ... enabled the craft to position itself perfectly for the 
jet stream.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Piccard and Jones passed the halfway point Saturday in their  
round-the-world bid. If they complete the circuit by making it back 
to North Africa they will have traveled more than 26,000 miles.

<HEADLINE> FDA OKs Device To Remove Blood Clots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- People who need to have blood clots removed  
from blocked arteries before angioplasty have a new alternative. 
</P>
<P>
	AngioJet, a medical device that removes these clots, was  
approved Monday by the federal Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The device, which was approved in 1996 for use in people  
undergoing dialysis, is expected to be especially helpful to heart 
patients who cannot use the so-called clot-busting drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Angioplasty is a widely used method for treating heart arteries  
that have been narrowed. Up to a half-million of the procedures are 
done annually in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In an angioplasty, a tiny balloon is threaded into the blocked  
artery, inflated to widen the blood vessel, then deflated and 
removed. Usually the widening remains and blood flow is increased. 
Sometimes a device called a stent is placed in the artery to help 
it stay widened. 
</P>
<P>
	But sometimes blood clots form in the narrowed areas and these  
can lead to heart attack or death. Currently these clots are 
treated with clot-removing drugs. However, some people cannot take 
the drugs, particularly those who have a predisposition to 
bleeding. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA said it gave the AngioJet System expedited review and  
approved it less than six months after receipt of a marketing 
application from the manufacturer, Possis Medical of Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike drugs, which move throughout the patient's system,  
AngioJet can be targeted at a specific area and is faster, said 
Rick Kravik, principal design engineer at Possis. 
</P>
<P>
	AngioJet is a coronary catheter containing a steel and a plastic  
tube. It shoots a jet of saline solution from the metal tube back 
into the tip of the plastic one, creating a vacuum that pulls along 
any blood clots. Treatment with this device takes about one minute, 
the FDA said. Once the blood clot is removed, the patient can then 
undergo angioplasty. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA said the manufacturer studied 731 people at 41 medical  
centers in the United States and Canada who had symptoms of heart 
artery blockage. 
</P>
<P>
	In one study, 180 were treated with AngioJet and 169 were  
treated with urokinase, a clot-busting drug. The study showed that 
AngioJet was similar in effectiveness to urokinase. 
</P>
<P>
	In another study, 105 patients who could not be treated with  
clot-busting drugs were treated with AngioJet. The study showed the 
device to be equally effective in these patients, the FDA said.

<HEADLINE> Estonia Leader Sees NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Estonia expects next month's 50th anniversary  
NATO summit meeting in Washington to give a clear signal the 
alliance will admit new members in the early 2000s, President 
Lennart Meri said today. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he did not expect Russia to put up serious  
opposition to a second or third wave of NATO expansion although 
Moscow would be unhappy about it. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at the National Press Club, Meri said he would like the  
NATO summit to ``produce a road map elaborating what is required 
for membership, taking into account that NATO is not only a 
well-oiled military machine but an organization based on democratic 
values shared by big and small (member) nations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the summit simply reaffirms previous commitments to admit new  
members, Meri said, ``This will create more questions than 
answers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he planned to discuss Estonia's candidacy with Secretary  
of State Madeleine Albright. She said Friday, when the Czech 
Republic, Hungary and Poland formally joined NATO, that more 
members may be on the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO enlargement is not an event but a process,'' Albright  
said. ``It is our common purpose, over time, to do for Europe's 
East what NATO has already helped to do for Europe's West ... to 
continue erasing -- without replacing -- the line drawn in Europe by 
Stalin's bloody boot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Estonia is among a group of hopefuls waiting for the next round  
of enlargement that also includes Slovenia, Romania, Lithuania and 
Latvia. 
</P>
<P>
	In assessing the new applicants for membership, the allies  
examine criteria such as democratic development and whether they 
meet minimum military requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	Meri rejected arguments by critics of NATO expansion that it  
risks alienating Russia and could impede closer ties with Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Russian view of the alliance is changing and accession no  
longer is viewed with panic and animosity,'' Meri said. ``While 
Russia will not support a second or third wave of expansion it will 
not seriously oppose it. '' 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has called NATO's eastward push ``a movement in the wrong  
direction'' and cautioned against admitting the Baltic states of 
Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia that were once part of the former 
Soviet Union.

<HEADLINE> Rain Helps Fight Vs. Florida Fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAPLES, Fla. (AP) -- Wet weather gave a respite to crews battling  
fires in swampy southern Florida forest land that forced about 600 
people to flee their homes and blocked a major highway. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the rain arrived Sunday, flames had burned across an  
estimated 1,600 acres, damaging up 10 houses and threatening nearly 
200 other structures. A 20-mile stretch of Interstate 75, known as 
Alligator Alley, was closed as fires burned on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rain put a damper on the fire,'' Lt. Paul France of the  
Florida Highway Patrol said in Naples late Sunday. ``It knocked it 
down enough to give firefighters a break.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Residents were allowed back into their homes and I-75 was  
reopened late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	State fire officials kept a small crew of firefighters watching  
for flare-ups in the area bordering Big Cypress National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Wind up to 40 mph had fanned the flames close to homes in Golden  
Gates Estates, seven miles west of Naples. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point, France said, ``the wind took the fire so fast  
(firefighters) couldn't keep up with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two firefighters suffered second-degree burns.  
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the blaze wasn't known, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Clock Ticking on Naming Next Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Forget, for a moment, the new century and the  
new millennium. A new decade is about to dawn, and no one is sure 
just what to call it. 
</P>
<P>
	We're ending the '90s. We're entering ... the ``goose eggs''?  
The ``orbs''? The ``zippos''? 
</P>
<P>
	And what do we call the individual years?  
Two-thousand-and-three? Twenty-oh-five? Oh-seven? The Year Eight? 
</P>
<P>
	Thankfully, people are already on the case. Bond traders who  
sold 30-year bonds in 1980. Automakers marketing cars that will 
come out two, three, four years from now. Television news anchors 
who are already stumbling over dates that in decades past conjured 
images of spaceships and aliens in metallic jumpsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	And people like Andrew Novick, who works in the Time and  
Frequency Division at the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology in Boulder, Colo. The institute sets measures like the 
hour and the foot for the federal goverment. 
</P>
<P>
	``You wouldn't say ... let's see. You wouldn't say ... boy, I  
don't know,'' Novick stumbled. ``I think I've flip-flopped, from 
two-thousand-and-six to twenty-oh-six. But that's more nerd 
language. There's definitely no consensus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither is there a shortage of suggestions.  
</P>
<P>
	Among the monikers submitted to a ``Name That Decade'' contest  
held in October by The Washington Post: The Ooze, The Millies 
(playing off millennium) and The Naughties (playing off ``aught,'' 
the quaint term for zero). 
</P>
<P>
	Others spun off the news (The Second Ken Starr Decade),  
technology (Twenty Bytes) or James Bond (Double 0s, or The James 
Bond Decade). 
</P>
<P>
	The paper settled on The Pre-Teens, with a caveat: ``We'll never  
know the real winner until we get to 2000 and see what begins to 
trip off the tongues of those commencement speakers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Voice of America provoked a more global discussion with its  
contest this month. From the Philippines came the Empties, the 
Zippos and The Roly 0s. The Zeroes from England. The Zoos from 
China. And this poem from the Czech Republic: 
</P>
<P>
	``Now there's a task  
</P>
<P>
	To put a name  
</P>
<P>
	On something filled with nothing.

</P>
<P>
	Bond traders refer to the years 2000-2009 in single digits:  
oh-six, oh-seven. And while Wall Street isn't exactly known for 
rollicking high humor, traders nicknamed the first decade long ago. 
Bonds that mature in 2005 are ``nickels.'' Those issued in the 
first quarter of 1980 and maturing in February 2010 are ``Bo 
Dereks,'' for the sex symbol star of the movie ``10.'' Bonds issued 
the next quarter and expiring in May 2010 are ``DC-10s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston &AMP; Co., said he  
was recently writing a forecast for the first decade when the Name 
Dilemma struck. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wrote the 2000s, but that doesn't sound right. I kept  
looking at it, and you can't even hardly say it. It seems so 
awkward,'' Jones said. ``When I'm asked about it, I'll probably 
just say `the first decade of the new century.''' 
</P>
<P>
	For carmakers, the vernacular so far is  
two-thousand-and-whatever, as in General Motors' 
two-thousand-and-three Impala. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't say oh-three, OK? You put the preface of 20 because  
it's going to be new! A new millennium! A new car! The future's 
already here for us in the automotive industry,'' said Vince 
Muniga, a GM spokesman in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury is still out in the news industry, but CNN executive  
editor Ted Iliff predicts people will say 
two-thousand-and-whatever. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything sounds strange, that's the problem,'' he said.  
``Reading it is one thing, but having a CNN anchor say it is 
jarring -- for an anchor to say, `The Olympics of oh-four.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Gareth Branwyn tracks such issues for Jargon Watch, a column in  
the prominent computer lifestyle magazine Wired. He has 
participated in several online discussions on the topic and 
predicts people will opt for the brief. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything we do is so accelerated and truncated, to have to  
say `two thousand and ...' -- we're sort of wired to not expend that 
much time,'' he said. ``I think people will just say `10' or `12' 
... or maybe `oh-six' or `aught-six.' That might be geeky though.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Looking backwards won't help. The first decade of the 1900s was  
called ``The Progressive Era,'' according to Paul Boyer, who 
teaches American cultural history at the University of 
Wisconsin-Madison. The first decade of the 1800s was ``The 
Jeffersonian Era,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe something dramatic will happen next year. It doesn't  
have to be something bad -- maybe it will be something wonderful,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boyer remembers his grandfather -- who was born in 1871 --  
referring to individual years of the first decade as ``the year 
four,'' or ``the year one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We kids used to laugh like it was the beginning of time,'' he  
said.

<HEADLINE> Torre To Have Surgery Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Joe Torre paced back and forth, the locker  
room absolutely silent. His players wanted -- no, needed -- to hear 
from him, and the New York Yankees manager spoke without fear. 
</P>
<P>
	He will undergo surgery for prostate cancer on Thursday, he told  
them, and there's no timetable set for his return. And this, more 
importantly: Doctors believe they detected the disease in its early 
stages. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't question, `why me?' because I've been a very healthy  
person,'' Torre said after Monday's team meeting, ``and I intend to 
be a healthy person again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed in street clothes, Torre answered a couple of questions  
and even managed to mix in some humor during his 15-minute talk. 
Speaking to the team for the first time since his diagnosis was 
announced Wednesday, he also delivered this message -- bench coach 
Don Zimmer is in charge in his absence. 
</P>
<P>
	``You could hear a pin drop when he spoke,'' pitcher David Cone  
said. ``But just to see the look on his face, to be reassured, it 
meant a lot to us. Once again, he had a real calming effect on us 
at a troubling time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Torre told the club he would be back ``soon,'' there's no  
telling when the World Series champions will have him in the 
dugout. Speculation has ranged from opening day on April 5 at 
Oakland to the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no clue,'' the 58-year-old Torre said. ``I will be  
taking a little extra time. I want to make sure when I come back, 
I'm strong enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a tough few weeks basically because of the choices I  
had to make after finding out I had cancer,'' he said. ``You've got 
pockets of bad times. But I feel a lot better than I did last 
week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. William Catalona, one of the nation's top urologists, will  
do the surgery at Barnes Jewish Hospital in St. Louis. Catalona 
previously performed successful prostate cancer surgery on former 
Yankees general manager Bob Watson. 
</P>
<P>
	``From what he said, it sounds like they caught it early on,''  
said outfielder Darryl Strawberry, making a comeback this spring 
from colon cancer. ``The key is looking forward, not back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre plans to leave the Tampa area on Wednesday. He expects to  
be in the hospital for 3-4 days after the surgery, and has not 
decided where he will recuperate. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre talked to the team before it left for an exhibition game  
against Cincinnati in Sarasota, Fla. Last week, he told Cone, Joe 
Girardi and Paul O'Neill about the cancer, and had them break the 
news to the rest of the players. 
</P>
<P>
	He waited to fully discuss it with the club, Torre said, until  
he knew more about the disease and how to treat it, be it surgery 
or radiation. He was aware the delay would cause some uneasiness. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a problem in that room because they had not heard  
from me,'' he admitted. ``A lot of them were unsure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was quiet in there,'' he said. ``I think everybody was sort  
of relieved to see me come in there and tell them what's going 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The clubhouse was more subdued than usual after Torre's talk.  
Center fielder Bernie Williams quietly strummed his guitar, pitcher 
Jeff Nelson tallied up the players' NCAA pool picks. Zimmer 
declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the players appeared calmed at having seen their leader  
without any outward show of sickness, acting like it was any other 
team meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``He sounded like Joe always sounds, very upbeat, very  
optimistic,'' pitcher Mike Stanton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, there was this not-so-subtle symbol for all Yankees to  
see: Torre, whose office door had been shut in a sign of respect 
for several days, left it open when he left the park. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre walked out of Legends Field with his wife, holding the  
hand of his 3-year-old daughter. He had a smile on his face, and a 
copy of the Yankees media guide under his arm.

<HEADLINE>  No Major Trades for Pat Riley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- For the first time since taking over operations of  
the Miami Heat four years ago, Pat Riley will go an entire season 
without making a major trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's silence at last week's trade deadline speaks volumes to  
the Heat players. It was another sign that Riley thinks he has the 
nucleus to win a championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very encouraging. I'm ecstatic,'' said forward P.J.  
Brown, a Riley favorite whose name frequently has popped up in 
trade rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	While other teams were reshaping themselves in the free-agent  
frenzy that followed the NBA lockout, Riley merely dabbled while 
making sure his ``core guys'' were taken care of. 
</P>
<P>
	And after the Heat shook off injuries and a 1-3 start to win 14  
of their next 16 games, there seemed hardly any reason to tinker 
with success -- particularly in the NBA's short 50-games-in-90-days 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're 15-5 and leading the Atlantic Division, it's hard  
to break up a team like that,'' Brown said. ``You'd be hard-pressed 
to make a move.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that Riley hasn't pulled the trigger in the past. Each of  
his first three seasons in Miami was marked by a trade-deadline 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Riley turned over half his roster in one day with three  
trades, including a four-player swap which brought Tim Hardaway 
from Golden State. That came three months after he pried Alonzo 
Mourning from Charlotte in a six-player deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Riley sent three players to Dallas for  
high-scoring forward Jamal Mashburn. Last season brought the only 
deal that failed to pay dividends, when he traded Ike Austin to the 
Los Angeles Clippers for Brent Barry. 
</P>
<P>
	Then this year -- nothing. Even when word surfaced that Stephon  
Marbury could be available from Minnesota at the right price, 
apparently including Hardaway, Riley defended his nucleus. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people are talking about Timmy, they are talking about an  
important part of what we built,'' Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley did his tinkering around the edges early, signing guard  
Terry Porter and forward Clarence Weatherspoon as free agents to 
strengthen his bench. Both have paid off tremendously. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter, in his 14th season, has averaged 11.0 points per game,  
working both as Hardaway's backup and teaming with him as the 
shooting guard. He went 5-for-5 from the floor for 14 points in 
Sunday's 102-76 win over New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Weatherspoon, a seventh-year pro, is averaging 9.5 points and  
6.4 rebounds per game. He has 31 points and 14 rebounds in his past 
two games, hitting 13 of 15 field-goal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got two veteran players that have produced since they  
got here,'' Riley said. ``Our bench has given us a huge lift. Our 
veterans simply know how to play basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the Heat still figure to improve down the stretch. Mashburn  
and Voshon Lenard have missed virtually the entire season with 
injuries, and their return will provide a scoring boost. 
</P>
<P>
	Mashburn, out the past five weeks with a hyperextended left  
knee, is expected to return to practice within a week and should be 
activated by the end of the month. Lenard, diagnosed with a stress 
fracture in training camp, figures to return in time for the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``With those guys returning, it'll improve our team,'' Brown  
said. ``We're just scratching the surface right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Heat's current makeup has been good enough to lead the  
Eastern Conference. Next up: catching Utah and Portland for the 
best record in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're thinking about winning a championship, then we're  
thinking about getting the best record,'' Riley said. ``Why not?''

<HEADLINE> Farmers Learn Dangers of Manure Gas / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEOSTA, Iowa (AP) -- Iowa farmers can learn about the dangers of  
swine manure gas in a new building a state company has donated to 
Northeast Iowa Community College. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the $70,000 swine building, The Double L Group,  
which manufactures such buildings, is donating the time of engineer 
Matt Robert, who will teach classes held at the National Education 
Center for Agricultural Safety on the college's campus in Peosta, 
Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The hands-on training in the building will help prevent deaths  
and unnecessary exposure to harmful gases, said Sam Steel, managing 
director of the safety center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Farmers don't understand how gas works in the environment,''  
Steel said. ``There's new technology in buildings that farmers 
don't always keep up with. In the old days, pigs were outside and 
manure was dispersed and decomposed. Now, it's condensed and 
confined.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Solids in manure held in a pit under a swine building settle to  
the bottom of the slurry. When farmers agitate the manure to lift 
and combine the solids for removal from the pit, a spike or plume 
of hydrogen sulfide can rise from the pit and overtake the farmer 
and his hogs. 
</P>
<P>
	People who have long-term exposure to manure gas may be more  
susceptible to bronchitis, pneumonia and other respiratory 
infections. 
</P>
<P>
	They may have decreased lung function and emphysema-type  
symptoms, said Charlotte Halverson, a nurse at the center. ``Once 
you've had exposure, you lessen your ability to fight off 
infection,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers won't find protection by wearing a simple dust mask.  
They need to wear fitted respiratory masks. 
</P>
<P>
	Swine will be brought in only for demonstrations and will not be  
kept overnight in the building, because the center borders a 
residential area. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert said training sessions in the swine building will show  
farmers easy steps and simple things they might overlook that could 
help ensure their safety. 
</P>
<P>
	``A little gas sensor on you will tell you about gases. Just  
being aware will help. It's easier showing them than giving them a 
pamphlet,'' Robert said. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	VINTON, Iowa (AP) -- Three farmers who have already been selling  
their soybeans directly to the Japanese market have taken another 
step toward capturing more of the food processing dollar for 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	They've opened a soy processing plant.  
</P>
<P>
	Iowa Soy Specialties is operated by soybean growers Dan Van  
Steenhuyse, 46, of Mount Auburn; Homer Showman, 46, of Shellsburg 
and Marlyn Jorgensen, 59, of Garrison. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal of the company, said Showman, is to make nutritious  
soybeans palatable for people. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't have to change their diet and eat tofu,'' he said.  
People can add the healthful benefits of soy to their diet by using 
flour in familiar foods and by using textured soy protein as meat. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not trying to hurt livestock producers but add to meat  
the benefit of soy. If you're vegetarian, it's great,'' Showman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's retail products are low-fat soy flour and dried,  
texturized soy protein. One pound of texturized soy protein, when 
reconstituted, is equal to five pounds of meat in volume. 
Texturized soy protein has a shelf life of seven years in its dried 
form. 
</P>
<P>
	The company provides several recipes for its soy products,  
including a smoothie made with yogurt, fruit and soy flour. 
</P>
<P>
	Van Steenhuyse, Showman and Jorgensen were founders of Iowa  
Producers Cooperative, a specialty crop organization. When the 
three men formed Iowa Soy Specialties in 1997, they invited others 
to share the risk and now have 28 soybean grower-investors and 
seven other investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The grower-investors sell beans to the plant and receive the  
market price plus a small premium. Van Steenhuyse says they also 
will receive dividends when the company makes a profit.

<HEADLINE> Herzog Criticizes Baseball Owners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUPITER, Fla. (AP) -- Baseball owners hunger for money as if they  
were ``junkies panting after crack,'' Whitey Herzog says in his new 
book. 
</P>
<P>
	The former manager also compares commissioner Bud Selig to  
reliever Neil Allen in ``You're Missin' a Great Game,'' an often 
off-color account of his advice for baseball's leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	He assails interleague play, the presence of the designated  
hitter in one league and not the other and the gulf between the 
haves and the have-not teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll be honest with you,'' Herzog says. ``A lot of things  
about the big-league scene today make me want to throw up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Almost nothing is sacred. Herzog, famous for the jackrabbit  
style of play in the 1980s that was nicknamed ``Whiteyball,'' even 
takes a swing at the great home run chase. 
</P>
<P>
	He notes that all of that thunder didn't do the Cardinals or  
Cubs much good. The Cardinals finished 19 games out in the NL 
Central even with Mark McGwire's record 70 home runs, and the Cubs 
barely made the NL wild card and then got swept in three games by 
the Braves. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was good for the game -- for a year,'' Herzog said.  
</P>
<P>
	Herzog says owners don't pay enough attention to the game on the  
field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I used to go to owners' meetings for Gussie Busch, and it's  
the same today,'' he writes. ``The only thing they ever talked 
about was money. How can we raise more revenue? How can we get more 
money? That's why we have an extra tier in the playoffs now, that's 
why we have interleague play -- more revenue. It's why we have the 
DH, 30 teams and everything we have in the game. More revenue, more 
revenue! It's junkies panting after crack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He says Selig is a good person and adds he used to bounce ideas  
off him in the press box. 
</P>
<P>
	``How many guys sell enough Chevys in their lifetime to purchase  
a major league ball club?'' Herzog writes. ``You can't be a dim 
bulb and do that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see Bud a little bit like the way I saw Neil Allen when I  
got him for the Cardinals. I'd rather have had Bruce Sutter as my 
closer, but he'd gone to Atlanta; it was over, so why cry about it? 
I didn't feel perfect about Neil, but he was the best I had, so I 
handed him the ball and hoped for the best.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Put Herzog in charge, and one of his first acts would be doing  
away with interleague play, which creates travel problems and 
affects competitive balance. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps because he's still smarting from losing the 1987 World  
Series in the Metrodome, he'd put the World Series at a permanent, 
warm-weather, neutral site. 
</P>
<P>
	His example is Nashville, where a seven-game series with no  
travel could be contested in eight days and teams would have to use 
more of their rotation than is the postseason norm these days. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the Metrodome, Herzog also thinks Wrigley Field, Fenway  
Park and Coors Field are unfair to visiting teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``The purists say it would take too much away from the team's  
hometowns,'' Herzog said in the book, co-written with Jonathan 
Pitts. ``It'd take away the charm of one league playing for all the 
marbles in the other league's stadium. However, some of these 
places guarantee that the field, not the players, will decide some 
championships.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Herzog's favorites are all on display. Casey Stengel, his first  
manager, is also the subject of the first chapter. 
</P>
<P>
	He states his case that former teammate Roger Maris belongs in  
the Hall of Fame, just like the best all-around player he ever 
managed, George Brett.

	Herzog has a long memory. He devotes a lot of space to rehashing  
the 1985 I-70 World Series and the infamous call by umpire Don 
Denkinger, and to his rebuilding job that led to the Cardinals' 
strong run in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
	Regarding the '85 Series, he wishes that he'd taken his team off  
the field in protest, and that maybe if he had there would be 
instant replay in the World Series today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd have been fined, suspended, maybe ... run out of  
baseball,'' Herzog said. ``In other words, it would've been 
everything my game needed to kick it in the rear.''

<HEADLINE> Three Men Charged in Rape-Slayings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Police charged three men in connection with two  
rape-slayings after being tipped off by a 10-year-old who 
recognized her father's picture on television. 
</P>
<P>
	The 3rd-grader recognized her father and a friend when  
surveillance pictures of three men were shown on the evening news 
Wednesday, police said Sunday. The next day, the girl told her 
teacher and school officials contacted police. 
</P>
<P>
	``That tip gave us their names,'' said Lt. Nick Nickeas.  
``That's how we picked them up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keary Gagnier, 36, was killed in August and Merceda Ares, 31,  
was found dead in her apartment on Feb. 17, investigators said. 
Both women, who lived alone, were raped, robbed and strangled. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeking help from the public in solving the crimes, police gave  
television stations pictures from surveillance cameras at automatic 
teller machines where unidentified men allegedly used bank and 
credit cards belonging to the two women. 
</P>
<P>
	Police would not say whose daughter provided the tip. Two men --  
Ronald Hinton, 26, of Chicago and Michael Sanders, 25, of Evanston 
-- were charged with murder, criminal sexual assault, and home 
invasion in both slayings. The third, David Wales, 26, of Chicago, 
was charged with the same counts in connection with Ms. Ares' 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said DNA evidence linked the three men to the crimes. The  
men also allegedly used Ms. Ares' bank card and Ms. Gagnier's 
credit card on numerous occasions. 
</P>
<P>
	Hinton and Sanders were arrested Thursday. Under questioning,  
the two men then implicated Wales, according to authorities.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Olympic Probe Finds Offense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Two IOC members were cleared of  
corruption and bribery, but they did break rules in connection with 
Sydney's winning bid for the 2000 Olympics, according to a report 
released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The two members were Kevin O'Flanagan of Ireland and Niels  
Holst-Sorensen of Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by independent auditor Tom Sheridan found Sydney's  
bid guilty of ``numerous breaches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheridan found that Niels Holst-Sorensen and his wife took a  
trip to watch the 1993 French Open final at the invitation of 
Australian IOC official and bid team member Phil Coles. Their air 
travel and ``associated expenses'' were paid for by Sydney's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Holst-Sorensen confirmed Coles paid for the trip, but he did not  
believe it broke IOC regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid also paid for O'Flanagan and his brother to travel to  
London for the 1992 Wimbledon final. Sydney paid their air travel, 
accommodation and other costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my view, these trips are apparent breaches of the guideline  
which prohibits the giving of benefits ... in excess of a total of 
$200,'' Sheridan said in the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheridan also criticized the IOC's rules governing bids, saying  
they were ``unworkable and have fallen into disrepute and are 
almost completely ignored by candidate cities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG president Michael Knight said the report showed there was  
``no comparison between what occurred in Salt Lake City and what 
Sydney did to win the 2000 Games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nine IOC members have resigned or been expelled in the wake of  
the inquiry into Salt Lake City's bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	There were several other IOC delegates named in the Sydney  
investigation, but their cases have already been documented. 
</P>
<P>
	Swaziland IOC member David Sibandze, who already resigned, was  
also cited in the Sydney report, following assistance for his 
daughter Nomsa to study in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney officials also played a role in the immigration to  
Australia of the daughter and son-in-law of Romanian IOC member 
Alexandru Siperco, arranged a job interview for the son of Tunisian 
delegate Mohamed Mzali, found work for the son of Finnish delegate 
Peter Tallberg and sought to arrange work for a relative of 
Algeria's Mohamed Zerguini. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheridan said breaches of the IOC guidelines included the value  
of gifts given to IOC delegates, the duration of visits, the number 
of overseas trips made by Sydney bid members to lobby IOC officials 
and assistance in finding jobs for delegates' families. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he also was concerned by the Australian Olympic  
Committee's involvement in African training schemes. 
</P>
<P>
	AOC president John Coates has admitted paying about $35,000 each  
to delegates from Kenya and Uganda on the night before the 1993 
decision to award Sydney the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheridan concluded there was no breach of IOC guidelines because  
the arrangements did not involve the giving of benefits to IOC 
members or their families. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight and the SOCOG board ordered the inquiry by the former  
state auditor general following the news from Salt Lake's inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheridan said under the guidelines Sydney needed to give IOC  
delegates ``red carpet treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If they didn't, ``they may not have necessarily achieved that  
objective,'' of winning the Games.

<HEADLINE>  Spring Training Roundup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Kevin Appier and Alex Fernandez showed off their  
surgically-repaired right shoulders once again for scouts Monday, 
while Kerry Wood flew back to Chicago to check on his injured 
elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, last year's NL Rookie of the Year and a key to the Cubs'  
pennant hopes, had an MRI exam, not knowing how seriously his arm 
was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday was a rough day,'' Cubs manager Jim Riggleman said.  
``We just crossed some fingers and hoped the news was not going to 
be bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood's test results are not expected until Tuesday, the Cubs  
said. He missed the last month of the regular season with a sore 
elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	At Dunedin, Fla., scouts from more than a dozen major-league  
teams watched Appier struggle for the first time this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Appier, who missed almost all of last season with the injured  
shoulder, labored through a brutal first inning where he threw 29 
pitches and gave up two hits, three walks and two runs in the 
Royals' 6-5 win in 10 innings over a split-squad of Toronto Blue 
Jays. 
</P>
<P>
	But then he settled down the next three innings and gave up just  
one hit, making sure the dozen or so scouts who were on hand will 
be back to see the next outing of the Royals' career strikeout 
leader -- assuming a deal's not made before then. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first inning was ugly,'' said Appier, 31, whose $4.8  
million contract is too rich for the Royals to afford. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was getting way ahead of myself. I had trouble with my  
rhythm and my stuff was really erratic and inconsistent. After 
that, I made an adjustment and I was able to stay back and improve 
quite a bit. It improved a lot, but not all the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Winter Haven, Fla., Fernandez allowed six runs -- five earned  
-- in 1 2-3 innings as the Florida Marlins lost to the Cleveland 
Indians 13-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez, who missed the 1998 season following rotator cuff  
surgery, had allowed only one run in his first two starts this 
spring. The Indians strung together five consecutive two-out hits, 
including Omar Vizquel's two-run double and Jim Thome's home run. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indians were among several teams with scouts at the game to  
mark the progress of Fernandez, who may be traded by the Marlins 
for younger, less expensive players if he proves healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	At Tampa, Fla., Joe Torre told his New York Yankees team that he  
would undergo surgery for prostate cancer on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Torre told the club he would be back ``soon,'' there's no  
telling when the World Series champions will have him in the 
dugout. Speculation has ranged from opening day on April 5 at 
Oakland to the All-Star break. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no clue,'' the 58-year-old Torre said. ``I will be  
taking a little extra time. I want to make sure when I come back, 
I'm strong enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre plans to leave the Tampa area on Wednesday. He expects to  
be in the hospital for 3-4 days after the surgery, and has not 
decided where he will recuperate. 
</P>
<P>
	At Vero Beach, Fla., Gary Sheffield, who said last week he is  
considering retirement, has left the Los Angeles Dodgers for a few 
days to take care of some personal business. 
</P>
<P>
	But the team said Monday that Sheffield had planned the trip  
more than a month ago and that it was unrelated to his comments 
this weekend about possibly ending his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Dodgers have known about this since before spring  
training,'' said John Olguin, a team spokesman. ``He'll be back 
Tuesday evening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In other games:

                        *Red Sox 13, Pirates 2

runs and six hits in the fifth inning.

<HEADLINE> China Denies Stealing US Secrets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji today denied  
allegations China stole U.S. nuclear weapons secrets and said 
U.S.-China ties were being sacrificed to partisan struggles in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the nuclear secrets scandal, Zhu said he still planned  
to travel to the United States next month. He acknowledged, 
however, that the visit will be tough, given the espionage 
allegations and disputes on trade, human rights and Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has emerged an anti-China wave in the United States.  
This makes us feel uneasy,'' Zhu said at a news conference after 
the closing of the legislature's annual session. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think my visit to the United States will bring me into  
a minefield but I do expect to encounter some hostile or some 
unfriendly atmosphere there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The post-National People's Congress news conference is the one  
time each year China's premier faces the domestic and international 
media and usually covers an array of issues the government is 
concerned about. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu spent much of the news conference dealing with questions  
that touched upon ties with the United States, a key indication of 
how crucial smooth relations are for China in achieving its goals 
of economic development. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu urged Washington and the European Union to let China into  
the World Trade Organization after 13 years of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	But he downplayed speculation that a WTO deal could be struck  
before his Washington visit, saying ``there remains a considerable 
gap'' in negotiating positions. 
</P>
<P>
	He was unbending on human rights, long one of the most  
contentious issues with Washington and made worse in recent months 
by China's jailing of democracy campaigners trying to form a 
political opposition party. 
</P>
<P>
	``Only we know best how we can best protect and preserve human  
rights in China,'' Zhu said. He added, however, that his government 
was willing to hold talks on human rights. 
</P>
<P>
	On the nuclear scandal, Zhu dismissed claims that China stole  
U.S. military secrets as ``fallacy.'' He noted that China built its 
first atomic weapon on its own. 
</P>
<P>
	``China is fully capable of developing any military technology.  
It's only a matter of time,'' he said. ``Why should China have 
taken such big political and moral risks to steal military secrets 
from others?'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Taiwanese-born American scientist, Wen Ho Lee, was fired last  
week from a U.S. weapons lab amid suspicions that he shared secrets 
with Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhu noted that investigators have not found enough evidence to  
arrest Lee and suggested that he was being unfairly targeted. 
</P>
<P>
	An official newspaper, the China Daily said today that the  
dismissed scientist visited China in 1985 with his wife who was 
invited to speak at a conference on ``sophisticated computer 
topics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Asian Wall Street Journal reported today that Lee also was  
invited to Beijing by the Institute of Applied Physics and 
Computational Mathematics, which does research on nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee presented two technical papers in 1986 and 1988 relating to  
problems in controlling explosions, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Cold Virus May Cause Heart Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- A respiratory virus responsible for the common  
cold can also infect adults' hearts in rare cases, causing damage 
that can lead to heart failure and sudden death, a study found. 
</P>
<P>
	The study linked certain adenoviruses, which can cause upper  
respiratory infections, to a condition in adults called left 
ventricular dysfunction. Earlier studies found that some 
adenoviruses cause LVD in children. 
</P>
<P>
	The study's lead author, Jeffrey Towbin of Baylor College of  
Medicine in Houston, warned that less than 1 percent of those who 
get a viral infection with flu- or cold-like symptoms will be at 
risk for heart damage from infection. 
</P>
<P>
	Patients with LVD have a swollen left ventricle that is  
squeezing poorly, leading to disabling and eventually fatal heart 
failure and possibly sudden death. The symptoms can include fatigue 
or shortness of breath. 
</P>
<P>
	The heart condition can be revealed by a physical exam or chest  
X-ray. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have a cold and you get better and then, two to four  
weeks later, you feel bad again, it's probably worth contacting 
your physician,'' said Towbin, professor of pediatrics, molecular 
and human genetics, and cardiovascular sciences. ``If you don't 
have fever or a runny nose again and if it persists more than a 
couple of days, there may be something going on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study was published in Tuesday's issue of Circulation, a  
journal of the American Heart Association. 
</P>
<P>
	In the United States, two to eight cases of LVD occur per  
100,000 persons each year, according to the heart association. An 
estimated 40 out of every 100,000 Americans suffer from the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	LVD can also be caused by heart disease, genetic defects, or  
tissue damage from using cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one study has shown that young adults who develop LVD  
have a 50 percent chance of dying in the next seven years, said Dr. 
Steven E. Lipshultz, chief of pediatric cardiology at the 
University of Rochester Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, researchers studied tissue samples from the hearts  
of 94 adults ages 17 to 76 whose LVD resulted from an unknown 
cause. They found genetic evidence of adenoviruses in 12 of the 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Lipshultz said the findings could lead to the development of a  
vaccine to protect the heart against adenoviruses. There is a 
vaccine for some adenoviruses, but it is not widely used and may 
not be effective against the types that cause LVD.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices were little changed Monday as  
traders awaited more clues on whether the economy is growing at an 
inflationary pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged  
Monday. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, held 
steady at late Friday's 5.52 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent signs of economic strength have fueled worries the  
Federal Reserve might raise interest rates to slow the pace of 
borrowing and ease inflationary forces. Rising prices make 
fixed-income investments such as bonds less appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	This week's key reports include Tuesday's report on February's  
industrial output and Thursday's reading on last month's consumer 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market Monday, prices of short-term Treasury  
securities were unchanged or down 1/32 point, while intermediate 
maturities were unchanged, reported Bridge Telerate, a financial 
information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, rose 0.99 
points from late Friday to 1,287.90. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills eased to 4.58 percent,  
while the discount fell 0.01 percentage point from late Friday to 
4.46 percent. Six-month yields rose to 4.70 percent, as the 
discount rose 0.04 percentage points to 4.53 percent. One-year 
yields rose to 4.74 percent as the discount rose 0.02 percentage 
point to 5.52 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 5.13 percent from 4.75 percent late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 9/32 to 124 9/16. The average yield to 
maturity fell to 5.20 percent from 5.21 percent late Friday.

<HEADLINE> DuPont buying rest of Pioneer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Chemical giant DuPont Co. is paying $7.7  
billion for 80 percent of Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc., the 
world's largest seed corn company. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which was announced today, boosts DuPont's 20 percent  
stake in the seed company to full ownership and is DuPont's first 
deal since it announced last week it wanted to increase its 
presence in the life sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is expected to be completed this summer.  
</P>
<P>
	Under the terms of the agreement, Pioneer shareholders will  
receive $40 per share in cash and stock. 
</P>
<P>
	That is a 16.5 percent premium over Pioneer's stock price on  
Friday when it climbed 40 percent after the companies disclosed 
they were in talks on a possible business combination. 
</P>
<P>
	The boards of directors of both companies have approved the  
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both companies are customer focused with compatible cultures  
and values,'' said Charles O. Holliday, Jr., DuPont chairman and 
chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the combination of DuPont's agricultural businesses and  
Pioneer's seed business would create a $5 billion agricultural 
enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont's life sciences business totaled $4.3 billion in sales  
last year -- less than 20 percent of the company's total sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Pioneer will be a wholly owned subsidiary of DuPont, doing  
business under the Pioneer name and will remain headquartered in 
Des Moines. It has 5,000 employees worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	``Crop genetics offers tremendous potential for meeting the  
needs of farmers, agriculture and consumers around the world,'' 
said Charles S. Johnson, who will continue to lead Pioneer as 
chairman, president and chief executive. ``Bringing the talents and 
resources of our two companies more closely together will ensure we 
deliver that potential to the market and do it quickly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont's business moves have been swift in the life sciences  
area the last few years. Two years ago, it spent $1.7 billion to 
buy 20 percent of Pioneer Hi-Bred, with the companies creating a 
joint venture for crop research. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, DuPont spent $2.6 billion to buy out Merck Co.'s  
share in a joint venture between the two, creating DuPont 
Pharmaceuticals.

<HEADLINE> Rangers 1, Capitals 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Enrico Ciccone scored at 11:44 of the third  
period to lift the Washington Capitals into a 1-1 tie with the New 
York Rangers on Monday night in a game between two teams fighting 
for a playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
	The tie moved the Rangers one point behind the Boston Bruins in  
the race for the eighth and final spot in the NHL's Eastern 
Conference. The Capitals closed within eight points of Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	With New York nursing a 1-0 lead, Michal Pivonka won the faceoff  
in the Rangers' end, Tom Chorsky nudged the puck back to the left 
point and Ciccone beat Mike Richter with a low shot to the far side 
of the net. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams had excellent scoring opportunities in the overtime.  
Capitals goaltender Olaf Kolzig, who stopped 22 shots, made the 
save of the game on a one-timer from the slot by Scott Fraser with 
just over a minute left. Richter made 33 saves for New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Roman Ndur scored his first NHL goal to give the Rangers a 1-0  
lead. Ndur took a pass from Fraser just behind the left circle and 
blasted a slap shot through a group of players past Kolzig at 14:33 
of the first period. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers made the goal stand up into the third period despite  
managing only four shots in the first period and one through the 
first 11 minutes of the second. New York killed off a two-man 
Washington advantage for 40 seconds, and Richter was brilliant, 
making key saves on Jaroslav Svejkovsky in the first and Pivonka in 
the second. 
</P>
<P>
	New York has a 6-2-2 record in the 10 games since Wayne Gretzky  
was sidelined with a neck injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, the Rangers announced that the team's leading  
scorer, Adam Graves, had signed a multi-year contract. Graves was a 
potential free agent in the coming off-season. Terms of the 
agreement were not disclosed.

<HEADLINE> Paperback Sales Slip as Prices Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Could the taken-for-granted paperback mystery or  
romance book, bought cheap at a drugstore, pulled out on the train 
and stuck thoughtlessly in a coat pocket, be going the way of the 
vinyl LP? 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of mass-market paperbacks -- long a staple at newsstands,  
supermarkets and airport shops -- are sliding, under pressure from 
discounted hardcovers and the growing appeal of more literary, more 
expensive trade paperbacks usually sold in bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
	As prices of the mass-market books have inched toward the $8  
mark, sales slipped 7.8 percent from 1996 to 1997, according to a 
report by Veronis, Suhler and Associates, an investment bank 
specializing in media companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 35-cent paperback is now $7.99, ... which is not that far  
away from what a trade paperback costs,'' said Richard Howorth, 
president of the American Booksellers Association. ``Mass-market 
publishers may be pricing themselves out of the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mass-market paperbacks, many of them popular fiction, romance  
and mystery titles, are smaller and lighter than trade paperbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Since Pocket Books sold the first modern mass-market books for a  
quarter just before World War II, compactness and affordability 
have been their primary appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Take it on a plane, take it on a train, take it to the  
beach,'' said Jim Milliot, the business and news editor at 
Publishers Weekly. 
</P>
<P>
	But for consumers shelling out more money than ever for the  
books, flimsy may no longer be an advantage. And with chain 
booksellers heavily discounting best-selling hardcovers, many 
readers may decide not to wait the year or so it takes for a book 
to come out in paperback. 
</P>
<P>
	Some experts even suggest that aging baby boomers want books  
with larger typefaces. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to their troubles, mass-market paperbacks can't seem to  
get any respect in chain bookstores, which command a major slice of 
the book market, several publishing analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the smaller chain outlets that were once common in  
shopping malls, superstores like Barnes &AMP; Noble and Borders Books &AMP; 
Music focus most of their promotional muscle on new titles, often 
letting backlist mass-market books fend for themselves, Milliot 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mass-market never gets any flashy treatment at the  
superstores,'' he explained. ``They'll never even say, `The new 
(John) Grisham paperback is in.' You just have to go and find it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mass-market paperbacks accounted for 39 percent of all book  
sales in 1993, but fell to 36 percent in 1997, according to the 
Book Industry Study Group, a publishing trade association. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, many publishers emphasized that mass-market paperbacks  
were still important. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite some of the doomsayers, hundreds of thousands of  
mass-market paperbacks are sold in this country every day,'' said 
Stuart Applebaum, a spokesman for Random House Inc.

<HEADLINE> Snowstorm Sweeps Across East Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Just days before the official start of spring,  
people are getting a brisk reminder not to jump the gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the East Coast and the Midwest were pounded by snow,  
sleet and rain as a storm that had dumped nearly 2 feet of snow on 
the middle of the country moved east. Thousands were without power 
today in the Northeast and schools were closed or opened late from 
Tennessee to Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	Laura Beeman said the storm that struck Sunday was the worst  
she'd seen all year, and it came in time to pile snow on top of 
several inches remaining from a storm last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last year, there wasn't any time that people got snowed into  
their houses. (This year) pretty much no one's getting their car 
out,'' said Beeman, 21, a server at the Tombstone Cafe in 
Frostburg, in western Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought winter was a thing of the past. I guess I was  
wrong,'' Judy Azevedo said today in East Haven, Conn., after 
spending 20 minutes shoveling out her car. ``You know what they 
say, ``Beware the Ides of March.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Although snowfall was heavy in parts of the East, with 18 inches  
at the southwestern Pennsylvania city of Bedford, the storm's 
deepest accumulations came in elsewhere, with 23 inches from 
Saturday into Sunday morning in southwestern Missouri, stranding 
many motorists. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 travelers, including two busloads of St. Louis high  
school band students who had performed in Washington and Baltimore, 
hit the road today after spending the night on Red Cross cots at a 
school in Hancock, Md. They were delayed when westbound Interstate 
70 was closed by pileups Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were in the hallway, in the gymnasium, the auditorium,  
the cafeteria, anywhere they could find a spot,'' Hancock Town 
Manager Louis Close said. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 18 inches fell in Oklahoma, causing dozens of traffic  
accidents. At least 13 people were killed in weekend traffic 
accidents, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Weekend thunderstorms along the big weather system's southern  
edge caused flooding in Louisiana and power outages in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy, wet snow in the Philadelphia area snapped power lines,  
and PECO Energy Co. reported 75,000 customers without electricity. 
Overhead wire problems delayed commuter trains today. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennsylvania's House and Senate called off meetings today in  
Harrisburg. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures at or near freezing made the snow wet and heavy in  
Connecticut, pulling down tree branches and power lines all around 
the state. Northeast Utilities reported more than 57,000 customers 
without electricity as of 6 a.m. today, and that number was 
expected to grow as people awoke to report outages, said utility 
spokeswoman Deb Durbin. 
</P>
<P>
	In Maryland, utilities reported about 21,000 customers still  
blacked out today around Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 10,000 customers had no power today in West Virginia, where  
the foot of snow that fell on Preston County brought that county's 
total so far this month to more than 54 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	Some grinned and endured the messy weather. Many Baltimore  
revelers shrugged off the weather to celebrate the annual St. 
Patrick's Day Parade. Yet fewer than half of the 116 units 
participated. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the cheerleaders showed up, the Naval Academy Band  
canceled -- leaving the job of leading the parade to the Na Fianna 
Irish Pipe band -- and some of the floats were empty. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm so disappointed because it isn't going to be a big  
parade,'' said Pat Zanti, who brought her 9-year-old granddaughter, 
Lauren Zanti, and her friend to watch the parade.

<HEADLINE>  Pippen Searches for Offensive Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Scottie Pippen didn't expect to feel comfortable  
immediately with the Houston Rockets' offense. But he didn't expect 
to be a virtual spectator 22 games into the season, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen is getting more frustrated as his offensive production  
diminishes. The Rockets mostly pound the ball inside to Charles 
Barkley and Hakeem Olajuwon rather than run the ball, which Pippen 
prefers. . 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, who signed a five-year, $67.5 million contract in  
January, took only five shots and scored four points in 35 minutes 
Sunday during a 104-90 loss to the Phoenix Suns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm frustrated,'' Pippen said. ``Playing the minutes I'm  
playing, I'm not involved in the offense. It makes the game not fun 
anymore. My next step is to find why this organization wanted me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen is averaging 40.6 minutes per game, fourth in the NBA,  
but he doesn't believe the Rockets are getting the most from his 
talents. Against the Suns, Barkley took 21 shots and Olajuwon 14. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to get everybody involved,'' Pippen said. ``We have to  
make the game fun for everybody. There are nights when things are 
not going right. It's time to go to somebody else and get somebody 
else involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen had similar comments following Saturday night's 100-89  
victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers when he had only one point in 
the first half but ended up with 16 points and 10 assists. The 
Rockets might have lost without his second half spurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Against the Cavaliers, Pippen was 4-for-11 from the field and  
Olajuwon was 11-of-19. Pippen is averaging 15 points, 5.6 assists 
and 7.5 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been difficult for me,'' Pippen said. ``It's going to be  
hard for me to find myself in this offense. They've built the 
offense around getting the ball in to Charles and Hakeem. For me to 
get shots, that's not going to happen often.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen was accustomed to the consistency of the Chicago Bulls,  
where he was the sidekick for Michael Jordan. The Bulls won six NBA 
championships in Pippen's 11 years with the team. Pippen is not a 
pivotal part of the Rockets' offense and some of his teammates are 
aware of that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to do a better job of diversifying,'' Barkley  
said. ``We've got to do a better job of getting it to Scottie and 
Michael Dickerson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets have struggled to get all their all-star parts  
working together. They've beaten only two teams with winning 
records, but guard Brent Price has seen glimpses of what the 
complete offense can do. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had moments where we clicked on all cylinders and that  
is exciting to see,'' Price said. ``If we ever get into the flow, 
we can be dangerous. You don't just have a bunch of good 
individuals show up and be a good team. It takes time to learn each 
other and come together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen is awaiting more of those moments.  
</P>
<P>
	``If the opportunities are there, I try to take advantage of  
them,'' Pippen said. ``I am more accustomed to getting some 
(chances) throughout the game to see where my rhythm is from an 
offensive standpoint. You have to be patient.''

<HEADLINE> Olympic Movement's Progress Praised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Andrew Young, co-chairman of the 1996 Atlanta  
Olympics committee, praises the Olympic movement's progress under 
Juan Antonio Samaranch and portrays this week's showdown as part of 
a power struggle. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, the counterrevolution begins,'' Young wrote in an op-ed  
column for Sunday's Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ``The old guard 
fights back -- but the issue is not corruption; it is control. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any intelligent analyst must realize that excesses by the  
delegates from Finland, Kenya, Sudan, Libya, Congo and Mongolia are 
not capable of corrupting the Olympic movement,'' wrote Young, a 
former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been a series of resignations and disciplinary actions  
since vote-buying allegations were made in connection with Salt 
Lake's successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The full IOC will meet in Lausanne, Switzerland, in an  
extraordinary general assembly Wednesday and Thursday. The members 
will be asked to endorse IOC president Samaranch, uphold 
expulsions, approve a new bidding and site-selection process, and 
set up a panel to study long-term reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	In his column, Young said Samaranch ``broadened the political  
and economic base of the Olympic movement,'' adding representatives 
of developing nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, the current Olympic situation can be improved, but  
not by dumping Samaranch and a group of impoverished delegates,'' 
Young concluded.

aware of that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to do a better job of diversifying,'' Barkley  
said. ``We've got to do a better job of getting it to Scottie and 
Michael Dickerson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets have struggled to get all their all-star parts  
working together. They've beaten only two teams with winning 
records, but guard Brent Price has seen glimpses of what the 
complete offense can do. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had moments where we clicked on all cylinders and that  
is exciting to see,'' Price said. ``If we ever get into the flow, 
we can be dangerous. You don't just have a bunch of good 
individuals show up and be a good team. It takes time to learn each 
other and come together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen is awaiting more of those moments.  
</P>
<P>
	``If the opportunities are there, I try to take advantage of  
them,'' Pippen said. ``I am more accustomed to getting some 
(chances) throughout the game to see where my rhythm is from an 
offensive standpoint. You have to be patient.''

<HEADLINE> Senate OKs Nursing Home Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress sent to the White House on Monday a  
measure that would bar nursing homes from evicting residents who 
rely on lower-paying funding from Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, approved by voice vote in the Senate, says nursing  
homes that decide to withdraw from the Medicaid program may not 
expel or transfer current residents who pay through the government 
health insurance program for the poor. The bill was approved by the 
House last week in a 398-12 vote. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House said in a statement that it supports the  
legislation because ``America's nursing home residents must not 
live in fear that they will be evicted solely because they rely on 
Medicaid to pay for their care.'' It also has strong backing from 
senior citizen groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``America's seniors should be treated with reverence, not  
handled like refuse,'' said Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., a chief 
sponsor of the bill. The House sponsors are two Florida lawmakers -- 
Republican Mike Bilirakis and Democrat Jim Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida legislators pushed for the measure after a nursing home  
operator, saying it was doing renovations, sought to remove more 
than 50 Medicaid patients from a home in Tampa, Fla. The company, 
Louisville, Ken., -based Vencor, later reversed that decision under 
public pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Evan Bayh, D-Ind., also became involved when the same  
operator told Medicaid residents to leave a home in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once a nursing home accepts a patient, it should fulfill it's  
promise and allow the patient to remain a part of the nursing home 
community, regardless of payment status,'' Bayh said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Health Care Financing Administration, which oversees  
Medicaid, estimates that 58 nursing homes a year are withdrawing 
from Medicaid, which generally pays less than people who pay with 
their own money. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the measure, nursing homes could still choose to leave the  
Medicaid program, but they could not oust current residents and 
they would be required to tell incoming residents that Medicaid 
payments were no longer acceptable and they might be asked to leave 
if they later came to depend on Medicaid. 
</P>
<P>
	Two-thirds of elderly nursing home patients rely on Medicaid to  
pay for their care. With nursing home costs averaging $40,000 a 
year, about half of residents who begin by paying with their own 
money and health insurance must turn to Medicaid within three to 
five years. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 540.

<HEADLINE> IOC President Suspects Revolt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- IOC president Juan Antonio  
Samaranch suspects officials within his own staff are trying to 
force him out, Olympic sources told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch, who faces a crucial vote of confidence this week at a  
special International Olympic Committee general assembly, has told 
close associates in recent days ``there is someone in the house'' 
working against him. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has said he believes these elements are capitalizing  
on the corruption crisis engulfing the IOC to try to unseat him and 
install a new leadership, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources, who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity, have  
firsthand knowledge of Samaranch's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	Suspicion of a palace revolt marks a dramatic shift in  
Samaranch's position. He previously told close aides and friends he 
believed his IOC lieutenants were completely loyal. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was the first time I've heard him say this,'' one source  
said Monday. ``He has always stressed that the house was totally 
with him and there was no plot in the house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The house refers to the Chateau de Vidy, the IOC's  
administrative headquarters on the shores of Lake Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
	The sources said Samaranch did not identify who or how many  
might be involved in the suspected campaign. He will not be 
available for comment until after the general assembly on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has come under attack from critics outside the IOC in  
the wake of the vote-buying scandal stemming from Salt Lake City's 
successful bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	While critics have called for Samaranch's resignation, the  
78-year-old Spaniard has insisted he intends to serve out the rest 
of his term until 2001 if IOC members continue to support him. 
</P>
<P>
	The general membership is expected to overwhelmingly endorse  
Samaranch on Wednesday at the extraordinary session called to deal 
with the Salt Lake crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	But there has been increasing speculation, including among IOC  
officials, about the possibility of Samaranch stepping down before 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal last week quoted ``senior IOC  
officials'' as saying Samaranch might announce that he would step 
down later this year and stay on in a leadership role -- possibly a 
transitional co-presidency -- until the 2000 Sydney Games. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC leaders have denied the story, but the report created more  
suspicion and intrigue behind the scenes. 
</P>
<P>
	Apart from endorsing Samaranch, the assembly will be asked to  
ratify the expulsions of six members accused of accepting cash or 
other improper inducements from Salt Lake bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	A two-thirds majority of the expected total of 91 members is  
required for expulsion. If any of the expulsions are rejected, it 
would mark a critical defeat for Samaranch and his executive board. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're assuming the session will agree with the  
recommendations,'' Richard Pound, the IOC vice president from 
Canada, said. ``I hope it's understood we have to do this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The assembly will also be asked to approve a new bidding and  
selection procedure for Olympic cities, the creation of an 
independent ethics commission and the appointment of a reform panel 
to study long-term structural changes to the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments Monday:  
</P>
<P>
	-- the executive board backed Anita DeFrantz, the American IOC  
vice president. Dave Johnson, the former No. 2 official in the Salt 
Lake bid, told the New York Times last week that DeFrantz ``knew 
everything'' about the city's improper inducements. 
</P>
<P>
	DeFrantz has denied Johnson's claims. Pound said the matter was  
discussed briefly at Monday's board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``As of right now, the account we have from Anita is she did not  
know and we are satisfied with that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Pound said his inquiry commission has no evidence yet to  
investigate reports that Australian member Phil Coles received 
thousands of dollars worth of jewelry from an official of the 1996 
Athens bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles is under pressure in Australia to resign from the board of  
directors of the 2000 Sydney Games organizing committee. That 
position is contingent on his continued IOC membership. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Pound said the IOC is ready to open its books to the public.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Pound said the executive board has reached apparent consensus  
on the formula for choosing the 2006 Winter Games site. 
</P>
<P>
	In a process that would take place on the same day at the June  
session in Seoul, South Korea, a 15-member body would be appointed 
to narrow the six-city field to two finalists. The entire IOC 
membership would then vote to select the winner.

<HEADLINE> GOP Sen. John Chafee Retiring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Sen. John Chafee, an influential  
moderate Republican first elected in 1976, announced today he will 
retire next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee, 76, said he will not seek a fifth term in 2000.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to try something else,'' Chafee said at a news  
conference at the Rhode Island State House. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee was flanked by his wife, by his children and  
grandchildren, and by Gov. Lincoln Almond, like Chafee a 
Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Providence and a scion of one of Rhode Island's most  
powerful families, Chafee is perhaps the most popular Republican in 
the history of this overwhelmingly Democratic state. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his Senate service, his political resume includes  
six years as governor, 3 1/2 years as secretary of the Navy and six 
years as a state representative. 
</P>
<P>
	Considered one of the Senate's most liberal Republicans, Chafee  
has earned high praise from both the American Civil Liberties Union 
and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce during his tenure. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans now hold a 55-45 edge in the Senate, but must defend  
19 seats next year, compared with 14 for the Democrats. The 19 GOP 
seats include many held by first-termers who were pulled into 
office on the strength of the GOP landslide in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Miami of Ohio Players Welcomed Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Suddenly, Wally Szczerbiak goes to class and it's as if he never  
left the basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got in last night at 3 a.m. and there was a big welcome,''  
he said today. ``A lot of students were waiting for us. Today in 
class, I got a standing ovation when I walked in. The campus is 
buzzing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Szczerbiak and Miami of Ohio already have done better in the  
NCAA tournament than any team in school history. A 66-58 victory 
over Utah on Sunday marked the first time that the 10th-seeded 
RedHawks had won two games in the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	After upsetting last year's title game runner-up, Miami (24-7)  
will play defending champion Kentucky (27-8) on Friday in St. 
Louis. The back-to-back games against Final Four teams give the 
RedHawks a chance to take their program to an unprecedented level. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's kind of interesting the way it works out,'' Szczerbiak  
said. ``To knock off the second-place team in the whole country and 
now to have the opportunity to knock off the best, that's an 
opportunity a lot of teams don't get. We want to make the best of 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With coach Charlie Coles recovered from his cardiac arrest at  
last year's Mid-American Conference tournament and Szczerbiak back 
for his senior season, Miami expected big things from the outset. 
</P>
<P>
	The RedHawks broke into the Top 25 for the first time in 20  
years and won the MAC's regular-season championship. 
</P>
<P>
	They had to settle for an at-large bid after losing the MAC  
tournament title game to Kent in which Szczerbiak played despite a 
knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles gave his players the next two days off, a move that made  
all the difference. Szczerbiak's knee healed and the RedHawks 
pulled themselves out of their funk. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach gave us two days off to totally get away from basketball  
and take our minds off the game,'' Szczerbiak said. ``That really 
helped everyone get better physically and refresh our minds. It was 
like basketball was fun again. It was enjoyable and we've carried 
that on through the NCAA tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Szczerbiak carried them through a first-round win over  
Washington, piling up 43 points of his team's 59 points. 
</P>
<P>
	He had 24 points in the victory over Utah, which didn't make the  
same mistake of leaving him open. Coles laughed Monday when asked 
if he thinks any other team will make that mistake. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, no,'' he said. ``I hope people do, but I don't think so  
anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coles decided to return to coaching this season after his  
near-death experience on court a year ago in part because he was so 
close to his senior class. Watching them in the NCAA tournament has 
been extremely gratifying. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been a team that's been through some heartaches  
together,'' Coles said. ``It means a lot, but it means more for me 
after a game like yesterday to see that they're really happy and 
we've got another game together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami played Kentucky in the second round in 1978 and lost  
91-69. Kentucky has won the last 17 games and leads their series 
19-4. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're very talented and very deep and like to dictate the  
tempo,'' Szczerbiak said. ``We're going to have to try to dictate 
our own tempo and slow the game down a little bit. If we can do 
that, we feel we can match up well.''

<HEADLINE> `Analyze This' Rubs Out Competition / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>

``The Rage: Carrie 2'' and four other new films to remain on top of 
the North American box office, final figures showed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Starring Robert De Niro as a crime figure with emotional issues

<HEADLINE> GOP Sen. John Chafee Retiring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) -- Sen. John Chafee, an influential  
moderate Republican first elected in 1976, announced today he will 
retire next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee, 76, said he will not seek a fifth term in 2000.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's time to try something else,'' Chafee said at a news  
conference at the Rhode Island State House. His voice broke when he 
said: ``I want to come home.'' He was flanked by his wife, children 
and grandchildren, and by Gov. Lincoln Almond, a fellow Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican Party could end up losing Chafee's Senate seat in  
next year's election. Rhode Island is predominantly Democrat, with 
just 8 percent of voters registered as Republicans, and at the 
moment the state GOP does not have a strong candidate to run for 
Chafee's job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Senator Chafee seems to have found me a very big job,'' said  
Joan Quick, state party chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans now hold a 55-45 edge in the Senate, but must defend  
19 seats next year, compared with 14 for the Democrats. The 19 GOP 
seats include many held by first-termers who were pulled into 
office on the strength of the GOP landslide in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Only one other Republican has announced plans to retire so far:  
Florida Sen. Connie Mack, who is leaving after two terms. Three 
Democratic senators have announced retirement plans: Richard Bryan 
of Nevada, Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey and Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Providence and a scion of one of Rhode Island's most  
powerful families, Chafee is perhaps the most popular Republican in 
state history. 
</P>
<P>
	Considered one of the Senate's most liberal Republicans, Chafee  
is the senior member in a dwindling group of Republican moderates, 
working to forge compromises in divisive areas such as health care 
and child care. He is chairman of the Environment and Public Works 
Committee, where he is a key voice for environmental protection and 
conservation in his party. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, he praised Senate colleagues who have joined him in  
bipartisan efforts to get things done, and praised the 
predominantly Democratic voters who sent him to Washington, saying, 
``They seek, as I do, bipartisan solutions to problems, rather than 
partisan gridlock.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his Senate service, his political resume includes  
terms as state representative, governor and secretary of the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of Democrats have been mentioned as possible candidates  
for Chafee's seat. They include Rhode Island Secretary of State 
James Langevin; Myrth York, who has lost two gubernatorial races to 
Almond; and Rep. Robert Weygand. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's other congressman, Rep. Patrick Kennedy, has said he  
will remain in the House because of his increasing influence there. 
Kennedy was recently named chairman of the Democratic Congressional 
Campaign Committee. Nonetheless, some pundits wonder whether 
Kennedy, son of Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, will be able 
to resist making a run for Chafee's seat. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Republican side, Lincoln Chafee, the senator's  
45-year-old son who is mayor of Warwick, said he is considering 
running for his father's seat. He declined to elaborate on whether 
he is forming an exploratory committee or taking other steps. 
</P>
<P>
	``Can we talk about this tomorrow?'' he said. ``Today is his  
day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee was elected governor in 1962. He was re-elected in 1964  
and 1966, both by the largest margins in state history at the time, 
but was defeated when he sought a fourth term in 1968. Chafee was 
appointed secretary of the Navy in 1969, a position he held until 
1972. 
</P>
<P>
	He lost a 1972 Senate race to Democrat Claiborne Pell. But he  
won an open Senate seat in 1976, and was re-elected three times 
after that.

<HEADLINE> CIA To Probe China Spy Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The CIA named a retired admiral on Monday to  
review its own damage assessment into how much nuclear weapons 
technology, if any, was lost to China through a suspected spy 
working at the Los Alamos, N.M., National Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointment of retired Adm. David Jeremiah appeared aimed at  
adding an air of independence to an inquiry buffeted by partisan 
politics. Republicans have accused the Clinton administration of 
acting too slowly when the potential espionage problem emerged. 
</P>
<P>
	CIA Director George Tenet briefed the Senate Intelligence  
Committee on the ongoing inquiry, and afterward the top Republican 
and Democrat on the committee agreed that additional security 
changes need to be made at the nation's weapons laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., said the  
administration should consider a moratorium on scientific exchanges 
in which foreign scientists visit the national laboratories and 
U.S. scientists from the labs go overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is perhaps just the tip of an iceberg. We need security  
at our national labs. ... It has been too loose, too long, and it's 
too important,'' Shelby said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Bob Kerrey D-Neb., the committee's vice chairman, cautioned  
that the espionage case in question involved not an exchange of 
scientists but a potential breach by a single employee. But he 
agreed that security at the labs must be revamped. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's obvious that considerably more needs to be done,'' Kerrey  
said. ``This is something that is potentially a very serious 
situation that has damaged the security of the United States of 
America considerably.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tenet said Jeremiah will provide an independent review of the  
work being done now by a multiagency intelligence team. It is the 
second such assessment Jeremiah has been asked to do. Last year, a 
study led by Jeremiah identified problems that contributed to the 
intelligence community's failure to adequately warn of nuclear 
testing by India. 
</P>
<P>
	``Admiral Jeremiah is the perfect person to lead such a  
review,'' Tenet said. ``His credentials are impeccable and his 
credibility is unquestioned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeremiah's panel of outside experts will examine work begun in  
mid-February within the intelligence community about whether a 
Taiwanese-born scientist who worked at the Energy Department's Los 
Alamos laboratory provided China with technology that could be used 
in developing a multiwarhead nuclear weapon. China has yet to field 
such a weapon, but a document obtained by U.S. intelligence in 1995 
indicated that China had knowledge of technology similar to the 
W-88, a U.S. multiwarhead nuclear weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	A Taiwanese-born computer scientist, Wen Ho Lee, was fired from  
his job at Los Alamos a week ago amid suspicions that he leaked 
secrets to the Chinese in the 1980s. Lee has not been charged with 
any crime, and Newsweek magazine said the FBI now believes it has 
virtually no chance of making a case against him. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI began its investigation in 1996, and Republicans have  
accused the administration of dragging its feet by allowing Lee to 
continue working at Los Alamos long after the initial suspicions 
arose. 
</P>
<P>
	The intelligence damage assessment was ordered based on the  
recommendation in a classified report by a House select committee 
headed by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., which looked into a 
variety of charges that sensitive U.S. weapons and missile 
technology has been leaked to China. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate is holding hearings this week on the espionage case  
involving the Los Alamos nuclear weapons lab. The allegations date 
to the mid-1980s but only recently came to light. In the House, 
members are demanding public release of the classified, 700-page 
Cox committee report on technology transfers to China. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., in an interview on  
PBS' ``NewsHour with Jim Lehrer,'' also called for declassifying 
the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott said he had not been reassured by what administration  
officials have been saying about the case. ``What we need is 
answers. What happened? Why wasn't more done sooner? ... Most 
important, what are we going to do about it?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Beijing Monday, Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji rejected  
allegations China stole U.S. nuclear weapons secrets and said 
U.S.-Chinese ties were being sacrificed to partisan struggles in 
Washington. Despite the nuclear secrets scandal, Zhu said he still 
planned to travel to the United States in April. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think my visit to the United States will bring me into  
a minefield, but I do expect to encounter some hostile or some 
unfriendly atmosphere there,'' Zhu said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Monday the espionage  
allegations are certain to come up during Zhu's visit ``as part of 
the broad relationship we have with China.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All of these issues will be on the table,'' Lockhart said.  
``This is an important issue and it's important we have addressed 
it the way we have.''

<HEADLINE> Story Absolves Cleland in Explosion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For 31 years, Max Cleland has blamed himself  
for the grenade explosion that cost him both legs and an arm in 
Vietnam, thinking he accidentally dropped the grenade as he jumped 
from a helicopter near Khe Sanh. 
</P>
<P>
	But now, a former Marine corporal has come forward to tell the  
Georgia senator a different story. 
</P>
<P>
	David Lloyd, who says he was one of the first to reach Cleland  
after the explosion, said in an interview Monday that he treated 
another soldier that day who was sobbing uncontrollably: ``It was 
my grenade. It was my grenade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd said he doesn't know the other soldier's identity, but he  
was an Army private who had gotten off the helicopter just after 
Cleland and who suffered minor shrapnel wounds in the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	``I put maybe 20 battle dressings on him and the whole time he  
was crying, but he wasn't crying from the pain,'' said Lloyd. ``He 
was crying more from knowing it was his grenade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Lloyd's story has not been independently verified, Cleland  
said he met with the Annapolis, Md., man last week, viewed pictures 
and maps he brought back from Vietnam and has no reason to doubt 
his account. A Marine Corps spokesman said it would take several 
days to confirm Lloyd's military service. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes more sense than anything I've heard,'' Cleland,  
D-Ga., said in an interview Monday. He never knew the names of any 
of the soldiers or corpsmen who aided him on the battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
	Cleland was an Army captain in the Signal Corps when he was  
wounded near Khe Sanh on April 8, 1968. His radio team had gotten 
off a helicopter to help establish a relay station on a hill when 
he spotted the grenade and reached for it just before it exploded. 
</P>
<P>
	While he was never certain where the grenade came from, Cleland  
thought it had fallen from his own belt. 
</P>
<P>
	It was ``easy after Vietnam to blame yourself as the  
victim...,'' the senator said. ``What poured salt into my wounds 
was the possible knowledge that it could have been my grenade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd said he always knew Cleland was the soldier crippled that  
day. But until he saw the senator on a cable TV show two weeks ago 
telling how Navy corpsmen had saved him, he hadn't known Cleland 
was unaware the grenade that exploded had come from another 
soldier. 
</P>
<P>
	A few days after contacting Cleland's office, the two spoke by  
phone. They had lunch together last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't believe it,'' said Cleland. ``For 31 years you have  
in your mind a certain set of circumstances that you've pretty much 
come to terms with and all of a sudden a call like this out of the 
blue changes everything for you.... It sent cold chills down my 
spine, caused me to relive the whole thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleland speculated that the soldier Lloyd treated had joined his  
unit just before the fateful helicopter ride. He said he'd like to 
learn his identity. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd tell him, `Don't feel guilty. We were all in situations  
where this could have happened to any of us. Live life the best you 
can, which is what I'm trying to do. There should not be any guilt 
there. It was just a tragic accident.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Cleland said he plans to accept Lloyd's invitation for a fishing  
trip. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Vietnam War requires a great deal of healing afterwards,''  
he said. ``The deepest wounds and scars we carry are the ones that 
are not visible, and I've had a deep wound and scar about this all 
my life. I think this will help me move on to a little deeper 
healing than I was experiencing.''

<HEADLINE> Rocker Marilyn Manson Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- A Marilyn Manson concert was cut short  
when the shock-rocker fell onstage at the Great Western Forum and 
injured his ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did injure himself, a minor injury to his ankle. The  
concert was stopped early,'' police Lt. Alex Perez said early 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate word on Manson's condition. Two local  
hospitals said the singer, whose real name is Brian Warner, had not 
been admitted after Sunday's concert. 
</P>
<P>
	Concertgoers logging onto a bulletin board on the singer's  
official Web site said Manson jumped or fell from an amplifier or 
speaker during a rendition of ``Rock is Dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The concert halted after the band finished the song.  
</P>
<P>
	Concertgoers at first were told there were technical  
difficulties and the show would continue, but a second announcement 
indicated Manson had been injured and the event was over. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were not sent to the scene. A Fire Department dispatcher  
referred calls to the Forum but calls there rang unanswered early 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Manson was playing a much-anticipated concert along with  
Courtney Love and her rock band Hole. The show started at 7 p.m., 
with Monster Magnet as the opening act.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Foreign Policy Ranked No. 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans rank President Clinton No. 1 among  
postwar U.S. presidents on foreign policy success, up from eighth 
place in the middle of his first term, according to a poll released 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey, conducted every four years by the Gallup  
Organization for the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations, shows 
support for a strong defense and for efforts to fight terrorism and 
prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Less support is expressed for deployment of U.S. forces abroad.  
And, although the poll finds that more Americans measure strength 
in terms of economic than military power, there is less 
apprehension over economic competition from Japan or Europe than in 
previous surveys. 
</P>
<P>
	Mirroring high public satisfaction with the economy, the survey  
shows widespread contentment in the conduct of U.S. foreign 
affairs, despite rising Republican challenges to Clinton on his 
dealings with the Kosovo crisis, China's human rights performance, 
North Korea's weaponry programs, faltering Middle East peace 
efforts, Iraq's intransigence and other foreign policy issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey shows no indication that ordinary Americans view any  
of these as critical issues. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked to list the two or three biggest foreign policy  
problems facing the country, the most common response among the 
public, at 21 percent, was: ``I don't know.'' That was followed by 
mainly global issues: terrorism (12 percent), the world economy (11 
percent), balance of payments (10 percent) and the Middle East 
situation (8 percent.) 
</P>
<P>
	Gallup, which has conducted the survey in a similar manner since  
the 1970s, interviewed 1,507 men and women in October and November. 
The margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
Separately, the pollsters interviewed 379 policy leaders, including 
members of Congress, administration officials, international 
business figures and members of the news media. 
</P>
<P>
	In the leaders poll, which is less scientific but has included  
the same types of people every four years, the biggest problems 
cited were the world economy (21 percent), Iraq (18 percent), arms 
control (15 percent), Japan and the Asian economic crisis (13 
percent) and dealings with Russia (13 percent). 
</P>
<P>
	The survey was published today in the journal Foreign Policy.  
</P>
<P>
	Richard Haas, foreign policy director for the Brookings  
Institution, said the assessment of Clinton's foreign policy 
success reflects the prosperous times for Americans more than any 
real achievement abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people feel content with the world as it is, but  
history has a different standard,'' he told reporters at the 
presentation of the report. He said Clinton has missed several 
opportunities to develop a coherent post-Cold War strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton soared past Presidents Kennedy, Nixon, Truman,  
Eisenhower, Reagan, Bush and Carter, ranked in that order in 1994, 
to top the poll of presidents with ``very successful'' foreign 
policy performance since World War II. Only Presidents Ford and 
Johnson had trailed Clinton in the 1994 poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress also got improved marks, with 43 percent of those  
surveyed saying its role in foreign policy is about right, the 
highest number since the surveys began in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite general satisfaction with the direction of U.S. foreign  
policy, the survey revealed concern for the new century: 53 percent 
said they believe there will be more bloodshed and violence 
worldwide, with 19 percent predicting less. In the leaders survey, 
however, 40 percent said they believe there will be less violence 
and only 23 percent predicted more. 
</P>
<P>
	In the public poll, 84 percent listed terrorism as the most  
critical threat to the United States, up 15 points from the last 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions in the poll also ranked countries that respondents  
believe are vital to U.S. interests and gave each a ``thermometer 
rating'' on the respondent's warm or cold feelings. 
</P>
<P>
	Topping the list of vital countries was Japan, followed by  
Russia, Saudi Arabia, China and Israel. Among leaders, the ranking 
was China, Japan, Mexico, Russia, Canada, Saudi Arabia and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
	On the thermometer, with 50 degrees being neutral, Canada topped  
the chart for the fifth survey in a row at 72 degrees and Iraq hit 
the bottom with 25 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, concern for foreign policy issues ranked below key  
domestic problems in the poll. The biggest concerns cited by the 
public were crime, Clinton's personal conduct, drug abuse and poor 
education. For leaders, top problems were education, 
dissatisfaction with government, immorality and the troubled Asian 
economy.

<HEADLINE> Sheffield Exits Dodgers for Few Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VERO BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Gary Sheffield, who is considering  
retirement, has left the Los Angeles Dodgers for a few days to take 
care of some personal business. 
</P>
<P>
	But the team said Monday that Sheffield had planned the trip  
more than a month ago and that it was unrelated to his comments 
this weekend about possibly ending his career. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Dodgers have known about this since before spring  
training,'' said John Olguin, a team spokesman. ``He'll be back 
Tuesday evening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 30-year-old outfielder told the Los Angeles Times that he  
has thought about retiring because of chronic pain in his throwing 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said he was upset the Dodgers had reinstated a policy  
restricting facial hair and jewelry -- rules that were relaxed last 
season to accommodate Sheffield, who has worn a beard and earrings. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second year of a six-year, $61 million contract,  
Sheffield came to the Dodgers last May from the Florida Marlins in 
the Mike Piazza trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``To be honest with you, if I still didn't have five years left,  
and if not for the trade, I would retire right now,'' Sheffield 
told the Times. ``But you're supposed to honor things that you 
agree to, and that's what I'm trying to do, but it's hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheffield, who underwent surgery on his right shoulder during  
the offseason to repair tendon damage, has been moved from right 
field to left.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Co. To Cut 6,700 More Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing Co. officials say the fact they are  
cutting 6,700 more jobs than expected in the company's commercial 
airplane division is a sign of economic improvement, not more bad 
times. 
</P>
<P>
	``What the news really is, is that commercial has made  
substantial improvements. They began to make a turn in the fourth 
quarter last year and have continued to make improvements in 
production,'' spokesman Peter Conte said Monday. ``As you get 
better, and more efficient, you need less people to do the job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The additional cuts will mean total job reductions by the end of  
the year will be at the high end of a range of 28,000 to 38,000 
that the company announced earlier, Conte said. 
</P>
<P>
	While there will be layoffs, about half of the job cuts will  
come through attrition, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Machinists union officials say the new job cuts are uncalled  
for. The union, which represents Boeing production workers in 
Seattle and Wichita, Kan., negotiates a new contract with Boeing 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are not mere numbers. These are people with families  
working and living in the Puget Sound,'' said Bill Johnson, 
president of Machinists District Lodge 751 in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are people who are good, highly skilled workers. So  
good, in fact, that they are able to drastically reduce the time it 
takes to produce an airplane. So good, in fact, that Boeing's 
fourth-quarter profits were up. ... And instead of giving these 
people the job security that they demand and deserve, Boeing 
threatens their job,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing's profits and its stock price have been severely  
depressed during most of the past two years, the result of 
production line snarls, parts shortages and late aircraft 
deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
	The troubles began as Boeing was cranking up assembly lines to  
record production rates, and asking workers to perform vast amounts 
of overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then sales have slackened due partly to recessions in Asia  
and other markets and Boeing plans to reduce its production rates 
over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	It announced late last year it would reduce employment from its  
mid-1998 peak of 238,400 down to between 185,000 to 195,000 by the 
end of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Puget Sound area, where the majority of Boeing jetliners are  
assembled, will bear the brunt of the layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Jacobs, an analyst with Ragen MacKenzie, said white-collar  
workers, not production employees, will be the target of future 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they also will be cutting additional salaried workers  
such as engineers and technical workers to further reduce overhead, 
which is unrelated to what's going on in the production line,'' 
Jacobs said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Boeing had profits of just $1.1 billion or $1.15 a  
share on revenue of $56.2 billion. It lost $178 million, or 18 
cents a share, on revenue of $45.8 billion a year earlier. The 1997 
loss was the first for Boeing in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they are getting back on their feet but it's still too  
early to gauge how that might translate into improved 
profitability,'' Jacobs said. ``We're already expecting the profit 
levels to improve this year ... but do these additional cuts mean 
that the profit levels would be up further? We just have to wait 
and see.''

<HEADLINE> The Boss, McCartney, Joel Inducted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Three singers who dominated radio in the 1970s --  
Bruce Springsteen, Paul McCartney and Billy Joel -- joined the Rock 
and Roll Hall of Fame on Monday along with Dusty Springfield, who 
died two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Elton John inducted Springfield, recalling how he joined her fan  
club and stuck her pictures on his bedroom wall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every song she sang, she claimed as her own,'' said John.  
</P>
<P>
	Joel gave a long hug to fellow piano man Ray Charles, who  
inducted him. Joel said he learned his music from Charles, Otis 
Redding, and Wilson Pickett. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I've been referred to as derivative,'' Joel said. ``I'm  
damn guilty. I'm derivative as hell. If everyone who is derivative 
was excluded from this institution, there wouldn't be any white 
people here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony at the elegant Waldorf Astoria Hotel was to feature  
the first live reunion of Springsteen and his E Street Band in a 
decade, even though the band itself wasn't being inducted. 
</P>
<P>
	McCartney, who didn't attend when the Beatles were inducted in  
1988, was expected to make his first major public appearance since 
the death of his wife, Linda, last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Other inductees included ``Superfly'' singer Curtis Mayfield,  
already in the hall as a member of the Impressions; Del Shannon, 
who made ``Runaway'' a hit in 1961; and the gospel group The 
Staples Singers.

<HEADLINE> Rock Hall of Fame To Induct Three </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Three singers who dominated radio in the 1970s --  
Bruce Springsteen, Paul McCartney and Billy Joel -- were set to join 
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on Monday along with Dusty 
Springfield, who died two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony at New York's elegant Waldorf Astoria Hotel was to  
feature the first live reunion of Springsteen and his E Street Band 
in a decade, even though the band itself wasn't being inducted. 
</P>
<P>
	McCartney, who didn't attend when the Beatles were inducted in  
1988, was expected to make his first major public appearance since 
the death of his wife, Linda, last spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Other inductees included ``Superfly'' singer Curtis Mayfield,  
already in the hall as a member of the Impressions; Del Shannon, 
who made ``Runaway'' a hit in 1961; and the gospel group The 
Staples Singers. 
</P>
<P>
	Blues artist Charles Brown and the Western swing band Bob Wills  
and His Texas Playboys were honored as early influences. Beatles

	Clinton Urges Milosevic Kosovo OK  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton today challenged Yugoslav  
President Slobodan Milosevic to follow the lead of ethnic Albanians 
in pledging to sign a peace deal for Kosovo. He said NATO 
airstrikes are still possible. NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana 
said that if the Kosovars agree to sign and Milosevic does not, 
``The risk of a catastrophe would be very likely.'' Clinton said 
the Serbs should be given a chance to agree to peace, but said they 
``can't go on indefinitely.'' The agreement gives Kosovars autonomy 
for three years but not the independence they sought.

	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt  
endorsed Vice President Al Gore today for the Democratic 
presidential nomination, signaling that party leaders want to 
settle the nomination early and focus on winning next year's 
election. Gephardt was considered a viable candidate himself, but 
decided last month to concentrate on helping Democrats take control 
of the House. Gore's visits to New Hampshire and Iowa today are 
seen as attempts to distance himself from President Clinton.

about 3 percent. United Airlines started this round of increases

	Snowstorm Sweeps Across East Coast  
</P>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A storm that dumped nearly two feet on snow on  
parts of the Midwest last week pounded the East Coast overnight, 
knocking out power to thousands, snarling traffic and closing many 
schools and businesses. Areas of Maryland and West Virginia are 
under a foot or more of snow, and outlying sections of New York 
City got as much as 10 inches. The bad weather was blamed for a 
traffic pileup involving more than 20 vehicles on a Maryland 
interstate. Eighteen people were hurt, including five seriously, 
but none of the injuries were life-threatening, police said.

	BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji today denied his  
country stole U.S. nuclear weapons secrets and said the allegations 
are hurting U.S.-China relations. Zhu said he still planned to 
travel to the United States next month, despite what he called an 
``anti-China wave.'' He said the visit will be tough, given the 
allegations and disputes on trade, human rights and Taiwan. A 
Taiwanese-born American scientist was fired last week from a U.S. 
weapons lab amid suspicions that he shared secrets with Beijing.

	Parental Kidnapping on the Rise  
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The number of reported kidnappings is holding  
steady, except in one category: children taken by their own 
parents. Many cases are quickly solved, including some that turn 
out to be misunderstandings about when a parent was to return a 
child after a visit. But the most recent national study, published 
in 1990, showed that 163,200 children are abducted by relatives 
each year. Law enforcement officials say the primary motive is 
revenge against a former spouse, and that long-term psychological 
effects of abduction, even by a parent, can be devastating.

	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- The death toll rose to 28 today in a  
fire that swept through a New Delhi slum crowded by residents who 
scratched out a living selling paper and plastic to recyclers. 
Noxious smoke from burning plastic made the fire especially hard to 
control. In addition, firefighters had to bulldoze shacks along the 
slum's narrow lanes to make way for their trucks. Many of the slum 
residents were so-called rag pickers -- poor people who collect 
plastic bags, old newspapers and other trash to sell.

	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The NFL reportedly will fine exiled San

in a Louisiana gambling scandal. The San Francisco Chronicle 
reported today the decision to impose the fine may be announced 
this week. DeBartolo faces a total of $3 million in fines for his 
involvement with indicted former Louisiana governor Edwin Edwards. 
He pleaded guilty last year to one felony charge of failing to 
report an alleged extortion attempt by Edwards in connection with 
DeBartolo's bid for a riverboat gambling license.

<HEADLINE> Phoenix Area May Get Super Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- If a new stadium is built in nearby Mesa for the  
Arizona Cardinals, the NFL will award a Super Bowl following either 
the 2004, 2005 or 2006 seasons to the area. 
</P>
<P>
	The league's Super Bowl policy committee on Monday passed a  
resolution that upon completion of the proposed multipurpose 
stadium in the East Valley, the Cardinals would be host of a title 
game. Voters in Mesa will have two referendums on their ballot in 
May for the construction of a new stadium and convention complex. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the area would have to form a host committee and  
submit a bid that satisfies the league's specifications for staging 
a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix held the Super Bowl in January 1996 at Sun Devil Stadium  
in Tempe, the current home of the Cardinals.

<HEADLINE> Kentucky, Miami Advance to Sweet 16 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- It took defending champion Kentucky a little  
longer to get to the next step on the road to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
	In a battle between two of the most storied teams in college  
basketball history -- and their first postseason encounter -- 
Kentucky needed an overtime before edging Kansas 92-88 in the NCAA 
Midwest Regional. The victory sends the Wildcats on to the Midwest 
semifinal in St. Louis on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	To the surprise of many, Miami of Ohio will be Kentucky's  
opponent. The Redhawks moved into the Regional semifinals for the 
first time by upsetting No. 2 seed Utah 66-58. 
</P>
<P>
	Against Kansas, Scott Padgett scored a career-high 29 points --  
including 23 in the last 10 minutes and seven of Kentucky's 13 in 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Padgett, whose 3-point basket forced the overtime, opened the  
extra period with a 19-foot jumper and then added five free throws 
in the final 1:05 for Kentucky (27-8). He also had three of his 10 
rebounds in the overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of teams down six with a minute left would fold,''  
Padgett said. We've been there before and no one panicked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Padgett's 3-pointer with 18.7 seconds left in regulation tied  
the game at 79 and ended a 4:32 stretch in which Kentucky didn't 
make a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Kansas (23-10) still had a chance in regulation, but freshman  
Jeff Boschee was stripped by Turner while making a move to the 
basket. Kenny Gregory came up with the ball in the corner, but 
couldn't make the shot at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're sitting by yourself, you call it bad luck,''  
Kansas coach Roy Williams said. ``But I'm realistic enough to know 
that Padgett made a great play to get it to overtime and then kept 
going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan Robertson led Kansas with 31 points, including four  
3-pointers and 13 of 14 free throws. Boschee scored his 18 points 
on six 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jayhawks made 8-of-14 3-pointers in the second half, but  
just 1-of-8 in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne Turner had 19 points for Kentucky, while Heshimu Evans  
added 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami (24-7) had never before won two consecutive tournament  
games. Against Utah, the Redhawks showed plenty of poise. 
</P>
<P>
	Forward Wally Szczerbiak, who scored 43 points in Miami's  
opener, shot 48 percent from the floor, made 15 of 17 free throws 
and matched the Utes with 27 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah (28-5) held Szczerbiak to 24 points, only to have his  
teammates step up. John Estick scored 18 points and had six 
rebounds and reserve Jason Stewart added 12, including three 
consecutive 3-pointers in the first half to bring the Redhawks back 
from an 11-point deficit to 24-22. 
</P>
<P>
	``He stung us pretty good with those shots,'' Utah coach Rick  
Majerus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Szczerbiak was still a big presence in the game. His was perfect  
on his 10 free throws, including six in the final 89 seconds. He 
also grabbed seven rebounds and had five assists. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's definitely one of the best players I've ever had to  
guard, if not the best,'' said Utah's Alex Jensen. ``It was tough 
because every time he came down the court he came off some picks to 
get open shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andre Miller led Utah with 20 points, Hanno Mottolo had 12. They  
were the only Utes to score in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah, which won 23 straight and made it all the way to the  
championship game last season, ranked third nationally in defense 
this season. The Utes had averaged 72 points a game and been held 
under 60 points only three times this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky has played in three straight national championship  
games and gone 19-1 in the last 20 NCAA tournament games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel we can play anybody,'' Szczerbiak said. ``They're just  
a name.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Sen. John Chafee Retiring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- John Chafee of Rhode Island, senior member of  
a dwindling band of Senate Republican moderates, announced plans 
Monday to retire at the end of the term in a decision that 
strengthens Democratic chances of taking a seat away from the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to come home,'' the 76-year-old Chafee told a news  
conference, his voice breaking, as he declared he would not seek a 
fifth term. A three-term governor and four-term senator, Chafee has 
been the most successful Republican politician in generations in a 
state that is overwhelmingly Democratic. 
</P>
<P>
	As chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works, he  
has carved out a record that consistently wins the praise of 
national environmental groups. And he has bucked GOP orthodoxy on 
issues ranging from abortion to health care. Most recently, he was 
one of five Republicans voting to acquit President Clinton on both 
impeachment counts. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton issued a statement praising Chafee as a ``tireless  
champion of the environment'' and lauding his work to expand health 
care to more women and children and improving services for the 
disabled. ``It is truly a rich legacy for America,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as Democrats were cheered by Chafee's retirement, they were  
stung by the announcement in Nevada that former Gov. Bob Miller 
will not run for the Senate. Party elders had courted Miller to run 
for the seat being vacated by Democrat Richard Bryan. Former GOP 
Rep. John Ensign is already in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans hold a 55-45 majority in the current Senate but must  
defend 19 of the 33 seats on the ballot in 2000. Chafee is the 
second Republican to announce retirement plans; three Democrats 
have done so. 
</P>
<P>
	The affable Chafee had been favored for re-election to a fifth  
term, so much so that second-term Democratic Rep. Bob Weygand had 
said he likely wouldn't run for the seat if the veteran lawmaker 
wanted to stay on. 
</P>
<P>
	Weygand is now expected to run, along with several other  
Democrats. Others whose names surfaced in the aftermath of Chafee's 
announcement are Secretary of State James Langevin and Myrth York, 
who twice has been defeated in gubernatorial races. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's other House member, Rep. Patrick Kennedy, recently  
joined the Democratic leadership and he reaffirmed that he will run 
for re-election to his current job. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Republicans, Chafee's son, Lincoln Chafee, is said to be  
interested in running for the Senate. Mayor of Warwick, the state's 
second-largest city, he attended his father's announcement. ``Can 
we talk about this tomorrow?'' he said to reporters asking about 
his own plans. ``Today is his day,'' he said of his father. 
</P>
<P>
	Former GOP Rep. Ron Machtley is also a potential contender.  
</P>
<P>
	Chafee was elected governor in 1962 for the first of three  
terms. He was defeated for re-election 1968 and was named secretary 
of the Navy. He left the Pentagon to challenge former Sen. 
Claiborne Pell in 1972, but was defeated and his political career 
seemed to be over. Four years later, though, he was elected to the 
Senate, and he vanquished three opponents in the years since. 
</P>
<P>
	At his news conference, Chafee thanked the predominantly  
Democratic electorate who consistently sent him to Washington. 
``They seek, as I do, bipartisan solutions to problems, rather than 
partisan gridlock,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chafee frequently labored to bridge partisan gaps in the Senate.  
In 1994, he was a key member of a group of senators who struggled -- 
in vain -- to find compromise on comprehensive health care 
legislation that President Clinton had proposed and the GOP 
leadership was working to defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent years, he voted against legislation to ban ``partial  
birth abortions,'' even though it was a key item on the GOP agenda 
and his state is home to a heavy concentration of Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
	He also slowed the GOP drive for block grants in welfare,  
casting his vote in favor of requiring continued protection for 
pregnant women, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the Senate, Chafee has paid a price for his independence.  
Elected to the GOP leadership in the 1980s, he was ousted from his 
post in 1990 as the rank and file became more conservative. 
</P>
<P>
	If Republicans hold control of the Senate in 2000, his successor  
as chairman of the environment panel would be Sen. Bob Smith of New 
Hampshire, a fellow New Englander but considerably more 
conservative.

<HEADLINE> Paperback Sales Slip as Prices Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The life of a paperback book -- dog-eared,  
underappreciated and shoved in readers' back pockets for decades -- 
has never been glamorous. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it may no longer even be profitable.  
</P>
<P>
	Sales of mass-market paperbacks -- long a staple at newsstands,  
supermarkets and airport kiosks -- dropped 7.8 percent from 1996 to 
1997, according to Veronis, Suhler and Associates, an investment 
bank specializing in media companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the decline may be due to their $8 price tag.  
</P>
<P>
	``The savings aren't as great as they once were when paperbacks  
were under $5 and hardcovers were more than $20 dollars,'' said Jim 
Milliot, the business and news editor at Publishers Weekly. 
</P>
<P>
	Mass-market paperbacks accounted for 39 percent of all book  
sales in 1993, but fell to 36 percent in 1997, according to the 
Book Industry Study Group, a publishing trade association. 
</P>
<P>
	About 419 million of the books sold in 1997, down from 439  
million in 1992, the association found. It predicted that sales 
would drop to about 416 million by 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Since publisher Pocket Books sold the first modern mass-market  
books for 25 cents just before World War II, compactness and 
affordability have been their primary appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	But as prices for mass-market paperbacks -- many of them popular  
fiction, romance and mystery titles -- approach those of the slicker 
and larger trade paperbacks, the appeal may be waning. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mass-market publishers may be pricing themselves out of the  
market,'' said Richard Howorth, president of the American 
Booksellers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to their troubles, mass-market paperbacks can't seem to  
get any respect in chain bookstores, which command a major slice of 
the book market, several publishing analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike smaller bookstores, superstores like Barnes &AMP; Noble and  
Borders Books &AMP; Music focus most of their promotional muscle on new 
titles, often letting mass-market books fend for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	And with chain booksellers heavily discounting best-selling  
hardcovers, many readers have little incentive to wait a year or 
more for a book to come out in paperback. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, publishers emphasize that pulp paperbacks continue to  
represent a key part of their business. ``Despite some of the 
doomsayers, hundreds of thousands of mass-market paperbacks are 
sold in this country every day,'' said Stuart Applebaum, a 
spokesman for Random House Inc.

<HEADLINE> No Pitter-Patter of Panda Paws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- She's young and frisky. He's middle-aged and  
lethargic. So far, there has been no love connection. 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego Zoo scientists have been desperately trying to mate a  
giant panda couple in captivity, but so far the furry, 
black-and-white creatures have done nothing but get on each other's 
nerves. 
</P>
<P>
	``For this species, the outlook is gloomy,'' Don Lindburg,  
leader of the zoo's giant panda team, said last week. 
</P>
<P>
	On loan from their native China, 8-year-old Bai Yun and  
20-year-old Shi Shi have beguiled behaviorists hoping to mate the 
endangered animals since they joined the zoo in September 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the panda population worldwide continues to dwindle  
as development eats away at their bamboo-thick habitat. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, San Diego officials hold out hope that Shi Shi will  
impregnate Bai Yun naturally, saying the couple's sexual malaise 
may have been caused by putting the pair together too soon in the 
past two mating seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	With only about nine more breeding years before the pandas must  
return to China, San Diego has joined zoos around the world in a 
race to determine the optimum moment for insemination.

<HEADLINE> Rangers Extend Graves' Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Adam Graves, in the midst of one of his best  
seasons, has signed a contract extension with the New York Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	No terms were given in the announcement Monday by Rangers  
general manager Neil Smith, except that Graves had signed a 
multi-year extension. 
</P>
<P>
	Going into Monday night's game against Washington, the  
30-year-old Graves led the Rangers in goals this season with 33. 
Graves was tied for fourth in the league with 13 power-play goals 
and tied for fourth in the league with seven game-winning goals. 
</P>
<P>
	In 815 games with New York, Edmonton and Detroit prior to Monday  
night, the 6-foot, 200-pound left wing had scored 493 points on 265 
goals and 228 assists. 
</P>
<P>
	Graves holds the single-season Rangers record for most goals,  
52, in the 1993-1994 season. Graves was a member of two Stanley Cup 
champions, the 1990 Edmonton Oilers and 1994 Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a tremendous organization,'' Graves said of the Rangers.  
``It's great to play with the guys here -- Jeff Beukeboom, Brian 
Leetch, Mike Richter. I look forward to playing with all these guys 
for a few more years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graves said the Rangers had treated him very well, and he felt  
obligated to return the favor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was fortunate enough in '93-94, they tore (the contract) up  
and gave me a new contract,'' Graves said. ``I wanted to give Neil 
the same opportunity he gave me five years ago. Life is a two-way 
street.

<HEADLINE> Duke, SW Mo. State Win With Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The difficulty of what's ahead hit Steve  
Alford even before the end of the party marking the biggest triumph 
in Southwest Missouri State history. 
</P>
<P>
	Alford's Bears rode a stifling defensive performance to an 81-51  
victory over Tennessee on Sunday, putting Southwest Missouri State 
in the NCAA tournament's round of 16 for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears' so-called reward is a date with top-ranked Duke in  
Friday's East Regional semifinals at East Rutherford, N.J. The Blue 
Devils have won 29 games in a row, including back-to-back 41-point 
blowouts to open the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we've got our hands completely full preparing for the  
best team in the country,'' Alford said with a shrug and a weak 
smile as the last of the Bears' noisy revelers left the Charlotte 
Coliseum. ``But you know what? We'd much rather be doing that than 
not playing at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tulsa was the latest team to find out how imposing Duke can be.  
The Blue Devils (34-1) built a 30-point halftime lead on the way to 
a 97-56 victory over the Golden Hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
	``Duke is probably better than advertised from our  
perspective,'' Tulsa coach Bill Self said. ``We don't get a chance 
to see teams like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the Blue Devils overwhelmed the Golden Hurricane by  
forcing 20 turnovers, converting them into 30 points and limiting 
Tulsa to 34-percent shooting, Southwest Missouri State did a 
similar job on Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears (22-10) scored 24 points off Tennessee turnovers and  
harassed the Vols into 30-percent shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second big defensive game in a row for Southwest  
Missouri State, which two days earlier held Wisconsin to 32 points, 
the lowest output in an NCAA tournament game since the introduction 
of the shot clock. 
</P>
<P>
	Danny Moore had 25 points and eight rebounds to lead 12th-seeded  
Southwest Missouri State, which shot 52 percent, had a season-low 
six turnovers and never trailed. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon Wharton and Isiah Victor had 11 points each for  
fourth-seeded Tennessee (21-9). The Vols were held to their lowest 
point total in more than two months. 
</P>
<P>
	``No explanation. We had a lot of open looks,'' Wharton said.  
``I guess we just hit a cold streak there. They made all the big 
shots and we didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vols were seeking their first regional semifinal berth since  
1981. Instead, that slot goes to a team that has become another 
example of Alford's NCAA tournament success. 
</P>
<P>
	He made a then-Final Four record seven 3-pointers to lead  
Indiana past Syracuse in the 1987 championship game, and in his 
first job as a head coach, he led Manchester, a school that had 
never been to the NCAA tournament, to the Division III title game. 
</P>
<P>
	Now in his fourth season at Southwest Missouri State, he faces  
his biggest test yet, and he's trying to face it with humor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll possibly put up some detour signs so Duke maybe gets  
lost and we start the game playing five on nobody,'' Alford joked. 
``We need to get a quick start because Duke has been putting away 
people pretty quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tulsa can confirm that. The ninth-seeded Golden Hurricane  
(23-10) was held to 28-percent shooting in the first half, and 
Tulsa was unable to challenge the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Making things even tougher on the Golden Hurricane was the fact  
that Michael Ruffin, Tulsa's best frontcourt player, got into early 
foul trouble. He wound up with eight rebounds and three blocks, but 
was held scoreless. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we got down, most teams let up a little bit, but they  
kept competing the entire game,'' Ruffin said. ``They never gave us 
a chance to come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Avery had 19 points, Elton Brand 17 and Shane Battier 14  
for the Blue Devils, who made the round of 16 for the 10th time 
under Mike Krzyzewski. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Harrington had 15 to lead Tulsa, which allowed a pair of  
13-0 runs in the first half and fell behind by as many as 43 points 
in the second. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt like we could stop everything,'' Battier said. ``I  
can't put into words how great it feels.''

<HEADLINE>  Sosa Hits 450 Foot Homer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Sammy Sosa hit one that just kept going  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the left-field fence at HoHoKam Park, about 360 feet away.  
</P>
<P>
	Over the 50-foot-high scoreboard, about 30 more feet back.  
</P>
<P>
	Over the back wall of the ballpark, about 10 feet behind the  
board. 
</P>
<P>
	Over four full rows of cars in the parking lot.  
</P>
<P>
	This is Arizona, where balls rifle through the thin Sonoran  
Desert air. But by any stretch, this was a moonshot, a 
450-foot-plus bomb of a home run that tied him for the spring 
training lead at five with -- you guessed it -- Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	Left fielder Tim Raines turned to the crowd on the berm behind  
the fence and started laughing. Then he shrugged his shoulders, as 
in: ``What was I supposed to do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``When I hit the ball, I don't look how far it's going to go,''  
Sosa said after homering twice and driving in four runs in the 
Chicago Cubs' 10-7 win over the Oakland Athletics. ``I just let you 
people do that. I just try to make contact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jose Hernandez hit a pair of homers off loser Kenny Rogers. Sosa  
followed Hernandez's first-inning homer with a solo shot to 
left-center. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez hit a two-run homer off Rogers in the third, and Sosa  
hit his monster shot off Gil Heredia in the fourth, a three-run 
drive that made it 10-2. After blowing his traditional kiss in 
honor of his mother, Sosa bowed to the fans, a habit he picked up 
during last year's All-Star tour of Japan. He says he intends to 
bow after each home run this season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got some balls up, and the Cubs didn't miss them,'' A's  
manager Art Howe said. ``Right-handed hitters had a field day today 
with the wind blowing to left field. They capitalized on every 
mistake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After thrilling the nation with their historic home-run race  
last summer, won by McGwire 70-66, the pair are dueling again this 
spring. McGwire and Sosa were tied at 3 before McGwire hit a pair 
against the Los Angeles Dodgers on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, but this is spring training,'' Sosa said. ``Ain't no  
competition. We're just going out trying to do our jobs and make 
fans happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers was tagged for six runs and eight hits in three innings.  
He's lost both his starts this spring, allowing nine earned runs in 
five innings, a 16.20 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody goes through this,'' he said. ``I feel like right  
now, my location, it's not very good.'' 
</P>
<P>
 *Notes:* Results of Kerry Wood's MRI exam won't be available until  
Tuesday. ... Miguel Tejada hit a two-run homer off Terry Adams in 
the eighth and Domingo Cedeno hit a two-run homer off Ray King in 
the ninth. ... Ben Grieve was 4-for-5 with an RBI. ... Winner Steve 
Trachsel allowed two runs and five hits in three innings.

<HEADLINE> Enzyme Found That May Feed Tumors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An enzyme that normally powers cells has been  
found to also promote the growth of blood vessels that feed tumors, 
a discovery researchers say could lead to new drugs to fight 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Salvatore V. Pizzo, co-author of the study by Duke  
University researchers, said that without the energy supplied by 
the enzyme ATP synthase, tumors would not grow beyond the size of a 
pinhead because they could not develop the blood vessels needed to 
receive nutrients. 
</P>
<P>
	ATP normally resides inside cells, but Pizzo said his group was  
startled to find the energy packet on the surfaces of cells lining 
blood vessels. Their findings were reported today in the 
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers in many labs recently have been studying the growth  
of blood vessels that supply cancer tumors with oxygen and 
nutrients, searching for possible ways to shut off that blood 
vessel growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The research intensified after Dr. Judah Folkman of Children's  
Hospital in Boston showed that a compound he isolated from the 
blood, angiostatin, was able to stop tumor growth in mice by 
blocking the formation of blood vessels. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of compounds that can block blood vessel formation have  
been discovered. In fact, a separate paper in the same National 
Academy of Sciences publication today reports on isolating such a 
substance from cartilage. 
</P>
<P>
	But exactly how angiostatin and similar compounds work has not  
been known. The Duke discovery may be the answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Until now, people knew that angiostatin blocked blood vessel  
growth, but there was no obvious mechanism,'' said Pizzo. ``Now we 
know why it works.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The study ``is a big jump ahead ... because it identifies a  
protein that binds (attaches to) angiostatin'' and suggests how 
angiostatin prevents blood vessel growth, Folkman said. The 
discovery puts researchers on track to isolate a compound from 
angiostatin that could work more directly to block blood vessel 
formation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The discovery of ATP on the surface of endothelial cells, the  
lining of blood vessels, came as a surprise, said Pizzo. The enzyme 
was previously found only inside cells. 
</P>
<P>
	``ATP is what the cells use as a fuel, as an energy source,''  
said Pizzo. ``It is present inside the cell, in the mitochondria, 
and is the little energy factory for the cell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The enzyme apparently is activated when the blood's oxygen  
content is lowered. Nature may have designed ATP as a healing 
mechanism, to build new vessels so the body can repair tissue 
damaged by injury or disease, Pizzo said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tumors are that way,'' he said. ``Tumors tend to take  
advantage of a normal mechanism in the body and then exaggerate it 
to their own growth advantage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When tumors do form, cells in the center of the growth are  
deprived of oxygen. That may trigger the formation and action of 
ATP, said Pizzo. 
</P>
<P>
	With a better understanding of how ATP causes blood vessels to  
grow, researchers also might be able to use the enzyme to promote 
beneficial blood vessel growth, such as in heart disease or 
diabetes, Pizzo said.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Board Issues Crash Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Pilot error, training shortfalls and burnout  
are among the factors blamed for a crash of two Air Force 
helicopters that killed 12 airmen. 
</P>
<P>
	An overview of the investigation into the Sept. 3 accident of  
two Pavehawk helicopters was released by the Air Force Monday. The 
leader of the investigative board, Col. Denver Pletcher, said one 
helicopter had a new instructor pilot on board and a marginally 
qualified copilot and an unqualified gunner. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that if any one of the crew members in those critical  
positions we mentioned had been different or more experienced, this 
accident might not have happened,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two helicopters were taking part in a mock rescue of a  
stranded airman at night when one helicopter struck the second 
craft, tearing into the cockpit with its rotor. The two helicopters 
crashed in rugged terrain 65 miles northwest of Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Pletcher also said the victims, members of the 66th Rescue  
Squadron, were ``operating at a constant state of surge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All four pilots in this accident weren't as sharp as they  
could have been simply because they deployed too much,'' Pletcher 
said. ``The result in this case was chronic fatigue and burnout.''

<HEADLINE> Renault To Announce Nissan Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- French car maker Renault SA will buy a  
controlling stake in Japan's debt-ridden Nissan Motor Co. in a deal 
expected to be announced today according to a Nissan executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Renault's board is expected to approve the deal this evening  
after a meeting in Paris. While Renault's plans still would have to 
approved by a Renault employee council, Nissan's board is scheduled 
to meet Friday to approve the new alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	Renault is expected to invest between $4 billion and $6 billion  
in Nissan in exchange for roughly a one-third stake in the company, 
the executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Monday. 
With a 33.4 percent or more stake, Renault would have veto power 
over Nissan's decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The alliance, which would create the world's fifth-largest  
automaker, would give Renault a premiere distribution system in 
Asia as well as access to Nissan's superior technology in engines, 
suspension, batteries and fuel cells. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan, in turn, would get a desperately needed cash infusion,  
better European distribution and management talent. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, Renault would appoint a chief operating officer  
to Nissan who would handle the Japanese automaker's day-to-day 
operations and have a seat on Nissan's board, according to today's 
edition of the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading financial 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Renault is expected to name two additional members to Nissan's  
board. It was unclear Monday whether Nissan would increase the size 
of its board, or simply replace existing directors with Renault's 
picks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time for Renault to start looking off shore,'' said Jay  
Woodworth, an independent auto analyst in Summit, N.J. ``I'm not 
sure this is the right deal for them, but it's something that's 
very interesting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Nissan's real estate, some of which the company has  
owned for more than 100 years, is vastly undervalued on its balance 
sheet, and that the company is actually worth two to three times 
its $7 billion stock market value. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real estate holdings give it tremendous value, but its  
hard to convert that into cash to feed huge cash flow deficits,'' 
Woodworth explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoshikazu Hanawa, Nissan's president, and Louis Schweitzer,  
Renault's chairman, hammered out the agreement over the weekend in 
Paris. Nissan turned to Renault after negotiations with 
DaimlerChrysler collapsed last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan also is said to be negotiating with Ford Motor Co. The  
Dearborn, Mich.-based automaker reportedly is weighing a bid for a 
33-percent-or-more stake in Nissan, according to The Wall Street 
Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	Though with Ford recent acquisition of Volvo AB's car division,  
and Ford's controlling stake in Mazda Motor Corp., several analysts 
said Ford is unlikely to make a serious offer for Nissan. 
</P>
<P>
	A call to Ford was not immediately returned Monday.  
</P>
<P>
	Nissan, best remembered in the United States for its sleek Z  
sports cars, has struggled to turn around sagging market share with 
family sedans like the Altima and minivans like the Quest. Nissan's 
fiscal year ends on March 31, and the company's North American 
operations are expected to break even -- a dramatic improvement from 
a $700 million loss in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Renault dabbled in the U.S. market in the 1950s and 1960s, and  
owned American Motor Corp. and the famous Jeep brand before the 
former Chrysler Corp. bought it in 1988.

<HEADLINE> Film's First Superman Alyn Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Actor Kirk Alyn, a dancer who followed friend Red  
Skelton to Hollywood and became film's first Superman, has died 
after a long illness. He was 88. 
</P>
<P>
	Alyn died Sunday in a hospital near his home in The Woodlands,  
Texas, just north of Houston, friends and family said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Superman, the comic book hero born in the Depression, already  
had captured the imagination of a generation of children in print 
and on radio when Alyn agreed to play the part in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 37 when he starred as the Man of Steel in two pictures  
for Columbia Films: ``Superman'' in 1948 and in ``Atom Man vs. 
Superman'' in 1950. Each film was done in a 15-part serial format. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he asked me if I wanted to play Superman I thought it was  
a publicity stunt,'' Alyn told The Associated Press in 1987, the 
50th anniversary of the superhero. ``I didn't think you could ever 
put Superman on film. They brought the people from D.C. Comics over 
and they said, 'Hey, he looks just like Clark Kent.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Born John Feggo Jr. in Oxford, N.J., Alyn began his show  
business career in New York, first in vaudeville acts and later in 
chorus lines. 
</P>
<P>
	When his friend Skelton left for Hollywood, Alyn soon followed.  
There he met another dancer and actress, Virginia O'Brien. The two 
married in 1942 and divorced 12 years later.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Large chemical companies are well prepared for  
the Year 2000 computer problem, but smaller companies, many located 
near residential areas, may be less able to cope with potentially 
dangerous shutdowns, says a report presented to Congress today. 
Some 85 million Americans live within a five-mile radius of 66,000

Gerald Poje of the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation 
Board, told a news conference in the Capitol's Senate side.

Chancellor is shaking up top management -- with its chief executive 
stepping aside -- and scrapping the planned purchase of Lin

stock price by focusing solely on radio and outdoor advertising. 
Chancellor Media shares were up 1 3/16 to 45 9/16.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Legislation establishing quotas on steel  
imports has gained the backing of nearly half of the House despite 
signs that the domestic industry's outlook is brightening. 
</P>
<P>
	That strong support in a Republican-led Congress that usually  
opposes restrictions on free trade reflects a belief that the 
turnaround is only temporary and that much larger layoffs loom if 
the federal government doesn't do something soon. 
</P>
<P>
	A House vote is scheduled Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
	``Steel is still hitting the docks on the coasts ... cheaper  
than what is produced in the United States,'' said George Becker, 
president of the United Steelworkers of America. ``Not a thing has 
changed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some U.S. steel plants recently recalled workers laid off last  
year as the domestic industry faced a surge in low-priced steel 
imports. Some imports have dropped since November because of 
preliminary rulings on complaints, and several companies have 
announced price hikes for April and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, House support for strong trade sanctions remains  
strong. The bill has 205 co-sponsors, including more than 40 
Republicans with large steel constituencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``While the trade figures have marginally improved, the crisis  
continues,'' said Rep. Pete Visclosky, D-Ind., the bill's chief 
sponsor. ``We can't let the problem take care of itself. We have to 
take a global approach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill faces a veto threat even if it overcomes steep hurdles  
in the Senate, so it may never become law. But supporters say they 
are happy just to show Congress takes the issue seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the legislation would violate international trade  
agreements and ultimately could hurt the U.S. economy if other 
countries raise trade barriers in response. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really sends a pathetic message,'' said David Phelps,  
executive director for a Washington trade group for steel importers 
and exporters. ``One hopes there is some fundamental economic 
common sense in Congress and that they will give this legislation 
the indecent burial it deserves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steel imports reached record levels last year as the Asian  
economic crisis reduced demand for steel abroad and forced foreign 
producers to turn to U.S. markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite rehiring at some plants, thousands of steelworkers  
remain out of work and 100,000 more jobs are threatened when a 
contractual no-layoff clause expires this summer. Three companies 
have filed for bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
	Domestic producers and two steelworkers unions complained to  
federal government that Japan, Russia and Brazil illegally dumped a 
widely used product -- hot-rolled carbon steel -- in the United 
States at prices dramatically below production costs. Allegations 
have also been brought concerning cut-to-length plate, another 
major product line, as well as stainless steel. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary rulings in favor of the U.S. industry regarding  
hot-rolled carbon steel helped reduce those imports from the three 
countries by 96 percent since November. 
</P>
<P>
	But overall imports in January, the most recent figures  
available, remain 27 percent higher than December 1997 levels, 
while steel prices have barely inched back to what they were 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry fears that Japan and Brazil will now shift to other  
products and that other countries will fill the void on hot-rolled 
carbon steel. Russia has reached a broad agreement with the United 
States to curb imports. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're making some progress but the issue is a longer-term  
one,'' said Curtis H. Barnette, chairman and chief executive 
officer of Bethlehem Steel Corp. ``While there have been some 
modest price increases, the starting price is so low.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials, already reluctant to take steps that  
could start a trade war, have used the signs of improvements as 
reasons not to take stronger action on steel. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the U.S. steel industry has intensified its efforts  
in Congress. The House Ways and Means Committee last week cleared 
the way for a House vote on legislation that would restrict imports 
to pre-July 1997 levels. Although opposed by a committee majority, 
the panel sent it to the full House with a negative recommendation 
to avoid parliamentary tactics by supporters.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Co. To Cut 6,700 More Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing Co. said Monday it will cut 6,700 more  
jobs than expected, due to reduced overtime and other manufacturing 
efficiencies in its commercial airplane division. 
</P>
<P>
	The additional cuts will mean total job reductions by the end of  
the year will be at the high end of a range of 28,000 to 38,000 
that the company announced earlier, Boeing said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They began to make a turn in the fourth quarter last year and  
have continued to make improvements in production,'' Boeing 
spokesman Peter Conte said. ``As you get better, and more 
efficient, you need less people to do the job.'' While there will 
be layoffs, about half of the job cuts will come through attrition, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing's profits and its stock price have been severely  
depressed during most of the past two years, the result of 
production line snarls, parts shortages and late aircraft 
deliveries. 
</P>
<P>
	The troubles began as Boeing was cranking up assembly lines to  
record production rates, and asking workers to perform vast amounts 
of overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then sales have slackened due partly to recessions in Asia  
and other markets and Boeing plans to reduce its production rates 
over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	It announced late last year it would reduce employment from its  
mid-1998 peak of 238,400 down to between 185,000 to 195,000 by the 
end of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Puget Sound area, where the majority of Boeing jetliners are  
assembled, will bear the brunt of the layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Machinists union officials say the new job cuts are uncalled  
for. The union, which represents Boeing production workers in 
Seattle and Wichita, Kan., negotiates a new contract with Boeing 
later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are not mere numbers. These are people with families  
working and living in the Puget Sound,'' said Bill Johnson, 
president of Machinists District Lodge 751 in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are people who are good, highly skilled workers. So  
good, in fact, that they are able to drastically reduce the time it 
takes to produce an airplane. So good, in fact, that Boeing's 
fourth-quarter profits were up. ... And instead of giving these 
people the job security that they demand and deserve, Boeing 
threatens their job,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Peter Jacobs, an analyst with Ragen MacKenzie, said white-collar  
workers, not production employees, will be the target of future 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they also will be cutting additional salaried workers  
such as engineers and technical workers to further reduce overhead, 
which is unrelated to what's going on in the production line,'' 
Jacobs said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, Boeing had profits of just $1.1 billion or $1.15 a  
share on revenue of $56.2 billion. It lost $178 million, or 18 
cents a share, on revenue of $45.8 billion a year earlier. The 1997 
loss was the first for Boeing in 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing's stock fell 43 3/4 cents Monday to close at $34.68 3/4 on the  
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think they are getting back on their feet but it's still too  
early to gauge how that might translate into improved 
profitability,'' Jacobs said. ``We're already expecting the profit 
levels to improve this year ... but do these additional cuts mean 
that the profit levels would be up further? We just have to wait 
and see.''

<HEADLINE> Fund-Raiser Case Will Affect Others </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A fund-raiser who steered thousands of dollars  
from a Buddhist temple to the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign 
deliberately covered her tracks and deserves no protection from the 
First Amendment, a federal prosecutor argued Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Maria Hsia knew she was soliciting illegal campaign  
contributions and arranged to use straw donors to hide the true 
source of the money, Justice Department lawyer Elizabeth Collery 
alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	``That type of deceitful conduct is simply not entitled to  
protection,'' Ms. Collery said in trying to persuade a federal 
appeals court panel to reinstate five charges against Ms. Hsia. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hsia's lawyer, Nancy Luque, argued that a lower court judge  
was right to dismiss the charges. The judge cited the First 
Amendment's broad protections of religious expression and free 
speech in dropping the campaign finance charges last September. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Hsia, a California immigration consultant, is one of several  
foreign-born fund-raisers whose role in the 1996 campaign has 
become the focus of a Justice Department prosecution task force. 
</P>
<P>
	The fate of her case will affect at least two others in which  
government prosecutors have alleged that successful Democratic 
fund-raisers made ``false statements'' to campaign regulators. 
</P>
<P>
	Those cases -- against Thai businesswoman Pauline Kanchanalak and  
former Little Rock, Ark., restaurateur Yah Lin ``Charlie'' Trie -- 
are on hold while the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia decides what to do about Ms. Hsia. The three-judge panel's 
decision is due later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Paul Friedman had said prosecutors used  
``Alice in Wonderland '' logic to blame Ms. Hsia for false campaign 
filings, but said she still must stand trial for conspiracy 
involving $65,000 in illegal contributions by a California Buddhist 
temple. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hsi Lai Temple, the Los Angeles-area host of an April 1996  
fund-raiser attended by Vice President Al Gore, was named as an 
unindicted co-conspirator when Ms. Hsia was indicted last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The temple is a tax-exempt religious organization barred from  
participating in any political campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Friedman is also handling the Kanchanalak and Trie cases, and  
has dismissed some of the charges against each.

<HEADLINE> Indians Buying Back Their Heritage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONROE, Conn. (AP) -- Newly moneyed Indian tribes, reveling in  
the riches from casinos and other ventures, are bidding top dollar 
for artifacts from the American past -- leaving poorer tribes at a 
disadvantage in buying back their heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	Wealthy tribes are increasingly investing in impressive new  
museums, ``from the Mashantucket Pequots in Connecticut to the 
Seminoles in Florida to the Makahs in Washington State,'' says 
Ginger Ridgway, curator of a museum for Cahuilla Indians in Palm 
Springs, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	They need artifacts to display in those museums, and some can  
now pay almost any price. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mashantucket Pequots, for example, opened a $193 million  
museum in August and have been buying up baskets and other 
artifacts native to New England. Powered by earnings from their 
highly successful Foxwoods Casino in Ledyard, Conn., the Pequots 
have helped force prices sky high. 
</P>
<P>
	Ash and basswood baskets woven generations ago by the  
Schaghticoke tribe of western Connecticut sold for as little as 10 
cents in the 1950s and '60s, and a mere $50 to $75 in the early 
1990s, says Philip Liverant of Colchester, Conn., an antiques 
dealer for more than 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, they typically bring $300 to $1,000 apiece. Some sell for  
as much as $7,000, Liverant says. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a tremendous amount of interest in Native American  
goods'' from all quarters, he adds. ``They seem to have taken 
off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Schaghticokes also want to stock a museum but, lacking a  
casino, are unable to compete with richer tribes and non-Indian 
antiquarians in the open market. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are purchasing bits and pieces of our soul,''  
Schaghticoke Chief Richard Velky says. ``If it was a crucifix, a 
Torah scroll or a tombstone, I doubt these items would fall under 
an auctioneer's hammer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In California, the Agua Caliente band of Cahuillas has prospered  
from appreciation of land it owns in Palm Springs, the resort 
community 120 miles east of Los Angeles. A casino and hotel with a 
mineral spring spa have also paid dividends. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridgway, the curator, says Agua Calientes plan to expand their  
museum from 1,600 square feet to 30,000 square feet in the next 18 
months and have started a fund to buy back Cahuilla artifacts for 
the expanded space. 
</P>
<P>
	The 300-member Schaghticoke tribe has no such fund. Besides its  
relative impoverishment, it also lacks the federal recognition 
granted larger Connecticut tribes such as the Pequots or Mohegans. 
The Schaghticokes filed a lawsuit last June seeking federal 
recognition and more than 1,900 acres of ancestral land in 
northwestern Connecticut. Those claims are pending. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, tribal members continue to search for a  
unifying, tangible heritage, piece by increasingly costly piece. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent auction of a private collection of 278 American  
Indian artifacts, including 11 Schaghticoke baskets, highlighted 
the difficulty. The Schaghticokes have no budget to buy artifacts, 
so tribal historian Paulette Crone-Morange, a nurse who traces her 
Schaghticoke heritage to 1687, took her own savings. 
</P>
<P>
	Crone-Morange was able to buy six baskets woven in the 1800s for  
$1,700. But the five others, including one made by her 
great-grandfather, Henry Harris, were auctioned off for almost 
$12,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Such baskets were once vital to Schaghticoke tribal life. Made  
from interlaced strips of wood and stamped with berry juice 
markings made with carved potatoes, the baskets were originally 
used to carry eggs and berries. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, some Schaghticokes made their living selling baskets to  
white farmers. Industrious tribal members paddled down the Ten Mile 
River into New York state or up the Housatonic River into 
Massachusetts to sell the baskets, says tribal archaeologist 
Lucienne Lavin. 
</P>
<P>
	Crone-Morange says she grew increasingly frustrated at the  
November auction as she watched collectors and dealers push the 
bidding up. ``I'm getting angry, saying, 'But these mean nothing to 
you. This is our family.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Carol Knight, whose father, Lyent Russell, a Yale physics  
professor, amassed the collection over 80 years, was asked before 
the auction to consider donating the Schaghticoke baskets. She says 
a tribal member told her the baskets were sacred tribal objects. 
</P>
<P>
	``But sacred objects, to me, are used in burial or religious  
activities,'' Knight counters. ``These were not that. These were 
made for sale. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did not offer me any money for them,'' Knight says. ``My  
feeling is that my father bought them. He paid money for them.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Documents Face New Perils </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When the courier rode in from Chesapeake Bay  
with a British invasion force at his heels, State Department clerk 
Stephen Pleasonton understood the urgency of his message and wasted 
no time. 
</P>
<P>
	On that steamy afternoon in August 1814, Pleasonton found a  
stock of raw linen, had it hastily stitched into large bags and 
stuffed them with every state paper and important book he could 
reach, beginning with the Declaration of Independence, the 
Constitution and the Bill of Rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The bagged documents were loaded on a cart and driven away from  
the approaching army. They spent the first night of the journey 
hidden in an unused grist mill on the Potomac River. 
</P>
<P>
	By Aug. 24, when fires set by British troops were consuming the  
timbers of the Capitol and White House, the rescued documents were 
arriving at safe haven in Leesburg, Va., 35 miles northwest of 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Two centuries later, government officials, archivists and  
preservation experts still worry about the security of the 
ink-on-parchment documents they collectively call ``the charters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hostile British soldiers are no longer a concern. The modern-era  
perils these documents face range from terrorism to air pollution 
to deteriorating ink. And their custodians are designing systems to 
keep them from harm for centuries, perhaps a millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	These charters are the physical emblems of the ideas on which  
American representative democracy is built: The Bill of Rights 
spelling out individual freedoms; the Constitution with its 
governmental clockwork of turning gears and weights and 
counterweights; the Declaration of Independence, which a historian 
for the National Archives calls ``perhaps the most masterfully 
written state paper of Western civilization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of the three, the Declaration of Independence has suffered the  
most, mainly because there has never been a time in its 223 years 
that the American people have not wanted to see it. 
</P>
<P>
	The declaration and its opening words, ``When in the course of  
human events ...,'' was written in a bold, clear hand, probably by 
Timothy Matlack, a clerk working for the Continental Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Although it was widely copied, the original parchment was  
repeatedly rolled and unrolled for inspection, carted from one 
congressional meeting place to another, and at least once before 
1814, spirited away from advancing British forces. 
</P>
<P>
	But the interest in the document by the American people who  
wanted to see the document -- either in the original or in exact 
reproductions -- proved its worst enemy. 
</P>
<P>
	Reproductions took their toll. One method possibly used involved  
placing a damp sheet of thin paper directly on the surface of the 
document and pressing it until part of the ink was transferred. The 
inked paper could then be used to etch a copper plate that was run 
through a printing press. 
</P>
<P>
	The other enemy was prolonged exposure to sunlight. For 35  
years, beginning in 1841, the Declaration of Independence was 
displayed next to a window in the U.S. Patent Office. A magazine 
described ``that old looking paper with the fading ink.'' By 1873 
many of the signatures were said to be illegible. 
</P>
<P>
	For most of the last half-century the three charters have been  
displayed in sealed glass frames lowered at night into a vault 
below the rotunda of the National Archives building. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrangement has had its drawbacks. Specialists have been  
unable to obtain direct access to the documents for decades. And 
the glass sheets that have been pressing directly against the 
documents for all those years appear to be slowly deteriorating, 
creating the possibility of eventual damage to the parchment 
surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
	That situation is on the road to change.  
</P>
<P>
	This week, the National Archives will unveil test designs of new  
aluminum and titanium encasements that will enclose the documents 
in an atmosphere of inert argon gas. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrangements will be fine-tuned while the Archives rotunda  
undergoes extensive renovations over the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
	After manufacture and testing, the new cases will get a tryout  
period while displaying the rarely shown transmittal page of the 
Constitution signed by George Washington. The final product will be 
open for view early in the new century. 
</P>
<P>
	The Archives says that when these documents are at issue there  
is only one ultimate goal: ``To assure that they will survive as 
long as the United States does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Pleasonton would approve.  
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Jimenez, Sjoland Added to Masters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Even with a new set of qualifications for the most exclusive  
major championship in golf, Augusta National found room Monday for 
Miguel Angel Jimenez and Patrik Sjoland, giving the Masters its 
largest field in 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The special invitations offered to Jimenez, coming off a victory  
in his native Spain, and Sjoland, a 27-year-old Swede, should 
complete the field for the first major championship of the year 
unless someone not already in the Masters should win the next three 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both men are very talented players,'' Augusta chairman Hootie  
Johnson said. ``Both golfers finished among the top five last year 
on the European tour's Order of Merit and have competed 
successfully against the best players in the world. We are very 
happy to have them in our field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of Jimenez and Sjoland brings the total number of  
invitations to 104, which includes past champions such as Byron 
Nelson and Gene Sarazen. The 95 players expected to compete is the 
largest field since 103 played in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimenez won twice last year and finished fourth on Europe's  
money list. He received his invitation Friday during the Turespana 
Masters, then responded with a 62 in the third round that sent him 
on his way to victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``My message to them is get ready!'' Jimenez said. ``It proves  
that my game is in great shape for not only the Masters but also 
for the rest of the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the second Masters for Jimenez, who missed the cut in  
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Sjoland will be making his debut at Augusta National. He earned  
his first European victory last year in the Italian Open and 
finished fifth on the money list. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I answered the phone and heard it was from Augusta  
National, I went all wobbly,'' Sjoland said. ``I had to turn down 
the volume on my stereo. It was the best news I've ever received.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Augusta National traditionally extends special invitations  
to international players at its discretion, that number dropped 
sharply this year when the Masters for the first time decided to 
invite the top 50 players from the world rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	Those in the top 50 at the end of last year, and any others who  
made the top 50 last week after the Doral Open, received 
invitations. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimenez and Sjoland came close to getting into the Masters  
through the rankings over the past month. 
</P>
<P>
	Sjoland was No. 55 going into the Match Play Championship and  
was 3-up with four holes to play in the third round when John 
Huston rallied to win the match and keep the Swede from locking up 
a spot in the Masters. Sjoland slipped to No. 58 Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimenez needed a victory in the Portuguese Open two weeks ago  
and was three off the lead going into the final round but closed 
with a 76 and finished well back. With a special invitation in 
hand, he played the weekend like he had Augusta on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a great week with a lot of good things happening,''  
said Jimenez, who moved up to No. 47 in the rankings.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Higher; Dow Up 76 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average resumed its  
advance toward 10,000 today as a new round of corporate mergers 
sent stock prices higher. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow was up 76.32 at 9,952.67, less  
than 48 points from 10,000. The index of blue-chip stocks has 
flirted with the milestone in recent sessions, coming as close as 
42 points on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market appears to be tiptoeing toward Dow 10,000,'' said  
Alan Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. ``But we 
could reach that mark at any time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators were also higher today.  
</P>
<P>
	As the Dow stayed in a narrow range with relatively low volume,  
analysts said the market appeared to be awaiting a catalyst 
powerful enough to spark a strong run past 10,000. Monday's 
momentum came from announcements of several big mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	The $16 billion acquisition of BankBoston by Fleet Financial  
Group added some punch to the financial services sector. And DuPont 
said it will pay $7.7 billion to acquire 80 percent of Pioneer 
Hi-Bred International Inc., the world's largest seed corn company. 
</P>
<P>
	``These big deals are making investors feel very confident,''  
said Rao Chalasani, chief investment strategist at Everen 
Securities in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline stocks benefited from fare increases that will push up  
the price of a business fare about 1 percent and a leisure fare 
about 3 percent. UAL Corp., which also indicated its first-quarter 
earnings will top analysts' expectations, was up 6 5/16 at 73 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil stocks were among the decliners after rallying Friday as  
world oil producers agreed to cut their output. Chevron was off 
9/16 at 84 1/8, and Exxon was off 7/16 at 73 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
	By midafternoon, technology stocks, which have driven the market  
higher in recent months, looked stronger than the broader market as 
Internet stocks traded mostly higher. The Nasdaq composite index, 
driven by technology issues, was up 37.65 at 2,419.18. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues and decliners were nearly even on the New York  
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 576.1 million shares, well off 
Friday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 9.76 at 1,304.35, the  
NYSE composite index was up 2.83 at 614.47, and the American Stock 
Exchange composite index was down 1.68 at 719.53. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks rallied sharply overnight in Japan, as the Nikkei reached  
its highest level since last summer, rising 2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	European markets, however, were mixed. Germany's DAX index  
closed 0.2 percent higher, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 1.2 percent and 
France's CAC-40 rose 0.2 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Addressing the threat of terrorist strikes at  
home, President Clinton announced Monday that he was reallocating 
$11 million in federal funds to bolster urban medical teams trained 
to respond to chemical and biological attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The president made the announcement at the annual legislative  
conference of the International Association of Fire Fighters, whose 
members enthusiastically welcomed the news. 
</P>
<P>
	``In most instances of domestic terror, the first professionals  
on the scene will be the fire fighters,'' Clinton said. ``They're 
becoming the front-line defenders of our citizens -- not just from 
accidents and arsonists, but from those who would seek to sow 
terror, and so undermine our way of life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Clinton highlighted $21 million in grants already  
included in this year's federal budget to help train fire fighters 
to handle terrorist attacks and $73.5 million to help communities 
buy protective and communications gear. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said that technological advances and more porous borders  
would make the next century ``a century in which limitless 
opportunities will be linked to dangerous new threats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not trying to put any American into a panic over this,  
but I am determined to see that we have a serious, deliberate, 
disciplined, long-term response to a legitimate potential threat to 
the lives and safety of the American people,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the initiatives Clinton discussed Monday were included  
in the fiscal 1999 budget, but the $11 million he announced to 
bolster the rapid-response medical teams came from across-the-board 
cuts in the Health and Human Services budget. Two programs were 
exempt from the cuts, one that helps low-income families pay 
heating bills and one that bolsters child care. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's fiscal 2000 budget proposals call for spending $2.8  
billion to safeguard the nation against chemical and biological 
attacks, as well as assaults on sensitive computer networks. That 
plan includes $683 million to train and equip urban emergency 
personnel.

<HEADLINE>  Duke, SW Mo. State Win With Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The difficulty of what's ahead hit Steve  
Alford even before the end of the party marking the biggest triumph 
in Southwest Missouri State history. 
</P>
<P>
	Alford's Bears rode a stifling defensive performance to an 81-51  
victory over Tennessee on Sunday, putting Southwest Missouri State 
in the NCAA tournament's round of 16 for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears' so-called reward is a date with top-ranked Duke in  
Friday's East Regional semifinals at East Rutherford, N.J. The Blue 
Devils have won 29 games in a row, including back-to-back 41-point 
blowouts to open the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we've got our hands completely full preparing for the  
best team in the country,'' Alford said with a shrug and a weak 
smile as the last of the Bears' noisy revelers left the Charlotte 
Coliseum. ``But you know what? We'd much rather be doing that than 
not playing at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tulsa was the latest team to find out how imposing Duke can be.  
The Blue Devils (34-1) built a 30-point halftime lead on the way to 
a 97-56 victory over the Golden Hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
	``Duke is probably better than advertised from our  
perspective,'' Tulsa coach Bill Self said. ``We don't get a chance 
to see teams like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the Blue Devils overwhelmed the Golden Hurricane by  
forcing 20 turnovers, converting them into 30 points and limiting 
Tulsa to 34-percent shooting, Southwest Missouri State did a 
similar job on Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears (22-10) scored 24 points off Tennessee turnovers and  
harassed the Vols into 30-percent shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second big defensive game in a row for Southwest  
Missouri State, which two days earlier held Wisconsin to 32 points, 
the lowest output in an NCAA tournament game since the introduction 
of the shot clock. 
</P>
<P>
	Danny Moore had 25 points and eight rebounds to lead 12th-seeded  
Southwest Missouri State, which shot 52 percent, had a season-low 
six turnovers and never trailed. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon Wharton and Isiah Victor had 11 points each for  
fourth-seeded Tennessee (21-9). The Vols were held to their lowest 
point total in more than two months. 
</P>
<P>
	``No explanation. We had a lot of open looks,'' Wharton said.  
``I guess we just hit a cold streak there. They made all the big 
shots and we didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vols were seeking their first regional semifinal berth since  
1981. Instead, that slot goes to a team that has become another 
example of Alford's NCAA tournament success. 
</P>
<P>
	He made a then-Final Four record seven 3-pointers to lead  
Indiana past Syracuse in the 1987 championship game, and in his 
first job as a head coach, he led Manchester, a school that had 
never been to the NCAA tournament, to the Division III title game. 
</P>
<P>
	Now in his fourth season at Southwest Missouri State, he faces  
his biggest test yet, and he's trying to face it with humor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll possibly put up some detour signs so Duke maybe gets  
lost and we start the game playing five on nobody,'' Alford joked. 
``We need to get a quick start because Duke has been putting away 
people pretty quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tulsa can confirm that. The ninth-seeded Golden Hurricane  
(23-10) was held to 28-percent shooting in the first half, and 
Tulsa was unable to challenge the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Making things even tougher on the Golden Hurricane was the fact  
that Michael Ruffin, Tulsa's best frontcourt player, got into early 
foul trouble. He wound up with eight rebounds and three blocks, but 
was held scoreless. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we got down, most teams let up a little bit, but they  
kept competing the entire game,'' Ruffin said. ``They never gave us 
a chance to come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Avery had 19 points, Elton Brand 17 and Shane Battier 14  
for the Blue Devils, who made the round of 16 for the 10th time 
under Mike Krzyzewski. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Harrington had 15 to lead Tulsa, which allowed a pair of  
13-0 runs in the first half and fell behind by as many as 43 points 
in the second. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt like we could stop everything,'' Battier said. ``I  
can't put into words how great it feels.''

<HEADLINE> Fight Decision Prompts Three Probes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- The state began three investigations Monday  
into the controversial draw between Evander Holyfield and Lennox 
Lewis for the undisputed heavyweight championship. 
</P>
<P>
	State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, New York's Athletic  
Commission and the state Senate Committee on Investigations each 
announced probes of the bout at Madison Square Garden on Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	While most observers thought Lewis clearly dominated the fight,  
the judges disagreed. One had IBF and WBA champion Holyfield 
winning, one had WBC champion Lewis winning and the third called it 
a draw. 
</P>
<P>
	The sport's three sanctioning bodies have called for a rematch  
within six months amid suggestions that the fight was rigged. 
</P>
<P>
	``Judging in an athletic contest is always a subjective  
process,'' said Spitzer, a Democrat who took office in January. 
``In this case, however, the judges' decision was so out of line 
with the reality of what happened in the ring that it has raised 
legitimate questions of either tampering, incompetence or both.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spitzer scheduled a hearing for Friday in New York City to hear  
from the three judges and others involved in the fight, which could 
include promoter Don King. 
</P>
<P>
	King denied he had anything to do with the judges, who are  
selected by the sanctioning bodies and can be replaced if either 
fighter objects. 
</P>
<P>
	``My job is to present a great event and to sell tickets, not  
select judges or determine the outcome of the fight in any way,'' 
King said Monday in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anytime that you have human judgment involved in making calls,  
you may have a certain amount of conflict. ... These decisions 
involve people making subjective calls and judgments and those 
decisions can be extremely controversial at times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Spitzer said he would hold the hearing in his capacity as  
chairman of a boxing task force within the National Association of 
Attorneys General. The task force is developing recommendations to 
reform the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	Spitzer's spokesman Darren Dopp said ``subpoenas are a  
possibility'' to make sure the judges appear at the hearing, ``but 
now we are simply making an invitation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Lee, president of the International Boxing Federation, said  
he would be happy to cooperate with any state inquiry. He defended 
the judges as fair and derided those portraying the decision as 
``sinister.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They are out there saying there is something wrong with it  
because they don't understand how these officials are selected, the 
training they go through and the fact that it is subjective and 
they all don't see the same thing,'' Lee said. ``They are three 
world-class officials who all saw the fight differently, and I 
respect that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate Committee on Investigations also has subpoena power  
to compel witnesses to appear. Chairman Roy Goodman said Monday he 
would hold a public hearing in the near future to take testimony 
from the three judges, referee Arthur Mercante Jr., the fight's 
promoters and others familiar with the bout. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman, a Republican state senator from Manhattan who attended  
the fight, has gotten involved in boxing before. In 1979, the 
Committee on Investigations helped increase safety for boxers after 
hearings it held on the death of fighter Willie Classen in the Felt 
Forum at the Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Monday, Gov. George Pataki said he gave the state Athletic  
Commission a week to 10 days to investigate the Lewis-Holyfield 
decision and determine if the selection process of judges should be 
handled by the commission or other impartial bodies. The commission 
did select Mercante to be the referee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly, if you have judges who have a preconceived view of  
who should win, then it could impact -- it would obviously impact -- 
the integrity of a match,'' Pataki said. ``We want to do everything 
we can to make sure that these judges are acting as objectively as 
possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani called the judging of the  
fight an ``embarrassment'' and compared it with a point-shaving 
scandal in basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we are going to bring boxing back to New York, to end up  
with fixed fights with fixed results, we might as well call it 
wrestling,'' Giuliani said.

<HEADLINE>  Serbs, Kosovo Albanians Still Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Stepping up hostilities in Kosovo  
even while talking peace in Paris, Serb and ethnic Albanian forces 
attacked each other Monday in the province's north. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighting that escalated after an inconclusive first round of  
talks last month showed no sign of easing despite a renewed pledge 
Monday by the ethnic Albanian delegation in France to sign an 
internationally backed peace plan as soon as Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, which would grant broad autonomy but not independence  
to the Albanian-majority province, requires the Kosovo Liberation 
Army to disarm. 
</P>
<P>
	But the guerrillas have significantly bolstered their weaponry  
in recent months and provided no hint they were ready to give them 
up -- reportedly launching three attacks in the hours before talks 
resumed. 
</P>
<P>
	International monitors said seven Yugoslav army soldiers were  
wounded in fighting in the Vucitrn area and another was shot in the 
arm as he drove just north of the capital, Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	Army forces, too, defied peace talks by massing around KLA-held  
northern villages, mostly emptied of residents, and bombarding them 
with tank and rocket fire. They said they had ``inflicted losses'' 
after attacks by rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides have been vying for position while international  
mediators struggle to end the year-old war that has killed more 
than 2,000 people and displaced 300,000 in the southern province of 
Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	An October truce under which the Yugoslav government withdrew  
thousands of troops has collapsed. NATO sources said Monday there 
are at least 15,000 Yugoslav army and 20,000 Serbian police forces 
in Kosovo -- at least as many as before the pullbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Army forces on Monday blasted Bukos and Osljane, villages 12  
miles northwest of Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	The attack came from both north and west, the forces pounding  
the area with frequent tank, rocket and Katyusha fire, according to 
photographers at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serb-run Media Center, meanwhile, said the KLA attacked an  
army unit in the northern village of Luzane before dawn after an 
assault on two police stations late Sunday. Reporters saw two 
houses smoldering in the village. 
</P>
<P>
	In another confrontation in the same region, the army sent tanks  
and other armored vehicles to the rebel-held village of Besinje 
after a Yugoslav army officer was shot and wounded as he rode along 
the main road just north of Pristina, monitor Robert Lowson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The army said in a statement that it fought back and ``inflicted  
losses to the Albanian terrorists, who fled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These, as other attacks so far, are aimed at provoking the  
Yugoslav army and Serbian police'' in order to create justification 
for international military intervention, the army said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has threatened airstrikes on Serb military targets if the  
Yugoslav government rejects the peace deal and its call for 28,000 
foreign peacekeeping troops to police the province. 
</P>
<P>
	In a sign of the spreading violence, monitor spokesman Walter  
Ebenberger of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in 
Europe said Monday that verifiers had found 10 bodies from weekend 
fighting elsewhere in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said four of the dead  
were two pairs of brothers, shot by Serb police while chopping wood 
in Grejkovce, a village near Prizren.

<HEADLINE> Kjus Wins World Cup Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIERRA NEVADA, Spain (AP) -- Lasse Kjus still isn't as popular in  
Norway as eight-time Olympic cross-country gold medalist Bjorn 
Daehlie, but he must be gaining on him. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus won his second World Cup overall title Sunday, edging  
childhood friend Kjetil Andre Aamodt by a scant 23 points -- after 
4 1/2 months and three dozen races -- in one of the tightest men's 
finishes on record. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus, who coughed and wheezed all winter with a chest infection,  
sped to a quick second leg in Sunday's giant slalom to grab seventh 
place -- he was 15th after the first leg -- in a time of 2 minutes, 
5.48 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Needing a second place to earn enough points to overtake Kjus,  
Aamodt got only fifth in 2:05.13. The result: Kjus 1,465 points, 
Aamodt 1,442. 
</P>
<P>
	A close finish and an even closer friendship.  
</P>
<P>
	Kjus and Aamodt were World Cup roommates for 10 years. Aamodt's  
father, Finn, was their first coach. They're both 28 and, with 
retired Marc Girardelli, they've each won a record 13 Olympic and 
World Championships medals. 
</P>
<P>
	Daehlie, the most popular athlete in Norway where Nordic skiing  
dwarfs alpine, has won a record eight gold medals -- more than any 
athlete in the Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I can do is congratulate Lasse,'' Aamodt said.  
``He has been the best skier all season. For what he did here and 
what he did in the Worlds (in Vail, Colo., a month ago), I can only 
take my hat off to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last month in Vail, Kjus became the first man to win five medals  
in a World Championships, including gold in super-G (shared with 
Hermann Maier) and giant slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is unbelievable to get this title,'' said Kjus, who won the  
same one in '96. ``It was great fun to have this close fight with 
Kjetil. I felt a lot of pressure in the second run because I had 
made so many mistakes on the first. But I risked it all because I 
had to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aamodt and Kjus split as roommates on the World Cup circuit last  
year ``because we got like an old married couple,'' said Aamodt, 
who won the 1994 World Cup overall. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd said about all two people could to each other in that  
time.'' Aamodt added. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kjus-Aamodt 1-2 was the closest men's overall finish since  
1991, when Marc Girardelli nipped Alberto Tomba by 20 points. But 
that was under a scoring system that awarded many fewer points -- as 
was the 1980 title when four points separated the winners. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the system begun in the 1991-92 season, the closest men's  
finish prior to Sunday's near dead heat was in 1993 when Girardelli 
edged Aamodt by 32 points. 
</P>
<P>
	The season's giant slalom went to Switzerland's Michael Von  
Gruenigen, who won in 2:04.33, followed by fellow countryman Steve 
Locher in 2:04.40 and Heinz Schilchegger of Austria in 2:04.44. 
</P>
<P>
	Von Gruenigen finished with 483 points to 410 for Austrian  
Stephan Eberharter and 371 for defending champion Maier. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier, who said he aggravated a back injury in Saturday's slalom  
and needed painkiller injections to ski Sunday, went out five gates 
from the finish on the first leg, losing his right ski in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	The defending overall World Cup and giant slalom champion, Maier  
was eliminated from the overall chase in Saturday's slalom, 
finishing behind Kjus and Aamodt with 1,307 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier blamed his bad back, picked up two months ago doing leg  
exercises with heavy weights, for crashing Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was disappointed about the situation and just didn't feel  
very coordinated,'' said the two-time Olympic champion. ``When I 
went out, I didn't even realize what had happened. My back was even 
worse today than it was yesterday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus' title capped a World Cup season dominated by Austrian  
women. They won all five titles, a feat last accomplished in 1987 
by the Swiss women. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexandra Meissnitzer took the overall and super-G, with Renate  
Goetschl winning the downhill and Sabine Egger the crystal globe in 
slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	Meissnitzer clinched super-G and Egger claimed her slalom title  
when the two races were canceled last week by high winds and 
snowstorms in Europe's southernmost ski resort. 
</P>
<P>
	On the men's side, the Austrians -- after sweeping all five last  
season -- got a super-G title from Maier and a slalom title from 
Thomas Stangassinger, at 33 the oldest skier on the circuit. Kjus 
won the overall and downhill, with Von Gruenigen taking the giant 
slalom.

<HEADLINE> Guilty Plea in Suffocation Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BENTONVILLE, Ark. (AP) -- A man pleaded guilty Monday to charges  
that he and a friend let two babies die while strapped into car 
seats in a hot, unventilated black car last year while the men 
searched for arrowheads and mushrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	Justin Griffith, 28, pleaded guilty to manslaugher and agreed to  
testify against his co-defendant, Ricky Crisp, 23, whose trial 
begins Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	First-degree murder charges against Griffith were dropped. He  
could get up to 20 years in prison when he is sentenced next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith admitted his role in the April 25 deaths of Crisp's  
daughter, 16-month-old Vicky Crisp, and her cousin, 4-month-old 
Sidney Pippen. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls died of heat exhaustion and dehydration after they  
were left for several hours in an unventilated car that reached at 
least 130 degrees even though the outside temperature was around 
80. Prosecutors have said the pain was so severe that Vicky pulled 
out her hair. 
</P>
<P>
	Griffith told Judge Tom Keith that he and Crisp didn't plan to  
look for arrowheads and mushrooms for long, but lost track of time 
because they had taken drugs and alcohol.

<HEADLINE> Congress Poised To OK Missile Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sixteen years after President Reagan called  
for a national missile defense shield, both houses of Congress are 
moving toward approval this week of legislation to commit the 
United States to such a system. 
</P>
<P>
	Reports of espionage by China at a U.S. nuclear weapons plant  
and recent missile tests by North Korea and Iran are helping to 
build bipartisan support for the measure, though the Clinton 
administration has threatened a veto. 
</P>
<P>
	``These recent events have answered the question about the  
threat,'' Thad Cochran, R-Miss., told the Senate as it opened 
debate on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate could vote on the overall bill as early as Tuesday.  
The House is taking up its version on Thursday, after a rare 
closed-door session to receive classified information on missile 
threats facing the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Support in the Senate has grown over the past year for the  
measure by Cochran and Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii. It would 
commit the United States to field a national missile defense system 
that would be effective against a limited missile attack as soon as 
technologically possible. 
</P>
<P>
	After blocking missile-defense legislation for years, Democrats  
are now trying to keep the issue from becoming a campaign liability 
in 2000. Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, the senior Democrat on the 
Armed Services Committee, said he had given up trying to block a 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Levin said he will work for passage of substitute  
legislation designed to give the Clinton administration more 
flexibility while seeking to work with Russia on modifications to 
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian officials contend the Cochran-Inouye bill violates the  
ABM treaty's restrictions on anti-ballistic-missile defense 
systems. ``I'm hopeful we can modify this language so we don't 
threaten to rip up this treaty,'' Levin said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	In his opening remarks to the Senate on Monday, Levin portrayed  
the bill as ``a headlong rush to deployment.'' He said, ``I have 
not heard of any of our senior military leaders who support this 
legislation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	National Security Adviser Sandy Berger has said he will  
recommend a veto if the legislation passes in its present form. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton proposed $6.6 billion for a missile defense  
system over the next five years in the budget he submitted last 
month. But he put off until June 2000 a decision on whether to 
field such a system. 
</P>
<P>
	There's one thing on which both supporters and critics of such a  
system agree: It won't come cheap. Some $40 billion has already 
been spent over the past 15 years on missile-defense research and 
related tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``The development program has suffered from a lack of commitment  
to deploy such a system,'' Cochran told the Senate. He said passage 
of the bill would ``put an end to this uncertainty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation before Congress would, basically, remove the  
discretion from the president on whether to commit to such a 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar bill, by Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., and Rep. John  
Spratt, D-S.C., is on the House calendar for Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Cochran and Weldon bills represent a blank check to  
defense contractors and a hollow promise to Americans rightly 
concerned about the potential of terrorist attack -- attacks that 
are much more likely to be delivered via a panel truck than a 
ballistic missile,'' John Isaacs, president of the Council for a 
Livable World, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But opponents were pessimistic.  
</P>
<P>
	A national system for shooting down incoming missiles was once  
almost universally derided by Democrats, denounced as ``Star Wars'' 
when first proposed by Reagan in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
	But little political advantage can be gained these days from  
opposing a missile defense, Senate Democratic officials suggest. 
</P>
<P>
	And Republican efforts to portray the administration as lax in  
its dealings with China -- allowing Beijing to buy or steal U.S. 
technology that enabled it to modernize its missile program -- are 
having an effect.

	EU Executive Commission Resigns  
</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The entire EU Executive Commission  
resigned Tuesday after a panel of experts issued a scathing report 
on cronyism and financial irregularities at the top of the 
executive branch. EU Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler said 
the report cited several of the 20 European Commissioners for 
cronyism and financial irregularities in aid and other programs had 
created a climate in which the EU executive could not remain in 
office.

	Panel Wants Tougher Seat Belt Laws  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- To prevent child deaths in car crashes, an  
expert panel recommended today that seat belt laws be strengthened 
and older children stay in booster seats longer before graduating 
to seat belts. The government had asked the panel to come up with 
recommendations for children aged 4 through 15 because so many die 
in auto crashes while riding unrestrained. In 1997, car crashes 
killed 1,627 children in that age group. Of those, 1,015 were 
unrestrained. Properly used booster seats and safety belts would 
have prevented about 500 of the deaths, an expert said.

	Kosovo Albanians Ready To Sign  
</P>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Ethnic Albanians have agreed to an international  
peace plan for Kosovo, leaving Yugoslavia's president with the 
choice of making peace or face NATO's wrath. The Kosovo Albanian 
delegation told international mediators today they were ready to 
sign the peace accord that gives them wide political autonomy but 
not the vote on independence they wanted. French and British 
foreign ministers said the decision will heighten pressure on 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to accept the deal, which 
calls for NATO troops to enforce it.

	Gay Military Harassment Said Higher  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Harassment of homosexuals in the military more  
than doubled last year, a gay rights groups said today in 
criticizing Pentagon enforcement of the ``don't ask, don't tell'' 
policy. The military isn't supposed to investigate sexual 
orientation unless ``credible information'' surfaces about a 
person's homosexuality. Proof that someone is gay or professes to 
be gay is grounds for automatic discharge. The Servicemembers Legal 
Defense Network counted 400 cases of anti-gay harassment in the 
military last year, including death threats, compared with 182 
violations in 1997, a 120 percent increase.

	Airlines Stocks Soar on Price Hike  
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Higher fares and hopes for even higher profits  
sent shares in the nation's airlines rising sharply today. Airlines 
last weekend imposed their second price increase of the year and 
today the parent company of United Airlines said its profit growth 
would be faster than expected. UAL Corp. gained $6.68 3/4 to $73.75 on 
the New York Stock Exchange and the rest of the industry followed. 
AMR, parent of American Airlines, and Southwest Air both saw its 
stock soar. As for passengers, airlines have now boosted leisure 
fares 7 percent this year and business fares are up 3 percent.

	SEATTLE (AP) -- Billionaire Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen  
agreed to buy a $300 million majority share in Go2Net Inc., in a 
deal that could make Go2Net's Web sites a main Internet destination 
for many cable-TV users. The company runs a network of Web sites 
focusing on personal finance, Internet search, commerce and games.

	Balloonists Break Distance Record

<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- The Swiss-English balloonists trying to circle the  
world nonstop broke American millionaire Steve Fossett's distance 
record today and sped across the Pacific toward Mexico, their 
control center said. The Breitling Orbiter 3 last night broke the 
15,203-mile distance record claimed by Fossett before he ditched 
near Australia last August. The record claim of the balloon piloted 
by Bertrand Piccard of Switzerland and Brian Jones of England must 
still be verified by the International Federation of Aviation.

sent stock prices higher. The Dow industrials rose 82.42 for a

	Nets Fire Coach John Calipari  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- John Calipari was fired today as coach of the  
New Jersey Nets, a once-promising team that quickly became one of 
the NBA's worst this season. Nets swingman Kendall Gill confirmed 
the dismissal, which had been expected ever since Calipari met with 
owners yesterday after a loss in Miami and didn't accompany the 
team to Toronto. Only the Los Angeles Clippers have a worse record 
then the Nets' 3-17 mark.

<HEADLINE> Schiavo Defends Airport Check </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- The former inspector general of the  
Transportation Department defended her attempt to test airport 
security by checking a suspicious bag, saying Monday she did 
nothing wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not do anything illegal, and it's not illegal to buy a  
ticket, check a bag and not get on a plane,'' Mary Schiavo said on 
NBC's ``Today'' show. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Schiavo, a critic of airline safety in the United States,  
said she agreed to help a television station test security at Port 
Columbus International Airport on Friday by checking a bag that 
should have attracted the attention of security. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she was trying to prove that bags are not routinely  
X-rayed before being loaded on a plane, and that bags are sometimes 
allowed to take off without their owners on board. International 
flights do not permit unattended passenger luggage to take off. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Schiavo's bag, which contained a tape recorder, a can of  
shaving cream, a racquet ball can and some wiring, did not leave 
with the flight bound for Washington. It was unclear if that was 
due to airport security checks or because the television station, 
WCHM-TV, had informed the airport about the bag prior to takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
	In any event, the bag was taken to a screening area at some  
point and drew attention when X-ray screeners saw what it 
contained. The airport concourse was evacuated, and the bag was 
taken outside and investigated, shutting down a runway for four 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Airport officials complained that the suspicious bag disrupted  
the airport. The FBI is investigating whether any laws were broken. 
The FBI would not discuss its investigation, and the Federal 
Aviation Administration would not comment on what possible laws may 
have been broken. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Schiavo said she was sorry for any inconvenience ``but it  
was done by the airport with the full knowledge of what was going 
on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The television station said the airport was informed in advance  
it would be doing a report on airport security Friday, but did not 
tell officials exactly how that was going to be done. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Schiavo resigned from her federal post in 1996 after  
criticizing the FAA on several occasions. Since then she has 
published a book accusing the FAA of sloppy inspections, lax 
airport security and disregard for bogus airplane parts.

<HEADLINE>  Nets Reportedly Fire Coach Calipari </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWARK, N.J. (AP) -- The New Jersey Nets fired coach John  
Calipari today, holding him responsible for the 3-17 start of a 
team that had been projected as an Eastern Conference power, ESPN 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The network, citing unidentified sources, said the Nets made  
assistant Don Casey interim coach a day before the team was to play 
the Raptors in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers reported today the Nets were courting former Chicago  
Bulls coach Phil Jackson to coach the team. Calipari, in his third 
season with the Nets, also was dismissed from his job as team vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Van Horn, speaking from the team hotel in Toronto, said  
the players hadn't been told of the change. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not supposed to talk about it,'' he said. ``We're having  
a team meeting later on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calipari arrived at the hotel later in the afternoon and went to  
meet his players. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets, who traded for star guard Stephon Marbury four days  
ago, have lost seven straight and 13 out of 14. Only the Clippers 
have a worse record in the NBA this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Calipari has two years and $6 million remaining on his five-year  
$15 million contract. It's not clear whether Calipari will take 
another job in the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	He and his players went separate ways after a loss to the Miami  
Heat on Sunday. After conferring with Nets owners after the 102-76 
thrashing in Miami, Calipari left in a car with one owner while the 
team flew to Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	Nets spokesman Matt Davey said today Calipari was still expected  
to be on the bench for Tuesday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing has come down to say otherwise,'' Davey said.  
</P>
<P>
	Repeated messages to Calipari's agent, Craig Fenech, were not  
returned today. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Musburger, Jackson's agent, has said he did not know if  
Jackson was leaning toward returning to coaching next season, as he 
has said in the past, or sooner. A message left today was not 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Calipari met for 34 minutes after the Miami game with Nets  
owners Finn Wentworth and Lewis Katz. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to talk and I said, `Let's talk,''' said Calipari,  
referring to Wentworth. ``It's confidential. He wanted to know 
where we go from here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he would remain to guide the Nets through the process  
of adjusting to Marbury, Calipari said: ``I believe so. Nothing was 
said in there to make me believe anything different.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A longtime NBA assistant, Casey, was the head coach of the  
Clippers during the 1988-89 season and has spent the last three 
seasons as Calipari's top assistant. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nets failed to build on the success of last season when they  
made the playoffs for the first time since 1994. Although the Nets 
were swept by title-bound Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls, 
they played well. 
</P>
<P>
	With Jordan's retirement, the Nets were seen as a potential  
successor as Eastern Conference champions. 
</P>
<P>
	They featured an up-tempo style anchored by Van Horn, All-Star  
center Jayson Williams, point guard Sam Cassell and shooting guard 
Kerry Kittles. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week's trade for Marbury was expected to lift the sagging  
team. Marbury made a strong debut Sunday with 21 points and five 
assists, but it was not nearly enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Calipari was hired as the Nets' coach on June 7, 1996, taking  
over a team regarded by many as the worst in the NBA. The Nets had 
gone 30-52 the previous two seasons under Butch Beard. 
</P>
<P>
	In two-plus seasons as Nets coach, Calipari had a record of  
72-112. After a 26-56 record in his first season, he guided the 
Nets to a 43-39 record last year.

<HEADLINE> Death Occurs at Home for the Abused </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANNER ELK, N.C. (AP) -- The death of a nine-year-old boy who  
suffocated after being restrained by his teacher has sparked an 
investigation into a home for abused children that has been the 
target of a number of complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	The death of Timithy Thomas, who weighed only 53 pounds,  
happened shortly after he was subjected to a ``basket hold'' by his 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	Basket holds are used on unruly children and involve a teacher  
getting behind the child, crossing his arms and holding on to the 
child's wrists. But on Thursday afternoon at Grandfather Academy, 
something went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	County and state officials are now investigating the  
disciplinary procedure, which is used by various juvenile workers 
and is considered by some to be controversial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like it was definitely unnecessary,'' Avery County  
Sheriff Richard Buchanan said Monday. ``We feel like that this 
probably was the cause of death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said the death is the latest in a series of problems at  
the home in the western North Carolina mountains. The academy is 
the school for youngsters living at the Grandfather Home for 
Children. 
</P>
<P>
	Several children have run away from the home, claiming staff  
members verbally and physically abused them, Buchanan said. His 
office is investigating two other employees in connection with an 
unrelated assault case, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Principal Roy Krege said he and the school board stand behind  
the school staff and have no immediate plans to change any 
procedures. He said children at the academy have extensive 
emotional and behavioral problems and must be restrained at times. 
</P>
<P>
	The teacher, whose name was not released, is an experienced  
employee with an exemplary personnel file, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If something did go awry, it was certainly and totally  
unintentional,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Olympic Probe Finds Offense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Ireland's Kevin O'Flanagan and  
Denmark's Niels Holst-Sorensen became the latest International 
Olympic Committee members to be accused of breaking its rules, when 
a report into Sydney's successful bid for the 2000 Games was 
released today. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent auditor Tom Sheridan found Sydney's bid effort  
guilty of ``numerous breaches'' of guidelines but found no evidence 
of corruption or bribery. 
</P>
<P>
	He criticized the IOC's rules governing bids, saying they were  
``unworkable and have fallen into disrepute and are almost 
completely ignored by candidate cities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Sheridan outlined the lavish hospitality and gift  
giving that won Sydney the bid, SOCOG president Michael Knight said 
the report showed there was ``no comparison between what occurred 
in Salt Lake City and what Sydney did to win the 2000 Games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nine IOC members have resigned or been expelled in the wake of  
the inquiry into Salt Lake City's bid for the 2002 Winter Games and 
the bribery scandal has seen action taken against 20 members. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheridan found Danish IOC delegate Niels Holst-Sorensen and his  
wife traveled from Copenhagen to Paris to watch the 1993 French 
Open tennis final at the invitation of Australian IOC official and 
bid team member Phil Coles. Their air travel and ``associated 
expenses'' were paid for by Sydney's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Holst-Sorensen said the trip was given to him by Coles but he  
did not believe it broke IOC regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	The bid also paid for O'Flanagan and his brother to travel from  
Dublin to London for the 1992 Wimbledon tennis final. Sydney paid 
their air travel, accommodation, theater tickets and other costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my view, these trips are apparent breaches of the guideline  
which prohibits the giving of benefits ... in excess of a total of 
$200,'' Sheridan said in the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Coles, named in the Salt Lake City ethics inquiry for treating  
site visits like vacations, was recommended for a severe censure by 
the IOC last week. 
</P>
<P>
	There were several other IOC delegates named in the Sydney  
investigation, but their cases had been documented previously. 
</P>
<P>
	Swaziland IOC member David Sibandze, who resigned after being  
named in the Salt Lake City inquiry, was also named in the Sydney 
report, following assistance for his daughter Nomsa to study in 
Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	Sydney officials also played a role in the immigration to  
Australia of the daughter and son-in-law of Romanian IOC member 
Alexandru Siperco, arranged a job interview for the son of Tunisian 
delegate Mohamed Mzali, found work for the son of Finnish delegate 
Peter Tallberg and sought to arrange work for a relative of 
Algeria's Mohamed Zerguini. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheridan said breaches of the IOC guidelines included the value  
of gifts given to IOC delegates, the duration of visits, the number 
of overseas trips made by Sydney bid members to lobby IOC officials 
and assistance in finding jobs for delegates' families. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he also was concerned by the Australian Olympic  
Committee's involvement in African training schemes. 
</P>
<P>
	AOC president John Coates has admitted paying about $35,000 each  
to delegates from Kenya and Uganda on the night before the 1993 
decision to award Sydney the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheridan concluded there was no breach of IOC guidelines because  
the arrangements did not involve the giving of benefits to IOC 
members or their families. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight and the SOCOG board ordered the inquiry by the former  
state auditor general following the news from Salt Lake's inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheridan said under the guidelines Sydney needed to give IOC  
delegates ``red carpet treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If they didn't, ``they may not have necessarily achieved that  
objective,'' of winning the Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheridan also detailed the names of delegates who stayed longer  
than the guidelines allow for visits to a bidding country, or for 
side trips. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve IOC members overstayed or took side trips, including  
visits to the northern Australian tropical resort town of Port 
Douglas, Paris, Singapore and Bangkok. They were usually 
accompanied by Coles, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	SOCOG board member Nick Greiner said the bid team encouraged IOC  
delegates to take side trips, knowing they were outside the 
guidelines, to break up the long journey to and from Australia. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea that we would give them the boot on day five if they  
wanted to stay for day six is ridiculous,'' Greiner said.

<HEADLINE> `Analyze This' Rubs Out Competition / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Five new films couldn't knock the mob comedy  
``Analyze This'' from the No. 1 spot at North American theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	The film starring Robert De Niro as a crime figure seeking help  
from therapist Billy Crystal, grossed $15.6 million, according to 
industry figures released Monday. That's more than double the 
closest competitor, ``The Rage: Carrie 2,'' which made its debut 
with $7.1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cruel Intentions'' tumbled 46 percent in its second week to  
finish third with $7 million. It was followed by four new films, 
all doing mediocre business. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the box office was down 7.5 percent from the same  
weekend last year, when ``Titanic'' was still going strong. 
</P>
<P>
	The top 20 movies at North American theaters Friday through  
Sunday, followed by studio, gross, number of theater locations, 
average receipts per location, total gross and number of weeks in 
release, as compiled by Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. and ACNielsen 
EDI Inc.: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Analyze This,'' Warner Bros., $15.6 million, 2,537  
locations, $6,136 average, $39.9 million, two weeks.

<HEADLINE> Chargers Agree To Acquire Harbaugh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Jim Harbaugh is all but penciled in as the San  
Diego Chargers' starting quarterback for opening day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers on Monday agreed to terms of a trade with the  
Baltimore Ravens, contingent on Harbaugh reworking his contract and 
the Ravens acquiring Scott Mitchell from the Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
	Lions spokesman Steve Reaven said Monday night that no deal is  
imminent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been talking to the Ravens for a couple of weeks about  
trading Mitchell -- that's been public knowledge. But there's 
nothing going on tonight that I know of, nothing official.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both the Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News reported in  
Tuesday editions, however, that the Lions were prepared to trade 
Mitchell to Baltimore in exchange for the Ravens' third-round draft 
choice this spring and a fourth- or fifth-round pick in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the News, the deal is so near completion that  
Mitchell's agent, Tony Agnone, said his client obtained permission 
from Baltimore Colts Hall of Fame quarterback Johnny Unitas to wear 
his uniform number, 19. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade could be announced as early as Tuesday, the Detroit  
newspapers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Harbaugh deal would likely keep troubled second-year pro  
Ryan Leaf on the bench, where he'd be expected to learn from 
Harbaugh, who's entering his 13th season. 
</P>
<P>
	New Chargers coach Mike Riley said there was always the chance  
Leaf would win the job in training camp, but added: ``My guess is 
that Jim is our starting quarterback on opening day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers hope to have the agreement finalized in time for a  
Thursday news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shook hands on it,'' general manager Bobby Beathard said  
from the NFL meetings in Phoenix. ``Nothing's official until it's 
all turned into the league, and anything can happen. But we have 
confidence it will work out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beathard said it's his understanding that the Lions have agreed  
to send Mitchell to Baltimore, which would then allow the Ravens to 
deal Harbaugh to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	Harbaugh reportedly has said that he's willing to take a  
significant cut in his $3.25 million salary for 1999 in order to 
play in San Diego. Beathard wouldn't comment on salary figures, but 
the Chargers reportedly are interested in bringing in Harbaugh for 
about $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chargers agreed to send Baltimore their fifth-round pick in  
2000, or a fourth-round pick if Harbaugh plays 50 percent of the 
time and the Chargers win at least nine games in 1999. The latter 
scenario would require a dramatic improvement for the Chargers, 
who've won only nine games combined the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Obtaining a veteran quarterback has been the Chargers' No. 1  
priority since finishing 5-11 in 1998. Most of the Chargers' 
problems stemmed from poor play by Leaf and Craig Whelihan, who 
combined to throw 34 interceptions and just 10 touchdown passes. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaf was the second pick in the 1998 draft and received an  
$11.25 million signing bonus as part of a $31.25 million contract. 
He was benched after nine starts because of his ineffective play 
and immature behavior off the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting Jim Harbaugh because we think this gives us a  
chance to give the defense help to win some games,'' Beathard said. 
``This is a great situation for Jim and I think the players will be 
excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Diego's defense allowed the fewest yards in the NFL, both  
overall and against the run, but was constantly put in bad position 
by turnovers. All-Pro linebacker Junior Seau publicly called for 
the Chargers to get a veteran in the offseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could be the start of a new identity for San Diego,''  
said Riley, who also was at the owners meetings. ``I'm excited 
about this. I think it's a big accomplishment in the offseason to 
get Jim coming our way.''

<HEADLINE> No Major Trades for Pat Riley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- For the first time since taking over operations of  
the Miami Heat four years ago, Pat Riley will go an entire season 
without making a major trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's silence at last week's trade deadline speaks volumes to  
the Heat players. It was another sign that Riley thinks he has the 
nucleus to win a championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very encouraging. I'm ecstatic,'' said forward P.J.  
Brown, a Riley favorite whose name frequently has popped up in 
trade rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	While other teams were reshaping themselves in the free-agent  
frenzy that followed the NBA lockout, Riley merely dabbled while 
making sure his ``core guys'' were taken care of. 
</P>
<P>
	And after the Heat shook off injuries and a 1-3 start to win 14  
of their next 16 games, there seemed hardly any reason to tinker 
with success -- particularly in the NBA's short 50-games-in-90-days 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're 15-5 and leading the Atlantic Division, it's hard  
to break up a team like that,'' Brown said. ``You'd be hard-pressed 
to make a move.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that Riley hasn't pulled the trigger in the past. Each of  
his first three seasons in Miami was marked by a trade-deadline 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Riley turned over half his roster in one day with three  
trades, including a four-player swap which brought Tim Hardaway 
from Golden State. That came three months after he pried Alonzo 
Mourning from Charlotte in a six-player deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Riley sent three players to Dallas for  
high-scoring forward Jamal Mashburn. Last season brought the only 
deal that failed to pay dividends, when he traded Ike Austin to the 
Los Angeles Clippers for Brent Barry. 
</P>
<P>
	Then this year -- nothing. Even when word surfaced that Stephon  
Marbury could be available from Minnesota at the right price, 
apparently including Hardaway, Riley defended his nucleus. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people are talking about Timmy, they are talking about an  
important part of what we built,'' Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley did his tinkering around the edges early, signing guard  
Terry Porter and forward Clarence Weatherspoon as free agents to 
strengthen his bench. Both have paid off tremendously. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter, in his 14th season, has averaged 11.0 points per game,  
working both as Hardaway's backup and teaming with him as the 
shooting guard. He went 5-for-5 from the floor for 14 points in 
Sunday's 102-76 win over New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Weatherspoon, a seventh-year pro, is averaging 9.5 points and  
6.4 rebounds per game. He has 31 points and 14 rebounds in his past 
two games, hitting 13 of 15 field-goal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got two veteran players that have produced since they  
got here,'' Riley said. ``Our bench has given us a huge lift. Our 
veterans simply know how to play basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the Heat still figure to improve down the stretch. Mashburn  
and Voshon Lenard have missed virtually the entire season with 
injuries, and their return will provide a scoring boost. 
</P>
<P>
	Mashburn, out the past five weeks with a hyperextended left  
knee, is expected to return to practice within a week and should be 
activated by the end of the month. Lenard, diagnosed with a stress 
fracture in training camp, figures to return in time for the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``With those guys returning, it'll improve our team,'' Brown  
said. ``We're just scratching the surface right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Heat's current makeup has been good enough to lead the  
Eastern Conference. Next up: catching Utah and Portland for the 
best record in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're thinking about winning a championship, then we're  
thinking about getting the best record,'' Riley said. ``Why not?''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Foreign Policy Ranked High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans favor a strong national defense and  
aggressive action against terrorists, but most oppose any use of 
U.S. ground troops to protect allies, a new survey suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll conducted by the Gallup Organization for the Chicago  
Council on Foreign Relations supports ``the guarded engagement of a 
largely satisfied superpower,'' said council president John Rielly. 
He gave high marks on foreign affairs to both President Clinton and 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	In the survey, 84 percent listed terrorism as the most critical  
threat to the United States, up 15 points from the last survey. To 
fight terrorists, 74 percent favored U.S. air strikes, and 57 
percent favored the use of U.S. ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
	In contrast, 68 percent oppose sending troops if China should  
invade Taiwan, 66 percent in case of a North Korean invasion of 
South Korea or a Russian invasion of Poland, and 56 percent oppose 
if Arabs invade Israel. Opposition drops to 48 percent if it's Iraq 
invading Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since 1978, however, those favoring increased  
defense spending exceeded the number who want cutbacks. Similar 
polls have been conducted every four years since 1974 
</P>
<P>
	Support for foreign aid continued a slow slide. Only 13 percent  
now favor increased spending for economic aid to other countries, 
and 48 percent want more cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	The new survey underscores general satisfaction with the U.S.  
role abroad by ranking Clinton No. 1 among postwar U.S. presidents 
for foreign policy success, up from eighth place in the middle of 
his first term. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress also got improved marks, with 43 percent saying its  
role in foreign policy is about right. That's the highest number 
for Congress since the surveys began. 
</P>
<P>
	Rielly said approval of Clinton parallels an absence of major  
foreign policy problems cited by those surveyed. When asked to list 
the two or three biggest foreign policy problems facing the 
country, the most common response among the public, at 21 percent, 
was: ``I don't know.'' That was followed by terrorism, 12 percent; 
the world economy, 11 percent; balance of payments, 10 percent; and 
the Middle East situation, 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Haas, foreign policy director for the Brookings  
Institution, who participated on a panel to mark the survey's 
release, challenged the assessment of Clinton. He said it reflects 
Americans' prosperity more than real achievement abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people feel content with the world as it is, but  
history has a different standard,'' he said. Clinton, he said, has 
missed opportunities to provide leadership in the post-Cold War 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton soared past Presidents Kennedy, Nixon, Truman,  
Eisenhower, Reagan, Bush and Carter, ranked in that order in 1994, 
to top the poll of presidents with ``very successful'' foreign 
policy performance since World War II. Only Presidents Ford and 
Johnson trailed Clinton in the 1994 poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Gallup interviewed 1,507 men and women in October and November.  
The margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
Separately, the pollsters interviewed 379 policy leaders, including 
members of Congress, administration officials, international 
business figures and members of the news media. 
</P>
<P>
	A report on the survey was published Monday in the journal  
Foreign Policy.

<HEADLINE> WWII Camp Commander Pleads Innocent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- Declaring his conscience clear, the last  
known living Nazi concentration camp commander pleaded innocent 
today to charges he was responsible for torture, killings and mass 
persecution of thousands of people. 
</P>
<P>
	Dinko Sakic faces charges of crimes against humanity in the  
death of 2,000 people during the eight months in 1944 when he 
commanded Jasenovac, the camp in Croatia known as the ``Death 
Factory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I absolutely do not feel guilty, not for a single charge,''  
the 77-year-old Sakic told the court after prosecutors read the 
35-page indictment. ``My conscience is clear.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sakic's trial resumed today after court-appointed doctors  
testified he was fit to take part in the proceedings, which were 
postponed after he fainted on the eve of his March 4 trial. Sakic 
was hospitalized with severe circulatory problems and high blood 
pressure and the proceedings were postponed for 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Jewish groups feared the postponement might signal that  
Croatia's government is unwilling to prosecute Sakic for fear of a 
right-wing backlash. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakic, who had lived since 1947 in Argentina until extradited to  
Croatia, could face up to 20 years in prison if convicted over his 
role as commander of the worst of about 20 concentration camps run 
by the then-Nazi puppet state of Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
	Tens of thousands of Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and antifascist Croats  
were killed in 1941-45 in Jasenovac. The Simon Wiesenthal Center 
and B'nai B'rith International believe Sakic is the last surviving 
commander of a Nazi-era concentration camp. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges against Sakic focus on ``torture, maltreatment and  
killings,'' allegedly committed by him and by his subordinates with 
his knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment charges that Sakic exposed inmates to ``excessive  
labor, starvation, physical and psychological torture,'' which led 
to diseases and death for a number of them. 
</P>
<P>
	The sick and those unable to work were ``liquidated,'' the  
indictment said. Others were tortured, some to death, for the 
alleged misbehavior, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sakic is also accused of allowing his subordinates to ``maltreat  
and kill ... out of capriciousness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the summer of 1944, as a reprisal for the escape of a  
musician prisoner, Sakic ordered a ``performance'' of all the 
detainees, the indictment said. As they stood before him, Sakic 
allegedly selected other musicians at random and had them killed -- 
two by his own hand. 
</P>
<P>
	On another occasion, the indictment says more than 20 inmates  
were to be hanged. One of them, Milo Boskovic, told Sakic that 
hanging was a humiliating way to die, so Sakic allegedly drew his 
pistol and shot him. 
</P>
<P>
	Last April, talking to an Argentine TV reporter in an interview  
that prompted his arrest, Sakic claimed the Jasenovac victims died 
of ``natural causes or diseases.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sakic claimed he was ``only doing my job.'' Asked whether he was  
ashamed before his children, Sakic said: ``No, I'm proud. I would 
do it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Franjo Tudjman, who often was criticized for  
cultivating the kind of nationalism that harks back to the World 
War II state, has promised that the trial will be impartial.

<HEADLINE>  Gephardt Endorses Gore in 2000 Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, in a show of  
political force to kick off his 2000 presidential campaign, secured 
the endorsements Monday of House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt and 
party stalwarts from the early battleground states of New Hampshire 
and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	With onstage hugs from Gephardt, Gore implored a New Hampshire  
crowd to ``stand with me,'' then headed for Iowa and a later stop 
in his onetime rival's hometown of St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would all be proud to have him as president of the United  
States,'' said the Missouri lawmaker, who opted out of the 
presidential race Feb. 3 to focus his energies on becoming speaker 
of the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt's announcement reflects the desire of top Democrats to  
settle the presidential nomination early and set their sights on 
winning both the House and White House in November 2000. President 
Clinton long ago pledged to help Gore get elected, guaranteeing his 
understudy an advantage not always bestowed upon vice presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley is the only announced  
challenger for the party's presidential nomination, though civil 
rights activist Jesse Jackson may enter the fray. 
</P>
<P>
	Lagging in polls, Bradley hopes to build a resurgent campaign  
that catches fire at the grass roots. He is buoyed by evidence of 
potential Gore weakness in the general election. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to have a nominee who can win,'' Bradley said.  
</P>
<P>
	Gore plans to capitalize on the popularity of Clinton  
initiatives while at the same time distinguishing himself from his 
boss. 
</P>
<P>
	The difficulty of this balancing act was evident at a New  
Hampshire news conference. Gore said he will ``face entirely new 
challenges, and we need new answers.'' Yet his answers sounded 
familiar: Reduce class sizes, make preschool available to all 
students and improve health care. Clinton has pressed those ideas, 
but Gore promises to push them further. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't want to join us in bringing radical change to  
public education, stand out of the way,'' he told a crowd of 400 
New Hampshire activists at a boisterous indoor rally. 
</P>
<P>
	With hardly a mention of his boss, Gore shouted again and again:  
``Stand with me!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt and Gore hugged after their speeches, raising their  
hands high. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair headed next to Iowa, hitting in one day the two states  
that cast the earliest votes in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	In rolling out the endorsements on his first official political  
trip of the campaign, Gore hoped to develop a sense of 
inevitability about his nomination even before he formally 
announces his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a reflection of reality,'' David Rohde, a professor of  
political science at the University of Michigan, said of Gephardt's 
endorsement. ``He and everyone else thinks Gore will be the 
nominee. What Gephardt wants is to be speaker -- and it's better to 
be part of a team than to hold back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, Gore said he is  
taking nothing for granted. ``I welcome a spirited contest,'' he 
said. ``I always expect it.'' He promised to return to both states 
to campaign in living rooms and coffee shops. 
</P>
<P>
	During the three-state swing, Gore also locked down the  
endorsements of Bill Shaheen, husband of New Hampshire Gov. Jeanne 
Shaheen, and prominent Democrats in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Hampshire governor and Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack are still  
neutral, though Shaheen is said to be leaning heavily toward Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	The same polls that show Gore with a wide lead over Bradley  
offer hints at weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest Wall Street Journal-NBC poll shows Gore 18 percentage  
points behind Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the early favorite for the 
Republican nomination. Gore did not mention Bush but criticized his 
father's ``failed prescriptions of the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Pew Research Center survey found nearly half of independent  
voters and 16 percent of likely Democratic voters said they had 
ruled out voting for Gore. The same poll showed that 76 percent of 
independents and 53 percent of Democrats said they would consider 
voting for Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I were the Gore campaign I would be concerned,'' said  
Democratic consultant David Axelrod of Chicago. ``But I wouldn't 
panic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Gore worked from the White House to lay claim to a  
series of bite-size initiatives popular among suburban voters, such 
as promising to ease traffic jams. Fine ideas, Democrats say, but 
he needs to leave Clinton's side to promote his own agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure about that ribbon-cutting strategy. That one  
makes me nervous,'' Axelrod said. ``I think it just underscores the 
second-banana thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans say Gore won't escape Clinton's policies or  
controversies. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is the Velcro to Clinton's Teflon,'' said GOP media  
strategist Alex Castellanos. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore proved last week that he can make mistakes. He claimed that  
he created the Internet, giving Republicans reason to howl. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after announcing he would not be a presidential  
candidate, Gephardt told Gore over lunch that he would endorse him. 
Gore's campaign saved the announcement until they could get the 
greatest attention for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore will formally declare his candidacy later this year.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Profits at U.S. commercial banks in 1998 set a  
record for the seventh straight year, rising 4.7 percent to $61.9 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong income from bank fees overcame the costs of a merger wave  
and weakness in overseas operations, the Federal Deposit Insurance 
Corp. said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	But profits declined slightly in the fourth quarter of 1998, the  
FDIC reported. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing the results for the nation's 8,774 commercial  
banks, the agency said last year's record profits came despite 
restructuring expenses related to mergers of some institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a net decline of 368 banks nationwide in 1998, as 557  
banks were absorbed in mergers, three failed, 190 new ones were 
chartered, and two uninsured institutions became federally insured, 
the FDIC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank profits declined 2.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 1998  
to $14.9 billion, weakened by continued lower earnings from foreign 
operations and the restructuring costs from mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	Economic and financial turmoil last year in Asia and Latin  
America were major factors in the weaker earnings overseas, 
according to the FDIC. 
</P>
<P>
	A basic yardstick of bank profitability -- return on assets -- was  
an average 1.11 percent in the October-December quarter, down from 
1.24 percent a year earlier. A majority of banks, 54.6 percent, 
reported lower returns on assets than in the fourth quarter of 
1997, the FDIC said. 
</P>
<P>
	Income from bank fees was strong, however.  
</P>
<P>
	Consumer advocates have criticized as excessive the fees that  
banks charge consumers for accounts, ATM machines and credit cards, 
and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan recently expressed 
concern over rising bank fees in congressional testimony. Studies 
by the Fed have found that bigger banks -- including those created 
by mergers -- tend to charge higher fees than smaller ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``Banks are making record profits by raising their fees, and  
some consumers are being priced right out of the bank,'' Edmund 
Mierzwinski, consumer program director for U.S. Public Interest 
Research Group, said Monday. ``Banks are not passing along the 
benefits of size to their customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The banking industry maintains that the fees are reasonable in a  
competitive industry and are needed, for example, to keep people 
from writing insufficient checks. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDIC does not separately report bank fees -- which include  
credit card fees -- but includes them in the category of 
non-interest income. That income jumped 18.4 percent in 1998 to 
$19.2 billion, the new figures show. 
</P>
<P>
	The three banks that failed last year were Bestbank, Boulder,  
Colo.; Omnibank, River Rouge, Mich.; and Q Bank, Fort Benton, Mont. 
The two uninsured institutions that started taking deposits and 
became federally insured were Harris Trust Co., West Palm Beach, 
Fla.; and Mercantile Trust Co., St. Louis., Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the nation's 1,687 savings institutions insured by  
the FDIC reported record earnings of $10.2 billion last year, up 
15.6 percent from 1997. The FDIC said the gain was largely the 
result of lower expenses for credit losses and growth in 
interest-earning assets.

<HEADLINE> Fares Increase for Air Travel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- The airline industry increased fares over the  
weekend, the second price increase so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Business fares were hiked by about 1 percent and leisure fares  
grew about 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines, a unit of UAL Corp., started this round of  
increases last Thursday when it first posted the higher fares. The 
other major carriers then followed. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think one of the primary motivators that caused the  
airlines to fall into line was the fact that fuel prices appear to 
have bottomed and are creeping back up,'' said Susan Donofrio, an 
analyst with BT Alex Brown Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Before this increase, the industry's last round of fare changes  
were at the end of January when business fares went up 2 percent 
and unrestricted leisure fares grew 4 percent.

<HEADLINE>  Gephardt Endorses Gore in 2000 Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, in a show of  
political force to kick off his 2000 presidential campaign, secured 
the endorsements Monday of House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt and 
party stalwarts from the early battleground states of New Hampshire 
and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	With onstage hugs from Gephardt, Gore implored a New Hampshire  
crowd to ``stand with me,'' then headed for Iowa and a later stop 
in his onetime rival's hometown of St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would all be proud to have him as president of the United  
States,'' said the Missouri lawmaker, who opted out of the 
presidential race Feb. 3 to focus his energies on becoming speaker 
of the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt's announcement reflects the desire of top Democrats to  
settle the presidential nomination early and set their sights on 
winning both the House and White House in November 2000. President 
Clinton long ago pledged to help Gore get elected, guaranteeing his 
understudy an advantage not always bestowed upon vice presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley is the only announced  
challenger for the party's presidential nomination, though civil 
rights activist Jesse Jackson may enter the fray. 
</P>
<P>
	Lagging in polls, Bradley hopes to build a resurgent campaign  
that catches fire at the grass roots. He is buoyed by evidence of 
potential Gore weakness in the general election. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to have a nominee who can win,'' Bradley said.  
</P>
<P>
	Gore plans to capitalize on the popularity of Clinton  
initiatives while at the same time distinguishing himself from his 
boss. 
</P>
<P>
	The difficulty of this balancing act was evident at a New  
Hampshire news conference. Gore said he will ``face entirely new 
challenges, and we need new answers.'' Yet his answers sounded 
familiar: Reduce class sizes, make preschool available to all 
students and improve health care. Clinton has pressed those ideas, 
but Gore promises to push them further. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't want to join us in bringing radical change to  
public education, stand out of the way,'' he told a crowd of 400 
New Hampshire activists at a boisterous indoor rally. 
</P>
<P>
	With hardly a mention of his boss, Gore shouted again and again:  
``Stand with me!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt and Gore hugged after their speeches, raising their  
hands high. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair headed next to Iowa, hitting in one day the two states  
that cast the earliest votes in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	In rolling out the endorsements on his first official political  
trip of the campaign, Gore hoped to develop a sense of 
inevitability about his nomination even before he formally 
announces his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a reflection of reality,'' David Rohde, a professor of  
political science at the University of Michigan, said of Gephardt's 
endorsement. ``He and everyone else thinks Gore will be the 
nominee. What Gephardt wants is to be speaker -- and it's better to 
be part of a team than to hold back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, Gore said he is  
taking nothing for granted. ``I welcome a spirited contest,'' he 
said. ``I always expect it.'' He promised to return to both states 
to campaign in living rooms and coffee shops. 
</P>
<P>
	During the three-state swing, Gore also locked down the  
endorsements of Bill Shaheen, husband of New Hampshire Gov. Jeanne 
Shaheen, and prominent Democrats in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Hampshire governor and Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack are still  
neutral, though Shaheen is said to be leaning heavily toward Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	The same polls that show Gore with a wide lead over Bradley  
offer hints at weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest Wall Street Journal-NBC poll shows Gore 18 percentage  
points behind Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the early favorite for the 
Republican nomination. Gore did not mention Bush but criticized his 
father's ``failed prescriptions of the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Pew Research Center survey found nearly half of independent  
voters and 16 percent of likely Democratic voters said they had 
ruled out voting for Gore. The same poll showed that 76 percent of 
independents and 53 percent of Democrats said they would consider 
voting for Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I were the Gore campaign I would be concerned,'' said  
Democratic consultant David Axelrod of Chicago. ``But I wouldn't 
panic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Gore worked from the White House to lay claim to a  
series of bite-size initiatives popular among suburban voters, such 
as promising to ease traffic jams. Fine ideas, Democrats say, but 
he needs to leave Clinton's side to promote his own agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure about that ribbon-cutting strategy. That one  
makes me nervous,'' Axelrod said. ``I think it just underscores the 
second-banana thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans say Gore won't escape Clinton's policies or  
controversies. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is the Velcro to Clinton's Teflon,'' said GOP media  
strategist Alex Castellanos. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore proved last week that he can make mistakes. He claimed that  
he created the Internet, giving Republicans reason to howl. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after announcing he would not be a presidential  
candidate, Gephardt told Gore over lunch that he would endorse him. 
Gore's campaign saved the announcement until they could get the 
greatest attention for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore will formally declare his candidacy later this year.

<HEADLINE> Flyers Still Stuck in Losing Streak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Finally, there was some fight in the  
Philadelphia Flyers. Of course, it came from captain Eric Lindros. 
</P>
<P>
	Since arriving in Philadelphia seven years ago, Lindros has come  
to personify a proud organization that even in down years has been 
about toughness and aggression. 
</P>
<P>
	Though they showed signs of life in a 1-1 tie with NHL-leading  
Dallas Sunday night, the Flyers are still mired in their longest 
winless streak in 28 years. Where do the Flyers go from here? 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst thing to do when things are not going well is sit  
back and give your problems to somebody else,'' said Lindros, who 
took the Flyers' slump into his own hands by starting a fight with 
Stars captain Derian Hatcher 40 seconds into the game. ``... We 
need a win. I guess we'll have to wait until Tuesday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers, who have plummeted from first to fifth in the  
Eastern Conference in only a month, are 0-7-4 during an 11-game 
winless streak that ties the franchise record set in the 1968-69 
season and equalled in 1970-71. A loss or tie in St. Louis Tuesday 
night would set a club record for futility. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers are 2-11-5 since going unbeaten in 23 of 24 games  
from Dec. 12 to Feb. 6, a confounding turnaround that no one in the 
organization seems able to explain. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Bob Clarke and Roger Neilson canceled a team  
retreat planned for New Orleans this week. After playing in St. 
Louis Tuesday night, the Flyers return to Philadelphia to practice 
instead of heading for Bourbon Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``First off, we don't deserve to be going,'' Lindros said. ``If  
we played the way we did tonight the previous three weeks, we'd be 
going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after Flyers chairman Ed Snider questioned the team's  
mental toughness, Clarke gave the players a stern talk several 
hours before Sunday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came in and gave a talk about the Flyers organization and  
what was expected,'' Neilson said. ``It was a good strong talk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though he said he didn't mind, it must have been an eerie  
situation for Neilson, presumably the ruler of the locker room. 
While Neilson is the coach, he's been a member of the organization 
for less than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarke, the captain of Philadelphia's last Stanley Cup  
championship team in 1974, viewed himself as a much better choice 
for a speech about what it means to be a Flyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes a different voice telling them the same thing  
helps,'' Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several players revealed that Clarke's speech was mostly about  
playing physical hockey, a trait that has always personified the 
Broad Street Bullies but has been absent during the month-long 
slide. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just talked about playing hockey, taking the body,''  
forward Jody Hull said. ``We talked about having trust that if 
something broke down you'd have your teammate right there behind 
you to help out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros wouldn't comment on Clarke's meeting, but no one seemed  
the least but surprised by it. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's to be expected when things are going that bad,''  
defenseman Eric Desjardins said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Neilson, Clarke mentioned nothing about fighting.  
But the Flyers' inexplicable failure to protect each other -- and 
retaliate for physical play -- has been one of the disturbing 
developments during their slump. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as he did when Clarke challenged him to become the best  
player in hockey during the offseason, Lindros took Clarke's 
challenge personally. Immediately after the opening faceoff, he ran 
at Hatcher with the obvious intention of starting a fight -- with 
the toughest player on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Though they still didn't eliminate defensive giveaways that have  
hounded them, at least the Flyers looked interested, hit hard and 
stuck up for each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros' next job is to show his teammates how to win again.  
</P>
<P>
	``He showed to everybody on the other side that he was here for  
a war, for a battle,'' Desjardins said. ``I think we followed him 
well after that. That's what we've got to do. That's what we need 
from him. We can't just watch what he's going to do, we've got to 
do it.''

<HEADLINE> Marilyn Manson Cancels Three Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Shock rocker Marilyn Manson has  
canceled three concerts after spraining an ankle during a show. 
</P>
<P>
	Manson hurt himself jumping from a speaker onto the stage Sunday  
night at the Great Western Forum. The concert was cut short. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't anything spectacular or acrobatic,'' Manson said  
Monday. ``It was something I'd do a million times a show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manson said he had slightly injured the ankle during a concert  
the night before and had it wrapped before Sunday's show. 
</P>
<P>
	Manson was advised to rest his ankle for five days. He canceled  
shows in San Diego, Las Vegas and Phoenix.

<HEADLINE> DuPont To Buy Pioneer Hi-Bred Intl. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Chemical giant DuPont Co. is purchasing  
Pioneer Hi-Bred International Inc., the world's largest seed corn 
company, in a move analysts said reflects the rapidly consolidating 
agribusiness sector. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont, which already owned 20 percent of Pioneer, will pay an  
estimated $7.7 billion for the remaining 80 percent, the company 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The strength of the Pioneer-DuPont merger creates the most  
powerful agricultural biotechnology force in the world,'' said 
Jerry Chicoine, Pioneer's executive vice president and chief 
operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Pioneer shareholders will receive $40 per share, with 45 percent  
of the shares being traded for cash and the remainder for DuPont 
stock. The boards of directors of both companies have approved the 
agreement, which is expected to be completed by the summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our interests are very closely aligned with Pioneer,'' said  
Charles O. Holliday Jr., DuPont chairman and chief executive 
officer. ``We think this is a natural extension of what we will 
have moving forward in the marketplace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a wholly owned subsidiary of DuPont, Pioneer will retain its  
name and remain headquartered in Des Moines. It has 5,000 employees 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wilmington, Del.,-based DuPont had made no secret of its  
intention to expand in agriculture, bio-technology and 
pharmaceuticals. Two years ago, it spent $1.7 billion to buy 20 
percent of Pioneer, with the companies creating a joint venture for 
crop research. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the buyout cements DuPont as a leading player in  
agricultural bio-technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this solidifies DuPont's position as a tour-de-force  
in the ag-biotech sector,'' said Frank Mitsch, an analyst with 
Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. ``Pioneer is probably the 
premier seed company out there and by acquiring them, they will be 
able to more fully integrate their developments in terms of their 
output biotech traits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chicoine said there had been no threat of a hostile takeover  
against Pioneer. 
</P>
<P>
	``What, in fact, occurred is the consolidation of our industry  
and that led us to the conclusion that we were at some risk,'' 
Chicoine said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past several months, seed giant DeKalb Genetics Corp. and  
agribusiness leader Monsanto Co. merged in a deal worth $2.3 
billion. Monsanto also acquired Scott, Miss.-based Delta &AMP; Pine 
Land Co., a leading producer of cotton seed, for $1.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles S. Johnson, who will continue as Pioneer chairman,  
president and chief executive officer, said the acquisition will 
allow Pioneer to move its research rapidly and effectively to 
farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Plant genetics are the only way for the world's farmers to  
increase their productivity without opening fragile lands (to 
farming),'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, not all groups embraced the DuPont-Pioneer alignment.  
</P>
<P>
	The Ames-based Iowa Farmers Union said mergers such as this  
could spell disaster for U.S. agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mergers and acquisitions in agriculture are occurring and  
being approved at breakneck speed with little regard for the 
consequences to America's farmers,'' said John Whitaker, president 
of the farmers union. ``Merger mania is undermining our system of 
independently owned and operated farms, putting at risk not only 
farmers, but our nation's food security.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Pioneer rose $4.06 1/4, or 12 percent, to $38.37 1/2 in  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Shares of DuPont slipped 
$1.50, or 3 percent, to $56.25, also on the NYSE.

<HEADLINE> Policy Supporting Instant Replay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- When Carmen Policy was running the San Francisco  
49ers, he was the league's staunchest proponent of instant replay 
to help officiating. Now that he is president of the Cleveland 
Browns, his position hasn't changed a bit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been in favor of instant replay for a long time,  
pretty much since it ended (in 1991),'' Policy said. ``At some 
point, we were in favor of almost any form of instant replay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Policy is confident the NFL will revive replay at these  
meetings. Following a season filled with controversial calls -- the 
league even admitted to some blown calls by officials -- there has 
been a strong groundswell to reinstate it. 
</P>
<P>
	The league's competition committee has introduced a plan  
featuring coaches' challenges, although a replay official can stop 
play to look at a call in the final two minutes of each half. 
</P>
<P>
	Even those who have opposed replay in the past believe it will  
pass. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not a replay person, but I think this is the best  
compromise we can come up with,'' said Tony Dungy, coach of the 
Tampa Bay Bucs, who have opposed replay in the past but probably 
will vote in favor this year. ``There is enough momentum that 
people want it.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SCHEDULE MAKERS:* The NFL has a tougher job than usual this  
year in the makeup of its schedule. Yet Val Pinchbeck, who has been 
involved in putting together the schedule since 1971, expects it to 
be done at the usual time, in April. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting there at a pretty good pace,'' Pinchbeck said.  
``Having 31 teams hasn't made it much more complicated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pinchbeck recognized there will be extra interest in the 1999  
schedule, because some team will have a bye each week -- including 
the opening weekend and the final weekend. While several plans were 
discussed, the most likely scenario will have teams with poor 
records from last season getting byes late in the year. The league 
hopes that will avoid a team making the playoffs and not playing on 
the final weekend, a distinct advantage. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the Atlanta Falcons went from a losing record to the  
Super Bowl last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Also likely is a schedule that gives warm-weather teams such as  
Arizona, Miami and Tampa early-season byes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The byes have added an element to it, but not an overwhelming  
one,'' Pinchbeck said. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *THANKSGIVING DISCORD:* One of the most contentious items on the  
agenda at the NFL meetings is the future scheduling of Thanksgiving 
Day games. 
</P>
<P>
	Traditionally, those games are played in Detroit and Dallas,  
with the Lions as host of the early game. 
</P>
<P>
	But a proposal presented by Kansas City Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt  
and New Orleans Saints owner Tom Benson would have the home sites 
rotated each year -- something the Lions and Cowboys vigorously 
oppose. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is something we've raised for 15 years,'' Hunt said.  
``The two teams that are home each Thanksgiving have a competitive 
advantage over teams that travel in a short week. That is a major 
inequity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly Dallas and Detroit are fighting against it and trying  
to keep an advantage. Their coaches and players have said it's an 
advantage. No one should have that advantage going into the 
schedule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lions owner William Ford Jr. has expressed his displeasure with  
any consideration of taking the game away from Detroit. He has 
publicly criticized commissioner Paul Tagliabue, claiming Tagliabue 
at first supported leaving the Thanksgiving games where they are, 
then backed off. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key there is what the owners feel,'' Tagliabue said.  
``This is a resolution presented by Kansas City and New Orleans and 
I think there are other clubs that feel there should be some 
rotation. I know that a lot of clubs respect the tradition of 
Detroit, which dates back to the '30s.''

<HEADLINE> More Minorities Becoming Cops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Someone reported a fight at an apartment building,  
but the crowd of Haitians in the stairwell told police they knew 
nothing about it. Then they began talking animatedly in Creole. 
</P>
<P>
	About what? A gang fight they were scared to report? A domestic  
dispute? 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign languages can frustrate investigators, but in this case  
there was no barrier. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just regular conversation,'' Officer Georges Exilien, a  
rookie Haitian-American officer, whispered to his black partner. 
</P>
<P>
	Exilien left the building, a little more confident the situation  
was under control. And that's just what the Boston Police 
Department was hoping for when it began recruiting members of 
immigrant communities. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is how you can best serve neighborhoods that require  
specific language and cultural backgrounds,'' said Sgt. Detective 
Margot Hill, a spokeswoman for the Boston police. ``It's not rocket 
science; it's just responsive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Around the country, many police departments are finding that  
hiring a few newcomers can make their jobs easier. 
</P>
<P>
	--St. Paul, Minn., has hired 12 officers from Southeast Asia to  
help patrol the Hmong community. The ethnic group from Laos now 
accounts for more than 10 percent of the city's 300,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
	--Palisades Park, N.J., a New York suburb whose Korean community  
quickly grew to about a quarter of the population, hired its first 
Korean officer in January after years of animosity between 
immigrants and authorities. 
</P>
<P>
	--Willows, Calif., a mostly white, rural town of 6,500, added a  
Hmong to its nine-member force when nearly 1,000 Hmong and Laotian 
immigrants moved into an apartment complex nine years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In a city where four of every 10 residents are immigrants,  
Boston has helped create detente in what was a cold war between 
minorities and police, said Pierre Imbert, executive director of 
the Catholic Charities Haitian Multiservice Center in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	``It raises the level of comfort. If you were stopped or go to  
the department and there is someone there who speaks your language, 
you cannot buy that'' sense of relief, Imbert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Many police departments have worked in recent decades to hire  
more blacks and Hispanics. But crime prevention experts have begun 
recommending that forces search for recruits from new immigrant 
communities, too, and departments in cities big and small seem to 
be listening. 
</P>
<P>
	``My feeling at the police department was that they're a new  
group and we need to start learning about their customs and 
learning how to deal with them,'' said former Police Chief Bob 
Shadley of Willows, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Shadley hired Thomas Lee, a Hmong, as a civilian liaison. Lee  
eventually became a full police officer in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	National statistics break down police forces by race, not by  
ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
	The vast majority of police officers are American-born white men  
who got their jobs with high scores on civil service exams. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't always that way. In the early years of the century,  
immigrant-dominated political machines doled out police jobs to 
their supporters, who often spoke with an Irish brogue. 
</P>
<P>
	With civil service reforms in the 1930s, departments began  
hiring new officers based on exams that were often difficult for 
many immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1990s, however, police abandoned the strategy of just  
responding to crimes and instead pursued community policing, which 
involves trying to forge new bonds with people in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
	One problem is that many refugees fled official corruption and  
violence at home and do not trust the police in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Like most departments, the Boston police still hire new officers  
based on civil service exams, but some candidates who fill a 
special need, such as those who speak Creole, are pushed to the 
front of the list. That's how Exilien, whose exam scores were good 
but not sterling, became an officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Exilien, 23, was born in the United States to immigrant parents.  
Before graduating from the police academy in January, he delivered 
supplies for the school district, worked in a residential home and 
restocked restaurants with soda syrup. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never even thought about being a cop. I thought I would be a  
laborer, but I knew I didn't want to be a laborer all my life,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	One recent night, Exilien drove with his partner through  
Boston's Haitian-dominated Mattapan neighborhood, where Exilien 
grew up. 
</P>
<P>
	Exilien's understanding of the community is invaluable,  
especially now that killings and other violent crime have decreased 
and much of his shift is spent mediating domestic disputes, said 
his partner, Philip Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are highly emotional situations,'' Morgan said. If the  
participants can identify with the officer, ``that's a lot more 
helpful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	These ethnic officers are already proving their worth in many  
towns. 
</P>
<P>
	A Vietnamese officer in Chamblee, Ga., prevented a potentially  
wrenching child abuse investigation when he recognized that a 
little girl's bruises were not the result of a beating, but of hot 
oil rubbed on her back with a coin -- a folk cure for a fever. 
</P>
<P>
	In St. Paul, the Hmong tradition of kidnapping teen-age girls as  
brides caused a lot of anger and confusion. Now Hmong officers sit 
down with the ``kidnapper'' and the girl's family, explain American 
law to them and ask the two sides to work out the problem.

<HEADLINE> DeBartolo May Pay NFL $1M Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Eddie DeBartolo, exiled owner of the San  
Francisco 49ers, will pay the NFL a $1 million fine for his part in 
a Louisiana gambling scandal, the San Francisco Chronicle reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue's decision to impose the fine  
may be announced this week at the annual owners meeting in 
Scottsdale, Ariz., the newspaper said, citing unidentified sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The fine brings to $3 million the total amount DeBartolo faces  
for his involvement with indicted former Louisiana governor Edwin 
Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, DeBartolo pleaded guilty to one felony charge of  
failing to report an alleged extortion attempt by Edwards in 
connection with DeBartolo's bid for a riverboat gambling license. 
The judge imposed $2 million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo and his sister, Denise DeBartolo York have been at  
odds for more than a year over control of the team, in part because 
of Eddie's debts to the family-held corporation. DeBartolo's 
attorney, Aubrey Harwell, while declining to discuss Tagliabue's 
pending sanctions, said he was hopeful Eddie DeBartolo and his 
sister could work things out. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue said in January that DeBartolo would be suspended for  
the 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, John York told the San Jose Mercury News that  
DeBartolo York had no plans to sell the team if Eddie DeBartolo did 
not regain control. 
</P>
<P>
	``What she wants is a separation from her brother,'' said York,  
recently appointed vice president of the team. ``His interests and 
hers do not go down the same path.'' 
</P>
<P>
	York told the newspaper Sunday his wife was committed to keeping  
the team while her brother was out. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo relinquished control of the team in December 1997 when  
the NFL investigated the gambling scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	While his wife might be interested in selling her share to her  
brother, she has no plans to sell to a third party if he can't 
return as active owner. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's first and foremost is a separation of her interests  
with Eddie's,'' York said. ``That does not mean she is out to hurt 
Eddie, but they need to be separated because their business 
interests are not the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 49ers are not for sale now. I can't tell you that that  
wouldn't change, but we don't have any intentions to sell the team. 
We are committed to running it because it is the most valuable 
single asset in the DeBartolo Corporation.''

<HEADLINE> Home Run Hitters in Spotlight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Properly aware of the excitement Mark McGwire  
and Sammy Sosa generated with last summer's home run race, the 
editors of the sixth edition of Total Baseball dedicated the 
official encyclopedia of major league baseball to the game's 
sluggers, past and present. 
</P>
<P>
	So they pay homage to homer hitters, listing 10 who have  
specialized in the long ball and led all major league players, 
either for a single season or an entire career. 
</P>
<P>
	Included are the usual suspects -- McGwire and his 70 homers,  
Hank Aaron and his 755, Roger Maris and his 61, Babe Ruth and his 
714. Even Sosa's 66 earned him an honorable mention. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there are the others, a collection of mystery men -- Dan  
Brouthers, Roger Connor, George Hall, Charley Jones, Harry Stovey 
and Ned Williamson. 
</P>
<P>
	Look them up and their power numbers seem like nothing special,  
except for one thing. They all played baseball before 1900, an era 
of the dead ball and the live arm. 
</P>
<P>
	That was before those rascally rabbits made their way into the  
cork-and-twine middle of baseballs, turning them into missiles. 
Home run leaders, forced to supply their own distance, rarely made 
it to double digits then, although occasionally some anomalies 
showed up. 
</P>
<P>
	In those pre-Comiskey days, the Chicago White Stockings played  
their games in Lakefront Park, where the right field fence was a 
cozy 190 feet from home plate. Before 1884, a ball that cleared 
that inviting wall was a ground-rule double. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the proprietors of the team and the league decided to make  
those balls home runs. Records, obviously, were treated more 
casually in those days. 
</P>
<P>
	Instantly, the White Stockings' long ball production zoomed from  
21 in 1883 to 142 in 1884. Williamson led the league with a record 
27 that year and, not surprisingly, 25 of them were hit at home. 
</P>
<P>
	This seemed exceedingly unfair, since no other team hit more  
than 39 homers that season. So the rule was changed again in 1885 
and Chicago's home run total dipped back to a more conventional 37. 
But Williamson's output stood as the single season record until 
Ruth hit 29 in 1919. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the times, Connor's 138 homers in 18 years gain in  
stature. And so does Stovey's production. He led his league in 
homers five times, including his rookie year of 1880, when he 
muscled six for Worcester. 
</P>
<P>
	That was one more than Hall hit for Philadelphia when he became  
the National League's very first home run champion in 1876. The 
next season, Hall was playing for Louisville and became involved in 
an unpleasant affair that involved the outcome of games. 
</P>
<P>
	After Louisville blew the pennant to Boston, league president  
William Hulbert, elected a year ago to Hall of Fame, started an 
investigation. When it was over, so were the careers of Hall, Bill 
Craver, Al Nichols and Jim Devlin, all thrown out of baseball in 
one of the many scandals that punctuated that period. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall was the most prominent of the four and he was devastated by  
the ban. Down on his luck, he went to see Hulbert and pleaded for 
another chance. The NL president was unimpressed. He gave the 
ex-home run king $50, saying, ``That's what I think of you as a 
man.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All four never played organized baseball again.  
</P>
<P>
	How were the Louisville schemers caught?  
</P>
<P>
	Probably the fact that they negotiated with gamblers by telegram  
-- no beepers in those days -- had something to do with it.

<HEADLINE> Rocker Marilyn Manson Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- A Marilyn Manson concert was cut short  
when the shock-rocker fell onstage at the Great Western Forum and 
injured his ankle. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did injure himself, a minor injury to his ankle. The  
concert was stopped early,'' police Lt. Alex Perez said early 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate word on Manson's condition. Two local  
hospitals said the singer, whose real name is Brian Warner, had not 
been admitted after Sunday's concert. 
</P>
<P>
	Concertgoers logging onto a bulletin board on the singer's  
official Web site said Manson jumped or fell from an amplifier or 
speaker during a rendition of ``Rock is Dead.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The concert halted after the band finished the song.  
</P>
<P>
	Concertgoers at first were told there were technical  
difficulties and the show would continue, but a second announcement 
indicated Manson had been injured and the event was over. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were not sent to the scene. A Fire Department dispatcher  
referred calls to the Forum but calls there rang unanswered early 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Manson was playing a much-anticipated concert along with  
Courtney Love and her rock band Hole. The show started at 7 p.m., 
with Monster Magnet as the opening act.

<HEADLINE>  No Major Trades for Pat Riley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- For the first time since taking over operations of  
the Miami Heat four years ago, Pat Riley will go an entire season 
without making a major trade. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami's silence at last week's trade deadline speaks volumes to  
the Heat players. It was another sign that Riley thinks he has the 
nucleus to win a championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very encouraging. I'm ecstatic,'' said forward P.J.  
Brown, a Riley favorite whose name frequently has popped up in 
trade rumors. 
</P>
<P>
	While other teams were reshaping themselves in the free-agent  
frenzy that followed the NBA lockout, Riley merely dabbled while 
making sure his ``core guys'' were taken care of. 
</P>
<P>
	And after the Heat shook off injuries and a 1-3 start to win 14  
of their next 16 games, there seemed hardly any reason to tinker 
with success -- particularly in the NBA's short 50-games-in-90-days 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you're 15-5 and leading the Atlantic Division, it's hard  
to break up a team like that,'' Brown said. ``You'd be hard-pressed 
to make a move.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not that Riley hasn't pulled the trigger in the past. Each of  
his first three seasons in Miami was marked by a trade-deadline 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Riley turned over half his roster in one day with three  
trades, including a four-player swap which brought Tim Hardaway 
from Golden State. That came three months after he pried Alonzo 
Mourning from Charlotte in a six-player deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, Riley sent three players to Dallas for  
high-scoring forward Jamal Mashburn. Last season brought the only 
deal that failed to pay dividends, when he traded Ike Austin to the 
Los Angeles Clippers for Brent Barry. 
</P>
<P>
	Then this year -- nothing. Even when word surfaced that Stephon  
Marbury could be available from Minnesota at the right price, 
apparently including Hardaway, Riley defended his nucleus. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people are talking about Timmy, they are talking about an  
important part of what we built,'' Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley did his tinkering around the edges early, signing guard  
Terry Porter and forward Clarence Weatherspoon as free agents to 
strengthen his bench. Both have paid off tremendously. 
</P>
<P>
	Porter, in his 14th season, has averaged 11.0 points per game,  
working both as Hardaway's backup and teaming with him as the 
shooting guard. He went 5-for-5 from the floor for 14 points in 
Sunday's 102-76 win over New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
	Weatherspoon, a seventh-year pro, is averaging 9.5 points and  
6.4 rebounds per game. He has 31 points and 14 rebounds in his past 
two games, hitting 13 of 15 field-goal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got two veteran players that have produced since they  
got here,'' Riley said. ``Our bench has given us a huge lift. Our 
veterans simply know how to play basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the Heat still figure to improve down the stretch. Mashburn  
and Voshon Lenard have missed virtually the entire season with 
injuries, and their return will provide a scoring boost. 
</P>
<P>
	Mashburn, out the past five weeks with a hyperextended left  
knee, is expected to return to practice within a week and should be 
activated by the end of the month. Lenard, diagnosed with a stress 
fracture in training camp, figures to return in time for the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``With those guys returning, it'll improve our team,'' Brown  
said. ``We're just scratching the surface right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Heat's current makeup has been good enough to lead the  
Eastern Conference. Next up: catching Utah and Portland for the 
best record in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we're thinking about winning a championship, then we're  
thinking about getting the best record,'' Riley said. ``Why not?''

<HEADLINE> GOP Blaming Shutdown on Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After years of paying a political price for  
shutting down the government over a budget stalemate, Republicans 
are trying to harvest a financial windfall from the episode. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican National Committee, seeking $5 million for an ad  
campaign supporting this year's GOP budget proposal, sent 
fund-raising letters blaming the 1995 and 1996 shutdowns on 
President Clinton and suggesting another might be inevitable this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Each year since 1994, President Clinton has engineered an  
artificial budget crisis with constant veto threats and three 
partial government shutdowns in four years,'' the GOP fund-raising 
letter states. 
</P>
<P>
	Predicting Clinton would ``shut down the government for a fourth  
time in five years'' the letter from RNC chairman Jim Nicholson 
asked recipients to donate $5 and up to help the RNC ``win the 
communications battle'' over this year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter's assignment of blame on Clinton comes despite polls  
and election results showing that Americans have blamed Republican 
congressional leaders for the two previous shutdowns that spanned 
27 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Some federal agencies and national parks closed after Clinton  
vetoed the spending bills to keep them open because he objected to 
provisions in the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., said at the time that  
one reason for the impasse was that Clinton snubbed him during a 
flight on Air Force One. The New York Daily News put a cartoon of 
Gingrich in diapers on the front page, under the headline, ``Cry 
Baby.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton shot up in the polls after standing up to the GOP and  
easily won re-election in November 1996. Meanwhile, House Democrats 
gained seats in both 1996 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	RNC spokesman Tim Fitzpatrick said the GOP has been unfairly  
blamed for the government shutdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our party certainly takes issue with the fact that the  
president seems to be disavowing any responsibility for that 
shutdown when it was his veto power that led to the government 
shutdown in the first place,'' Fitzpatrick said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to point that out, and we want to make sure the  
president doesn't get away with any of his budgetary smoke and 
mirrors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Andrew, the new Democratic National Committee national  
chairman, called the Republican fund-raising letter ``revisionist 
history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Blaming President Clinton for the government shutdown is like  
blaming President Roosevelt for Pearl Harbor,'' Andrew said. 
</P>
<P>
	With both sides poised to revisit the thorny budget disputes  
this year, there may be an advantage in Republicans getting their 
side of the story out early, GOP consultant Eddie Mahe said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's best we set out and make sure we don't get beat up on it  
again,'' Mahe said. ``It's what we call inoculation. We have to get 
the process under way that Republicans know it's not Republican 
members of Congress making it happen, it's Bill Clinton.''

	SIERRA NEVADA, Spain (AP) -- In and out of his sick bed all  
season with lung and chest problems, Lasse Kjus still proved to be

<P>
	Despite his battle with chronic bronchitis, the 28-year-old  
Norwegian still managed to win the prestigious World Cup overall 
crystal globe, the season's World Cup downhill and combined titles, 
and a record five medals at the world championships in Vail, 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's difficult to compare it with my overall title in 1996,''  
said Kjus. ``But at the moment this is my favorite because I'm 
feeling the emotion right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 28-year-old Kjus hacked and coughed through the first half  
of the season, took an early leave before Christmas to recuperate, 
then missed six races in the second half, losing valuable chances 
to collect points. 
</P>
<P>
	His accomplishments this season overshadowed every other skier  
expect one -- Austria's Alexandra Meissnitzer, who matched Kjus 
title for title, winning gold in the super-G and giant slalom at 
the World Championships, as well as the World Cup overall, super-G 
and giant slalom crowns. 
</P>
<P>
	Poor health wasn't the only thing Kjus had to battle. He also  
had to fend off last year's overall champion, Hermann Maier, and 
teammate Kjetil Andre Aamodt. 
</P>
<P>
	It proved to be the tightest fight for the men's overall since  
1991, and ended in dramatic fashion on Sunday -- the last day of the 
season -- when Kjus edged Aamodt by just 23 points, even though 
Aamodt finished ahead in the final race, a giant slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy I was in the fight for the overall,'' said Aamodt,  
who didn't win a World Cup race all season. ``This second place 
makes me happy and motivates me for next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Maier, who shot to stardom claiming double Olympic gold, 10  
World Cup wins and the overall title in his first full season on 
the circuit last year, settled for the World Cup super-G title. 
</P>
<P>
	He surrendered his World Cup overall crown to Kjus, and allowed  
Michael Von Gruenigen to reclaim the giant slalom title the Swiss 
skier had won in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am still very happy and proud of my season,'' Maier said.  
``I won eight World Cup races and won two gold medals at the world 
championships. The overall doesn't matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeping all five World Cup crystal globes last season, this  
year Austria's men claimed only two -- Maier in super-G and Thomas 
Stangassinger in slalom. 
</P>
<P>
	But the nation's pride survived thanks to a dominant performance  
by its women, who swept five titles with German Hilde Gerg taking 
the season combined. 
</P>
<P>
	Meissnitzer won overall, super-G and giant slalom, Renate  
Goetschl captured the season downhill, and Sabine Egger won the 
slalom crystal globe. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a disappointing season for Gerg, who was hoping to  
benefit from the absence of '98 overall champion and teammate Katja 
Seizinger, out with a leg injury. 
</P>
<P>
	But a disappointing performances just days before the start of  
the World Cup Finals last week allowed rivals to pull away from her 
in overall and the downhill. 
</P>
<P>
	The Finals, disrupted by quick-changing weather in Sierra  
Nevada, were also hit with a strike threat when women skiers 
declined to ski the second leg of slalom because of a rutted piste. 
FIS moved quickly and canceled the race to avoid embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
	The cancellation cost Swede Pernilla Wiberg -- a mere 10 points  
behind Egger in slalom -- a chance to win the season crown.

<HEADLINE> Billionaire Probes Man's Suicide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The parents of a man who committed suicide in  
a bathroom near the office of conservative billionaire Richard 
Mellon Scaife are trying to trace their son's final days. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still don't know if Steve was running or if he was after  
somebody,'' said Jan Lankeet, the mother of Steven R. Kangas. 
</P>
<P>
	Kangas, 37, was found dead from a gunshot wound to the head last  
month on the 39th floor of One Oxford Center, where Scaife has his 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're as baffled as anybody else. We have no earthly idea why  
he would be up there,'' said Robert Esh, the victim's father. 
``Steve was totally nonviolent. He didn't even believe in guns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kangas, who championed liberal causes with a Web site titled  
``Liberalism Resurgent,'' posted a message on the Internet six days 
before his death. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Tribune-Review of Greensburg, where Scaife is  
publisher, the message blamed Scaife for President Clinton's 
political troubles. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clinton is, in my mind, a moderate Republican, and it is only  
the insanity of Richard Mellon Scaife that is causing them to go 
after this man,'' the newspaper on Sunday quoted Kangas writing. 
</P>
<P>
	Scaife himself has hired a private investigator to investigate  
Kangas' motives. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported Sunday that 
Scaife is interested in knowing whether Kangas was after him 
because Scaife funded conservative causes, including giving a 
magazine, the American Spectator, $1.8 million to investigate 
President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	In discovering Kangas' body, police said they found a pistol he  
had bought two weeks earlier in Las Vegas, where he had been a 
partner in a gambling venture before recently selling his stake in 
the business. 
</P>
<P>
	He was found with $14.63 in his pockets, 47 rounds of ammunition  
in his backpack, a nearly empty bottle of Jack Daniels whiskey and 
a copy of Hitler's ``Mein Kampf,'' authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Post-Gazette reported that in an autobiography he posted on  
his Web site, Kangas called his move to Las Vegas in 1997 ``a big 
mistake'' and said he was planning to move back to Santa Cruz, 
Calif., where he had attended the University of California. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, according to family and friends, he placed ads in a  
newspaper to sell his car and his camera, then bought a gun. 
Authorities did not know precisely when he left Las Vegas.

<HEADLINE> Group: Gay Military Harassment Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Harassment of homosexuals in the military more  
than doubled last year, a gay rights groups said Monday in 
criticizing Pentagon enforcement of the ``don't ask, don't tell'' 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the 5-year-old policy, the military isn't supposed to  
investigate sexual orientation unless ``credible information'' 
surfaces about a person's homosexuality. Proof that someone is gay 
or professes to be gay is grounds for automatic discharge. 
</P>
<P>
	The Servicemembers Legal Defense Network counted 400 cases of  
anti-gay harassment in the military last year, including death 
threats, compared with 182 violations in 1997, a 120 percent 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The group said they found 511 incidents -- including a number of  
the 400 harassed -- in which service members said they were asked 
about their sexual orientation and their cases were pursued by 
military investigators or commanders until they quit or were 
dismissed. In 1997, the legal defense network's counted 359 such 
instances. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was in constant fear of being found out, investigated and  
discharged despite my impeccable record,'' said former Navy Lt. 
Comdr. Jill Szymanski, who resigned in August after 12 years. ``It 
has become an acceptable part of military culture to pick on and 
demean suspected gay service members and no one is held accountable 
for these actions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon declined immediate comment on the report.  
</P>
<P>
	There were 1,145 gay discharges from all service branches last  
year, the Pentagon reported in January. In 1997, the total was 997, 
the highest number since 1987. The number hit a low of 617 in 1994, 
the year the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy took effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon officials, in releasing the discharge figures, said  
many were recruits intent on leaving the military anyway. But a 
Pentagon report last April concluded, ``The reasons for this 
increase are not known and would be difficult to ascertain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	C. Dixon Osburn, co-executive director of the legal defense  
network, said the cases his group documented tell the story behind 
the discharges. 
</P>
<P>
	``The service members are forced between hiding under this  
blanket of fear and anxiety from harassment every day or coming out 
and being fired for who they are,'' Osburn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Osburn said he isn't arguing for a ``zero discharge'' policy,  
realizing members of Congress, the administration and the Supreme 
Court aren't going to reverse the law any time soon. Instead, his 
group is advocating commanders enforce the rules designed to 
protect the privacy of service members and limit investigations 
into their lives. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon, facing criticism for alleged overzealous pursuit  
of gay men and women in the military, issued guidelines in March 
1997 for carrying out the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy more 
evenly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investigators should not solicit allegations concerning the  
sexual orientation or homosexual conduct of the threatened 
person,'' said the guidelines, written by Undersecretary of Defense 
Edwin Dorn. He also wrote that service members who are harassed 
should be able to report that without fear of reprisals. 
</P>
<P>
	David Raleigh, a former lance corporal with the Marine Corps who  
quit after two years, said he experienced harassment from basic 
training when his drill instructor asked, ``You're a fag, aren't 
you?'' He said he was afraid that reporting the insults and threats 
would end his career, but he finally decided it was unsafe to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the end, I knew I couldn't trust these Marines in combat  
for fear that I would be the first casualty,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Magazine Bill Advances in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OTTAWA (AP) -- The House of Commons passed a contentious bill  
Monday that would limit U.S. magazine operations in Canada, but the 
government indicated it was still open to compromises to avert a 
trade war. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, which now goes to the Senate, would impose fines on  
foreign publishers who carried Canadian advertising in special 
Canadian editions of their magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	Canadian publishers say they lose advertising to these so-called  
split-run magazines, which have lower production costs and charge 
less for ads. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, which cleared the House of Commons on a 193-46 vote,  
has been assailed by the U.S. government. Washington has threatened 
retaliatory trade sanctions on Canadian lumber, textiles steel and 
plastics if the measure goes into effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations on a compromise are scheduled to continue this  
week, and U.S officials have said they are willing to be patient in 
hopes agreement can be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's heritage minister, Sheila Copps, said Monday that her  
government might be willing to compromise by amending the bill to 
set allow split-runs with a specified amount of Canadian editorial 
content. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are willing to discuss with the Americans changes that  
would accommodate their concerns and at the same time respect 
Canadian content,'' Copps said.

<HEADLINE> McDougal's Testimony Disputed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Kenneth Starr's office put one of its  
own prosecutors on the witness stand Monday to fight Susan 
McDougal's allegation that Whitewater investigators pressured her 
to tell lies about the Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office only asked for the ``total and complete truth,''  
former prosecutor Amy St. Eve insisted at Mrs. McDougal's criminal 
contempt and obstruction trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent counsel's office has been thrown on the  
defensive by the strategy of Mrs. McDougal's lawyer, Mark Geragos, 
who is accusing the prosecutor's staff of a pattern of misconduct -- 
including urging Mrs. McDougal to give testimony that falsely 
implicates President and Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely not,'' St. Eve replied when prosecutor Julie Myers  
asked whether Mrs. McDougal had been asked to lie. 
</P>
<P>
	St. Eve related two conversations she and prosecutor Ray Jahn  
and his wife, also a prosecutor, engaged in on Aug. 15, 1996, with 
Mrs. McDougal's lawyer at the time, Bobby McDaniel. Mrs. McDougal 
listened in on the conversations. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to demonstrate close ties between the Clinton camp and  
some lawyers for major figures in the inquiry, St. Eve read to the 
jury portions of a memo written by another prosecutor. It said one 
of Mrs. McDougal's lawyers had contacted Clinton lawyer David 
Kendall after a discussion of a possible cooperation agreement 
between Starr's office and McDougal's legal team. 
</P>
<P>
	Geragos attacked the memo, eliciting from St. Eve that the  
document was dated Oct. 11, 1996, two months after conversations it 
was memorializing had occurred.

<HEADLINE> Compaq To Boost Taiwan Purchases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Compaq Computer Corp., already the largest  
foreign buyer of Taiwan's information products, will boost 
purchases from the island to $7 billion in 1999 from last year's 
$5.5 billion, a company executive said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq also will establish a research center here to encourage  
leading-edge manufacturing methods among local electronics 
companies, said Greg Petsch, senior vice-president for global 
manufacturing at Compaq. 
</P>
<P>
	The center will promote technologies such as Internet commerce  
to help reduce turnaround times for Compaq's orders from Taiwan, 
which are slightly slower than Compaq's global average of eight to 
nine days, Petsch said 
</P>
<P>
	He did not say how much the company would invest, but the China  
Times Express newspaper quoted unidentified sources saying the 
company could pour as much as $30 million into the center. 
</P>
<P>
	Compaq is already a key customer for a batch of local technology  
companies, including Inventec Corp., Mitac Inc. and Chuntex 
Electronics Co., and the top overall foreign buyer of Taiwanese 
information products, according to the Economics Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan is the world's third biggest producer of computer  
equipment after the United States and Japan, with output rising 12 
percent last year to $34 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwanese computer chip makers have predicted a double-digit  
growth in revenues amid a cyclical upswing in the industry and 
increased orders from customers gearing up to face the impact of 
the year 2000 on computer systems.

<HEADLINE> New Round of Kosovo Talks Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- The second round of Kosovo peace talks opened  
today, but negotiators expressed little hope of a deal between 
rival Serbs and ethnic Albanians as violence flared anew. 
</P>
<P>
	Three weeks after the first round of talks ended without any  
agreement, Yugoslav forces bombarded two rebel-held villages in 
northern Kosovo with tank and rocket fire and an army officer was 
shot in the arm. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serbs accused the Kosovo Liberation Army of attacking an  
army post early today after firing on two police stations the 
previous night. 
</P>
<P>
	A Yugoslav army officer was shot and wounded today as he rode in  
a jeep along the main road just north of Kosovo's capital, 
Pristina, near a rebel-held village, a spokesman for the 
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe said. 
</P>
<P>
	International monitors said they saw the bodies of 10 war  
victims Sunday -- four in the western Klina area and six in the 
southwest. 
</P>
<P>
	Both warring sides have been vying for position while mediators  
opened a second round of talks today to end the year-old war that 
has killed more than 2,000 people and displaced 300,000 in the 
separatist province of Serbia, the dominant republic in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The two delegations at a Paris conference center this morning  
met in separate sessions with mediators. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to mediators said the Serbs were still refusing  
to discuss a NATO-led implementation force in Kosovo -- a key 
element for any peace deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The international community has insisted both the military and  
political components of any settlement must be agreed upon. 
</P>
<P>
	Failure of the talks could lead to NATO bombardment of Serb  
strategic targets, especially if the Serbs are seen as the party 
blocking a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mediators were talking tough. Phil Reeker, the chief spokesman  
for the conference, said that this time the meeting will last ``a 
few days at most.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, co-host of the talks  
with French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine, said this was a time 
for tough bargaining. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not a conference for high rhetoric,'' Cook said.  
``This is a conference for serious, businesslike discussion, hard 
bargaining, aiming at a rapid conclusion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But prospects did not look good for a deal, with the Serbs  
refusing the deployment of some 28,000 NATO-led troops, including 
up to 4,000 Americans, to police the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kosovo Albanians, who represent 90 percent of Kosovo's 2  
million people, have been reluctant to sign because they are not 
getting the independence they seek and their guerrillas would have 
to be disarmed. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Kosovo Albanians, and the West, have said there cannot  
be a deal without the NATO-led police force. 
</P>
<P>
	Vedrine said Sunday night that ``there is no optimism'' among  
the Contact Group -- comprised of the United States, Russia, France, 
Britain, Italy and Germany -- which is trying to persuade the two 
sides to agree. 
</P>
<P>
	The leader of the Serb delegation, Ratko Markovic, on Sunday  
flatly rejected any NATO-led troops in Kosovo and said there will 
be no independence for the province. 
</P>
<P>
	``Serbia will never give up Kosovo voluntarily. It's only by  
force that it can be taken,'' Markovic told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources close to the Serbian delegation have indicated they  
might try to stall the talks by proposing a three-month cease-fire 
in Kosovo, or the deployment of unarmed, non-NATO peacekeeping 
troops -- something the West is sure to reject. 
</P>
<P>
	The ethnic Albanians may, for tactical reasons, sign the plan.  
The United States has hoped all along that an ethnic Albanian 
signing would step up the pressure against Yugoslav President 
Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent weeks, Serbia has massed troops in and around Kosovo  
and fighting in the province itself has resulted in numerous 
casualties. Thousands of ethnic Albanians have fled their homes and 
are living in the forests and mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	There was still no public claim of responsibility for two  
weekend bomb blasts in Kosovska Mitrovica and Podujevo that killed 
seven people and injured dozens. Both sides blamed each other.

<HEADLINE> Norway Plans Oil Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- Norway is set to cut its oil production by  
an additional 100,000 barrels a day as of April 1, joining other 
oil exporters in a drive to reduce a global glut and boost prices, 
the oil ministry said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The cuts will be made if the Organization of Petroleum Exporting  
Countries formally adopts a 2-million-barrel daily cut negotiated 
by five major oil exporters last week, said ministry spokeswoman 
Sissel Edvardsen. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC ministers are scheduled to meet on March 23 in Vienna.  
</P>
<P>
	Norway is the world's second-largest oil exporter, producing  
just under 3 million barrels per day. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not a member of OPEC but has often contributed to the  
organization's efforts to manage prices. Last year, Norway cut 
production by 100,000 barrels to support those efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the OPEC countries don't contribute, then Norway will have  
to reevaluate its decision. That is also the case if the agreed 
cuts are not carried out,'' Oil Minister Marit Arnstad was quoted 
as telling the Norwegian news agency NTB.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Higher Rallying / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen Tuesday morning as  
global investors shifted funds into the rallying Tokyo stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 118.24 yen in late morning, down 0.18 yen from  
late Monday in Tokyo but above its rate of 117.64 yen in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average rose 62.67 points, or 0.40 percent, to  
15,842.27 at the end of the morning session. On Monday, the average 
closed up 290.74 points, or 1.88 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese stocks have risen on news of corporate restructurings  
such as that announced by Sony Corp., helping to make the Nikkei 
the best-performing major market this year. 
</P>
<P>
	That's made a number of foreign fund managers reconsider  
decisions to avoid investing in the lackluster Japanese economy. As 
they've started putting money into Japan, their buying has given 
the yen a boost. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar moved as low as 117.28 yen at one point early in the  
Tokyo session following comments from Japan's Finance Minister 
Kiichi Miyazawa that seemed initially to indicate a turn toward a 
stronger yen. 
</P>
<P>
	At a regular news conference, Miyazawa said the dollar's fall  
below 118 yen in New York earlier somewhat reflected fundamental 
economic factors. 
</P>
<P>
	Miyazawa's remarks came after comments Monday by Vice Finance  
Minister for International Affairs Eisuke Sakakibara, who clearly 
said that yen strength was ``undesirable'' at this time. 
</P>
<P>
	Market players who sold the U.S. currency soon after Miyazawa's  
remarks scrambled later to cover their short, or oversold, 
positions, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 128.32 yen, down  
sharply from 129.44 yen late Monday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro fell after news that the 20-member European Union  
Executive Commission resigned en masse Tuesday following reports of 
financial irregularities. The resignation was announced by EU 
Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section gained 11.76 points, or 0.97 percent, to 1,222.94. 
The TOPIX gained 15.57 points, or 1.30 percent, on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.765  
percent from Monday's close of 1.785 percent, driving its price up 
to 110.27 yen from 110.11 yen.

$11 million in federal funds to bolster urban medical teams trained 
to respond to chemical and biological attacks. In addition, Clinton 
highlighted $21 million in grants already included in this year's 
federal budget to help train fire fighters to handle terrorist 
attacks and $73.5 million to help communities buy protective and 
communications gear.

	EU Executive Commission Quits

<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The chief executive of the European  
Union and 19 other senior officials abruptly resigned early 
Tuesday, after an investigative panel alleged cronyism and 
financial irregularities in their ranks. It marked the first time 
in the group's 42-year history that the European Commission, which 
runs the day-to-day affairs of the powerful trading block, had 
stepped down under fire. The action would be roughly equivalent to 
the entire U.S. Cabinet resigning.

	HMO Group Requiring Outside Reviews  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- HMOs must let patients appeal denials of care  
to outside experts if they want a seal of approval from the 
nation's largest accrediting group. It's the latest in a string of 
private initiatives boosting the idea of external reviews, which 
both supporters and critics of managed care have come to support as 
a way to assure consumers they won't be unfairly denied treatment 
for financial reasons. The National Committee on Quality Assurance, 
which accredits about half of the nation's health maintenance 
organizations, plans to require these independent reviews beginning 
next year.

	More Salmon Species Now Endangered  
</P>
<P>
	GRANTS PASS, Ore. (AP) -- Nine salmon species in the Pacific  
Northwest are being added to the endangered list in a move that 
could change the way people fertilize their lawns, dig construction 
sites or wash their cars. The National Marine Fisheries Service 
said that Endangered Species Act protections will be extended to 
certain wild salmon stocks in the region. The waterways, once full 
of salmon, are now surrounded by urban sprawl where industries 
pollute rivers, road culverts block spawning areas and even lawn 
fertilizers and soap used to wash cars seep into streams through 
storm drains.

neighborhoods in the 1980s sued the CIA and Justice Department on 
Monday. The complaints were filed on behalf of mostly black 
residents whose babies were born addicted to crack, whose relatives 
died in drug-related drive-by shootings and whose communities were 
affected by crowded emergency rooms and gutted business districts, 
the lawsuit said.

<HEADLINE> Baseball May Leave Umpires Behind </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- If umpires don't want to go to Cuba, they can  
stay behind, major league baseball said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires filed grievances last week to prevent the American  
League from sending them to Cuba for Baltimore's historic 
exhibition game on March 28 and to block the new interpretation of 
the strike zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Commissioner Bud Selig was livid, according to several baseball  
officials. The grievance over the Cuban game was interpreted by the 
commissioner's office as an attempt to get more money for both the 
first leg of the series and the return game in Baltimore on May 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not required to have major league umpires for the game  
in Havana or the game in Baltimore,'' Sandy Alderson, the executive 
vice president of baseball operations in the commissioner's office, 
said Monday, ``If the umpires are not inclined to go, they won't be 
invited to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires union head Richie Phillips said that was fine with him.  
</P>
<P>
	``The umpires always seem to be an afterthought. That kind of  
disrespect the umpires really can't tolerate,'' Phillips said. 
``They'd rather go with four Cuban umpires than negotiate with the 
umpires' association. If that's their inclination, that just proves 
where their coming from.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selig, according to several officials, is tired of Phillips  
attempting to force his will on owners. Selig planned to shift 
authority over umpires from the league presidents to Alderson this 
year, but was blocked by Phillips. Selig intends to make the change 
after this season, when the umpires' labor agreement expires. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not clear what the next step will be in the strike zone  
grievance. Owners want umpires to call more high strikes. In a Feb. 
19 memo, Alderson told them to raise the top of the strike zone to 
two inches above the top of the uniform pants -- still below the 
definition called for in the official playing rules: the midpoint 
between the top of the shoulders and the top of the uniform pants. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was disappointed but not surprised given the lack of  
communication we've had and the general posture the union has 
taken,'' Alderson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires deny the strike zone is a problem, with some saying they  
do enforce the rule as written and others saying players don't want 
them to call high strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, they're going against the rule book,'' NL umpire  
Bob Davidson said. ``I don't think any player has any problem with 
it. I think baseball is succumbing to media pressure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While some umpires in Florida have called higher strikes,  
Chicago Cubs infielder Gary Gaetti says he hasn't noticed any 
change in calls this spring in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't seen an effort to call that particular pitch, and I  
haven't noticed anybody complaining,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Umpires think they're caught in the middle of a power struggle  
that pits AL president Gene Budig and NL president Len Coleman, who 
are their legal bosses, against Selig and Alderson. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of flattering,'' Davidson said. ``Everyone wants to  
be in control over us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's still resentment stemming from 1996, when umpires  
attempted to strike the postseason after Roberto Alomar was given 
just a five-game suspension for spitting at umpire John Hirschbeck. 
Representatives of owners, players and umpires met that offseason 
in an attempt to develop a code of conduct, but no code has emerged 
and that committee hasn't met in a over a year, Phillips said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The code of conduct was a sham,'' Phillips said. ``That whole  
concept seems to have gone by the wayside. That was just talk from 
Bud and nothing more than talk from Bud.''

<HEADLINE> Lemieux Upbeat about Penguins Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTREAL (AP) -- Mario Lemieux said Monday he has an excellent  
chance of becoming president and co-owner of the Pittsburgh 
Penguins in the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
	``This week is crucial,'' Lemieux said at his official induction  
into the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League's Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	``The group I lead has put together the $50 million needed to  
save the Penguins. We have been working on a solid re-establishment 
project for nearly six months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux, who later left for meetings in Pennsylvania on Tuesday  
and Wednesday, said his group will present its business plan 
Thursday to a bankruptcy court hearing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision whether to accept the plan won't be made for a  
few months,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux, who submitted his plan last Thursday to NHL  
commissioner Gary Bettman, declined to identify the other members 
of his group. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're mostly good friends,'' Lemieux said. Later, he  
admitted former Penguins owner Howard Baldwin could be among the 
group members. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux is eager to have his project accepted because he risks  
losing about $32 million owed to him by the current owners in 
delayed salary payments. The Penguins have declared bankruptcy and 
are using a bank loan to support them this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux said he wouldn't be involved in the venture if the  
Penguins didn't owe him money. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't blame me for wanting to protect my assets,'' he  
said. ``But I'm equally concerned about the survival of the 
Pittsburgh Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't spend 12 seasons playing for the Penguins just to  
watch them leave a few years after my retirement. I believe in the 
future of the Pittsburgh franchise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux, 33, said he never thought he'd find himself in such a  
situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't part of my retirement plans,'' he said. ``You know  
me -- I don't like to be in the spotlight. But after a couple of 
years of playing golf, I was ready for the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd even say that after a few months, I'm starting to like it.  
But it looks like it's tougher to be an administrator than a 
player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux said he'll be highly visible as president of the  
Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll attend all the home games and travel with the team. I'll  
be quite a bit more involved than people think.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the future of Canadian NHL teams, Lemieux said  
governments should give them more financial support. 
</P>
<P>
	``If governments don't do anything, Canadian teams will have no  
choice but to leave within a few years,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux also said he's pleased to note there's less hooking and  
grabbing nowadays in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's better but there's still room for improvement.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Hall of Fame induction prompted Lemieux to recall some fond  
memories of his last regular-season game in the QMJHL. 
</P>
<P>
	It was March 14, 1984, when Lemieux, playing for Voisins de  
Laval, scored six goals and added five assists. That gave him a 
record 133 goals in a season, surpassing the previous mark of 130 
set by Guy Lafleur. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux's league record still stands.

<HEADLINE> Forbes Announces Candidacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Steve Forbes will declare his  
presidential candidacy Tuesday on the Internet, promising to wage 
an ``information-age campaign about great ideas and enduring 
values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an address produced for transmission on his Internet site,  
Forbes says, ``You and I are entering the information age and 
Washington politicians are stuck in the Stone Age.'' He outlines 
his Republican agenda to abolish the tax code, protect Social 
Security and curb abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am happy to announce the beginning of my campaign for  
president of the United States of America,'' Forbes says. ``Today 
marks the beginning of a national crusade to restore Ronald 
Reagan's vision of hope and prosperity for all Americans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, a millionaire businessman who has never held elective  
office, still plans a traditional announcement for June. But the 
Internet address and a two-day swing through New Hampshire mark the 
informal opening of a campaign that actually began almost the day 
he dropped out of the 1996 Republican primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe in business as usual,'' he said in the  
address. ``And I don't believe in politics as usual. This is going 
to be a new, information-age campaign about great ideas and 
enduring values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes said in a telephone interview that his campaign Internet  
site ``will set a new standard, a new level, for high technology 
and politics. We see the 'net as a way to bring politics and power 
back to the people in a way that was not possible in the era of 
mass media -- i.e. radio and television.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think others will be scrambling to catch us,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 2000 campaigns have Internet sites, with the likes  
of Forbes and Rep. John Kasich of Ohio competing to see who can be 
the most creative. Forbes' advisers say he is the first to use the 
Internet for the main announcement of his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	According to 1998 election exit polls conducted by Voter News  
Service, four out of 10 voters described themselves as regular 
Internet users. Thirty-eight percent of Republicans described 
themselves as Internet regulars. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' site will include:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Campaign ``reporters'' who will submit information directly to  
the site. 
</P>
<P>
	-- A digital camera to file photos directly from the road.  
</P>
<P>
	-- A volunteer section to organize and motivate grass-roots  
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a major vacuum in the public square,'' Forbes told the  
AP. ``By pushing hard our principles and policies, I think we're 
going to enormously impact the political landscape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes is in the middle of the pack in most public opinion  
polls, well behind the current GOP favorite, Texas Gov. George W. 
Bush. But his enormous wealth gives him a huge cash advantage over 
the rest of the field. 
</P>
<P>
	His attack ads during the 1996 primaries nearly sank the  
candidacy of Bob Dole, who eventually won the Republican 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past four years, he has courted conservative leaders who  
were skeptical of him in 1996. His staff is loaded with veterans 
from conservative campaigns of the past, including media 
strategists Greg Mueller, Keith Appell and Craig Shirley and press 
aides Juleanna Glover, K.B. Forbes and Sean McCabe. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes' Internet address will be: www.Forbes2000.com, scheduled  
to open at 8:30 a.m. EST on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> BASF Expects Hard Times </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUDWIGSHAFEN, Germany (AP) -- The German chemicals company BASF  
posted record earnings in 1998 for the second consecutive year, but 
forecast tougher times ahead and announced plans to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The company earned 3.32 billion marks, or $1.9 billion, in 1998,  
up from a record 3.24 billion marks in 1997. Sales slipped to 54.1 
billion marks, or $30.4 billion, from 55.8 billion marks in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	But Chairman Juergen Strube said Monday that for the first two  
months of 1999, BASF sales were down about 10 percent from a year 
earlier. ``That clearly describes what challenges face us,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Strube said results slipped due to the worldwide decrease in  
energy prices and noted a fourth-quarter decline in the chemical 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	The economic crisis in Asia and South America also affected  
BASF, because a surplus of chemicals on the market pushed prices 
down worldwide, Strube said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company hopes to realize $506.2 million in savings from  
measures such as reducing inventory and other operational changes, 
a spokesman said, adding there were no plans to reduce the work 
force of some 105,000 people worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Echoing calls by other companies, notably DaimlerChrysler and  
Allianz Insurance, Strube said BASF demanded the government ease 
the tax burden on German businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	According to BASF, a business slowdown began in the last quarter  
of 1998 with a decrease in sales of about 11.4 percent. Operating 
profit was down 28 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Strube said BASF expects to 1999 sales to match those last year,  
although he warned there would be less profit.

<HEADLINE> Stradivari Violin Goes to Winner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When Judith Ingolfsson was 10, the great  
violinist Josef Gingold autographed one of his record albums for 
her, predicting a fine career for the budding artist. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, the late master's 17th century Stradivari violin  
was handed to the now 25-year-old winner of the Indianapolis 
competition associated with Gingold. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Ingolfsson will make her Carnegie Hall debut in 2000 with  
the brilliant, sweet sound of the Gingold Stradivari. She can play 
the 1683 instrument until it is passed on to the next winner in 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has an unbelievable sound, very warm, expansive -- a breadth  
that just hugs the room,'' the beaming musician said as she tuned 
the strings at the shop of violin craftsman Rene Morel. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Ingolfsson won the quadrennial International Violin  
Competition of Indianapolis in September, but it took months of 
negotiations for organizers to acquire the violin with a grant from 
the Lilly Endowment, said Tom Beczkiewicz, founding director of the 
17-year-old competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Gingold, the contest's artistic director and a former professor  
at the Indiana University School of Music, played the violin for 
five decades as a soloist and as concertmaster of the Detroit and 
Cleveland orchestras. Gingold, a favorite of maestro Arturo 
Toscanini and beloved ``guru'' to such violinists as Itzhak 
Perlman, Pinchas Zukerman and Joshua Bell, died in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	His violin, worth up to $2 million and one of only several dozen  
Stradivaris that have survived in concert-playing shape, ``has a 
very rich, sweet sound -- like Gingold's personality,'' said Morel, 
who kept it in his shop's vault after Gingold's family put it up 
for sale in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, Morel has been adjusting it to make the sound big  
enough to fill today's huge concert halls and to satisfy modern 
audiences with a taste for a powerful sonority. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Ingolfsson won the Indianapolis competition playing a less  
valuable Italian instrument for the prize that included the 
Carnegie Hall debut and $30,000. She is the first winner to be 
allowed to use the Stradivari, too. 
</P>
<P>
	A native of Iceland who lives in Cleveland, she attended the  
Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia and the Cleveland 
Institute of Music. 
</P>
<P>
	She first played for Gingold as a child prodigy while living  
with her parents in Alabama. At the 1984 encounter in Bloomington, 
Ind., the Russian-born master wrote on the LP he gave her: ``May 
your life be filled with beautiful music.''

<HEADLINE> Forest Health Called Top Priority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Forest Service should place forest health  
above all else as it decides how to use 191 million acres of 
national forests and grasslands, scientists recommended Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Committee of Scientists said in a 193-page report that the  
agency should use science in regulating lands, make forest plans 
flexible, ensure that critical species remain viable and consider 
entire regions when developing plans rather than individual 
forests. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Lyons, the Agriculture Department undersecretary who  
oversees the Forest Service, said the agency already is doing much 
of what the scientists recommended. ``What I get is a message ... 
that we're on the right track,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department appointed the 13-member group in late  
1997 to help update forest rules that have been unrevised since 
1982. Most panel members are college professors from schools 
including the University of Michigan, Pennsylvania State University 
and the University of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules guide local forest officials in crafting plans for 155  
national forests that dictate most aspects of forest management, 
from where loggers can work to where a ski chalet can be built. The 
rules also help determine which lands must be left pristine to 
preserve nature. 
</P>
<P>
	More than two-thirds of the plans are to be revised in the next  
three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists were pleased with the panel's emphasis on  
conservation, but industry groups worried the document could lead 
to broad new restrictions on logging, recreation and other forest 
uses. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're moving in a direction that I don't think is supported  
by the laws of this land,'' said Laura Cleland, vice president of 
the Independent Forest Products Association, based in Portland, 
Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists opposed attempted rules updates in 1991 and  
1994 as lacking sufficient public involvement and lacked 
protections for plants and animals. They said the scientists 
redressed those problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully the Forest Service will accept most of the guidance  
it got,'' said Michael Francis, director of national forests for 
the Wilderness Society. 
</P>
<P>
	The Forest Service will now decide which if any recommendations  
to accept and put out draft rules in late spring or early summer. 
Final rules could be complete at the end of the year or in early 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Committee of Scientists didn't work entirely without  
controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	Norman Johnson, an Oregon State University professor who led the  
panel, quit last year when he said he could no longer defend its 
conclusions. His colleagues quickly persuaded him to rejoin the 
effort.

<HEADLINE> El Paso Energy Buys Sonat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Natural gas supplier El Paso Energy  
Corp. is buying Sonat Inc. for $3.9 billion in stock, extending its 
reach deeper into the Southeast. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced today gives Houston-based El Paso Energy the  
ability to ship gas through pipelines from supply fields in 
California and Texas to growing Southern markets, especially 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``New gas-fueled power generation development is particularly  
active in these areas,'' said El Paso Energy chief executive 
William A. Wise. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company will have some 40,000 miles of pipeline  
transporting nearly one-fourth of all the natural gas moved in the 
United States each day. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to swapping stock, El Paso Energy will assume some  
$1.9 billion in Sonat debt. 
</P>
<P>
	El Paso Energy chief financial officer H. Brent Austin said the  
merger includes 1.6 trillion cubic feet of gas or equivalent 
reserves held by Sonat. The company's Southern operations 
previously were centered around Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co., one of 
five subsidiaries.

<HEADLINE> Panel Condemns EU Executive Branch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Union's executive branch  
came under scathing attack Monday by a panel of experts who say 
they found cronyism and financial irregularities in the upper 
ranks. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Parliament's two largest parties called for the  
resignation of the entire European Commission after the report 
cited several of the 20 commissioners for lax control over aid and 
other programs, for putting friends and relatives on the EU payroll 
and for pleading ignorance when asked why they did not act sooner 
to stop waste and fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, set up by the Parliament, said ``undoubted cases of  
fraud and corruption ... have thus passed `unnoticed''' at the top 
of the institution that runs the EU's day-to-day affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	It dismissed the defense of senior executives who contended they  
did not know matters were so bad. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is becoming difficult to find anyone who has even the  
slightest sense of responsibility,'' the 140-page report concluded. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel found no evidence that any commissioner ``was directly  
and personally involved in fraudulent activities'' or had 
personally enriched themselves. Yet, it said, all bear 
``responsibility for instances of fraud, irregularities or 
mismanagement in their services or areas of special 
responsibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no immediate reaction from the Commission, which went  
into emergency session Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The report did not call for the dismissal of any of the 20  
commissioners, but members of the European Parliament were quick to 
demand the resignations of some, if not all, of them. 
</P>
<P>
	Edward McMillan-Scott of Britain, leader of Conservatives in the  
assembly, said the entire commission should step down. 
</P>
<P>
	``The report concerns a culture of cover-up and cronyism ... a  
conspiracy if silence on the part of the commission,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 626-member assembly set up the inquiry by the independent  
experts, including two former EU auditors, in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The report reserved its harshest criticism for Edith Cresson, a  
former French prime minister who is in charge of EU research 
programs. It alleged that she ``failed to act in response to known, 
serious and continuing irregularities over several years'' in 
educational and other programs for which she was responsible. 
</P>
<P>
	It alleged that when told of fraud and waste in an outside  
contractor that squandered $160 million meant for a youth training 
program, she failed to stop the abuses. She also was criticized for 
getting a short-term EU research job for a friend in 1997 for which 
the man was later judged to be unqualified. He was paid for 10 
months but was allegedly sick for nine. 
</P>
<P>
	Magda Aelvoet of Belgium, leader of the Green faction, which was  
instrumental in getting the assembly to launch an independent 
inquiry, told reporters: ``On the basis of these elements, it is 
obvious that Mrs. Cresson has to step down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report condemned others for cronyism, too.  
</P>
<P>
	Regional Development Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies of  
Germany, and Portugal's Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the commissioner for 
relations with developing nations, put friends and relatives on the 
EU payroll, it alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	It cited Development Commissioner Manuel Marin, a Spaniard, for  
lax control over the running of an aid scheme for Mediterranean 
nations, for irregularities in hiring and for doing too little to 
stop fraud in the EU's humanitarian aid budget handled through a 
Luxembourg contractor in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	The commissioners, in appearances before the panel in recent  
weeks, denied any wrongdoing and testified they were unaware of 
sloppiness and fraud by their staffs or outside contractors. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said that only made it worse because a ``sense of  
responsibility is essential (and) must be demonstrated ... by the 
commissioners individually and the Commission as a body.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commissioners are political appointees.

<HEADLINE> CIA To Probe China Spy Allegations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The CIA said today it will conduct a damage  
assessment to determine how much sensitive nuclear weapons 
information, if any, was lost to China through a suspected spy 
working at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
	Amid mounting criticism that the Clinton administration took no  
decisive action when it first learned of the possible compromise of 
sensitive weapons information, CIA Director George Tenet said 
retired Adm. David Jeremiah will provide an independent review of 
the work being done now by a multiagency intelligence team. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the second such assessment Jeremiah has been asked to do.  
Last year, he led a review hat found weaknesses in intelligence 
community procedures that contributed to the CIA's failure to 
provide adequate warning that India was about to test a nuclear 
weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Admiral Jeremiah is the perfect person to lead such a  
review,'' Tenet said. ``His credentials are impeccable and 
hcommunity. At issue is whether China gained top-secret know-how on 
building multiple-warhead nuclear is credibility is unquestioned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jeremiah's review team will examine work begun in mid-February  
within the intelligence weapons from a Taiwanese-born scientist who 
worked at Los Alamos. China has yet to field such a weapon, but a 
prototype bears a strong resemblance to the W-88, a U.S. warhead. 
</P>
<P>
	Several members of Congress are pressing for greater disclosure  
and a closer look at high-tech relations between the United States 
and China. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate is holding hearings this week on an alleged 1980s  
case of Chinese spying at the Energy Department's nuclear weapons 
laboratory in Los Alamos, N.M., that only recently came to light. 
In the House, members are demanding that nearly all of a classified 
700-page report on technology transfers to China be made public. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials stood their ground Sunday, saying they  
have dealt properly with the Los Alamos case and overall security 
threats to the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we moved swiftly and I think we continue to impose on  
China the strictest controls,'' national security adviser Sandy 
Berger said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., said President Clinton should  
appoint a nonpartisan commission to investigate allegations that 
China stole nuclear warhead technology. The Justice Department 
``does not have credibility on this issue'' because Attorney 
General Janet Reno refused to seek an independent counsel 
investigation into illegal campaign contributions originating in 
China, he said on CBS' ``Face the Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Dick Lugar, R-Ind., told NBC that the spy case called for a  
serious review of U.S.-Chinese policy, including a warning to China 
that a missile attack on Taiwan would be met with U.S. retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
	Other Republicans said they would fight administration  
resistance to make public almost all of the report on technology 
transfers prepared by a special panel headed by Rep. Christopher 
Cox, R-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will have to have a vote of the House in order to  
declassify that report, and when the American people see what's in 
it, I think they will be really outraged,'' House Majority Whip Tom 
DeLay, R-Texas, said on ``Fox News Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cox, interviewed on ABC's ``This Week,'' said his panel believes  
that ``not only now but for the indefinite future we have serious 
counterintelligence problems at our national laboratories and 
elsewhere throughout the government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ranking Democrat on the panel, Rep. Norm Dicks of  
Washington, said the most important finding was that for 20 years 
``we had a major counterintelligence failure at Los Alamos and at 
the other national labs that is now being corrected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Taiwanese-born computer scientist, Wen Ho Lee, was fired from  
his job at Los Alamos a week ago amid suspicions that he leaked 
secrets to the Chinese in the 1980s. Lee has not been charged with 
any crime, and Newsweek magazine said the FBI now believes it has 
virtually no chance of making a case against him. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI began its investigation in 1996, and Republicans have  
accused the administration of dragging its feet in acting against 
Lee in the interests of U.S.-China relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, appearing on NBC and CNN's  
``Late Edition,'' insisted the administration acted swiftly and 
responsibly. ``I took (Lee's) clearance away, I moved him away from 
sensitive areas long before the story broke,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Energy Department since 1997 has doubled the  
intelligence budget at the national labs, initiated strong 
background checks of scientists from sensitive countries and 
required employees to take polygraph tests. 
</P>
<P>
	National security adviser Berger said there was ``no question''  
that the Chinese did benefit from the flow of nuclear technology in 
the 1980s that is now subject to strict controls. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also said the spying allegations must be seen in the  
context of China's cooperation in such areas as stopping the sales 
of weapons to countries including Iran and dealing with North 
Korea. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most countries are engaged in efforts to obtain American  
sensitive information by clandestine means,'' Berger added. ``The 
world is not a playpen here.''

<HEADLINE> Sen. McCain Slams Clinton Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration's inability to run  
a foreign policy worthy of the world's only superpower has 
endangered national security and left the United States more 
vulnerable to aggression from China, Republican presidential 
hopeful Sen. John McCain said today. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first major foreign policy speech of his emerging  
campaign for the White House, McCain, R-Ariz., also lambasted the 
administration for a lack of long-term strategy in dealing with 
North Korea, Iraq and the recurring violence in the former 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's tendency has been to ``put off resolution of  
the most difficult problems, often substituting photo-op diplomacy 
for meaningful action,'' said McCain, a member of the Senate Armed 
Services Committee and decorated Vietnam War veteran. 
</P>
<P>
	``Often evident in administration policies is a mystifying  
uncertainty about how to act in a world where we are the only 
superpower,'' McCain said in a speech prepared for delivery at 
Kansas State University in Manhattan, Kan. ``Nowhere has this 
confusion been more evident than in our relationship with China.'' 
</P>
<P>
	America must engage China and work toward bringing it into the  
international community, McCain said, but ``we must also prepare 
for the other contingency, that China emerges as the primary threat 
to American interests and values.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has sacrificed national security for the sake  
of engaging China, he contended, and that has ``left the United 
States more vulnerable to a ballistic missile attack.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The White House has drawn fire recently over the  
administration's handling of allegations that China stole missile 
technology from a federal nuclear weapons lab in the 1980s. The 
issue has renewed questions about whether Clinton's policy was 
tainted by alleged illegal campaign contributions and the transfer 
of satellite technology that may have been used by the Chinese 
military. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain, who is expected to formally declare for the GOP  
presidential nomination this spring, gave few specifics of what 
policies his administration would pursue. He did embrace a popular 
defense issue of the moment in Washington, calling for creation of 
a defense against ballistic missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	In a patriotic appeal, McCain called the United States ``the  
indispensable nation because we have proven to be the greatest 
force for good in human history.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he said the United States should never cede its leadership  
in the world to the United Nations. ``It has its uses, but to 
confer on that diverse organization the leading responsibility for 
international stability, freedom and justice will quickly render it 
incapable of any task whatsoever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCain called for a ``rogue state rollback'' policy, which, like  
the so-called Reagan Doctrine, would support ``indigenous and 
outside forces that desire to overthrow the odious regimes that 
rule'' Iraq, North Korea and other ``rogue'' nations. 
</P>
<P>
	And sounding a personal note, McCain said he would bring his  
experience -- as a Navy fighter pilot who was a prisoner of war in 
Vietnam for 5 1/2 years -- to the role of commander in chief. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have seen war. What are today horribly compelling televised  
images were once the whole of reality for me,'' he said. When 
American troops are lost in the service of foreign policy, 
``whether others were involved in the decision or not, the 
president will be lonely man in a dark room when the casualty 
reports come in.''

<HEADLINE> No Decision on NFL Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- If the NFL likes what it has seen and heard from  
Houston so much, why doesn't it just give the Texas city an 
expansion team? Simply because the league would like to see and 
hear the same kind of things from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Team owners on Sunday delayed any decision on where they will  
place a 32nd franchise -- or, indeed, if they will expand anytime 
soon -- even though Houston's bid seems to have all the ingredients. 
What Houston doesn't have is the No. 2 market in the United States, 
something the NFL desperately wants. 
</P>
<P>
	So Los Angeles, despite the presence of competing groups, each  
without a stadium proposal in the same, uh, ballpark with Houston, 
is getting extra time to come up with one. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Los Angeles situation was as far along as Houston's  
situation, we'd come away with a much clearer idea of what will 
happen this week,'' Cleveland Browns president Carmen Policy said. 
``We need a clear relationship with the Los Angeles community and 
the state of California powers that be. I get a sense that the 
stadium plan is not solid in terms of being readily 
implementable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns are the league's 31st team, beginning play this  
season. With an odd number of teams, the schedule gets messy, with 
at least one team off every week -- including the opening weekend 
and the final weekend. Although the 32nd team probably wouldn't 
begin play until 2002, most team owners believe it is imperative 
that the enrollment be expanded. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody who doesn't want a 32nd team isn't looking at it,''  
Steelers president Dan Rooney said. ``We need 32 for the schedule 
and to get eight divisions of four teams.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Jerry Jones, owner of the Dallas Cowboys, isn't so sure  
expansion is a good idea. He wouldn't be surprised if no decision 
is made at these winter meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's understandable to want a team in Los Angeles and  
a team in Houston. It's more a question of the timing and the 
owners and the stadium,'' Jones said. ``We will do the NFL in Los 
Angeles and in Houston. It's just a matter of how we get to that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think LA is such a great market and we ultimately want a  
team there. But there are so many criteria to base it on, so it 
takes time to do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert McNair, who heads Houston's bid for a new team, isn't so  
patient. He even sent a letter to nine teams he claims ``do not 
have advantageous stadium situations'' to express his group's 
interest in buying a current team and moving it to Houston if the 
city doesn't get an expansion franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	He also realizes that further delays in making a decision helps  
Los Angeles, which lost the Rams and Raiders four years ago. 
Houston lost the Oilers to Tennessee after the 1996 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, you've got some owners who do not want to do  
anything, some owners who want to go to Houston ... Some who want 
to wait and see if something can be put together in Los Angeles,'' 
McNair said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to have to get a coalition of at least two of  
those groups in order to come up with the 24 votes. So there has to 
be some type of compromise to resolve the issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chargers owner Alex Spanos sounded ready to vote for Houston,  
also calling on government officials to get involved in the bidding 
by helping finance a new stadium in the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
	``The city of Los Angeles hasn't shown it's ready. I'd like the  
city to get involved,'' Spanos said. ``Look at what Houston's 
done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But is it enough? Nobody will know until Tuesday or Wednesday.  
Maybe. 
</P>
<P>
	McNair, an opera buff, was asked which opera this bidding  
process resembles. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know how most operas end,'' he said. ``It depends if you  
are the stabber or the stabbee.''

<HEADLINE> Landmark D.C. Cafeteria May Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's not quite the Lincoln Memorial, yet  
Sholl's Colonial Cafeteria, as homey as the rich brown gravy it 
serves, is undisputedly a Washington monument -- a place enjoyed by 
thousands of busloads of people who have come on school visits to 
the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Sholl's, where VIPs dine next to the homeless,  
observed its 71st, and perhaps last, anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
	The cafeteria's rent is going up faster than its profits. And  
despite a ``Save Our Sholl's Committee,'' praise from first lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton, who calls it an ``warm and welcoming 
organization,'' a T-shirt campaign and well wishes from longtime 
customers, the cafeteria could soon serve its last slice of rhubarb 
pie. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can't negotiate a lower rent, then come this summer  
we'll be out of business,'' says George Fleishell, the proprietor 
who is 71 years old just like the business. He could move, but that 
would cost up to $1 million. ``I don't have the money and I don't 
have the will to go into that much debt,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleishell, who wears a knife-and-fork tie clip, is the nephew of  
founder Evan Sholl. Since 1928, there have been cafeterias at about 
a dozen locations in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The plainspoken Harry S. Truman ate at Sholl's when he was vice  
president. George Wallace dined there when he ran for president in 
1972. Former President Carter stopped in on a visit to Washington. 
Art Buchwald has eaten at the cafeteria. Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., 
is a loyal patron. 
</P>
<P>
	Today there's only one Sholl's. It's in the basement of a modern  
office high-rise about five blocks from the White House. The 
building, owned by Asian businessmen, is represented by Cushman &AMP; 
Wakefield, which did not return phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Fleishell says the landlord wants to raise the monthly rent from  
$20,000 to $24,000. That's 2,286 more plates of Sholl's $1.75 
meatloaf. 
</P>
<P>
	``My favorite Pennsylvania lunch: Meatloaf with smothered  
onions. I love it,'' exclaimed former Pennsylvania Congressman Fred 
Rooney, who stopped in for lunch on Monday. He got out of there for 
under $4. 
</P>
<P>
	A trendy, high-priced eatery it's not. Roast beef is $2.65. Beef  
stew is just a dime more. Liver and onions is $2.25. There's soup, 
salad, vegetables, fruit and nine kinds of pie. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like plain ordinary cooking and that's what they've got,''  
says Helen Gant, who started eating at Sholl's in the late 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
	No one leaves hungry. Not even the hungry.  
</P>
<P>
	A few years ago, Michael Kirwan, founder of the Llewellyn Scott  
Catholic Worker House of Hospitality, gave $5,000 to the cafeteria, 
printed $12 tan-colored meal tickets and began passing them out to 
poor people on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somehow that $5,000 check never seemed to run out,'' Kirwan  
said. ``The stories I've heard from people on the streets, their 
quiet moments of dignity, respect, warmth and a full and nourishing 
meal at the hands of this wonderful cafeteria could fill a book of 
essays.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the bill was under $12, the cafeteria credited Kirwan's  
account. But when they ate more than $12, the cafeteria, despite 
its financial troubles, absorbed the loss. 
</P>
<P>
	``They do a little,'' Fleishell says modestly as he stuffs the  
tickets back in a safe. ``And we do a little.''

<HEADLINE> Gephardt Backs Gore in 2000 Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore secured the  
endorsement today of House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt in a sign 
that top Democrats would like to settle the presidential nomination 
early and focus on winning in November 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt, who decided on Feb. 3 that he would not seek the  
presidency himself, announced his endorsement in Manchester, N.H. -- 
the first stop on Gore's first official political trip of his 
presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm here today because I want to make my fight putting Al Gore  
in the presidency of the United States,'' Gephardt told a 
boisterous rally of 400 activists. ``We would all be proud to have 
him as president of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With a row of American flags as a backdrop, Gore replied in  
kind: ``We are going to make Dick Gephardt the next speaker of the 
House of Representatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was headed next to Iowa and St. Louis, Gephardt's hometown,  
before returning to Washington late tonight. ``I'm going to be back 
early and often,'' Gore promised the New Hampshire rally in a 
cramped auditorium. A huge banner read: ``New Hampshire welcomes 
the next president of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt would have been a formidable rival for the nomination  
but decided he stood a better chance of helping Democrats seize the 
House of Representatives in 2000 and become speaker. At a 
Democratic unity rally two weeks ago, Gephardt and Gore hugged on 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's huge,'' Gore spokesman Chris Lehane said of the  
endorsement. ``Obviously, having Congressman Gephardt's support is 
very welcome. The unity that this is going to bring to our effort 
will be extremely helpful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, hoping to begin stepping outside President Clinton's  
shadow, was visiting New Hampshire and Iowa on a one-day swing 
today to address supporters in states that are critical to winning 
the Democratic nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's only announced opponent for the nomination is former New  
Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, although civil-rights activist Jesse 
Jackson is considering the race. Opting out in recent weeks in 
addition to Gephardt were three senators who could have offered 
stiff challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, a Hall of Fame basketball player, says he can beat Gore  
one-on-one and win the general election. 
</P>
<P>
	He hopes to capitalize on Democrats' concern about Gore's poll  
numbers. Although the vice president is maintaining a healthy lead 
over Bradley among Democratic voters, he is not fairing as well 
against Republican favorite George W. Bush in public opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore says he's not worried about polls conducted ``four  
lifetimes'' before the election. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I were the Gore campaign I would be concerned,'' said  
Democratic consultant David Axelrod of Chicago. ``But I wouldn't 
panic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic operatives say Gore's two biggest challenges are  
showing that he can be a leader after years as Clinton's understudy 
and convincing Americans that he cares about their problems. 
</P>
<P>
	With those goals in mind, Gore planned to roll out a new stump  
speech to promote initiatives not necessarily part of the 
administration agenda. Promising to make ``revolutionary changes in 
our schools,'' he was calling for reduced class sizes in all 
grades. Clinton had focused on elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president also wants to make preschool available  
everywhere in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore is staking out territory in poll-tested health care issues,  
promising more preventive care options. ``Instead of more breast 
cancer tomorrow, let's have more mammograms today. Instead of more 
low-birth-weight babies tomorrow, let's have more prenatal care 
today. Instead of more sick children tomorrow, let's have more 
immunizations today,'' his stump speech says. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Gore worked from the White House to lay claim to a  
series of bite-size initiatives popular among suburban voters, such 
as promising to ease traffic jams. Fine ideas, Democrats say, but 
he needs to leave Washington to promote his own agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure about that ribbon-cutting strategy. That one  
makes me nervous,'' Axelrod said. ``I think it just underscores the 
second-banana thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the disease that all vice presidents have: You cannot  
be seen as a strong, decisive leader when you're the second man on 
the totem pole,'' said Democratic pollster Mark Mellman. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's biggest advantage, the support of a popular president,  
was being put on display today as he continued to collect 
endorsements from party stalwarts. Bill Shaheen, husband of New 
Hampshire Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, will formally join the Gore team. In 
Iowa, 70 prominent Democrats are set to side with the vice 
president. Gov. Shaheen and Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack are still 
neutral. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans say Gore won't escape Clinton's policies or  
controversies. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is the Velcro to Clinton's Teflon,'' said GOP media  
strategist Alex Castellanos. ``A lot of problems that slide off of 
Clinton stick to Gore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore proved last week that is prone to gaffes of his own. He  
claimed that he created the Internet, giving Republicans reason to 
howl. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore has done political chores on previous trips, but this is  
the first one in which his campaign organization will pick up part 
of the tab.

<HEADLINE> Bucks Fined for Comments by Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NBA fined the Milwaukee Bucks $25,000 today  
for comments head coach George Karl made about the Seattle 
SuperSonics, the team he formerly coached. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl's comments about Sonics general manager Wally Walker  
appeared in the March 10 edition of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Wally totally discontinued the communication,'' Karl said.  
``He said it's because I talk too much. I say it's because he's 
incompetent. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were very few negative things negative about Seattle  
outside of Wally. I believe in doing the right things and I don't 
think he does. He's a politician. He's a trickster. And that's 
opposite of how I handle my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SuperSonics fired Karl last summer despite a sixth straight  
50-win season after another playoff run fell short of the title. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl signed a four-year, $20 million deal with the Milwaukee  
Bucks in August. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know what they try to do,'' Karl said before Monday night's  
game between the Bucks and the New York Knicks in Milwaukee. ``I 
think they try to protect the league, and if they felt I was 
hurting the league, I'm sorry that they felt that way. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that makes me sad is that I think I said 90 percent  
awful positive things about my time in Seattle and about the team 
there because I have a lot of love for the team,'' Karl said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's one human being there that I have problems with,'' he  
said, and ``I guess they don't want me talking about that.''

<HEADLINE> Women Debate Breast Implant Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Women who sued Dow Corning Corp. over the  
silicone it manufactured for breast implants face a vote on the 
proposed $3.2 billion settlement plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The claimants, who number in the tens of thousands, have 60 days  
to decide. A packet explaining the deal along with a ballot is 
being mailed to claimants. The ballot must returned by May 14. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Corning said Monday it would spend $12 million to inform  
women about the settlement. It has set up a call center to handle 
questions about the plan. The center of 200 people will answer 
questions in 30 languages from 8 a.m. until midnight EST. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement is the cornerstone of a $4.5 billion bankruptcy  
reorganization plan, which details how Dow Corning will pay off 
about 570,000 creditors, about 170,000 of whom are women who sued. 
</P>
<P>
	Dow Corning filed for bankruptcy under the weight of the breast  
implant suits. Among the other creditors are banks who hold Dow 
Corning's debt, insurance companies, doctors and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur Spector will hold hearings in June  
on whether the plan should be approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposed settlement, women who blame illnesses on Dow  
Corning silicone breast implants could get between $12,000 and 
$300,000 each. Women could also receive up to $25,000 for ruptured 
or leaking implants, and up to $5,000 for implant removal. 
</P>
<P>
	Women who have no problems with Dow Corning implants but still  
filed claims against the company could also settle for $2,000 with 
no questions asked. The plan allows women who joined the case to 
file claims for 15 years after it goes into effect, and also offers 
payments to people who had other types of silicone implants. 
</P>
<P>
	Women outside the United States would be paid 40 percent to 65  
percent less for their claims, depending on where they live. Dow 
Corning said that was due to lower medical costs and different 
economic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	And for those who reject the money and still want to sue, Dow  
Corning would set aside up to $400 million to cover any costs of 
defending such lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for Dow Corning and breast implant plaintiffs said the  
settlement was the best they could do. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan ``is the result of intensive, often acrimonious  
negotiations stretching over a long period of time,'' said 
plaintiffs lawyer Ralph Knowles. 
</P>
<P>
	``There had to be compromise in order to come to some conclusion  
to this litigation in a reasonable period of time,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The creditors are divided into several classes. For the  
bankruptcy plan to be approved, a majority of the creditors in each 
class must approve it, and they would have to represent two-thirds 
of the claims in that group. 
</P>
<P>
	While Dow Corning still contends breast implants are safe, ``in  
the end, both sides believed it was far wiser to agree to disagree 
and find common ground,'' said company spokeswoman Barbara 
Carmichael. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys fees would be capped to between 10 and 30 percent of a  
woman's award, with the percentage increasing with the size of the 
award. 
</P>

	CIA To Probe China Spy Allegations  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The CIA said today it will investigate whether  
China obtained nuclear weapons secrets through a suspected spy at 
Los Alamos National Laboratory. CIA Director George Tenet said 
retired Adm. David Jeremiah will independently review the findings 
of a multi-agency intelligence team. Last year, Jeremiah oversaw a 
review that found weaknesses in procedures that contributed to the 
CIA's failure to provide adequate warning that India was about to 
test a nuclear weapon.

agree or face NATO's military wrath. The French and British foreign 
ministers praised the decision by the Kosovo Albanians and said it 
will heighten pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to 
accept the deal, which calls for NATO troops to enforce it.

his 2000 presidential campaign, secured the endorsements today of 
House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt and party stalwarts from the 
early battleground states of New Hampshire and Iowa. Gephardt's 
announcement reflects the desire of top Democrats to settle the 
presidential nomination early and set their sights on winning both 
the House and White House in November 2000. Former New Jersey Sen. 
Bill Bradley is the only announced challenger for the party's 
presidential nomination.

a fifth term. During his tenure, he earned a record that 
consistently won the praise of national environmental groups. He's 
bucked GOP orthodoxy on issues ranging from abortion to health

against the navigator of the jet that sliced an Italian ski gondola 
cable last year and killed 20 people. Capt. Joseph Schweitzer will 
be tried only on charges of obstructing justice and conspiracy to 
obstruct justice when his court-martial begins Thursday. The 
decision come after a Marine jury on March 4 cleared Capt. Richard 
Ashby, the pilot of the EA-6B Prowler, of similar charges. Ashby

	Cancer Tumor Enzyme Is Found

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a dramatic advance, researchers have found  
an enzyme that helps build blood vessels that feed growth of cancer 
tumors. Researchers report finding -- on the surface of cells inside 
blood vessels -- ATP synthase. The enzyme apparently provides the 
energy for the growth of blood vessels, said Dr. Salvatore V. Pizzo 
of the Duke University team, the co-author of a study appearing 
tomorrow in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 
Without such energy, he said, tumors can never grow beyond the size 
of a pin head.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Analysts say the most common method used to  
fix computers vulnerable to Year 2000 glitches is only a short-term 
remedy and advocates of the technique say it will need other costly 
repairs or replacements within a generation. One expert describes 
computers already fixed with the technique called ``windowing'' as 
``little ticking time bombs waiting to go off.'' It's being used 
because it saves money and experts hope it will prove adequate 
until these computers are replaced -- or until programmers can 
devote enough time and money to make permanent repairs.

<HEADLINE> El Paso Energy Buys Sonat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Natural gas supplier El Paso Energy  
Corp. is buying Sonat Inc. for $3.9 billion in stock, extending its 
reach deeper into the Southeast. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced today gives Houston-based El Paso Energy the  
ability to ship gas through pipelines from supply fields in 
California and Texas to growing Southern markets, especially 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``New gas-fueled power generation development is particularly  
active in these areas,'' said El Paso Energy chief executive 
William A. Wise. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company will have some 40,000 miles of pipeline  
transporting nearly one-fourth of all the natural gas moved in the 
United States each day. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to swapping stock, El Paso Energy will assume some  
$1.9 billion in Sonat debt. 
</P>
<P>
	El Paso Energy chief financial officer H. Brent Austin said the  
merger includes 1.6 trillion cubic feet of gas or equivalent 
reserves held by Sonat. The company's Southern operations 
previously were centered around Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co., one of 
five subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors reacted favorably to the deal, with share prices in El  
Paso Energy rising $1.16 to $35.75 a share in early trading on the 
New York Stock Exchange. Sonat was unchanged from Friday's closing 
price of $30.16 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	El Paso Energy has about 3,600 employees compared to about 1,900  
for Sonat. The merged company will retain the El Paso Energy name 
and be headquartered in Houston, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	Sonat is currently based in Birmingham, and the headquarters of  
Sonat's interstate pipeline, Southern Natural Gas Company, will 
remain there. 
</P>
<P>
	Wise will continue as CEO. Sonat chief executive Ronald L. Kuehn  
Jr. will become chairman of the board until Dec. 31, 2000 for the 
merged company, which will have directors from both companies. 
</P>
<P>
	El Paso Energy has more than $10 billion in assets. Sonat's  
assets are valued at $4.4 billion.

<HEADLINE> Dem. Convention Brings $140M to L.A. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- When the gavel bangs down to open the  
Democratic National Convention next year, Southern California's 
hospitality industry will be listening for a different sound: the 
ringing of cash registers. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats' decision to bring their national convention to Los  
Angeles will mean an infusion of more than $140 million to the area 
economy and the opportunity to showcase the city's attractions to 
thousands of journalists from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	The convention in the new Staples Sports Arena is expected to  
attract more than 20,000 people, including 5,000 delegates and 
about 15,000 reporters, photographers, editors and news 
technicians. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be a big pop for the hospitality industry,''  
said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles Economic 
Development Corp. ``But the dollar impact is much larger than $140 
million. The idea is you're getting national and international 
exposure. It's one of a few plum events you would like to bring to 
your city.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the convention, visitors will rent about 20,000 hotel  
rooms and consume hundreds of thousands of meals and beverages at 
Los Angeles-area restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
	The $140 million, a figure provided by the Democratic National  
Committee, only includes money paid by delegates and the news media 
for hotels, food and incidental expenses. More will be spent on 
support services, such as electricians, technicians, carpenters, 
florists and caterers who will be hired to handle evening parties 
that follow the daily convention activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you work strictly on a delegate basis, you miss a lot of  
things,'' said Michael Collins, executive vice president of the Los 
Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau. ``There's probably a 
significantly larger number. It's extremely hard to pin down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Delegates will be housed in hotels throughout the Los Angeles  
area, but they will spend most of their time in the Staples Center, 
the $350 million, 20,000-seat arena under construction on the 
southern edge of downtown. The arena is scheduled to be completed 
in October, nearly a year before the convention opens in August 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	In the big picture, revenue generated by the convention will be  
small. Los Angeles County's annual gross domestic product is 
estimated at $282 billion. But if the right impressions are made on 
the visitors, the convention could lead to many millions of dollars 
more in future convention and tourist business. 
</P>
<P>
	Some downtown business already are preparing to attract their  
share of the business. At the Kachina Grill, a popular lunch and 
dinner spot about six blocks from the arena, general manager 
Alfredo Cepeda is hoping for a boost in business. 
</P>
<P>
	Cepeda plans to expand evening hours to lure delegates in for  
drinks and dinner after late convention sessions. He also is making 
arrangements to participate in a shuttle service that will bring 
convention goers near his restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	``It definitely should help us out. I'm already advertising with  
them and in several magazines,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Rises 6 in Early Trading / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices have opened slightly higher. The  
Dow Jones industrial average is up six points in today's early 
going. Advancers on the New York Stock Exchange hold an 11-10 lead 
over decliners. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Composite Index is up eleven points and the S&AMP;P 500  
Index is up one point. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not yet clear whether the Dow has designs on the 10,000  
level this week. 
</P>
<P>
	But many long-time market-watchers say it's only a matter of  
time before it does clear the mark. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow came within 42 points of 10,000 on Friday, before

<HEADLINE> Canada Stock Exchanges Consolidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Canada's four stock exchanges announced a major  
consolidation today which will make the Toronto Stock Exchange the 
sole market for trading in shares of blue-chip companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Montreal Exchange will cede the market share it had -- about  
10 percent -- and instead concentrate on futures and options 
trading, with Toronto transferring to Montreal its share of that 
growing niche market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Vancouver and Alberta stock exchanges will merge to create a  
single Canadian market for smaller companies. The Winnipeg Stock 
Exchange will be invited to participate. 
</P>
<P>
	The move underscored a long, slow decline in influence for the  
125-year-old Montreal Exchange, the first, and for years the 
dominant, stock market in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	The exchange president, Gerald Lacoste, told a Montreal news  
conference that ``we have to face reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We could not continue to justify the dual expenses'' of two  
exchanges doing the same thing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lacoste said the changes could take 15 to 20 months to complete,  
and require approvals by provincial securities commissions and 
exchange members. 
</P>
<P>
	No decision has been made on where the new national junior  
equities market will be headquartered, although it will be based in 
Western Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	It will have around 3,000 listings, including some 2,600 from  
the Vancouver and Alberta exchanges and others transferred from 
Montreal.

<HEADLINE> Communities Sue Over Crack Epidemic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- City residents who claim the federal  
government did nothing to stop crack cocaine sales in their 
neighborhoods in the 1980s sued the CIA and Justice Department on 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaints were filed on behalf of mostly black residents  
whose babies were born addicted to crack, whose relatives died in 
drug-related drive-by shootings and whose communities were affected 
by crowded emergency rooms and gutted business districts, the 
lawsuit said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not some sort of litigation lottery ticket,'' attorney  
Katya Komisaruk said. ``The government contributed to what happened 
to us, so now we need the government to come and help us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The federal civil rights lawsuits, filed in Oakland and Los  
Angeles, were partially prompted by last year's disclosure of a 
1982 agreement between the late CIA Director William Casey and 
former Attorney General William French Smith that the spy agency 
had no duty to report drug crimes to the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Komisaruk said she wants a judge to declare the agreement  
illegal, order the CIA and Justice Department to report crimes they 
are aware of and issue reparations to cities affected by cocaine 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department officials had not reviewed the lawsuit and  
will not comment on it until Tuesday, spokesman David Slade said. 
The CIA did not return a telephone message left by The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The complaints are the latest result of a 1996 San Jose Mercury  
News series that claimed a drug ring funneled profits to the 
Nicaraguan Contra rebels for the better part of a decade. The 
series traced the drugs to traffickers who were also leaders of a 
CIA-run guerrilla army in Nicaragua during the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The executive editor of the Mercury News later acknowledged in a  
letter to readers that the series had shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
	Last summer, an 800-page internal Justice Department report  
exonerated the department and the CIA.

<HEADLINE> Airlines Stocks Soar on Price Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Analysts say some of the blame for the latest  
round of airfare hikes can be placed on rising fuel costs, though 
high demand for tickets is just as important a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the weekend, the airline industry upped their business  
fares about 1 percent and their leisure fares by about 3 percent, 
the second price increase this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they continue with this momentum, we could see the highest  
rates in many moons,'' said Tom Parsons, editor of Best Fares 
Discount Travel Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines started the latest round of increases last  
Thursday with a 1 percent increase in business fares and 3 percent 
for leisure travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	Airfare increases by an individual airline usually don't stick  
unless other major competitors follow suit, which is exactly what 
happened over the weekend. The increases come on top of those 
imposed in late January. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, a flight from New York to Los Angeles booked 21  
days in advance that cost $562 on Jan. 1 now costs $602, according 
to Bestfares.com, Parsons' Web site. The same flight booked on 
short notice -- as many business travelers do -- rose from $1,836 to 
$1,890. 
</P>
<P>
	The airlines have now boosted leisure fares 7 percent this year  
and business fares are up 3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	American Airlines played down fuel costs -- which remain quite  
low-- as the major reason for the increase. 
</P>
<P>
	``Certainly that was a factor, but we were matching the  
others,'' said American spokesman Bill Dreslin. 
</P>
<P>
	Jet fuel cost about 36 cents a gallon in the first week of  
March, said a report from the securities firm BT Alex. Brown Inc. 
That's up 7 percent from the previous week, but still down 19 
percent from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're starting to see a little bit of a creep back up,'' said  
Southwest spokeswoman Beth Harbin, without providing specifics. 
</P>
<P>
	The airlines have made five attempts to raise prices so far in  
1999 after relative stability for about 18 months. The air carriers 
were unable to increase prices primarily because Northwest Airlines 
was holding out. Northwest has been having labor problems with 
flight attendants and mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
	This time around, Northwest matched the rise on Saturday night.  
</P>
<P>
	While business travel ticket prices have been rising during the  
last three years, most advance-purchase tickets have fallen, 
meaning average prices have been somewhat stable. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong U.S. economy has kept demand up among business  
travelers and vacationers and airline profits high. 
</P>
<P>
	US Airways, for instance, filled a record 73 percent of its  
seats last year. The industry average was 62 percent in 1990, 
according the Air Transport Association, a trade group, but the 
average has increased steadily through the decade. In 1997, the 
average hit 70 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	After a slowdown in the last quarter of 1998, some analysts  
worried that the industry might be in for trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, however, UAL Corp. said its earnings per share would  
be about $1.35 for the first quarter, well above analyst 
predictions of $1.12 as compiled by the research firm First Call. 
Annual profits will be between $10 and $12 a share, UAL said, while 
analysts expected $9.12. 
</P>
<P>
	UAL, the parent company of United, said that economic  
uncertainty present in the fourth-quarter had dissipated. 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy passenger demand has meant few empty middle seats and few  
alternatives for passengers when a flight was canceled. Passengers 
have been increasingly unhappy with service. 
</P>
<P>
	During a recent snowstorm more than 4,500 travelers were  
stranded by Northwest for up to 8 1/2 hours aboard 34 planes unable to 
take off or reach passenger gates. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then several bills that would strengthen the rights of air  
travelers have been debated in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	The industry is acting to relieve the pressure by buying more  
planes. Even more capacity is expected by this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Investments like new planes keep up the pressure on airlines to  
raise fares or face lower profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``We continue to be concerned about the sizable amount of  
capacity growth that we expect the majors to have in third quarter 
'99,'' said Susan Donofrio, an analyst with BT Alex. Brown.

<HEADLINE> Kerry Wood To Get MRI on Elbow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MESA, Ariz. (AP) -- Kerry Wood's elbow hurt, and Cubs' fans  
immediately felt the pain. 
</P>
<P>
	The NL Rookie of the Year, a key to the Cubs' pennant hopes,  
headed back to Chicago today for tests, not knowing how seriously 
his arm was injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yesterday was a rough day,'' Cubs manager Jim Riggleman said  
before today's game against the Oakland Athletics. ``We just 
crossed some fingers and hoped the news was not going to be bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood's test results are not expected until Tuesday, the Cubs  
said. He threw 26 pitches Saturday against Anaheim, just 10 for 
strikes. During one stretch in the second of his two innings, he 
threw 10 consecutive pitches out of the strike zone, with catcher 
Tyler Houston leaping up to catch some. He didn't strike out 
anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was after the first inning,'' Wood said Sunday after a  
sleepless night. ``My first warmup pitch, Tyler hardly got a glove 
on it. I felt it a little bit but kept going. The velocity was 
still there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, who didn't mention any pain when he spoke with reporters  
after the game, was examined Sunday by Anaheim team physician Dr. 
Lewis Yocum, who endorsed the decision to have him go back home for 
an MRI and an exam by Cubs physician Dr. Micheal Shafer. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago hopes the pain resulted from scar tissue and that the  
exam will show no ligament damage. Wood missed all of September 
last year because of a sore elbow, then returned for the Cubs' 
final game of the season, a loss to Atlanta in Game 3 of the NL 
division series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just being conservative,'' Cubs president Andy MacPhail  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cubs general manager Ed Lynch said Wood threw about 96 mph  
Saturday. It was Lynch who made the announcement, saying Wood 
``felt significant discomfort.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago knows that elbow pain probably will always be an issue  
with Wood, as it is with most power pitchers. Cubs pitching coach 
Marty DeMerritt has been working to alter Wood's delivery this 
spring, trying to lessen the strain on the elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	``A couple of pitches, he got across himself a little bit,''  
DeMerritt said. ``Last year, he was throwing across his body all 
the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wood, a 21-year-old right-hander, was 13-6 with a 3.40 ERA and  
233 strikeouts in 166 2-3 innings last year. On May 6, in just his 
fifth career start, he struck out 20 against Houston, tying Roger 
Clemens' record for a nine-inning game. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago didn't make any big additions during the offseason. If  
Wood is sidelined for any lengthy period, it will damage the Cubs' 
chances to win a pennant for the first time since 1945. 
</P>
<P>
	Wood already was getting a late start following two  
hospitalizations this spring to treat an upper respiratory and 
gastrointestinal illness. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whatever it is, it has got to be taken care of,'' DeMerritt  
said. ``The sooner the better.''

<HEADLINE> Mass. Parishioners Evicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROCKTON, Mass. (AP) -- A dispute over gay rights has put a  
priest and his parishioners who oppose same-sex marriages on the 
street, so the evicted congregation held services right on the 
sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Thomas Morris and about a dozen members of his flock  
prayed outside Sunday, despite their eviction Friday by a judge in 
their ongoing dispute with the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	Morris and his congregation at St. Paul's Church opposed the  
diocese's 1994 decision to sanction same-sex unions and ordain 
noncelibate homosexuals as priests. In opposition, the congregation 
began withholding fees it was bound to pay the diocese. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may have lost access to our church building, but we have  
not lost faith,'' Morris said. ``In the end, Jesus wins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The church changed. It's not the same one that taught me when  
I was a child,'' Sybil Hambly of Brockton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Diocese officials maintained the dispute was not about beliefs  
or issues. ``What this is about is this church needs a priest in 
good standing with the bishop and other churches in the diocese,'' 
said the Rev. Donald Parker, the diocese vicar. The diocese is 
overseen by Bishop Thomas Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
	In Friday's decision, Judge Charles J. Hely said his ruling  
settled a legal issue about property, not a religious issue. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Morris' predecessor at St. Paul's, the Rev. James R.  
Hiles, was defrocked after the diocese found him guilty of sexual 
misconduct. But many members of the church stand by Hiles, and say 
the charges against him were concocted as punishment for his stance 
against homosexuality.

<HEADLINE> $3B Left Unspent From Welfare Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With welfare rolls at a 30-year low, states  
have yet to spend some $3 billion of federal welfare money. 
Congressional Republicans are seizing on the figures released 
Monday to argue that new money is not needed for child care and 
other services. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Congress overhauled the nation's welfare system, giving  
states a total of $16.5 billion each year rather than money for 
each person who needs public assistance as it did for 61 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Ways and Means Committee said in a statement that  
states have a total of $6.2 billion in unspent welfare money, but 
that counts funds states have already obligated for specific 
payments. Counting only unobligated money, the total is just over 
$3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	States say they need to save the unspent money in case of an  
economic downturn and to provide special services to people with 
the most problems who will be toughest to move off welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans agree it is time to turn attention to such people.  
</P>
<P>
	``The next phase of welfare reform is the key to permanently  
lifting more families from poverty and giving them opportunities 
for brighter futures,'' Rep. Nancy L. Johnson, R-Conn., chairwoman 
of the committee's welfare panel, said in a statement Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson released a report by the Congressional Research Service  
detailing the unspent money. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans argue that states have enough money without new  
spending proposed by President Clinton. In his budget, Clinton 
seeks billions of dollars to provide more child care and to offer 
job training for those hardest to remove from the welfare rolls. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd like to understand the president's reasoning, especially  
in light of the fact that they'll get another $16.5 billion next 
year,'' said Ways and Means spokesman Trent Duffy. 
</P>
<P>
	There are proposals to cut that spending, too, although states  
argue the funding level was a promise made during the 1996 welfare 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
	House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, R-Ohio, has said he  
will propose cutting welfare money because caseloads have dropped 
so fast -- an idea states have vigorously protested. 
</P>
<P>
	State welfare balances vary widely. New York has the most  
unspent money -- $689 million, and Pennsylvania is No. 2 with $245 
million. But many states have nothing left over, including Alaska, 
Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Oregon, Virginia and 
Wyoming.

<HEADLINE> Food Council Releases Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A White House food safety task force fell  
short of embracing a recommendation by the National Academy of 
Sciences to create a single food safety chief in a report Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the President's Council on Food Safety, made up of  
officials from the departments of Agriculture, Commerce and Health 
and Human Services, said it would continue to study structural 
models that could ``strengthen the federal food safety system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the panel made clear that establishing a single food safety  
voice within government poses challenges due to the overlapping of 
many areas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Foodborne disease problems may also be waterborne disease  
problems,'' the council wrote. ``Other programs, particularly 
research and education programs for food safety, often do not 
operate as separate activities within the agencies but rather draw 
on the strength from one another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NAS in August issued a report saying that ``Congress should  
establish a unified, central framework for managing food safety 
programs, headed by one official with control of resources for all 
federal food safety activities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The council was created by President Clinton days after that  
report to review its findings and develop a national strategy. Work 
on a comprehensive strategy is already under way, the council said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAS report gave examples such as a food safety council with  
a chair appointed by the president with control of all resources, a 
lead agency for food safety and an independent food safety agency 
at Cabinet level. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics, including some lawmakers and consumer groups, have  
complained about the current fragmented system of 12 agencies with 
various food safety issues. 
</P>
<P>
	Most food safety responsibilities are handled by the Agriculture  
Department, which is in charge of meat and poultry and certain 
fresh produce issues, and the Food and Drug Administration, which 
oversees other foods. But agencies like the Environmental 
Protection Agency and Commerce Department also have a role. 
</P>
<P>
	``The council is confident that its comprehensive strategic plan  
will be a major step toward creating a seamless food safety 
system,'' the report said, adding that it also wants to ensure that 
federal food safety statutes are based on scientific evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials have been moving the food safety system toward more of  
a scientific-based program. Last year, the government instituted 
the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points program, which 
places checks for things like proper temperature and fecal 
contamination in the meat production system. Before, plants only 
poked carcasses for visual signs of disease. 
</P>
<P>
	While U.S. food is considered the world's safest, up to 9,000  
Americans die every year from food poisoning and millions are 
sickened.

<HEADLINE>  Pippen Searches for Offensive Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Scottie Pippen didn't expect to feel comfortable  
immediately with the Houston Rockets' offense. But he didn't expect 
to be a virtual spectator 22 games into the season, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen is getting more frustrated as his offensive production  
diminishes. The Rockets mostly pound the ball inside to Charles 
Barkley and Hakeem Olajuwon rather than run the ball, which Pippen 
prefers. . 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, who signed a five-year, $67.5 million contract in  
January, took only five shots and scored four points in 35 minutes 
Sunday during a 104-90 loss to the Phoenix Suns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm frustrated,'' Pippen said. ``Playing the minutes I'm  
playing, I'm not involved in the offense. It makes the game not fun 
anymore. My next step is to find why this organization wanted me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen is averaging 40.6 minutes per game, fourth in the NBA,  
but he doesn't believe the Rockets are getting the most from his 
talents. Against the Suns, Barkley took 21 shots and Olajuwon 14. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to get everybody involved,'' Pippen said. ``We have to  
make the game fun for everybody. There are nights when things are 
not going right. It's time to go to somebody else and get somebody 
else involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen had similar comments following Saturday night's 100-89  
victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers when he had only one point in 
the first half but ended up with 16 points and 10 assists. The 
Rockets might have lost without his second half spurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Against the Cavaliers, Pippen was 4-for-11 from the field and  
Olajuwon was 11-of-19. Pippen is averaging 15 points, 5.6 assists 
and 7.5 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been difficult for me,'' Pippen said. ``It's going to be  
hard for me to find myself in this offense. They've built the 
offense around getting the ball in to Charles and Hakeem. For me to 
get shots, that's not going to happen often.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen was accustomed to the consistency of the Chicago Bulls,  
where he was the sidekick for Michael Jordan. The Bulls won six NBA 
championships in Pippen's 11 years with the team. Pippen is not a 
pivotal part of the Rockets' offense and some of his teammates are 
aware of that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to do a better job of diversifying,'' Barkley  
said. ``We've got to do a better job of getting it to Scottie and 
Michael Dickerson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets have struggled to get all their all-star parts  
working together. They've beaten only two teams with winning 
records, but guard Brent Price has seen glimpses of what the 
complete offense can do. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had moments where we clicked on all cylinders and that  
is exciting to see,'' Price said. ``If we ever get into the flow, 
we can be dangerous. You don't just have a bunch of good 
individuals show up and be a good team. It takes time to learn each 
other and come together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen is awaiting more of those moments.  
</P>
<P>
	``If the opportunities are there, I try to take advantage of  
them,'' Pippen said. ``I am more accustomed to getting some 
(chances) throughout the game to see where my rhythm is from an 
offensive standpoint. You have to be patient.''

<HEADLINE> Missionaries Accused in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The leader of an Indianapolis-based  
missionary group says that its members' only goal was to deliver 
Bibles, medicine, clothing and seed to the people of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities in Zimbabwe, however, said the group's real mission  
was more sinister: aiding Congolese rebels while committing 
espionage, terrorism and sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
	Jonathan Wallace, leader of Harvestfield Ministries, denied  
those charges during a weekend interview at his home in 
Indianapolis. He said he and other members did carry weapons -- but 
only for protection -- and that they never fired them in the Congo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We preached, we drilled water wells, and did lots of other  
missionary work there... We now have hundreds of Christians and 
preachers there,'' Wallace said. 
</P>
<P>
	While Wallace spoke in the United States, three Harvestfield  
members, including Wallace's son-in-law, remained jailed Sunday in 
Zimbabwe. All were being held without bail on charges that could 
bring them life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The men were taken into custody March 7 in Zimbabwe when, as  
they boarded a flight for Switzerland, a gun activated an airport 
metal detector. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said a search of their pickup truck at the airport  
later turned up assault and sniper rifles, shotguns, a light 
machine gun, hand guns, firearms, telescopic sights, knives, 
camouflage cream, two-way radios and ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace readily acknowledged members of his group had shipped  
guns when they moved to Africa from Canby, Ore., and built their 
mission in late 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of us packed all the property we owned and necessities we  
needed, including guns. The guns were bolt-action hunting rifles 
with scopes, pistols, but no automatic weapons,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Zimbabwean prosecutors claim the three were funneling arms  
to rebels involved in an eight-month civil war to topple Congolese 
President Laurent Kabila. Zimbabwe has been supporting Kabila with 
troops and weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercenaries in Africa often pose as missionaries in order to  
mask arms shipments and travel unhindered. But Wallace said his 
son-in law, Joseph Wendell Pettijohn, 35, and the other two -- John 
Lamonte Dixon, 39, and Gary George Blanchard, 34 -- were the real 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are not guilty of any espionage. They are not guilty of  
any assassination plots.'' said Wallace. ``No one in my 
organization has ever served in the military. We are religious 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace said he formed Harvestfield as a non-denominational  
Christian organization about nine years ago. While independent, the 
group is supported financially by individuals and by a number of 
churches, including congregations of the Assembly of God, the 
Church of God and independent churches, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A newsletter published by the organization at that time told  
readers the group was moving to Congo, ``only because it is God's 
will for our lives.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- An Amtrak train slammed into a truck  
loaded with steel bars at a crossing Monday night, causing several 
cars and engines to derail and starting a fire. At least 30 people 
were injured, some critically. 
</P>
<P>
	The train's engines and passenger cars were scattered over the  
tracks, with smoke pouring from the wreckage two hours after the 
crash. 
</P>
<P>
	An Amtrak manager of operations in Wilmington, Del., who would  
not give her name said two engines overturned and four passenger 
cars derailed and were still upright. 
</P>
<P>
	About 200 emergency workers were on the scene, climbing on top  
of the overturned cars and working through twisted metal to rescue 
trapped passengers. One of the cars was burning and Amtrak said one 
engine was on fire. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear how many people were on board.  
</P>
<P>
	Becky Wilder, a spokeswoman for St. Mary's Hospital in nearby  
Kankakee, said 23 people had been brought to the hospital and more 
were coming in. Six were in critical condition, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A nursing supervisor at Riverside Medical Center in Kankakee  
said seven victims had been brought to that hospital so far, 
including one person with an amputated foot and another with head 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Ed St. Louis, captain of Bourbonnais Fire Protection District,  
said the tractor-trailer that collided with the train came out of 
the nearby Birmingham Steel Company and was loaded with steel bars 
used for reinforcing concrete. 
</P>
<P>
	The City of New Orleans train was bound for New Orleans from  
Chicago. A dispatcher with the Bourbonnais Police Department said 
the collision happened around 9:40 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak spokeswoman Debbie Hare said the train consisted of two  
engines and 14 passengers cars. She did not know the exact number 
of passengers on board.

<HEADLINE> Jackson, Best Accept Bench Roles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Mark Jackson and Travis Best are  
competitors, so neither enjoys sitting on the bench watching the 
other play for the Indiana Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	With the Pacers leading the Central Division, though, the duo is  
reluctantly accepting a rotation that has Jackson starting at point 
guard and Best finishing. 
</P>
<P>
	That's been the rotation for the past six games and it is likely  
to continue since it has contributed to five victories with Indiana 
opening a 2 1/2-game lead in the division. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, I'm not happy being on the bench,'' said Jackson, who has  
the league's second highest assist-to-turnover ratio of 3.86 and is 
fifth in assists despite playing about 28 minutes per game. ``What 
I want to do is win, and if we can do it by my being on the bench, 
I'll accept that because it is for the good of the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his 12th season and nearing his 34th birthday, Jackson  
realizes he has to spend some time watching from the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never had great speed, so I'm not really slowing down,'' he  
said. ``Yes, I need a little more rest. What I want is a 
championship and however I can contribute to it, so be it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Best, meanwhile, signed a four-year, $13 million contract when  
the NBA lockout ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could have gone elsewhere and gotten more money, but that  
wasn't what I wanted,'' Best said. ``I'm very enthused over being 
here. We nearly got to the finals last season, and the ingredients 
are here to go all the way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Best has led the Pacers in assists four times this season and  
has committed just two turnovers with 15 assists as Indiana has won 
its last four games. In those four games, he has contributed six of 
his 13 steals this season and scored 29 points while averaging just 
about 21 minutes per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Best's assists have come in the fourth quarter with  
Indiana battling for a victory. That's when he had all six of his 
assists, along with a 3-pointer that tied the score at 94-94, when 
the Pacers defeated Boston on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love to be out there when the game is on the line and it's  
time to make plays when the crowd is into it,'' Best said. ``I'm 
just happy that the coaches have confidence to leave me out there, 
and let me play at the end of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no competition between Mark and I. He's a great  
teammate and friend. He helped me through some rough times earlier 
in my career, and I respect what he means to this team,'' Best 
said. ``There's going to come a time when I become a starter, but 
there's no point in being selfish as this time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers are off to their best start in franchise history and  
Bird insists he has no plan to continue the pattern with his point 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always say that when you play well, you stay in the game,''  
Bird said. ``It has worked out because Travis is playing well. It's 
no reflection on either player how I use them. Travis gives us some 
things that Mark can't give us and Jackson certainly has proven 
himself in his career.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Says Jackson: ``I'd be lying if I said I don't want to be out  
there on the court when the game is on the line. But, I hope to be 
a coach someday and I understand the situation.''

<HEADLINE> Europe May End Duty-Free Shops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European Union finance ministers failed  
Monday to back an extension of duty-free shopping within the 
15-nation bloc. Those sales are scheduled to end June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministers split over German proposals to grant a temporary  
reprieve for duty-free sales of tobacco, liquor, perfume and other 
goods for travelers crossing borders within the EU. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a long way from unanimity,'' said German Economics  
Minister Werner Mueller. ``I don't have much hope. A majority is 
clearly against an extension.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fate of duty-free shopping will be decided by EU leaders at  
a summit next week in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
	The governments agreed in 1991 to end duty-free sales within the  
union, arguing such benefits were incompatible with a borderless 
Europe. The goods bought in duty-free stores on a traveler's way 
out of a country are not subject to that nation's taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban would not apply to duty-free sales for Americans and  
other tourists traveling to or from the EU from countries outside 
the bloc. 
</P>
<P>
	At the French port of Calais, striking workers paralyzed ferry  
service and blocked Eurotunnel trains for six hours to protest the 
expected end of duty-shopping. 
</P>
<P>
	Ferry traffic between Calais and the British port of Dover was  
halted beginning at 9 a.m., and thousands of striking port workers 
blocked the entrance to the Channel tunnel. The protests ended at 
mid-afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 demonstrators gathered outside EU headquarters in  
Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
	The duty-free industry estimates the ban would destroy over  
100,000 jobs and wipe out an industry with annual sales of some $7 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Monti, the EU's top tax official, insisted the impact  
would be much more limited. He argued the industry costs national 
treasuries some $2 billion a year, with taxpayers picking up the 
tab. 
</P>
<P>
	German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder last month proposed  
extending duty-free shopping for another 2 1/2 years while duties and 
taxes are introduced step-by-step.

<HEADLINE> Europe To Boot Duty-Free Stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Time is running out for duty-free  
shopping in the European Union as EU finance ministers failed 
Monday to agree on an extension beyond June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The finance ministers split over German proposals to grant a  
late reprieve for duty-free sales of tobacco, liquor, perfume and 
other goodies which are scheduled to be abolished for travelers 
crossing borders within the 15-nation bloc. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're a long way from unanimity,'' said German Economics  
Minister Werner Mueller, who chaired the meeting on finance 
ministers. ``I don't have much hope. A majority is clearly against 
an extension.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duty free's fate will now be decided by EU leaders next week in  
Berlin, with the popular travelers' perk looking doomed unless the 
summit produces an unanimous decision to reverse abolition. 
</P>
<P>
	Underlining the high passions the issue raises in Europe,  
thousands of French port workers Monday blockaded the Channel 
tunnel and the ferry port of Calais in protest at the planned 
abolition. About a hundred demonstrators gathered outside EU 
headquarters here. 
</P>
<P>
	The duty-free industry estimates the ban will destroy over  
100,000 jobs and wipe out an industry with annual sales of some $7 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Monti, the EU's top tax official, insisted the impact will  
be much more limited. He argued the industry costs national 
treasuries some $2.2 billion a year, with taxpayers picking up the 
tab. 
</P>
<P>
	``It must end and it will end,'' Monti told reporters. ``We must  
end a situation where ordinary European citizens are paying for 
other people's duty-free and the quite considerable profits of the 
duty-free firms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Having once voted to kill it, Germany, Britain and France are  
now battling to save the industry. But officials warn that without 
agreement at the Berlin summit, it may be impossible to push 
through the necessary legislation before the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
	German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder threw the latest lifeline  
last month by proposing to keep duty-shopping alive for another 2 1/2 
years while duties and taxes are introduced gradually. 
</P>
<P>
	But he appeared not to have swayed the doubters who are led by  
Denmark. ``The feeling is that we will stick to the original 
decision,'' said Finnish Finance Minister Sauli Niinisto. 
</P>
<P>
	All EU governments agreed in 1991 to end duty-free sales within  
the Union, arguing they were incompatible with a borderless Europe. 
Travelers in and out of the EU will still be able to shop 
duty-free.

<HEADLINE> Stopping the TV Rerun Madness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Check the television listings and there it  
is, branding program after program:(R). 
</P>
<P>
	That means Rerun. Repeat. Really annoying.  
</P>
<P>
	And it's standard in the post-February ``sweeps'' slump, when  
network shows are recovering from the ordeal of airing a month of 
new episodes to inflate ratings. 
</P>
<P>
	We feasted, so now comes the famine. But here is a modest  
proposal: Maybe it doesn't have to be this way. Maybe there are 
other, more viewer-friendly options than subjecting us to a barren 
TV spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Economic restraint is the answer, suggests industry veteran Fred  
Silverman, former network executive and now producer (``Diagnosis 
Murder''). And, we might add, a touch of imagination. 
</P>
<P>
	First, the numbers. The 39-episode series, extending throughout  
the official September-to-May TV season and allowing for a 
tolerable 13 weeks of summer reruns, is a thing of the past. 
</P>
<P>
	Network greed prompted the initial decisions to cut episode  
orders back a bit, said Silverman. But the paring continued as 
network costs for an hourlong show rose to the current level of 
about $1.2 million per episode. 
</P>
<P>
	Series now average about 22 episodes, with more than half of  
those concentrated in the three key sweeps months. That's akin to 
an Ally McBeal-sized miniskirt that offers barely enough fabric to 
provide decent coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	In the increasingly competitive TV environment this does not  
represent the kind of customer service that encourages viewers to 
choose broadcast over cable. 
</P>
<P>
	But is it feasible to produce more episodes per season?  
Silverman thinks so. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ultimately, what everybody has got to do is find a way to do  
shows less expensively and to do more of them. That is the solution 
to the problem,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cutting back costs on half-hour comedies is one sensible place  
to start: Big, highly paid writing staffs eat up much of their 
budget, but ``Does all that money really translate on the screen?'' 
Silverman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another drain, he says, is shooting sitcoms in front of an  
audience and keeping a five-day schedule with room for script 
revisions -- too much room, he contends. 
</P>
<P>
	What makes business sense, he said, is giving viewers something  
they can rely on for 35 to 40 weeks of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	It might be tough, however, to squeeze more episodes out of  
stars who already complain of 12-hour-plus workdays (leaving barely 
enough time for a feature film). And producers say keeping quality 
high means fewer episodes. 
</P>
<P>
	So what to do? How about something creative?  
</P>
<P>
	Maybe something like the three-in-one series wheel that worked  
28 years ago. The ``NBC Mystery Movie'' rotated episodes of 
``Columbo,'' ``McMillan and Wife'' and ``McCloud'' and was popular 
enough to last from 1971-78. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea was a hit as well with Weaver, who played McCloud, a  
New Mexico lawman transplanted to New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the most gratifying series that I ever did, the most  
fun and the least stressful,'' Weaver said. ``There were fewer 
episodes, but we took more time with those that we did. The writers 
had more time to flesh out a good story, and I think the general 
production reflected that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Viewers, he added, seemed to enjoy the variety in the Sunday  
night slot. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaver doesn't recall anyone resisting the idea. ``The feeling  
was it was a sensible way to go and had every reason to be 
successful,'' he said. ``It all depends on the quality of the 
writing and the storytelling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Or maybe another approach would work, something like ABC's new  
Tuesday night venture, ``Strange World.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The science-fiction drama is occupying the ``NYPD Blue'' niche  
through March. That means the police drama will return with eight 
new episodes leading up to its May 25 season finale (and spare us 
having to watch Jimmy Smits' character rise from his fresh grave in 
reruns). 
</P>
<P>
	``Strange World,'' which stars Tim Guinee as an ailing scientist  
pressed into government service, is labeled in ABC promotions as an 
``exclusive limited series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted to make sure people understood this series ... was  
something a little special; something you could get into but you'd 
be satisfied with when the viewing experience is over,'' said 
Michael Benson, ABC's senior vice president of advertising and 
promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, if ``Strange World'' catches on, ABC would be  
delighted to bring it back as a full-fledged series. But if that 
doesn't happen, Benson said, both viewers and the networks remain 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think limited series enhance the viewing experience, help  
build the network brand and help the audience understand the 
variety of programming we have,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Short-run programs or an umbrella template like the ``NBC  
Mystery Movie'' are not flawless solutions. An abbreviated series, 
for example, means that a production company loses the chance to 
accumulate the block of episodes needed for a syndication sale. 
</P>
<P>
	And HBO executive Chris Albrecht, whose cable channel excels in  
special programming and limited series, notes that such fare 
requires intense and costly promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	TV is a ``cluttered environment,'' he notes. ``No matter how  
much money you throw at it in the beginning to promote it, by week 
three or four if you are not continually promoting it off-channel 
there are other things that are going to grab media attention or 
the front page of TV guides.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rotating series present different problems. They have to fit  
together logically with no weak leaks. And fewer episodes per year 
means a longer wait to reach the magic 100 shows for syndication. 
</P>
<P>
	Those are certainly considerations. But consider this unsettling  
alternative for viewers: Broadcast schedules packed, if not with 
reruns, then with cheap-to-produce news magazines and banal reality 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Envision ``The Big Moment,'' from the producers of ``America's  
Funniest Home Videos,'' taking over the tube. The ABC series, 
coming in April, awards prize money for such feats as pulling a 
cloth off a fully set dining table. 
</P>
<P>
	If TV networks have any compassion -- or intelligence -- they'll  
figure out a way to provide more of the dramas and comedies 
audiences have consistently favored. And not just for the sake of 
viewers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The alternative is really ugly,'' said Silverman. ``The  
alternative is that everybody will go broke.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ....  
</P>
<P>
	TO THE RESCUE: The adventures of a team of Los Angeles  
paramedics provide the drama in ``Rescue 77,'' a WB midseason 
series debuting 9 p.m. EST Monday. Richard Roundtree (``Shaft'') 
stars as the tough-but-compassionate captain. Marjorie Monaghan is 
the vulnerable heroine, Christian Kane the overzealous hero and

<P>
	After stocks sputtered in the first hour of trading, analysts  
said the market appeared to be awaiting a catalyst powerful enough 
to spark a strong run past 10,000. By midday, announcements of 
several big mergers provided that spark 
</P>
<P>
	The $16 billion acquisition of BankBoston Corp. by Fleet  
Financial Group Inc. added some punch to the financial services 
sector. Shares of BankBoston rose 1 1/16. Fleet, however, slipped 1 
15/16 to 42 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Also today, chemical giant DuPont Co. said it will pay $7.7  
billion to acquire 80 percent of Pioneer Hi-Bred International 
Inc., the world's largest seed corn company. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline stocks benefited from a new round of fare increases,  
which will push up the price of a business fare about 1 percent and 
a leisure fare about 3 percent. UAL Corp., which also indicated its 
first-quarter earnings will top analysts' expectations, was up 4 3/4 
at 71 13/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Oil stocks were among the decliners today, having rallied Friday  
as world oil producers agreed to cut their output. Chevron was off 
9/16 at 84 1/8, and Exxon was off 1/4 at 73 11/16.

<HEADLINE> Toronto Still Eying 2008 Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Despite the recent controversies surrounding  
Toronto's bid for the 2008 Summer Games, bid chairman David Crombie 
says the quest for the Olympics is still on track. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're staying the course with this bid,'' Crombie told the  
Toronto Star from his home Sunday. ``As we go down the road and the 
IOC reforms come down we'll be in a better position to win these 
games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toronto 2008 Olympic Bid Corp., the private company attempting  
to win the Games, was stunned last week with the disclosure that 
International Olympic Committee vice-president Dick Pound had 
resigned from the executive board of the bid in December. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound said one reason for his departure was a potential conflict  
with his job as head of the IOC's investigation into the Salt Lake 
City corruption scandal. Toronto bid supporters are hoping Pound 
will return to the executive board after the IOC addresses the Salt 
Lake City matter this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Toronto Sun reported today that anger toward Toronto Mayor  
Mel Lastman and the Toronto media also influenced Pound's decision 
to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	In October, Pound said that with Beijing, a favorite to win,  
entering the race, Toronto ``would go from being a clear 
front-runner to somebody who will have to pull up the proverbial 
socks'' in order to win. 
</P>
<P>
	Lastman was angered by the comments and suggested that Pound  
could be positioning himself to succeed IOC president Juan Antonio 
Samanranch. 
</P>
<P>
	Crombie said that Pound had mentioned last year he was  
considering resigning. 
</P>
<P>
	``He did mention back in December that he was thinking of  
leaving our bid committee while he worked for the IOC, but he also 
said that he might return again when he was through and we said 
`Fine. That's your decision, Dick, and your choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, Canadian Olympic Association chief executive  
officer Carol Anne Letheren called Toronto's bid ``ambivalent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no direction,'' she said. ``One day you hear we're  
going to go for it and the next day you hear we're not. Sometime 
soon we're going to have to commit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Crombie admits the bid has had its problems. Just $2 million of  
the estimated $29 million needed to be competitive in the bidding 
process has been raised so far. However, Crombie insists the bid is 
organized. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been serious about this for the last two years,'' he  
said. ``And we've got 500 volunteers working hundreds of hours on 
this thing to prove that we're serious. This is the best time for 
Toronto to go for the Olympics.''

<HEADLINE> Testimony Resumes in McDougal Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- One former prosecutor in Kenneth  
Starr's office testified today that Whitewater investigators never 
asked Susan McDougal to lie for them and stressed in conversations 
with her and her lawyers that ``we want the truth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Testifying on the third day of Mrs. McDougal's trial on charges  
of criminal contempt and obstruction of justice, Amy St. Eve 
responded to accusations by Mrs. McDougal's legal team that 
prosecutors had demanded that she falsely implicate President 
Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton in wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	In August 1996, the time of the alleged incident, Mrs. McDougal  
faced sentencing after being convicted of four felonies in a fraud 
trial. Her lawyer, Bobby McDaniel, had contacted Starr's office to 
ask what prosecutors could do for her if she cooperated. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. St. Eve testified that McDaniel wanted to know who  
prosecutors wanted her to testify against, but that Starr's office 
refused to give names. Mrs. St. Eve said prosecutors purposely did 
not specify the Clintons because they were concerned that the 
McDougal camp would then ``spin'' an incorrect account of their 
conversation with the McDougal legal team. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's lawyers have said Starr wanted her to lie and  
that she feared being charged with perjury if she didn't tell 
prosecutors what they wanted to hear. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal, convicted of fraud in a Whitewater-related trial  
in 1996, has refused to testify to a Whitewater grand jury under 
subpoena by Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Her refusal resulted in the charges of criminal contempt and  
obstruction of justice for which she is now on trial. 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony Thursday, an FBI agent linked a $27,600 loan in  
Clinton's name to a fraudulent $300,000 loan to Mrs. McDougal 3 1/2 
years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitewater figure David Hale says he was pressured by Clinton to  
make the $300,000 loan. Clinton denies Hale's allegation and says 
he knows nothing about the $300,000 loan. 
</P>
<P>
	The $27,600 loan from the McDougals' savings and loan is  
important because Clinton testified in 1996 that he never borrowed 
any money from the financial institution. Three months after the 
president's testimony, Jim McDougal tipped off Starr's office to 
the $27,600 loan.

<HEADLINE> Trilateral Commission Reaches Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Trilateral Commission, long an exclusive  
club of influential citizens from the world's most powerful 
nations, is reaching out to other countries to help find ways to 
foster democracy and economic freedom. 
</P>
<P>
	While leading figures from nonmember countries like China,  
Korea, Russia and Ukraine cannot become members of the commission, 
which meets annually to discuss the future of the world, they sat 
at the table for this year's meetings in Washington, which ended 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have taken steps importantly to extend the range of the  
discussion ... to people outside the traditional trilateral 
areas,'' said former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker, leader 
of the U.S. contingent in one of the world's most prestigious 
gatherings. The commission, founded 26 years ago by banker David 
Rockefeller, includes more than 300 mostly private citizens from 
the United States, Canada, Europe and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Volcker, at a closing news conference that attracted only a  
handful of journalists, said three days of discussions that 
involved about half the council's membership reached no 
conclusions. Sessions are closed to news coverage, although 
security is not tight and some media figures belong to the 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Membership includes academics and industrial and former  
political leaders. Current members of national governments are 
excluded. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Trilateral Commission doesn't make any recommendations on  
anything,'' Volcker said -- particularly not on reform of exchange 
rates or the world financial system, which were among topics 
briefly discussed at the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Otto Graf Lambsdorff, European chairman and former German  
Bundestag member, said China was the focus of much discussion, 
again with no consensus reached. He said, however, that no one 
opposed cooperation with China and no one said China should not 
respect human rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Volcker said the participation of representatives from several  
nonmember countries enhanced the discussions and will continue at 
future annual sessions, held alternatively in the United States, 
Japan and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have the opportunity of changing thinking,'' said Volcker,  
assessing the value of the meetings. ``I would hope that there is 
some kind of changing in thinking, a convergence of thought, 
because people are affected by the discussions, but it's not 
directed deliberately towards a particular end, other than the 
fostering of democracy and economic development around the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese commission chairman, Yotaro Kobayashi, head of Fuji  
Xerox Co., Ltd., said, ``Having more participants from outside ... 
has only enriched the course of the discussions.''

<HEADLINE>  Duke Has Clear Regional Path </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- As if Duke needs any breaks in the NCAA  
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The top-seeded Blue Devils (34-1) might have gotten a few over  
the weekend, though, when the East Regional appeared to get easier 
with losses by high seeds Miami (Fla.), Cincinnati, Tennessee and 
Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
	With seeds 2-5 ousted from the region, Duke will face  
12th-seeded Southwest Missouri State (22-10) Friday at East 
Rutherford, N.J. If Duke wins its 30th straight, it will get the 
winner of No. 6 Temple and No. 10 Purdue in the regional title 
game. 
</P>
<P>
	An easy road to the Final Four?  
</P>
<P>
	``I wish,'' forward Shane Battier said Monday. ``It has been a  
crazy year, and it's exciting as a college basketball fan to watch 
teams that don't get as much press come out and play the so-called 
powers and beat them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Krzyzewski said anyone who reaches the tournament's  
round of 16 is capable, including Steve Alford's team, which beat 
No. 4 seed Tennessee by 30 points Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the closer you get to having a chance to win a  
national championship the harder it gets,'' said Krzyzewski, whose 
45-12 career record in the NCAA tournament is best among active 
coaches. ``That's why a lot of teams have been eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the regular season, it's totally different. People  
believe in miracles in March. In February and January, when you're 
playing road games, people don't necessarily believe in miracles. 
You only have to have the miracle once. That's the beauty of the 
tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taking that into consideration, is Duke leery of an upset?  
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't scare us because teams that lost may have tended to  
overlook their opponent, and we haven't overlooked an opponent 
yet,'' Battier said. ``(Southwest Missouri) won two games, they 
beat a No. 4 and No. 5 seed, so that tells you something.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duke won its first- and second-round NCAA games at the Charlotte  
Coliseum by 41 points each, against Florida A&AMP;M and Tulsa. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Devils have won their last 11 by an average margin of  
31 points, but Krzyzewski said it might be difficult ``to keep them 
at this level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You want to protect against letting up, especially this time  
of year because if you do it once your year is over,'' Trajan 
Langdon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke remains confident about reaching the Final Four -- but not  
overconfident considering the many upsets that have occurred in its 
region. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coach has always preached respecting your opponent,'' Battier  
said. ``Throughout the year we've played teams where we've been 
favored by X amount of points, and on paper it looks like it can be 
a 100-point game, but we're always respected our opponent's effort 
and that's been key to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The loss of No. 3 seed Cincinnati means Duke won't get a shot at  
beating the only team to defeat the Blue Devils this season. The 
Bearcats beat the Blue Devils 77-75 Nov. 28 in the Great Alaska 
Shootout. 
</P>
<P>
	``A Final Four banner doesn't have the words, `They played  
Cincinnati or they didn't play Cincinnati,' '' Battier said. ``If 
we can get one, I don't care who we play. We can play the `Little 
Sister's of the Poor' and it would feel great.''

<HEADLINE> HIV-Killing Proteins Found in Tears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tears, saliva and the urine of pregnant women  
all contain proteins that are potent killers of HIV, the virus that 
causes AIDS, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists isolated a protein, called lysozyme, and found  
that it was able to kill the AIDS virus quickly in test-tube 
experiments. A report on the study appears Tuesday in the 
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
	The lysozyme could become an important therapeutic drug against  
HIV because it is a natural compound that the body routinely makes, 
said Sylvia Lee-Huang, professor of biochemistry at New York 
University, who identified it with colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	``It ought to be more tolerated and have fewer side effects than  
other HIV drugs,'' said Lee-Huang. ``It possibly could be used in 
combination with other drugs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team also found that the urine of pregnant women contains  
another type of protein, called ribonucleases, that destroys the 
genetic material in the HIV virus. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not known how lysozyme kills HIV, but Lee-Huang speculated  
that it could work by breaking down the outer membrane of the 
virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Nava Sarver, an AIDS researcher at the National Institute of  
Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the study was interesting but 
needs to be confirmed by other laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of work needs to be done to simulate the (laboratory)  
findings in a more relevant situation,'' said Sarver. Her agency, 
NIAID, is part of the National Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
	The search for the anti-HIV protein was prompted, said  
Lee-Huang, when researchers realized the babies of women infected 
with HIV were somewhat protected from the virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers earlier suspected that human chorionic gonadotropin,  
or HCG, a hormone produced during pregnancy, was responsible for 
protecting against HIV and other viruses. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee-Huang said she and her group purified HCG and found it had  
no effect on HIV. The researchers then spent two years isolating 
other proteins in urine and testing them against HIV. Eventually 
they found lysozyme and ribonucleases. 
</P>
<P>
	The researcher speculated that pregnancy prompts a woman's body  
to make more virus-killing proteins to protect the developing baby 
from viruses and bacteria. That suggests ``Mother Nature knows best 
how to protect the earliest stages of life,'' Lee-Huang said. 
</P>
<P>
	The proteins also were found in mother's milk, white blood cells  
and chicken egg white, and lysozyme was found in saliva and tears. 
</P>
<P>
	The presence of lysozyme in saliva may a factor in why HIV is  
not transmitted by casual kissing, said Lee-Huang. 
</P>
<P>
	The team is now trying to determine exactly how lysozyme attacks  
HIV. That is a critical step in developing a new HIV drug based on 
the protein, she said.

<HEADLINE> Yankees' Petitte Resumes Throwing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- New York Yankees left-hander Andy Pettitte  
took a small step forward today. 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte reported no problems after playing catch for the first  
time since leaving his spring debut after one inning March 7 
because of a muscle strain in his throwing elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't feel anything,'' said Pettitte, who might throw off a  
mound later this week. ``The biggest test is stepping on the mound, 
taking five minutes off and cranking it up again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pettitte is scheduled to play catch again Tuesday before leaving  
the team to attend his grandfather's funeral Wednesday in Baton

<HEADLINE> Rodman Remains on Paid Leave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Dennis Rodman remained on an excused, paid  
leave of absence from the Los Angeles Lakers on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	A source close to Rodman said he wasn't sure when the seven-time  
NBA rebounding champion would return to the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know, I can't address that,'' the source, who spoke on  
the condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press on Monday 
night. ``He has some personal things he needs to deal with. He's 
addressing his problems and looks forward to returning and 
contributing to the team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about a report that Rodman was seen gambling in Las  
Vegas on Sunday night, the source would only say, ``He spent some 
time out of town. He's back in the Los Angeles area.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers confirmed Sunday that Rodman missed practice the day  
before, and didn't travel with the team to Sacramento for Sunday 
night's game against the Kings -- the opener of a six-game road trip 
in nine days. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, ESPN reported Rodman was spotted playing blackjack at  
Caesars Palace on Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing privacy regulations, Phil Cooper, vice president of  
public relations for Caesars Palace, said the hotel doesn't reveal 
customer names. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman wasn't registered at the hotel early Monday afternoon.  
However, when the woman answering the phone at the Las Vegas Hilton 
Hotel was asked if Rodman was registered there, she replied, ``All 
I'm showing is the reservation was canceled.'' It's known that 
Rodman has been a guest previously at that hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is nothing new today,'' said Tom Savage, assistant  
director of public relations for the Lakers. ``He's on an excused 
leave of absence and he's being paid. (The leave) is indefinite. He 
told us he had some personal, non-basketball issues he needed to 
handle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Savage said Lakers executives Jerry West and Mitch Kupchak would  
not comment on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	The source said the Lakers have been ``real supportive,'' and  
Rodman was ``very happy'' with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``His absence has nothing to do with what's going on with the  
Lakers,'' the source said. ``There are a lot of different rumors 
about different problems he might be addressing. However, I think 
it could be hurtful to speculate on them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's important he addresses them privately. He's trying to  
wrestle with them and go on. Dennis does love to entertain. But 
right now, he needs some privacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lakers coach Kurt Rambis said Rodman informed him he would  
return to the team at some point. Rodman continues to earn his 
$12,195 per-game salary. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers, 9-0 when Rodman has played and 6-7 when he hasn't,  
lost at Sacramento 105-101 to snap their 10-game winning streak. 
They return to action Tuesday night at Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman joined the Lakers last month after some three weeks of  
uncertainty, and is averaging 10.3 rebounds in 24.8 minutes of 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old forward played only eight minutes -- all in the  
first half -- of his most recent game, an 89-78 victory over Golden 
State last Friday night. The Lakers said he was hampered by a sore 
right elbow.

<HEADLINE> L.A. To Get DNC 2000 Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Months of sales pitches and protracted  
negotiations seem to have paid off: Los Angeles has been chosen the 
site of next year's Democratic national convention. 
</P>
<P>
	The official announcement was scheduled to be made today by  
National Democratic leaders and California dignitaries, according 
to a statement released by party officials Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	It comes after nearly a year of meetings between Democratic  
National Committee members and a coalition of public officials and 
private business people intent on bringing the convention here for 
the first time since 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	Mayor Richard Riordan, a Republican known for supporting and  
working with Democrats, lobbied for the convention, but wanted to 
keep the city government from being financially responsible for the 
event's estimated $30 million to $35 million tab. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the independent host committee known as LA Convention  
2000 proposed assuming full responsibility for the event, as the 
private sector did for the 1984 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	In its proposal, the committee said the publicly held Los  
Angeles Convention Center and privately held Staples Center would 
be offered free of charge for the convention. The Staples Center is 
scheduled for completion in October, far in advance of the August 
convention. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear how the two sides resolved the  
issue of money for the convention. The City Council must vote on a 
contract before the deal is completed, DNC officials have said, but 
it's unknown when that would be. 
</P>
<P>
	For weeks senior Democratic officials have said Los Angeles is  
all but certain to host the party's next convention. Boston and 
Denver were also options in case the party in Los Angeles can't 
resolve differences on money and other amenities. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans decided last month to hold their 2000 convention in  
Philadelphia. Indianapolis, New Orleans, New York and San Antonio 
had also sought to host the GOP convention.

<HEADLINE> Holyfield, Lewis Get Another Chance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The last time anybody asked for a do-over this outrageous, Tonya  
Harding had one leg up on a figure skating judge's desk, a broken 
shoelace and tears streaming down her face. 
</P>
<P>
	Don King didn't have enough self-respect to even pretend he was  
crying when he left Madison Square Garden early Sunday. Instead, he 
was yelling ``Let's do it again!'' over and over. And cackling in 
between. 
</P>
<P>
	The draw involving Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis that  
preceded it didn't set a new low for boxing -- but only because no 
one can say for sure what the last one was. 
</P>
<P>
	It might have been any of the handful of fights during Mike  
Tyson's first comeback, or the meal he tried to make of Holyfield 
that ended it. It might have been the disqualification Andrew 
Golota earned for mistaking Riddick Bowe's shoelaces for his belt -- 
twice. Or Oliver McCall's loss to Lewis two years ago, when he 
stood in the middle of the ring sobbing and refused to fight. Take 
as many punches to the head as fight fans recently and things start 
to run together. 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, what the boxers involved had in common, besides  
making a mockery of their sport, was that each was given the chance 
to do it over again. And so, too, will Holyfield and Lewis. In an 
almost unprecedented show of unity, the heads of the International 
Boxing Federation, World Boxing Council and World Boxing 
Association decreed it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shame there was so much controversy attached to this  
important fight,'' IBF president Bob Lee said, apparently 
forgetting who hired the judges that produced it. `But we did what 
we thought was the most sensible thing by ordering a rematch in six 
months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If you're looking for the definition of ``chutzpah,'' this is as  
good as any. Most people with the chance to get out of town with 
nothing accomplished and too much of someone else's money know 
enough to keep it to themselves. Or they try to make amends by, 
say, putting the rematch on free TV. 
</P>
<P>
	Not these guys. Having picked the pockets of the 21,000 people  
who jammed the Garden and millions more at home through the miracle 
of pay per view and gotten away with it once, they can't wait to 
see if they can run the scam again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Definitely,'' Holyfield said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Automatic,'' Lewis said.  
</P>
<P>
	The people at HBO, uncertain whether they'll be cut in on the  
rematch, were already trying to squeeze some dollars out of the 
replay. By Sunday night, the cable network was running ads showing 
one of the few entertaining moments of the fight, inviting viewers 
to see for themselves ``if it's one of the biggest travesties 
ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trust us, it was -- though that hardly qualifies as a reason to  
sit through a dull fight again. The time and effort would be better 
invested trying to get a refund if you shelled out $50 to watch it 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Don King loves to say, ``Only in America!'' and only in a  
country with an oversupply of lawyers would there even be a chance 
you might get your money back. Of course, it's highly unlikely. But 
as the three ringside judges proved last weekend, justice is not 
only blind, but sometimes misguided. 
</P>
<P>
	Last Wednesday, the Nevada Supreme Court ruled that a number of  
lawsuits filed against Tyson and King seeking refunds for 
pay-per-view customers of the infamous ``bite fight'' could go 
forward as a class action in Clark County. 
</P>
<P>
	In that June 1997 bout, Tyson twice tried to make a snack of  
Holyfield's ear and got himself disqualified. Some of the more than 
30 lawsuits that followed in its wake suggest Tyson's snacking 
habit was actually a ploy to throw the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	A New York judge dismissed a similar complaint last year, but  
that is being appealed. And as the whole shameless bunch involved 
in this latest episode has reminded us, sometimes the only obstacle 
to getting a do-over is having the courage to ask for it.

<HEADLINE> Chancellor Media Ends Merger Quest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Chancellor Media Corp. is ending its quest for a  
merger partner after just two months, with no takers emerging for 
the $20 billion price tag set by the radio-station empire. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Chancellor is shaking up top management -- with its  
chief executive stepping aside -- and scrapping the planned purchase 
of Lin Television Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	The company said Monday it hopes to revive its lethargic stock  
price by focusing solely on radio and outdoor advertising. 
</P>
<P>
	But investors gave the plan a fuzzy reception Monday, initially  
pushing Chancellor's shares down 11 percent. The stock recovered in 
the afternoon, however, closing $1.18 3/4 higher at $45.56 1/4 on the 
Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe this will all work out, but the point is the story just  
keeps changing and changing and changing,'' said analyst Bishop 
Cheen of First Union Capital Markets. ``Investors like a little bit 
of stability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chancellor -- controlled by the buyout firm Hicks, Muse, Tate &AMP;  
Furst -- spent billions to acquire radio and billboard companies 
last year. The pending purchase of Capstar Broadcasting Corp., 
which is also controlled by Hicks Muse, will make Chancellor the 
nation's largest radio group with 467 stations nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	After the aggressive buildup, however, Chancellor surprised Wall  
Street in January by putting itself up for sale because its stock 
price lagged rival radio groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Chancellor had hoped to fetch at least $20 billion, but found no  
suitors willing to meet that price and face the inevitable 
regulatory hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
	``The right thing to do for this company is to stay independent  
as the best group of radio assets in the industry,'' said Thomas 
Hicks, chairman of both Hicks Muse and Chancellor, who will succeed 
Jeffrey Marcus as Chancellor CEO. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcus is stepping down nearly a year after joining Chancellor  
from Marcus Cable Co., where he had been chairman. Hicks said he 
and Marcus jointly decided that Marcus would give up day-to-day 
oversight of Chancellor, but remain a board member. 
</P>
<P>
	Chancellor shares enjoyed a brief boost after the company  
announced it was up for sale on Jan. 20, but soon fizzled amid the 
nagging uncertainties over the company's future. 
</P>
<P>
	Hicks said Chancellor had talked with several potential suitors  
-- which he refused to name -- but never received an offer. Clear 
Channel, the nation's third-largest radio company, had been widely 
seen as the most likely buyer for Chancellor. A Clear Channel 
spokesman did not return a call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its new strategy, Chancellor is calling off its $900  
million acquisition of Lin Television, which owns or manages 12 TV 
stations and is also controlled by Hicks Muse. 
</P>
<P>
	Hicks said investors told Chancellor they would prefer it to  
focus on radio and outdoor advertising, so Hicks Muse will try to 
build its TV holdings separately through Lin. 
</P>
<P>
	Since television is perceived as having slower growth prospects  
than radio, many investors will prefer Chancellor's decision to 
abandon the Lin deal in favor of paring its debt and cutting costs, 
said Prudential Securities analyst James Marsh. 
</P>
<P>
	Chancellor also said Monday it plans to develop an Internet  
division to seek opportunities for online commerce -- an 
increasingly common strategy among media companies thanks to Wall 
Street's insatiable appetite for anything Internet-related. 
</P>
<P>
	Other moves announced Monday include James de Castro, head of  
Chancellor's radio group, assuming control of the company's outdoor 
advertising businesses, and Steven Hicks, Capstar's president and 
CEO, leading Chancellor's new media efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Hicks Muse also announced that it will buy an additional $500  
million worth of Chancellor stock over the next two weeks, bringing 
to company's ownership stake to 29 percent once the Capstar deal 
closes. 
</P>
<P>
	Hicks Muse created Chancellor in 1993 to acquire radio companies  
in large markets. Its flagship stations now include WHTZ-FM, a top 
40 station in New York, and KHKS-FM, a top 40 station in Dallas. 
The company also provides syndicated programming, including Casey 
Kasem's long-running ``American Top 40.''

<HEADLINE>  Gephardt Endorses Gore in 2000 Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, in a show of  
political force to kick off his 2000 presidential campaign, secured 
the endorsements Monday of House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt and 
party stalwarts from the early battleground states of New Hampshire 
and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	With onstage hugs from Gephardt, Gore implored a New Hampshire  
crowd to ``stand with me,'' then flew to Iowa and later to his 
onetime rival's hometown of St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would all be proud to have him as president of the United  
States,'' said the Missouri lawmaker, who opted out of the 
presidential race Feb. 3 to focus his energies on becoming speaker 
of the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt's announcement reflects the desire of top Democrats to  
settle the presidential nomination early and set their sights on 
winning both the House and White House in November 2000. President 
Clinton long ago pledged to help Gore get elected, guaranteeing his 
understudy an advantage not always bestowed upon vice presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley is the only announced  
challenger for the party's presidential nomination, though civil 
rights activist Jesse Jackson may enter the fray. 
</P>
<P>
	Lagging in polls, Bradley hopes to build a resurgent campaign  
that catches fire at the grass roots. He is buoyed by evidence of 
potential Gore weakness in the general election. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to have a nominee who can win,'' Bradley said.  
</P>
<P>
	Gore plans to capitalize on the popularity of Clinton  
initiatives while at the same time distinguishing himself from his 
boss. 
</P>
<P>
	The difficulty of this balancing act was evident at a New  
Hampshire news conference. Gore said he will ``face entirely new 
challenges, and we need new answers.'' Yet his answers sounded 
familiar: Reduce class sizes, make preschool available to all 
students and improve health care. Clinton has pressed those ideas, 
but Gore promises to push them further. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't want to join us in bringing radical change to  
public education, stand out of the way,'' he told a crowd of 400 
New Hampshire activists at a boisterous indoor rally. 
</P>
<P>
	With hardly a mention of his boss, Gore shouted again and again:  
``Stand with me!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt and Gore hugged after their speeches, raising their  
hands high. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair headed next to Iowa, hitting in one day the two states  
that cast the earliest votes in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of about 300 greeted Gore in Iowa, fewer than the number  
who attended a rally by Republican presidential hopeful Elizabeth 
Dole last week. Gore said he feels ``connected to the great civil 
rights struggles of this century, and I believe they must be merely 
the foundation for the great civil rights victories of the 21st 
century. We will not go back. Stand with me, and we will break down 
the barriers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In rolling out the endorsements on his first official political  
trip of the campaign, Gore hoped to develop a sense of 
inevitability about his nomination even before he formally 
announces his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a reflection of reality,'' David Rohde, a professor of  
political science at Michigan State University, said of Gephardt's 
endorsement. ``He and everyone else thinks Gore will be the 
nominee. What Gephardt wants is to be speaker -- and it's better to 
be part of a team than to hold back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, Gore said he is  
taking nothing for granted. ``I welcome a spirited contest,'' he 
said. ``I always expect it.'' He promised to return to both states 
to campaign in living rooms and coffee shops. 
</P>
<P>
	During the three-state swing, Gore also locked down the  
endorsements of Bill Shaheen, husband of New Hampshire Gov. Jeanne 
Shaheen, and prominent Democrats in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Hampshire governor and Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack are still  
neutral, though Shaheen is said to be leaning heavily toward Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	The same polls that show Gore with a wide lead over Bradley  
offer hints at weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest Wall Street Journal-NBC poll shows Gore 18 percentage  
points behind Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the early favorite for the 
Republican nomination. Gore did not mention Bush but criticized his 
father's ``failed prescriptions of the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll found Gore not only  
trailing Bush, 56 percent to 41 percent, but also Mrs. Dole, 52 
percent to 44 percent. The survey of 1,025 people carried a margin 
of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	A Pew Research Center survey found nearly half of independent  
voters and 16 percent of likely Democratic voters said they had 
ruled out voting for Gore. The same poll showed that 76 percent of 
independents and 53 percent of Democrats said they would consider 
voting for Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I were the Gore campaign I would be concerned,'' said  
Democratic consultant David Axelrod of Chicago. ``But I wouldn't 
panic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Gore worked from the White House to lay claim to a  
series of bite-size initiatives popular among suburban voters, such 
as promising to ease traffic jams. Fine ideas, Democrats say, but 
he needs to leave Clinton's side to promote his own agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure about that ribbon-cutting strategy. That one  
makes me nervous,'' Axelrod said. ``I think it just underscores the 
second-banana thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans say Gore won't escape Clinton's policies or  
controversies. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is the Velcro to Clinton's Teflon,'' said GOP media  
strategist Alex Castellanos. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore proved last week that he can make mistakes. He claimed that  
he created the Internet, giving Republicans reason to howl. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after announcing he would not be a presidential  
candidate, Gephardt told Gore over lunch that he would endorse him. 
Gore's campaign saved the announcement until they could get the 
greatest attention for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore will formally declare his candidacy later this year.

<HEADLINE> Fed, States Near Deal on Tobacco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators and state officials talked of  
compromise Monday on whether states would give the federal 
government a piece of the $246 billion tobacco companies agreed to 
pay to settle health-related lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue was a measure approved this month by the Senate  
Appropriations Committee that would prevent the government from 
using Medicaid law to claim a share of the money. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has threatened to seek what it says  
is the federal share unless states agree to spend settlements 
exclusively on health-related matters. State officials contend the 
states should be able to use the money as they please, even on 
sidewalks, roads or tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be that we can reach some accommodation,'' said Sen.  
Arlen Specter, R-Pa., chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee 
on labor, health and human services. As he prepared his amendment 
to the measure, Specter asked state officials to provide ``general 
set of standards'' they could accept for how to spend the money. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we're entitled to know where it's going to be spent,''  
Specter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The request underscored the instability of the full committee's  
March 4 approval of Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison's amendment to a $1.9 
billion emergency spending bill, tempered by continuing political 
heat that surrounds the tobacco issue since the death last year of 
a $516 billion Senate settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	The tobacco industry settled with the states in November, but  
what to do with that money has sparked new contention between 
Washington to the 50 state capitals. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco companies agreed to pay $40 billion over 25 years to  
settle four state lawsuits and another $206 billion in a broader 
deal with the other 46 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchison said Wednesday her amendment would prevent ``the Big  
Brother federal government'' from dictating spending priorities to 
states that fought for and won the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am going to try to keep you from dictating to the states  
what they should do with money that I think they've earned,'' 
Hutchison told Mike Hash, deputy administrator of the Health Care 
Financing Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration contends states must share proceeds  
of any lawsuits involving Medicaid, because the federal government 
pays 57 percent of that program's cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchison's legislation would bar the White House from using  
Medicaid law to recoup the money, and supporters see a critical 
need to move swiftly because legislatures want to decide quickly 
how to spend the money. 
</P>
<P>
	All 50 governors have challenged the federal position on the  
ground that the states earned every penny of the settlement by 
filing and settling lawsuits against tobacco companies. States, the 
governors believe, should be able to use the dollars as they 
please, however they choose to spend them. 
</P>
<P>
	``After bearing all the risks and expenses in the arduous  
negotiations and litigation, ... we are now fully entitled to all 
the funds awarded to us,'' Kentucky Gov. Paul Patton told Specter's 
subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration fired back Monday with a letter from Donna  
Shalala, secretary of health and human resources, urging 
Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted Stevens of Alaska and ranking 
Democrat Robert Byrd of West Virginia to reject the states' 
challenge to the government's claim. 
</P>
<P>
	The whole matter, said Specter, is so legally uncharted that  
it's likely to wind up in court once again. Instead, he asked 
Patton and state officials from Texas and Pennsylvania to get back 
to him with a list of spending requirements they could accept.

<HEADLINE> Rockies 8, White Sox 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Darryl Kile had his best outing of the  
spring, pitching four strong innings to lead the Colorado Rockies 
past the Chicago White Sox 8-2 Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Kile, traditionally a slow starter in the spring, entered the  
game with an 0-2 record and 7.20 ERA, but threw three shutout 
innings before allowing a run in the fourth when Gabby Martinez 
stole home on the front end of a double steal. 
</P>
<P>
	Kile allowed three hits and one run with one walk and three  
strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Dante Bichette went 3-for-4 with an RBI and Larry Walker was  
2-for-3 with two RBIs for the Rockies, who capitalized on four 
Chicago errors. Only three of the Rockies' eight runs were earned. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado (8-6) erupted for six runs -- only two of them earned --  
in the fourth inning off starter James Baldwin (1-1) and reliever 
Mike Heathcott. The Rockies sent 12 men to the plate, collecting 
six singles including Walker's two-run single. 
</P>
<P>
	All 12 Colorado hits were singles.  
</P>
<P>
	John Thomson, projected to be the Rockies' No. 3 starter, made  
his spring debut after being slowed by a sore shoulder. He went one 
inning, allowing two hits but no runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Tilson Brito knocked in Chicago's only other run with a  
sacrifice fly in the eighth. The White Sox (6-8) had just six hits, 
two by Carlos Lee. 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago's Jeff Abbott was a late scratch from the starting  
lineup after developing flu symptoms.

	COTONOU, Benin (AP) -- Isidore de Souza, the Roman Catholic  
archbishop of Cotonou and a key figure in Benin's transition to 
democracy, died Saturday of a heart attack. He was 65. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, de Souza was president of the national conference that

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Leon ``Lee'' Falk, the creator of the comic  
strips ``Mandrake the Magician'' and ``The Phantom,'' died Saturday 
at the age of 87. 
</P>
<P>
	Falk was a college student when he conceived ``Mandrake the  
Magician,'' which illustrated a hypnotist who used his powers to 
fight crime. The strip, which first appeared in 1934 and has been 
drawn by Fred Fredericks since 1965, is still syndicated in 125 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1936, Falk developed ``The Phantom,'' which follows the  
exploits of a costumed superhero. The strip runs in than 500 
newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	After working in secret intelligence with the Office of War  
Information during World War II, Falk returned to playwriting and 
theatrical production. For many years he was the owner of summer 
theaters in Massachusetts and a winter theater in Nassau in the 
Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	Falk produced more than 300 plays and directed about 100 others,  
featuring stars such as Dame May Whitty in ``Night Must Fall'' and 
Charlton Heston in ``Bell, Book and Candle.''

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Nieson Himmel, an eccentric newsroom  
character who rubbed elbows with gangsters and celebrities while 
covering every major Los Angeles crime story since World War II, 
died Saturday of pneumonia-related complications. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
	The Los Angeles Times reporter had been off work since February,  
after collapsing in the newsroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Himmel earned his reputation in the 1940s and 1950s covering the  
infamous Black Dahlia murder and the shooting of gangster Bugsy 
Siegel, spending 22 years with the now-defunct Los Angeles 
Herald-Examiner. 
</P>
<P>
	During the late '40s, Himmel befriended everyone from gangsters  
and call girls to con men and cops, often arriving at crime scenes 
before police and occasionally knocking back drinks with his 
sources when the night was through. 
</P>
<P>
	Himmel left the Herald-Examiner during a strike in the 1960s and  
worked for the City News Service before joining the Times in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
	Himmel spent most nights at his desk in recent years, monitoring  
police and fire department scanners.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Garson Kanin, a prolific playwright who created  
the Broadway and Hollywood classic ``Born Yesterday,'' died 
Saturday after a long illness. He was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Kanin's place in entertainment history would have been assured  
had he done no more than write and direct ``Born Yesterday,'' the 
oft-revived play that made Judy Holliday a star of the theater in 
1946 and won her an Oscar for the movie version in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
	In collaboration with his wife of 43 years, actress Ruth Gordon,  
he wrote the screenplays of Tracy and Hepburn's ``Adam's Rib'' in 
1949 and ``Pat and Mike'' in 1952. He and his wife also received an 
Academy Award nomination for writing ``A Double Life,'' the 1948 
movie for which Ronald Colman received a best-actor Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Gordon died in 1985. In 1990, Kanin married actress Marian  
Seldes, who was with him when he died. 
</P>
<P>
	Kanin claimed collaboration in the first Tracy-Hepburn teaming,  
``Woman of the Year,'' in 1942. His brother, Michael Kanin, and 
Ring Lardner Jr. were the officially credited writers and won an 
Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said ``The More the Merrier,'' the delicious 1943 comedy  
of wartime Washington, was his brainchild, but the screenplay is 
credited to four other writers. 
</P>
<P>
	As an officer in an Army film unit during World War II, Kanin  
was co-director, with Carol Reed, of ``The True Glory,'' which won 
the Oscar for best documentary in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
	He wrote 14 books and published numerous articles and short

<HEADLINE> Flutie To Sign Extension With Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- Doug Flutie reached agreement today on  
a contract extension with Buffalo that will give the Bills two $5 
million quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie was expected to sign the four-year, $22 million deal  
Tuesday. The extension will pay the Pro Bowl quarterback $6 million 
up front. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie's Boston-based agent, Jack Mula, who last week called the  
month-long negotiations ``arduous,'' said the deal was all but 
wrapped up over the weekend, when Flutie spoke by telephone with 
Bills owner Ralph Wilson and expressed a desire to remain with the 
Bills. 
</P>
<P>
	``Buffalo is the team that gave Doug a chance,'' Mula said. ``He  
still wants to give something back. Buffalo put the money where the 
mouth is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rob Johnson, last year's starter until going out with a rib  
injury in the fifth game, signed a $25 million contract last 
offseason. Flutie took over and led the Bills to a 10-6 record and 
a wild-card playoff berth after they started the season 0-3. 
</P>
<P>
	The cash crunch at the quarterback position made for tough  
negotiations, Mula said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Buffalo had to find a way to reward Flutie while keeping Rob  
Johnson,'' Mula said. ``That's why it was difficult. I'm happy. 
Doug's happy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``They're paying two quarterbacks over $5 million per year.  
That's a first for the National Football League.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson said at the league meetings in Phoenix that the team  
``needs two No. 1 quarterbacks'' and will keep both Johnson and 
Flutie. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will not cut or trade Rob Johnson,'' Wilson said with  
emphasis. 
</P>
<P>
	After Flutie secured the starting job last season, Johnson said,  
``If it does (go on beyond this year), I probably won't be here. 
You can't pay a guy this much to be a backup, and I'm not a backup 
in this league.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson also said he would re-evaluate the situation with agent  
Leigh Steinberg after the season if he remained the No. 2 guy. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie is just the latest veteran quarterback to parlay a strong  
1998 season into a big contract. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Jets quarterback Vinny Testaverde received a $19.5  
million three-year extension, and Randall Cunningham reportedly 
received a $25 million deal from Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Testaverde took New York to a 12-4 record and the AFC East  
title. He was 12-1 after replacing Glenn Foley as starter, and 
threw 29 TD passes with only seven interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a Pro Bowl year and selection as NFL Comeback Player of  
the Year, Flutie's status for next season remained uncertain after 
the 1998 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Flutie signed as a free agent after eight seasons in the  
Canadian Football League and was told he would have a shot at the 
starting job in Buffalo. But he became Johnson's backup even before 
training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	He posted a 7-3 mark in his starts, including 5-1 in six home  
starts, and completed 57.1 percent of his passes for 2,711 yards 
and 20 touchdowns.

<HEADLINE> Air Force Board Issues Crash Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Pilot error, training shortfalls and burnout  
were among the causes of a crash of two Air Force helicopters that 
killed 12 airmen, military investigators say. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force on Monday released an overview of the  
investigation into the Sept. 3 accident of two Pavehawk 
helicopters. Col. Denver Pletcher said one helicopter had a new 
instructor pilot, a marginally qualified copilot and an unqualified 
gunner. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that if any one of the crew members in those critical  
positions we mentioned had been different or more experienced, this 
accident might not have happened,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The two helicopters were taking part in a mock rescue at night  
when one helicopter struck the second craft, tearing into the 
cockpit with its rotor. The two helicopters crashed 65 miles 
northwest of Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	Pletcher also said the victims, members of the 66th Rescue  
Squadron, were ``operating at a constant state of surge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All four pilots in this accident weren't as sharp as they  
could have been simply because they deployed too much,'' Pletcher 
said. ``The result in this case was chronic fatigue and burnout.''

<HEADLINE>  Gephardt Endorses Gore in 2000 Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore, in a show of  
political force to kick off his 2000 presidential campaign, secured 
the endorsements Monday of House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt and 
party stalwarts from the early battleground states of New Hampshire 
and Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	With onstage hugs from Gephardt, Gore implored a New Hampshire  
crowd to ``stand with me,'' then flew to Iowa and later to his 
onetime rival's hometown of St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would all be proud to have him as president of the United  
States,'' said the Missouri lawmaker, who opted out of the 
presidential race Feb. 3 to focus his energies on becoming speaker 
of the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt's announcement reflects the desire of top Democrats to  
settle the presidential nomination early and set their sights on 
winning both the House and White House in November 2000. President 
Clinton long ago pledged to help Gore get elected, guaranteeing his 
understudy an advantage not always bestowed upon vice presidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley is the only announced  
challenger for the party's presidential nomination, though civil 
rights activist Jesse Jackson may enter the fray. 
</P>
<P>
	Lagging in polls, Bradley hopes to build a resurgent campaign  
that catches fire at the grass roots. He is buoyed by evidence of 
potential Gore weakness in the general election. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to have a nominee who can win,'' Bradley said.  
</P>
<P>
	Gore plans to capitalize on the popularity of Clinton  
initiatives while at the same time distinguishing himself from his 
boss. 
</P>
<P>
	The difficulty of this balancing act was evident at a New  
Hampshire news conference. Gore said he will ``face entirely new 
challenges, and we need new answers.'' Yet his answers sounded 
familiar: Reduce class sizes, make preschool available to all 
students and improve health care. Clinton has pressed those ideas, 
but Gore promises to push them further. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't want to join us in bringing radical change to  
public education, stand out of the way,'' he told a crowd of 400 
New Hampshire activists at a boisterous indoor rally. 
</P>
<P>
	With hardly a mention of his boss, Gore shouted again and again:  
``Stand with me!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt and Gore hugged after their speeches, raising their  
hands high. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair headed next to Iowa, hitting in one day the two states  
that cast the earliest votes in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of about 300 greeted Gore in Iowa, fewer than the number  
who attended a rally by Republican presidential hopeful Elizabeth 
Dole last week. Gore said he feels ``connected to the great civil 
rights struggles of this century, and I believe they must be merely 
the foundation for the great civil rights victories of the 21st 
century. We will not go back. Stand with me, and we will break down 
the barriers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In rolling out the endorsements on his first official political  
trip of the campaign, Gore hoped to develop a sense of 
inevitability about his nomination even before he formally 
announces his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a reflection of reality,'' David Rohde, a professor of  
political science at Michigan State University, said of Gephardt's 
endorsement. ``He and everyone else thinks Gore will be the 
nominee. What Gephardt wants is to be speaker -- and it's better to 
be part of a team than to hold back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press, Gore said he is  
taking nothing for granted. ``I welcome a spirited contest,'' he 
said. ``I always expect it.'' He promised to return to both states 
to campaign in living rooms and coffee shops. 
</P>
<P>
	During the three-state swing, Gore also locked down the  
endorsements of Bill Shaheen, husband of New Hampshire Gov. Jeanne 
Shaheen, and prominent Democrats in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Hampshire governor and Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack are still  
neutral, though Shaheen is said to be leaning heavily toward Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	The same polls that show Gore with a wide lead over Bradley  
offer hints at weakness. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest Wall Street Journal-NBC poll shows Gore 18 percentage  
points behind Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the early favorite for the 
Republican nomination. Gore did not mention Bush but criticized his 
father's ``failed prescriptions of the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, a CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll found Gore not only  
trailing Bush, 56 percent to 41 percent, but also Mrs. Dole, 52 
percent to 44 percent. The survey of 1,025 people carried a margin 
of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	A Pew Research Center survey found nearly half of independent  
voters and 16 percent of likely Democratic voters said they had 
ruled out voting for Gore. The same poll showed that 76 percent of 
independents and 53 percent of Democrats said they would consider 
voting for Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I were the Gore campaign I would be concerned,'' said  
Democratic consultant David Axelrod of Chicago. ``But I wouldn't 
panic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Gore worked from the White House to lay claim to a  
series of bite-size initiatives popular among suburban voters, such 
as promising to ease traffic jams. Fine ideas, Democrats say, but 
he needs to leave Clinton's side to promote his own agenda. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not sure about that ribbon-cutting strategy. That one  
makes me nervous,'' Axelrod said. ``I think it just underscores the 
second-banana thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans say Gore won't escape Clinton's policies or  
controversies. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is the Velcro to Clinton's Teflon,'' said GOP media  
strategist Alex Castellanos. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore proved last week that he can make mistakes. He claimed that  
he created the Internet, giving Republicans reason to howl. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after announcing he would not be a presidential  
candidate, Gephardt told Gore over lunch that he would endorse him. 
Gore's campaign saved the announcement until they could get the 
greatest attention for it. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore will formally declare his candidacy later this year.

<HEADLINE> Clinton OKs $450M in Farm Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton has agreed to a stopgap  
measure that makes more than $450 million in farm loans available 
for financially strapped farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure will ``accelerate the availability of federally  
guaranteed loans to our nation's farmers and ranchers to give them 
continued access to credit,'' Clinton said in signing the measure 
into law Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The law covers funds that had been limited to the Beginning  
Farmers and Ranchers program until April 1. After that date, the 
government could make it available to anyone eligible for the 
Agriculture Department guaranteed loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the money is not expected to be used under that program,  
lawmakers passed a measure to allow its immediate use. 
</P>
<P>
	The money is intended to bridge the gap for farmers until  
Congress has a chance to act on Clinton's request for $153 million 
in extra money this year for emergency loans and to hire temporary 
government workers to handle the heavy disaster assistance demand. 
</P>
<P>
	The Agriculture Department has said the past year of low prices  
has sent farmers racing for loans, nearly depleting its funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I call on the Congress to work expeditiously to include these  
amounts in a supplemental bill I can sign that does not include 
unwise and unnecessary offsets,'' Clinton said.

	MODESTO, Calif. (AP) -- About 1,000 people marched in a ``vigil  
of hope'' to lend comfort to two families searching for their 
relatives who disappeared one month ago while visiting Yosemite 
National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those who attended Sunday's march were the families of  
Carole Sund, her 15-year-old daughter Julie and 16-year-old 
Argentine exchange student Silvina Pelosso. 
</P>
<P>
	Silvina's mother, Raquel Pelosso, said it ``makes you feel  
better to know you have so much support from the community. Perhaps 
something can come out of this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three women were last seen at a lodge near Yosemite. Their  
rental car is still missing and Mrs. Sund's wallet was found in 
Modesto. No suspects have been named. 
</P>
<P>
	A relative said Mrs. Sund's husband, Jens, did not attend  
because he was emotionally exhausted and had returned to the 
family's home in Eureka. Sund issued a statement saying, ``We are 
reminded of the fact Julie is missing because of the silence of the 
piano and the phone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other family members who spoke at the vigil included Mrs. Sund's  
father and mother. They were comforted by the families of other 
missing children. 
</P>
<P>
	A poem written by daughter Regina Sund was read: ``At a time  
when I need my mother's touch most, all I see of her are pictures 
nailed to a post. When it is time for bed, I rock myself to 
sleep.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the people attending the vigil was Minnie Norrell of  
Pittsburg, whose 15-year-old daughter, Lisa, disappeared in 
November after a party and was found slain days later near a garden 
center in Antioch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I sat down the whole eight days my daughter was  
gone,'' she said. ``I just kept looking out the window.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	DAKOTA CITY, Neb. (AP) -- IBP Inc., the world's largest supplier  
of fresh beef and pork to stores and restaurants, plans to expand 
its reach directly onto grocery shelves with its own brand of meat 
products. 
</P>
<P>
	The company announced Monday that it has hired an advertising  
firm to create a national brand name for a new line of uncooked and 
cooked beef and pork products. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to be the preferred meat brand in categories in which  
we compete,'' IBP spokesman Gary Mickelson said. 
</P>
<P>
	In another step toward diversification, IBP said last week it  
will purchase H&AMP;M Food Systems Co. from Specialty Foods Corp. of 
Deerfield, Ill. H&AMP;M produces pizza toppings, soups, sauces and side 
dishes for restaurants and other food service companies.

	CIA To Probe China Spy Allegations  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The CIA announced today it is launching a  
probe into whether China gained top-secret know-how on building 
multiple-warhead nuclear weapons from a Taiwanese-born scientist 
who worked at Los Alamos National Laboratory. CIA Director George 
Tenet said retired Adm. David Jeremiah will conduct an independent 
review of the work now being done by a multiagency intelligence 
team. It is the second such assessment Jeremiah has been asked to 
oversee since last year, when he led a team that found weaknesses 
in intelligence community procedures that contributed to the CIA's 
failure to provide adequate warning that India was about to test a 
nuclear weapon.

	Cuba Sentences 4 Dissidents to Jail  
</P>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Risking international criticism, the government  
today sentenced one of Cuba's best-known dissidents to five years 
in prison and set lesser terms for his three co-defendants. The 
sentences could hold international repercussions for Cuba, which 
has worked to improve its ties with other nations, particularly in 
the Caribbean and Latin America. Several European nations pressured 
Cuba to free the four dissidents, who were arrested in 1997 for 
criticizing a Communist Party document that they said did not 
present solutions to Cuba's severe economic problems. Cuba insists 
there are no political prisoners and reject the characterization of 
the four dissidents as prisoners of conscience.

	Ethnic Albanians 'Ready To Sign'  
</P>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Kosovo Albanians told mediators they would agree to  
a pact that gives them autonomy but keeps the province within Serb 
borders. Prospects haven't looked good for a Serb-ethnic Albanian 
deal, with the Serbs refusing the deployment of NATO troops. The 
Kosovo Albanians, who represent 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million 
people, had also been reluctant to sign because they are not 
getting the independence they seek, and their guerrillas would have 
to be disarmed. More than 2,000 people have died and 300,000 have 
lost their homes in a year of fighting in Kosovo between the 
secessionist Kosovo rebels and Serbian security forces.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno says a new  
public-private alliance to curb Internet crime will help teach 
children ``that hacking is the same as breaking and entering.'' She 
announced the formation of a new education campaign that's designed 
to promote cyberspace ethics and help law enforcement officials 
track down online criminals. It also features a ``personnel 
exchange program'' between private business and federal agencies in 
which both will learn how the other responds to threats and crimes

to face charges involving torture, killings and mass persecution. 
The trial of 77-year-old Dinko Sakic was delayed Friday after he 
fainted and was hospitalized with severe circulatory problems and 
high blood pressure. Sakic is charged with having a role in the 
deaths of some 2,000 inmates during the eight months he commanded 
the Jasenovac camp in 1944. He could face up to 20 years in prison 
if convicted.

	Y2K Fix May Only Last a Generation

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Analysts say the most common method used to  
fix computers vulnerable to Year 2000 glitches is only a short-term 
remedy and advocates of the technique say it will need other costly 
repairs or replacements within a generation. One expert describes 
computers already fixed with the technique, called ``windowing'' as 
``little ticking time bombs waiting to go off.'' It's being used 
because it saves money and experts hope it will prove adequate 
until these computers are replaced -- or until programmers can 
devote enough time and money to make permanent repairs.

<HEADLINE> Loser in Nigeria Vote Files Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- The loser of Nigeria's presidential  
election filed a protest of last month's results Monday, despite 
fears a dispute could derail the West African nation's return to 
civilian rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Finance Minister Olu Falae, who was defeated by retired  
Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo, led a team of lawyers into the Court of 
Appeals in Abuja to file the protest. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Nigerians, including those who didn't support Obasanjo,  
oppose challenging the vote. There is widespread fear that a 
protest would simply encourage Nigeria's military -- with its long 
history of coups -- to seize power again, or to postpone the May 29 
handover to civilian rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Falae said many people had discouraged him from filing a  
protest. 
</P>
<P>
	``Very few have said `go to court,''' he said. ``But my  
conscience has told me to go to court and to court I am going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The protest accuses Obasanjo's agents of offering money, rice,  
curry and salt to buy votes before, and on the day of, the Feb. 27 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
	It also says Obasanjo was not a valid candidate because of his  
alleged membership in a secret society and because he had been 
convicted of treason. 
</P>
<P>
	Obasanjo is reportedly a member of the Ogboni, one of a number  
of Nigerian secret societies that include some of the nation's most 
powerful businessmen and politicians. Nigeria's elections rules 
preclude members of secret societies from running for president. 
</P>
<P>
	The treason allegation stems from Obasanjo's conviction for  
participating in an alleged 1995 coup plot against Nigeria's former 
dictator, Gen. Sani Abacha. The plot is widely believed to have 
been invented by Abacha to imprison his political enemies. Obasanjo 
was pardoned and released from prison after Abacha's death in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Obasanjo won the elections with 63 percent of the vote. Nigerian  
and international monitors have also criticized the election, 
saying supporters of both candidates engaged in ballot-box stuffing 
and inflated vote returns.

<HEADLINE> Times Delayed China Espionage Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- At the request of the FBI, The New York Times  
held up for one day a front-page story about China's theft of U.S. 
nuclear secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper refused a second request from the FBI to hold the  
story for another day. 
</P>
<P>
	The article said that China had miniaturized its nuclear bombs  
using information stolen from Los Alamos National Laboratory in New 
Mexico. The story was supposed to run on March 5. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI asked the Times to delay the article because the main  
suspect in the theft, a Taiwanese-American scientist, was due to be 
interviewed by the bureau that day. 
</P>
<P>
	The story contained at least two facts the scientist didn't  
know, including his failing a lie detector test, Times executive 
editor Joseph Lelyveld told The Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	Lelyveld told the Post that when the FBI asked the Times to hold  
off for a second day, he said he would only do so if FBI Director 
Louis Freeh called him directly. When Freeh failed to call by 7 
p.m., Lelyveld went ahead with the story. It appeared March 6. 
</P>
<P>
	The story did not name the suspect, Wen Ho Lee. Two days later,  
he was fired. He has not been charged. 
</P>
<P>
	Times spokeswoman Lisa Carparelli confirmed that the Times  
delayed publication for a day at the FBI's request. She was unable 
to provide further details. 
</P>
<P>
	Lelyveld did not immediately return a call for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Bill Carver, an FBI spokesman in Washington, refused to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Columbia Journalism Review editor Marshall Loeb said the  
practice of editors delaying stories at the request of government 
officials is appropriately rare. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is legitimate for an editor to hold a story for a brief  
period if he or she has persuasive reason to believe that reporting 
it might endanger national security or hurt a significant criminal 
investigation,'' Loeb said. ``But such withholding should be done 
only rarely and only when a really important issue is at stake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Loeb said the most famous example of a newspaper honoring such a  
request was when President Kennedy asked the Times to withhold 
disclosing the Bay of Pigs invasion before it began. 
</P>
<P>
	``They withheld it much to the regret of one and all,'' Loeb  
said. ``Had the information been revealed, there might have been 
sufficient public outcry to get the whole operation called off. In 
the end, the operation was a total fiasco.''

<HEADLINE>  Flyers Still Stuck in Losing Streak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Finally, there was some fight in the  
Philadelphia Flyers. Of course, it came from captain Eric Lindros. 
</P>
<P>
	Since arriving in Philadelphia seven years ago, Lindros has come  
to personify a proud organization that even in down years has been 
about toughness and aggression. 
</P>
<P>
	Though they showed signs of life in a 1-1 tie with NHL-leading  
Dallas Sunday night, the Flyers are still mired in their longest 
winless streak in 28 years. Where do the Flyers go from here? 
</P>
<P>
	``The worst thing to do when things are not going well is sit  
back and give your problems to somebody else,'' said Lindros, who 
took the Flyers' slump into his own hands by starting a fight with 
Stars captain Derian Hatcher 40 seconds into the game. ``... We 
need a win. I guess we'll have to wait until Tuesday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers, who have plummeted from first to fifth in the  
Eastern Conference in only a month, are 0-7-4 during an 11-game 
winless streak that ties the franchise record set in the 1968-69 
season and equalled in 1970-71. A loss or tie in St. Louis Tuesday 
night would set a club record for futility. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flyers are 2-11-5 since going unbeaten in 23 of 24 games  
from Dec. 12 to Feb. 6, a confounding turnaround that no one in the 
organization seems able to explain. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Bob Clarke and Roger Neilson canceled a team  
retreat planned for New Orleans this week. After playing in St. 
Louis Tuesday night, the Flyers return to Philadelphia to practice 
instead of heading for Bourbon Street. 
</P>
<P>
	``First off, we don't deserve to be going,'' Lindros said. ``If  
we played the way we did tonight the previous three weeks, we'd be 
going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after Flyers chairman Ed Snider questioned the team's  
mental toughness, Clarke gave the players a stern talk several 
hours before Sunday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came in and gave a talk about the Flyers organization and  
what was expected,'' Neilson said. ``It was a good strong talk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though he said he didn't mind, it must have been an eerie  
situation for Neilson, presumably the ruler of the locker room. 
While Neilson is the coach, he's been a member of the organization 
for less than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Clarke, the captain of Philadelphia's last Stanley Cup  
championship team in 1974, viewed himself as a much better choice 
for a speech about what it means to be a Flyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes a different voice telling them the same thing  
helps,'' Clarke said. 
</P>
<P>
	Several players revealed that Clarke's speech was mostly about  
playing physical hockey, a trait that has always personified the 
Broad Street Bullies but has been absent during the month-long 
slide. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just talked about playing hockey, taking the body,''  
forward Jody Hull said. ``We talked about having trust that if 
something broke down you'd have your teammate right there behind 
you to help out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros wouldn't comment on Clarke's meeting, but no one seemed  
the least but surprised by it. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's to be expected when things are going that bad,''  
defenseman Eric Desjardins said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Neilson, Clarke mentioned nothing about fighting.  
But the Flyers' inexplicable failure to protect each other -- and 
retaliate for physical play -- has been one of the disturbing 
developments during their slump. 
</P>
<P>
	Just as he did when Clarke challenged him to become the best  
player in hockey during the offseason, Lindros took Clarke's 
challenge personally. Immediately after the opening faceoff, he ran 
at Hatcher with the obvious intention of starting a fight -- with 
the toughest player on the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Though they still didn't eliminate defensive giveaways that have  
hounded them, at least the Flyers looked interested, hit hard and 
stuck up for each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros' next job is to show his teammates how to win again.  
</P>
<P>
	``He showed to everybody on the other side that he was here for  
a war, for a battle,'' Desjardins said. ``I think we followed him 
well after that. That's what we've got to do. That's what we need 
from him. We can't just watch what he's going to do, we've got to 
do it.''

<HEADLINE> Experts Want To Keep Smallpox Stock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Smallpox has been eradicated worldwide, but  
U.S. experts say laboratory specimens of the virus should be 
preserved to make vaccines in case the deadly disease is ever used 
as a bioterrorist weapon. 
</P>
<P>
	Smallpox cursed humanity with disease, death and disfigurement  
for more than 1,000 years but was wiped out as a naturally 
occurring disease in 1980 after a worldwide inoculation effort. 
</P>
<P>
	The World Health Organization has recommended destroying, by  
this June, two small caches of specimens that were believed to 
remain, one in Russia, the other in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	But bioterrorism experts have said in recent months they believe  
the virus has been distributed to other spots in Russia, perhaps in 
places with less effective security controls. 
</P>
<P>
	That information originates with a former high Soviet research  
official, Ken Alibek, who defected to the United States in 1992 and 
testified before Congress last May. Alibek's information has been 
verified by others, according to smallpox experts who spoke at a 
recent bioterrorism conference sponsored by Johns Hopkins 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	That raises the possibility the smallpox virus could get into  
the hands of those who would try to use it in bioterrorism weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	A study released Monday by experts at the National Academy of  
Science's Institute of Medicine recommends that the surviving 
laboratory specimens of smallpox be kept alive as a safety net in 
case the disease breaks out again. 
</P>
<P>
	The study warns that with much of the world's population no  
longer protected by inoculation against smallpox, the virus could 
pose a serious threat. Most Americans below 30 have never had the 
inoculation, and remaining smallpox vaccinations stocks could treat 
only about 6 million people. Even those supplies are deteriorating. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most compelling need for long-term retention ... would be  
the development of antiviral agents or novel vaccines to protect 
against a re-emergence ... due to accident or intentional 
release,'' the study said. 
</P>
<P>
	An outbreak of smallpox, said the report, ``would likely spread  
widely before being recognized and before appropriate 
countermeasures could be put in place.'' The report noted that an 
airborne spray of the virus ``is considered a serious threat as a 
biological weapon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smallpox is highly contagious and kills about 20 percent of  
those afflicted. 
</P>
<P>
	If the live specimens of smallpox virus are preserved,  
scientists could develop antiviral drugs that could be used in the 
event smallpox returns or becomes a weapon, the committee said. 
</P>
<P>
	The development of a new vaccine against the disease also would  
require that virus stocks be kept alive, the study found. Also, if 
science is to learn how to quickly detect smallpox in the 
environment, more research is needed with the live virus. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, the study found that the live smallpox virus is needed  
to learn how the organism attacks the human immune system and how 
the body responds. 
</P>
<P>
	``The weight of scientific opinion suggests that continuing  
investigation of (smallpox) could lead to new and important 
discoveries with real potential for improving human health,'' the 
report says. 
</P>
<P>
	But the committee also admitted that as long as live stocks of  
smallpox exist, a risk remains that the virus could get loose into 
the population, either accidentally or maliciously. 
</P>
<P>
	``The risks ... might well outweigh the benefits,'' the report  
said. ``If they are retained, however, they could offer the 
possibility of scientific advances that could not be otherwise 
achieved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Academy of Sciences, the parent of the Institute of  
Medicine, is a private group of scientists chartered by Congress as 
an adviser to the federal government. The World Health Organization 
has said it plans to review the plan to eradicate the stocks in 
May. 
</P>
<P>
	If the smallpox vaccines were eradicated as the World Health  
Organization has recommended, it would be the first time in history 
that people planned and carried out the formal eradication of a 
complete species.

<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Maud Morgan, an artist who exhibited  
with Jackson Pollock, Mark Rothko and Barnett Newman and was a 
mentor to the young Frank Stella and Carl Andre, died Sunday. She 
was 96. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Morgan worked in abstract and representational styles. She  
drew and painted in watercolors, oils, and gouache. She also 
created collages, made prints and worked with handmade paper. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, her work was bought by the Museum of Modern Art,  
the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum. 
</P>
<P>
	She exhibited her paintings for 50 years at the Addison Gallery  
of American Art in Andover.

</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Commodore William Eldon Warwick, the first captain  
of the Queen Elizabeth 2, the world's best-known cruise ship, died 
Feb. 27 at age 86. The cause of death was not announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Warwick, who was known as Bil, participated in the vessel's May  
1969 maiden voyage across the Atlantic, steered the ship around the 
globe and dined with royalty, world leaders and celebrities. 
</P>
<P>
	Warwick began his career in the British merchant navy in 1928,  
serving in the Indian Ocean and Red Sea. During World War II, he 
enlisted in the Royal Navy. After the war, he joined Cunard and 
took charge of his first passenger vessel, the Carinthia, in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
	He went on to command almost every passenger liner in the Cunard  
fleet, including the Queen Mary and the Queen Elizabeth. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1966, he won the sought-after assignment as master to QE2,  
which was still under construction. 
</P>
<P>
	Warwick, who received a CBE, or Commander of the Order of the  
British Empire, from Queen Elizabeth II in 1971, died weeks before 
he was due to make another voyage across the Atlantic on the QE2 as 
part of the ship's 30th anniversary celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
	His son, Ronald, is now the vessel's commodore.

<HEADLINE> Ousted IOC Official Criticizes Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- IOC rules against accepting lavish  
benefits from bid cities were unrealistically aimed at ``angels and 
saints,'' said the ousted member who allegedly gained the most in 
the Salt Lake bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean-Claude Ganga of the Congo Republic, expelled for accepting  
$270,000 in cash, travel, medical care and other gifts from Utah 
bidders, said the International Olympic Committee's rules were 
wrong and should have been flouted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Laws are made by men. It's not the laws that make the man,''  
Ganga said Monday. ``If you can't adapt laws to different 
situations, because man is not a machine, those laws are bad and 
must be changed. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``The Olympic Games and the Olympic movement are organized by  
individuals. They are not angels and saints. If you want angels and 
saints, go organize the Olympic Games in heaven, not on earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The worst scandal in Olympic history had driven a stake into the  
IOC's heart, Ganga said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is the objective of the Olympic movement? It's to bring  
together the different colors and different continents,'' he said. 
``Today it's a corruption syndrome. People are afraid to talk to 
each other, to do business, to have meetings, to eat. Is that the 
objective of the Olympic movement?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga is among six members ousted by IOC leaders in their  
investigation of a $1.2 million vote-buying scheme run by the bid 
that won Salt Lake the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The expulsions will be voted upon by 91 IOC members Wednesday,  
with a two-thirds vote needed to uphold the leadership's actions. 
Officials said it was up to the assembly, meeting in an emergency 
session, to decide if the vote would be by a show of hands or 
secret ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever method is chosen, Ganga said he would fight hard to  
hold onto the seat he has held since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are here to win,'' his son Jean-Noel said following a news  
conference at which his father denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean-Claude Ganga said his ouster was part of a ``plot against  
the Third World'' and ``a decision to exclude Africa from the 
center of decision making in world sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the six members expelled were from African countries,  
with the others from Latin America and Samoa. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga also said he was being punished for leading the African  
boycott of the 1976 Montreal Games, and that the whole 
investigation revolved around efforts to pick a successor to Juan 
Antonio Samaranch as IOC president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three of the members on the (inquiry) commission have said  
they might run for president,'' he said, referring to chairman Dick 
Pound of Canada, Pal Schmitt of Hungary and Jacques Rogge of 
Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound called Ganga's charges ``completely wrong.''  
</P>
<P>
	``None of the investigations or recommendations were politically  
motivated. ... ,'' Pound said at a separate news conference. ``The 
past is the past. More important is the present.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a 1 1/2-hour session with reporters in the 5-star hotel where  
the IOC members -- including those expelled -- are staying, Ganga 
said he accepted only token gifts from Salt Lake and paid or tried 
to pay for other items identified as freebies. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he put $70,000 earmarked for African sports programs  
into his own Utah bank account to avoid currency transfer delays, 
and that the money wound up where is was supposed to. He said he 
had documents to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
	Gifts such as a refrigerator and fax machine listed in ethics  
reports as going back to his Brazzaville home were just extra 
furnishings in a Salt Lake hotel suite he stayed in, put there 
without his asking, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be polite,'' he said. '' You can't ask them to  
take it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga said he tried to pay for treatment of hepatitis C at  
Latter Day Saints Hospital in Salt Lake but was told there was no 
bill. He produced a letter from Dr. Terry Box, the liver specialist 
who treated Ganga, confirming his recollection that the African 
official ``insisted on paying me for my services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake organizers picked up the tab, but Ganga showed a  
letter from a Luxembourg insurer, Deutsche Krankenversicherung, 
that said his medal policy would have covered the treatment and 
hospitalization in full. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, he contradicted statements by former Salt Lake  
Olympic chief Tom Welch that Ganga cleared the hospital stay 
beforehand with Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why should I call him? I was paying.'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ganga denied that his wife had cosmetic surgery paid for by the  
bid, although he conceded she had ``problems with skin on her 
hands'' and may have received some treatment. Knee replacement 
surgery for his mother-in-law, he said, was arranged by Welch after 
he visited Ganga's home and found the woman had to be carried to 
the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	To get to Salt Lake for the operation, Ganga said, he paid for  
tickets for himself, his wife and mother-in-law from Brazzaville to 
Paris, with Salt Lake flying them the rest of the way on tickets 
provided as part of Delta Airlines' sponsorship. Ganga said there 
was nothing improper about such perks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Salt Lake City had a sponsorship with Delta, what is wrong  
with that?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said that he had found credit-card receipts showing he  
paid for items such as draperies that had been listed as gifts from 
Salt Lake. He accused some Utah Olympic workers of seeking 
reimbursement for items they bought for themselves, singling out 
Jason Gull, a student at the time and the Ganga's escort when they 
were in Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	An Utah ethics report said Ganga and his wife maxed out Gull's  
credit cards on shopping sprees. That report said Ganga's activity 
``merits special mention.''

<HEADLINE> NTSB Reviewing 737 Safety Fixes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government safety officials are considering  
whether to recommend wholesale changes to the rudders of Boeing 
737s after an incident last month raised doubts about previous 
modifications of the world's mostly widely used airliner. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal and private aviation officials thought they had fixed  
problems with the 737 in a safety effort dating back to a crash 
near Pittsburgh in 1994. But fresh concern was raised on Feb. 23, 
when a MetroJet 737 that had received the post-crash modifications 
started to roll on its own. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the members of the National Transportation Safety Board are  
divided over whether to recommend changes that could cost the 
airlines up to $100 million, or live with the ones that have 
already been made. 
</P>
<P>
	One high-level NTSB official, speaking on the condition of  
anonymity, said the ``tweaks'' ordered by the Federal Aviation 
Administration have not solved anything. 
</P>
<P>
	A resolution may come next week, when the five-member board  
meets to settle on the probable cause of the September 1994 crash 
of USAir Flight 427. That 737 inexplicably spiraled into a ravine 
outside Pittsburgh after a flight from Chicago. All 132 aboard were 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
	The board may also discuss three other incidents: The 1991 crash  
of a United Airlines 737 on approach to Colorado Springs, Colo.; a 
flight control disturbance to an Eastwind 737 on approach to 
Richmond, Va., in 1996; and flight control problems with a United 
Airlines 737 before takeoff from Seattle on Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	In the aftermath of the USAir crash, the NTSB, the FAA and the  
airplane's maker, the Seattle-based Boeing Co., opened an 
investigation that surpassed the TWA Flight 800 inquiry in length 
and will likely run second to it in terms of cost. 
</P>
<P>
	All three entities agree that the rudder on the USAir plane, a  
control surface that runs up the tail and moves the nose left and 
right, went to its full left position shortly after the plane flew 
through the wake of an aircraft ahead of it. 
</P>
<P>
	They disagree about what sent the plane into its 6,000-foot  
death spiral. 
</P>
<P>
	Boeing points to the two-man flight crew, saying they held the  
left rudder pedal to the floor as they tried to regain control. 
</P>
<P>
	``Experienced crews do not always respond to flight path upsets  
in a predictable or routine manner, particularly when they are 
suddenly surprised,'' the company said in a submission to the 
safety board. 
</P>
<P>
	Some investigators believe the rudder control reversed itself,  
so a pilot pressing on the right pedal to straighten the nose would 
have unknowingly held the rudder in the wrong position. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA believes the answer will never be known. Instead, it is  
relying on three mandatory changes made in the aftermath of the 
crash: a redesign of the rudder's hydraulic control unit to prevent 
rudder reversal, new training for crews in handling turbulence and 
a reduction in the amount of rudder a pilot can apply in high-risk 
situations. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have attempted to cover all potential scenarios because  
there isn't conclusive evidence to identify any one of them,'' said 
Thomas McSweeny, associate FAA administrator for regulation and 
certification. 
</P>
<P>
	Safety board officials aren't so sure. While they don't have the  
power to require changes, their recommendations are widely 
publicized and are likely to resonate with the public. The 737 is 
the most common passenger jet, with nearly 3,000 worldwide. 
Southwest Airlines, the popular discount carrier, has an all-737 
fleet. 
</P>
<P>
	According to those familiar with a draft report of the safety  
board's conclusions, one potential recommendation is to install 
dual power-control devices in older 737s. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently the planes have two primary rudder control systems  
that merge in a single soda can-sized hydraulic device known as the 
power control unit. Boeing and the FAA redesigned the unit in the 
aftermath of the crash and required airlines to install it by 
August. 
</P>
<P>
	Switching to a dual control system would require new hydraulic  
and electrical rigging that could harm other aircraft systems. 
Aviation analysts also say it could cost from $60 million to $100 
million and create considerable aircraft downtime. 
</P>
<P>
	A more benign recommendation is to create redundancy in the  
rudder control system, which some say is accomplished by the 
existing modifications. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of that approach note that the 737 has more than 90  
million flight hours, yet only a limited number of incidents 
traceable to the rudder. 
</P>
<P>
	The MetroJet incident raised fresh concerns, however. The plane,  
flown by the discount subsidiary of the renamed US Airways, started 
to roll while cruising at 33,000 feet from Orlando, Fla., to 
Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	Using training adopted in the aftermath of the Flight 427 crash,  
the pilots regained control of the aircraft and landed safely in 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the concerns, according to the top NTSB official:  
</P>
<P>
	--The MetroJet rudder moved 8.5 degrees off center, perhaps  
indicating a new rudder control problem. 
</P>
<P>
	--The pilots regained control only after switching to backup  
systems and rebalancing engine power, an achievable task at cruise 
altitude but more complicated in the harried moments before 
landing. 
</P>
<P>
	--The power control unit in the MetroJet, which was updated to  
the post-USAir design, showed no problems, which may indicate a 
hidden flaw or problems elsewhere in the rudder system. It runs the 
length of the plane.

<HEADLINE> GPS Technology Used To Nab Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- The television cop shows have it all  
wrong. Fact is, it's virtually impossible to track a crook in an 
unmarked car. 
</P>
<P>
	A better way? Let satellite technology do the legwork.  
</P>
<P>
	Police figured that out here last summer when they followed the  
movements of a Centre County man suspected of setting dozens of 
fires. 
</P>
<P>
	With a warrant from the court, they slipped a Global Positioning  
System receiver on the suspect's Isuzu Trooper. Then, using 
satellites and cell-phone technology, they tracked his movements on 
a laptop back at the station. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's neat, neat stuff,'' said Oak Norton, owner of Intelldex  
Inc., a State College private investigation firm that lent the 
equipment to the police. ``It makes your work a lot easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The companies that sell the GPS trackers are cagey about who  
their police clients are, for fear of blowing a department's cover. 
Law enforcement is also quiet about its use: the FBI would 
``neither confirm nor deny'' employing the technology. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Pennsylvania arson case reveals some the technology's  
power. 
</P>
<P>
	David Beer, 39, became a suspect in the arsons after several  
people said they saw him hanging around Dumpsters that later caught 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Police started tracking Beer covertly. But that took a lot of  
manpower, and involved risk. At one point, an officer watching 
Beer's house barely escaped detection after Beer walked right up to 
the van, pressing his face to the glass to peer inside. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had to stay still,'' Officer Matthew Wilson testified during  
a preliminary hearing. ``Even the chair I was in would have 
squeaked.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the GPS tracker, the officer could have been back at  
headquarters keeping an eye on the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can actually sit at the computer and watch the unit move  
from street to street, town to town,'' Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
	In using the GPS, police occasionally tailed Beer to visually  
confirm he was driving the car and that the car was where the 
program said he was. One hitch: Like a cell phone, the tracker went 
off-line when trees, mountains and buildings blocked the signal. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, authorities said, the device helped link Beer to a  
Sept. 2 fire and hastened his arrest on charges of arson, criminal 
mischief and reckless endangerment for 25 fires, including a car 
fire and an apartment building blaze that caused $500,000 in 
damage. He is awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Beer's attorney, Ron Travis, said he expects to ask the judge to  
suppress the GPS evidence, although he has not thoroughly 
investigated the technology yet. 
</P>
<P>
	An American Civil Liberties Union official said the GPS tracker  
does not concern him any more than normal police surveillance. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that there's some court intervention certainly makes  
it less scary,'' said Larry Frankel, director of the Pennsylvania 
chapter of the ACLU. 
</P>
<P>
	Remote tracking technology has been around for decades, Norton  
said, but most of the receivers could not transmit farther than a 
fraction of a mile. Current systems can track something anywhere in 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
	State College police, who have been promised future access to  
the tracker, are ecstatic about GPS. 
</P>
<P>
	``No. 1, the accuracy of the system is incredible,'' Sgt. John  
Wilson said. ``No. 2, it replaces manpower. This system replaces, 
at a minimum, four people. No. 3 is the covertness of it. The 
target would have no knowledge of this. It reduces the possibility 
of an undercover officer being spotted. And it provides 24-hour 
coverage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The whole system cost $2,400, but Norton lent it to the  
department for free. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted it to stay online 24 hours a day,'' said Tom  
Moody, president of Boulder, Colo.-based Tracking Products Inc, 
which custom-built the system for Norton, then tweaked it for the 
police. ``Man, I don't want to see that cell bill.''

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Derails Outside Chicago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOURBONNAIS, Ill. (AP) -- An Amtrak train carrying between 200  
and 400 passengers derailed after hitting a truck south of Chicago 
Monday night, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	A witness to the accident told WBBM-AM that she could see flames  
inside several of the passenger cars. An Amtrak manager in 
Wilmington, Del., however, said there was a small fire in one 
engine but it was under control. 
</P>
<P>
	The manager, who would not give her name, said two engines  
overturned and four passenger cars derailed. Thirty people have 
been taken to two hospitals, she said. None was in critical 
condition, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	A nursing supervisor at Riverside Medical Center in nearby  
Kankakee said seven victims had been brought to the hospital, 
including one person with an amputated foot and another with head 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak spokeswoman Debbie Hare said the train was made up of two  
engines and 14 passengers cars. She did not know the exact number 
of passengers on board. 
</P>
<P>
	Hare said there were reports that the semi-trailer that collided  
with the train was carrying a heavy load of steel. 
</P>
<P>
	The train, known as City of New Orleans, runs between Chicago  
and New Orleans. It derailed about 50 miles south of Chicago at 
about 9:40 p.m. near Bourbonnais, a police dispatcher said.

<HEADLINE> FAA OKs Sea-Launched Spacecraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government officials said Monday they have  
given the go-ahead for the first space launch from a seagoing 
platform. 
</P>
<P>
	Sea Launch, an international consortium that includes the  
U.S.-based Boeing Co. as a 40 percent partner, will use a 
Ukrainian-built booster rocket and a Russian-built upper stage for 
an unmanned demonstration launch in the Pacific Ocean scheduled for 
March 27. 
</P>
<P>
	The launch platform is a converted self-propelled oil-drilling  
platform. The rockets are transported to the launch site and 
controlled afterward from a separate assembly and command ship. 
</P>
<P>
	Sea Launch is designed to launch communications satellites, and  
it gains several advantages by firing them from a midocean location 
at the Equator. 
</P>
<P>
	It benefits from the maximum rotational forces of Earth, which  
give its rockets extra momentum entering orbit. Also, since large 
geostationary communications satellites must orbit over the 
equator, its position can boost them by the most direct route. 
</P>
<P>
	That allows Sea Launch to lift heavier-than-normal payloads.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is the beginning of an exciting new era in commercial  
space launch activity,'' said a statement issued by FAA

<HEADLINE> Y2K Fix May Only Last a Generation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The most common technique used to fix  
computers vulnerable to Year 2000 failures is only a short-term 
remedy, and even advocates of the method acknowledge it will 
require other expensive repairs or replacements within a 
generation. 
</P>
<P>
	The temporary fix, using a sophisticated twist of logic to fool  
computers, is highly controversial among insiders because it's 
intended to work for only a few decades -- typically 30 years. One 
expert describes computers already fixed with the technique as 
``little ticking time bombs waiting to go off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration and industry analysts estimate the  
method is being used to patch 80 percent of computers in the 
worldwide repair effort expected to cost $300 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K bug exists because some computers and software recognize  
only two-digit years. They won't work properly in 2000, when they 
will assume ``00'' is 1900. If computers aren't fixed, the digital 
meltdown could cause problems for banks, airlines, power and water 
plants and even traffic lights. 
</P>
<P>
	So why is the technique, called ``windowing,'' used at all?  
</P>
<P>
	Simple: It saves money because it's quicker and easier, even if  
it only works for a specific window of time. The permanent fix, 
called ``expansion,'' requires a tedious line-by-line repair of all 
the dates expressed in two-digit years rather than four digits. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts hope ``windowing'' will prove adequate until these  
computers are replaced -- or until programmers can devote enough 
time and money to make permanent repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	In some cases, corporate executives and government bureaucrats  
approved using the method knowing that problems won't resurface 
until after they retire or change jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a Band-Aid, the way building a house out of wood and  
fiberboard is,'' said Jim Duggan, a researcher with the Gartner 
Group consulting company of Stamford, Conn. ``You hope you'll be 
somewhere else before it falls down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It gets them off the hook,'' agreed Michael P. Harden,  
president of Century Technology Services Inc. consultants of 
Fairfax, Va. ``I don't think some people expect to be in those same 
jobs. Fix it now, get everybody off your back -- and in five or 10 
years if there's a problem, you won't be around to have to deal 
with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Marvin Thornton led repair efforts inside one of the nation's  
largest banks, $40 billion Southtrust Corp. in Birmingham, Ala. He 
fought hard against using windowing to fix his bank's computers but 
complained that some contractors insisted on the technique. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really aggravating,'' said Thornton. ``They've taken the  
quick and dirty path and not really fixed the problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government, which expects to spend $6.4 billion and  
has ordered its most important computers fixed by the end of March, 
doesn't discourage agencies from using windowing. But it warns of 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like the Fram oil filter guy: You can pay me now or you  
can pay me later,'' said Keith Rhodes, a technical director at the 
General Accounting Office, which monitors repair efforts at federal 
agencies. ``It's not solving your problem. It's delaying the 
inevitable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some government agencies, such as the Social Security  
Administration, have generally shunned the method. The Internal 
Revenue Service allows it only rarely. The State Department is 
using it on nearly half its most important computers, but also 
plans to replace those systems within five years. 
</P>
<P>
	Other agencies, such as the Federal Aviation Administration,  
freely acknowledge using the technique. The agency's top Y2K 
expert, Ray Long, says he doesn't consider it a problem or even 
just a short-term solution. 
</P>
<P>
	Using windowing, programmers instruct software to guess the  
century for dates that fall within a specific ``window'' of time, 
such as the next three decades. The computer interprets the year 
based on a future so-called hinge date, or pivot, that programmers 
choose arbitrarily. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, a software program with a pivot of ``30'' will  
interpret years ``00'' through ``29'' as 21st century dates, but 
will assume years ``30'' through ``99'' are during the 1900s. Some 
programmers use pivots of ``50'' or ``70'' to buy even more time, 
but their choices are limited by a variety of technical factors. A 
pivot of ``70,'' for example, might cause problems for computers 
trying to process birthdates earlier than 1969. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the pivot date is past, those computers will need to be  
replaced or patched again as they begin quietly contaminating data 
by making wrong assumptions about the century. 
</P>
<P>
	Windowing is fraught with other risks, too. Different programs  
assigned different pivots can cause havoc when companies or 
governments try to share information, unless they take complex 
precautions. 
</P>
<P>
	Testing typically takes longer, too. Windowing problems might  
not appear until January, when computers start guessing which 
century to use, said Noah Ross, a consultant and vice president for 
Cap Gemini Group. In contrast, if the permanent ``expansion'' fix 
is done incorrectly, the problem often is immediately obvious. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an issue of pragmatism,'' explained Ed Yourdon, a  
consultant. ``Anybody who had to go through that choice was very 
much aware of the tradeoffs. We'd like to do it the right way ... 
and we don't have time, so even though it's a quick and dirty 
approach, we have no alternative. Too bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a compromise,'' agreed Duggan. ``People with time and  
money took the high road and did full expansion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most people using windowing realize it's not a permanent  
solution, said Jack Gribben, spokesman for President Clinton's Year 
2000 council. ``The window closes, so to speak, and you're back at 
square one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harden, the private consultant, compared the computers fixed  
with windowing to ``time bombs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll replace this in 20 years, but isn't that exactly the  
same thing we said back in the 60s?'' Harden said. ``The same 
people who created the problem are now fixing it, and installing 
something that will have the very same problem down the road.''

<HEADLINE> New Mosquito Killer Hitting Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST GREENWICH, R.I. (AP) -- Bruce Wigton was swatting mosquitoes  
during a fishing trip in 1990 when he began to plot his revenge 
against the bloodsucking bugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine years later, Wigton has come up with the Mosquito Magnet, a  
device that lures mosquitoes to what they think is a hemoglobin 
snack, but instead sucks them into a bag where they die. 
</P>
<P>
	American Biophysics, which has worked with the U.S. Department  
of Agriculture in developing the product, is selling the Mosquito 
Magnet to resorts in Florida and the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
	The next step is completing the design of a smaller, cheaper  
unit that ``the average person can get into his back yard,'' said 
Wigton, chairman and director of research and development at the 
East Greenwich-based company. 
</P>
<P>
	Mosquitoes may be the most despised insect on earth. Not just an  
annoyance to anglers who enjoy the outdoors, they can be deadly. 
Around the world, more than a million deaths a year are attributed 
to malaria, which is transmitted by mosquito bite, says the World 
Health Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	The main weapons against mosquitoes are pesticides. Others have  
used electric bug zappers, but with little effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Zappers have declined in popularity over the years as  
researchers have pronounced them useless for controlling 
mosquitoes. Instead, they fry moths and other benign bugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Pesticides and bug sprays are more effective, but some question  
their long-term health effects to humans. 
</P>
<P>
	Enter the Mosquito Magnet, which Wigton says only harms nasty,  
bloodsucking bugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mosquito Magnet is fueled by a propane tank like those  
attached to a gas grill. A patented device in the Mosquito Magnet 
creates a catalytic reaction -- essentially combustion without a 
flame -- that converts the propane into carbon dioxide and warm 
water vapor in proportions similar to those in human breath. 
</P>
<P>
	This process generates a small electrical charge that powers the  
machine's fan, which blows out the carbon dioxide, and its vacuum. 
</P>
<P>
	As the gasses waft out, female mosquitoes (males do not bite)  
are duped into thinking they are in the vicinity of human blood. 
</P>
<P>
	A tiny vacuum siphons mosquitoes into a bag, where they die. As  
the egg-laying females are cleaned from an area, the population 
drops, says Raymond Iannetta, president and chief executive officer 
of American Biophysics. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the company has produced only large, industrial-strength  
units -- which sell for $1,295. They have gotten accolades for 
killing not just mosquitoes, but also sand flies -- called 
no-see-ums because they're too small to see. 
</P>
<P>
	Smaller backyard models are to hit the market in late summer,  
with a price tag of about $495. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Morgan, chairman of the exclusive Ocean Reef Club in Key  
Largo, Fla., has bought several machines and ordered more for 
friends and neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first month and a half, Morgan said he had collected a  
bag with more than a million of the tiny bugs. 
</P>
<P>
	American Biophysics had sales of about $225,000 in 1998 and  
hopes to generate revenues of about $8 million this year, said 
Iannetta, who ran and sold several startups before joining the 
company in July. 
</P>
<P>
	American Biophysics has a lot riding on the success of the  
Mosquito Magnet. But Iannetta has motives other than profit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hate mosquitoes,'' he said. ``Kill them all.''

<HEADLINE> Endangered Gray Wolves Hit Forest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- A family of four Mexican gray wolves was  
released Monday into the Apache National Forest, the first freed 
this year in ongoing efforts to restore the endangered species to 
its natural habitat. 
</P>
<P>
	The animals, native to Arizona, New Mexico and northern Mexico,  
had been held for two months in an acclimation pen in the forest. 
</P>
<P>
	``These wolves were fairly anxious to run free,'' said Dave  
Parsons, head of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Mexican gray 
wolf recovery program. ``One of the wolves was out before the 
biologists could retreat from the pen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two other adults have been free since December, but the program  
got off to a rocky start in 1998 when ultimately five of 11 animals 
released were shot to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Plans call for another 11 wolves to be put into the wild this  
spring during the breeding season, including a pair that in 
mid-April will be carried by pack mules in specially built crates 
into the roadless Blue Range Primitive Area in eastern Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	That pair will be ``hard-released'' directly into the wilderness  
area without any transition period, Parsons said: ``It gives us a 
chance to put wolves in a much more remote area, deep in the Blue 
Range.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All the animals being released will have brightly colored  
fluorescent collars to enable hunters to distinguish them from 
coyotes. The collars emit radio transmitter signals for biologists 
to track. 
</P>
<P>
	The multi-agency federal and state program has changed its  
approaches in its second year after ranchers and many other 
residents were critical of the wolf releases, Parsons said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, most of the release sites will be more remote, there will  
be more law enforcement agents in those areas, including covert 
officers, and there will be a greater outreach effort to residents, 
forest users and hunters' organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mexican gray wolf was hunted to near extinction about 50  
years ago.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Olympic Tickets Go on Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Fans wanting to purchase tickets for  
the 2000 Sydney Olympics will have to wait a little longer. 
</P>
<P>
	Tickets for the games officially went on sale Monday, but people  
were only able to request brochures that will be sent out by Cartan 
Tours Inc., the U.S. Olympic Committee's official travel agent. 
</P>
<P>
	``The brochure is available today and people will get it in the  
mail in a week or two,'' said Don Williams, Cartan's vice president 
of marketing and sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said the United States has been allotted 200,000 of the  
9.6 million tickets, but the company has requested 50,000 more. 
Tickets won't be available in Australia for almost two months. 
</P>
<P>
	Cartan Tours offers packages ranging from a six-night stay in a  
private home for $4,900 to a six nights in a five-star hotel for 
$7,400. The prices are per person. 
</P>
<P>
	Tickets to the events are not included in that price, but the  
packages encompasses round-trip airfare, food and daily 
transportation to and from the events. 
</P>
<P>
	Ticket prices for the events will range from $8 for preliminary  
rounds to more than $1,000 for premium opening and closing ceremony 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said the demand for tickets has not decreased even  
though the 2000 Summer Games will take place later than usual, in 
September, conflicting with children's school schedules.

<HEADLINE> Europe: Holiday Will Protect Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - The European Central Bank wants to  
limit the risks of the ``millennium bug'' wreaking havoc in the 
European Union's banking system by making the upcoming New Year's 
Eve a special holiday, officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	ECB President Wim Duisenberg said he planned to close the  
European System of Central Banks on Dec. 31 -- a Friday -- to ensure 
that its information systems are fully prepared for any problems. 
The ESCB comprises the ECB plus the national central banks of the 
11 euro-zone member countries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be more efficient if all member states declared Dec.  
31, 1999 a bank holiday,'' said Duisenberg in a letter to the 
president of the EU council of finance ministers. The letter was 
dated March 10 but released Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bank testing for the millennium bug is being carried out and  
will continue in the runup to the year 2000, but Duisenberg said 
``no matter how detailed the testing is, it is not possible to give 
a 100 percent guarantee'' nothing will go wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	The issue has to be settled by the EU council of ministers.  
</P>
<P>
	The millennium bug problem stems from the old computer  
programming practice of using only the last two digits of the year 
to save memory. Massive problems are feared on Jan. 1 as computers 
mistake 2000 for 1900.

<HEADLINE> Boxing Orders Holyfield-Lewis II </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It takes a lot to get the heads of boxing's  
three warring factions to agree on anything. Watching Evander 
Holyfield get a draw after taking a beating at the hands of Lennox 
Lewis apparently was enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Just hours after three judges concluded early Sunday that the  
first heavyweight title unification fight in seven years was a 
draw, the people who control the title belts ordered a second fight 
within six months. 
</P>
<P>
	If anyone is interested in paying to see it again -- and assuming  
the two fighters are as willing as they say-- Holyfield and Lewis 
will meet once more for the IBF and WBA titles held by Holyfield 
and the WBC crown owned by Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	``In six months if he wants to get it on we'll get it on,''  
Holyfield said. ``Six months ain't no problem with me.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Nor with Lewis, although a lot of agreements would have to take  
place and deals be made if the fight is actually to occur. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief among them would be the purses -- Lewis is unlikely to  
accept half of what Holyfield gets this time around -- and a place. 
There's also the matter of competing networks -- Holyfield fights 
for Showtime and Lewis for HBO -- and promotional disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	``There should be an automatic rematch,'' said Lewis, who earned  
$10 million to Holyfield's $20 million in a bout promoted by Don 
King. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Lee of the International Boxing Federation, Jose Sulaiman of  
the World Boxing Council and Gilberto Mendoza of the World Boxing 
Association met after the fight and issued the rematch declaration. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shame there was so much controversy attached to this  
important fight,'' Lee said. ``But we did what we thought was the 
most sensible thing by ordering a rematch in six months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. George Pataki wants the New York State Athletic Commission  
to look into the draw. He said his administration worked hard to 
bring boxing back to Madison Square Garden, ``but it has to be done 
in a way that upholds the integrity of the game and people's 
confidence in the sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd of 21,284 saw an aging Holyfield lose a lopsided  
fight. What two of three judges saw, however, was something quite 
different. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked like an old man in there,'' Lewis said. ``He looked  
slow to me and he missed a lot of punches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not in the eyes of ringside judge Jean Williams.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care who the winner was,'' Williams said. ``I scored  
by the blows that connected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams thought Holyfield connected with enough punches to win  
the fight seven rounds to five, allowing him to escape with a draw 
in a fight Lewis appeared to dominate from the opening bell. 
</P>
<P>
	She gave Holyfield the edge even though the WBA and IBF champion  
was credited in ringside stats with landing fewer than 10 punches 
in each of six different rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have the privilege of a boxing stat,'' Williams said.  
</P>
<P>
	Neither did the sellout crowd, but that didn't stop the fans  
from booing lustily when the shocking decision was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	For 12 rounds, Lewis was in control, landing left jabs and right  
leads at will and frustrating Holyfield every time he attempted to 
get inside to neutralize the bigger man's advantages. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of those rounds, the fifth, Lewis clipped Holyfield with  
a hard right off the top of his head, sparking a flurry of 12 to 15 
head shots as Holyfield appeared helpless on the ropes and did not 
return a punch for 45 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Lewis' best round of the fight. It showed in punch stats  
tallied at ringside, which had the WBC champion landing 43 punches 
to 11 for Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, a New Jersey judge, gave Holyfield the round.  
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like the judging is rigged almost,'' said Lewis  
trainer Emanuel Steward. ``I hate to say it, this is a sport I make 
my living in. I'm ashamed of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams had Holyfield winning 115-113, while British judge  
Larry O'Connell had to give Lewis the last round to even get him 
the draw, with a 115-115 score. 
</P>
<P>
	South Africa's Stanley Christoudoulou had Lewis winning 116-113.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought Lewis definitely dominated, especially the first  
seven rounds,'' Christoudoulou told the South African Press 
Association. ``Apart from the third, it was all Lewis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 36-year-old Holyfield looked every year his age as he tried  
to get inside the jabs and right leads thrown by Lewis. Holyfield 
connected occasionally, but never put together any series of 
punches in combinations that might have hurt the 33-year-old 
British fighter. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis was credited with landing 348 punches to 130 for  
Holyfield, yet if it hadn't been for a late flurry in the final 
round he might have been going home to England without his belt as 
a split decision loser. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was my time to shine and they ripped me off,'' Lewis said.  
``I am the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world and 
everyone knows it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis might actually have been the undisputed champion had he  
gone after Holyfield with a vengeance instead of fighting carefully 
when he seemed to have the bout in hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Always cautious in the ring, Lewis might have been a bit too  
careful when he needed to make an impression on the judges the 
most. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to fall for any sucker thing,'' Lewis said. ``He  
was basically trying to use his experience to bring me in, but that 
didn't happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the left side of Holyfield's face was badly swollen by  
the end of the fight, while Lewis was basically unmarked. With just 
seconds left in the fight, Lewis threw his right arm up in triumph, 
seemingly secure in the knowledge he had won. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield's plan to knock Lewis out in the third round had  
failed, and there was no backup plan when he needed it. Yet, he 
wasn't about to concede defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still feel like the heavyweight champion,'' Holyfield said.  
``It's real simple. The people around the ring aren't judges.''

<HEADLINE> Ousted IOC Official Criticizes Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- The IOC's rules against lavish  
benefits from bidding cities are aimed at ``angels and saints,'' 
the ousted member alleged to have taken the most in the Salt Lake 
bribery scandal said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean-Claude Ganga of the Congo Republic, expelled for accepting  
$270,000 in cash, travel, medical care and other gifts from Utah 
bidders, said the International Olympic Committee's rules were 
wrong and should have been flouted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Laws are made by men. It's not the laws that make the man,''  
he said. ``If you can't adapt laws to different situations, because 
man is not a machine, those laws are bad and must be changed. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``The Olympic Games and the Olympic movement are organized by  
individuals. They are not angels and saints. If you want angels and 
saints, go organize the Olympic Games in heaven, not on earth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The worst scandal in Olympic history had driven a stake into the  
IOC's heart, Ganga said. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is the objective of the Olympic movement? It's to bring  
together the different colors and different continents,'' he said. 
``Today it's a corruption syndrome. People are afraid to talk to 
each other, to do business, to have meetings, to eat. Is that the 
objective of the Olympic movement?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga is among six members ousted by IOC leaders in their  
investigation of a $1.2 million vote-buying scheme run by the bid 
that won Salt Lake the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	The expulsions will be voted upon by 91 IOC members Wednesday,  
with a two-thirds vote needed to uphold the leadership's actions. 
Officials said it was up to the assembly, meeting in an emergency 
session, to decide if the vote would be by a show of hands or 
secret ballot. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever method is chosen, Ganga said he would fight hard to  
hold onto the seat he has held since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are here to win,'' his son Jean-Noel said following a news  
conference at which his father denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Jean-Claude Ganga said his ouster was part of a ``plot against  
the Third World'' and ``a decision to exclude Africa from the 
center of decision making in world sports.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the six members expelled were from African countries,  
with the others from Latin America and Samoa. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga also said he was being punished for leading the African  
boycott of the 1976 Montreal Games, and that the whole 
investigation revolved around efforts to pick a successor to Juan 
Antonio Samaranch as IOC president. 
</P>
<P>
	``Three of the members on the (inquiry) commission have said  
they might run for president,'' he said, referring to chairman Dick 
Pound of Canada, Pal Schmitt of Hungary and Jacques Rogge of 
Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound called Ganga's charges ``completely wrong.''  
</P>
<P>
	``None of the investigations or recommendations were politically  
motivated. ... ,'' Pound said at a separate news conference. ``The 
past is the past. More important is the present.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a 1 1/2-hour session with reporters in the 5-star hotel where  
the IOC members -- including those expelled -- are staying, Ganga 
said he accepted only token gifts from Salt Lake and paid or tried 
to pay for other items identified as freebies. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he put $70,000 earmarked for African sports programs  
into his own Utah bank account to avoid currency transfer delays, 
and that the money wound up where is was supposed to. He said he 
had documents to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
	Gifts such as a refrigerator and fax machine listed in ethics  
reports as going back to his Brazzaville home were just extra 
furnishings in a Salt Lake hotel suite he stayed in, put there 
without his asking, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to be polite,'' he said. '' You can't ask them to  
take it out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga said he tried to pay for treatment of hepatitis C at  
Latter Day Saints Hospital in Salt Lake but was told there was no 
bill. He produced a letter from Dr. Terry Box, the liver specialist 
who treated Ganga, confirming his recollection that the African 
official ``insisted on paying me for my services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake organizers picked up the tab, but Ganga showed a  
letter from a Luxembourg insurer, Deutsche Krankenversicherung, 
that said his medal policy would have covered the treatment and 
hospitalization in full. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, he contradicted statements by former Salt Lake  
Olympic chief Tom Welch that Ganga cleared the hospital stay 
beforehand with Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why should I call him? I was paying.'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ganga denied that his wife had cosmetic surgery paid for by the  
bid, although he conceded she had ``problems with skin on her 
hands'' and may have received some treatment. Knee replacement 
surgery for his mother-in-law, he said, was arranged by Welch after 
he visited Ganga's home and found the woman had to be carried to 
the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
	To get to Salt Lake for the operation, Ganga said, he paid for  
tickets for himself, his wife and mother-in-law from Brazzaville to 
Paris, with Salt Lake flying them the rest of the way on tickets 
provided as part of Delta Airlines' sponsorship. Ganga said there 
was nothing improper about such perks. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Salt Lake City had a sponsorship with Delta, what is wrong  
with that?'' he asked. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said that he had found credit-card receipts showing he  
paid for items such as draperies that had been listed as gifts from 
Salt Lake. He accused some Utah Olympic workers of seeking 
reimbursement for items they bought for themselves, singling out 
Jason Gull, a student at the time and the Ganga's escort when they 
were in Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	An Utah ethics report said Ganga and his wife maxed out Gull's  
credit cards on shopping sprees. That report said Ganga's activity 
``merits special mention.''

<HEADLINE> DeBartolo May Pay NFL $1M Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Eddie DeBartolo, exiled owner of the San  
Francisco 49ers, will pay the NFL a $1 million fine for his part in 
a Louisiana gambling scandal, the San Francisco Chronicle reported 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue's decision to impose the fine  
may be announced this week at the annual owners meeting in 
Scottsdale, Ariz., the newspaper said, citing unidentified sources. 
</P>
<P>
	The fine brings to $3 million the total amount DeBartolo faces  
for his involvement with indicted former Louisiana governor Edwin 
Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, DeBartolo pleaded guilty to one felony charge of  
failing to report an alleged extortion attempt by Edwards in 
connection with DeBartolo's bid for a riverboat gambling license. 
The judge imposed $2 million in fines. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo and his sister, Denise DeBartolo York have been at  
odds for more than a year over control of the team, in part because 
of Eddie's debts to the family-held corporation. DeBartolo's 
attorney, Aubrey Harwell, while declining to discuss Tagliabue's 
pending sanctions, said he was hopeful Eddie DeBartolo and his 
sister could work things out. 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue said in January that DeBartolo would be suspended for  
the 1999 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, John York told the San Jose Mercury News that  
DeBartolo York had no plans to sell the team if Eddie DeBartolo did 
not regain control. 
</P>
<P>
	``What she wants is a separation from her brother,'' said York,  
recently appointed vice president of the team. ``His interests and 
hers do not go down the same path.'' 
</P>
<P>
	York told the newspaper Sunday his wife was committed to keeping  
the team while her brother was out. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo relinquished control of the team in December 1997 when  
the NFL investigated the gambling scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	While his wife might be interested in selling her share to her  
brother, she has no plans to sell to a third party if he can't 
return as active owner. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's first and foremost is a separation of her interests  
with Eddie's,'' York said. ``That does not mean she is out to hurt 
Eddie, but they need to be separated because their business 
interests are not the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``The 49ers are not for sale now. I can't tell you that that  
wouldn't change, but we don't have any intentions to sell the team. 
We are committed to running it because it is the most valuable 
single asset in the DeBartolo Corporation.''

<HEADLINE> SW Mo. St. Fans Loving NCAA Ride </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- When Southwest Missouri State superfan  
T.J. Lordis had his silkscreen business print up hundreds of ``Go 
Bears'' T-shirts for the NCAA tournament, he knew he might be doing 
business with his heart and not his head. 
</P>
<P>
	This was a team, after all, that some said got into the NCAA  
tournament through the back door, having to wait for an at-large 
bid after failing to make it to the finals of its own Missouri 
Valley Conference tournament. It would probably be booted right out 
the front door after its first game with Wisconsin, seeded No. 5 in 
the East Regional. 
</P>
<P>
	But all that was forgotten in Springfield on Monday, after SMS's  
Bears not only upset Wisconsin 43-32 but then demolished Tennessee 
81-51 in the second round. That second win puts the Bears into the 
round of 16 for the first time and sets up a showdown Friday with 
No. 1 Duke. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bring on Duke!'' shouted Lordis, laughing Monday as he took a  
quick break between fielding dozens of calls from fans wanting 
shirts from the next batch he was producing, these emblazoned with 
the words, ``Bring on Duke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Springfield's beloved Bears had become the little team that  
could. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of exciting when you're watching ESPN or NBC or  
whatever and you see names of big schools like Tennessee, 
Connecticut on the screen. And right up there with them, there's 
little old Southwest Missouri,'' said Angie Curran, assistant 
manager of the Classic Sports Bar, which was packed Sunday with 
patrons cheering on the Bears. 
</P>
<P>
	``Especially after they got the name right,'' laughed Russ  
Robinson, whose father played basketball for SMS in the 1950s. 
``For a while there they had it SWMS every time I looked up. I'm 
glad they got that straightened out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some folks fretted just a bit at the thought of the world  
finally getting to know SMS just before the Duke game. 
</P>
<P>
	``They play like an NBA team,'' Robinson said of Duke. ``I don't  
how we can beat them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But others, like Lordis, would not be deterred. After all, no  
one but SMS seemed to think it could beat Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're playing like a Big Ten team right now,'' he said. ``We  
can beat anybody right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Russ Koeneman, whose Russ' Sports Bar stood nearly empty Monday  
afternoon, reflecting the calm before a storm that would be a 
hundred or more patrons cheering on the Bears against Duke there 
Friday, also was quietly confident. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think they'll embarrass us,'' he said, smiling. ``How  
will they win? Play strong defense. Play hard. Outscore 'em. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the great thing about a basketball game,'' he  
continued, chuckling. ``That's all you've got to do. Outscore 'em. 
You put two teams on the floor and both have to play for 40 
minutes. And we certainly showed over the weekend that we can play 
those 40 minutes with anybody.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a level of play that left even the Bears overwhelmed.  
</P>
<P>
	``What a ride we're on, what a ride,'' said guard William  
Fontleroy afterward. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the ride's biggest beneficiaries in this Ozarks town of  
150,000 is fourth-year coach Steve Alford, who was no stranger to 
criticism when his 20-10 team struggled at times during the regular 
season, then was eliminated from its conference tournament in the 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Alford, 34, had played on a national champion at Indiana in 1987  
and on a USA team that won the Olympic gold medal in 1984. And when 
he arrived in Springfield in 1995 he was expected to bring that 
level of excellence with him. 
</P>
<P>
	When it wasn't seen immediately, the grumblings of discontent  
were heard. 
</P>
<P>
	But then in one weekend he took the Bears farther into NCAA  
postseason play than they had ever been. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now,'' Koeneman said, leaning back behind his bar, ``all of  
Steve Alford's critics, myself included, ought to just shut up. 
He's done something here that nobody else ever did.''

<HEADLINE> Anwar Expects Prison Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Ousted Deputy Prime Minister Anwar  
Ibrahim predicted Monday he would be convicted and imprisoned after 
the defense rested in his five-month sex and corruption trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense closed after the presiding judge dealt it a stunning  
blow by refusing to allow it to call witnesses who claim they were 
tortured by police into making allegations against Anwar. 
</P>
<P>
	High Court Judge Augustine Paul has consistently rejected  
defense attempts to show that a conspiracy of politicians and 
police seeking to wreck Anwar's career is behind the charges 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
	Anwar seemed resigned to a guilty verdict. When asked by  
reporters how long he expected to be sentenced, Anwar replied: 
``Two, four years, it makes no difference.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trial, which began Nov. 2, now enters its final stage. The  
judge set a March 21 hearing for closing arguments by both sides, 
after which he will pronounce his verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	Anwar, 51, who was sacked and arrested last September, has  
repeatedly said that all 10 charges against him were fabricated by 
his political enemies who worked with the police to end the 
challenge he posed to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. 
</P>
<P>
	This trial concerns four charges of abuse of power related to  
alleged attempts to cover up his sexual trysts, which the 
prosecution says includes a string of illegal homosexual acts. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the four counts carries a jail term of 14 years and a  
fine of $5,000. If convicted, Anwar will also be barred from 
entering politics for five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense had sought to call a number of witnesses Monday,  
including several who say they were ``coerced, tortured until they 
fabricated stories'' of homosexual relations with Anwar. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of Anwar associates -- including his adopted brother and  
his former speech writer -- have been jailed based on confessions of 
relations with Anwar. But they have since retracted the 
confessions, saying they were coerced. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Paul, however, ruled that evidence by the witnesses  
appeared to have ``absolutely no direct connection'' with the case 
and was inadmissible. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are taken aback,'' said defense lawyer Christopher  
Fernando. ``We feel that crucial relevant evidence has been shut 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Anwar reacted stoically. ``It's OK. It's not surprising,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul also rejected a request by the defense to allow testimony  
by a U.S.-based Malaysian businessman, who says he was offered a 
bribe by a Malaysian diplomat in Washington to make allegations 
against Anwar.

<HEADLINE> INS Officer Charged With Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A 12-year-veteran of the Immigration and  
Naturalization Service has been arrested on charges that she 
smuggled an illegal alien from Canada into the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Detention Enforcement Officer Paula M. Jesmer, 34, was indicted  
last week by a grand jury in Boston and arrested Monday. Federal 
prosecutors say that while working at INS' Service Processing 
Center for detainees in 1996, Jesmer got to know a Portuguese 
citizen named Jose M. Cabral-Simnas. 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1997, Cabral-Simnas was deported back to Portugal.  
But six months later he traveled to Montreal, where Jesmer met him 
and drove him across the U.S. border to her home in Medford, 
prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jesmer faces a maximum penalty of 5 years in prison and $250,000  
in fines.

<HEADLINE> DNC Convention Returns to L.A. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- With Democrats firmly back in power in  
California, the Democratic National Convention is returning to Los 
Angeles next year for the first time since John F. Kennedy was 
nominated in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	Civic leaders and convention boosters said Monday's announcement  
also was proof that the nation's second-largest city had rebounded 
from its much-publicized problems -- such as recession, earthquakes, 
floods and race riots. 
</P>
<P>
	The choice of Los Angeles over 12 other cities that were asked  
to submit proposals, including Boston and Denver, reflects 
California's importance -- with its 54 electoral votes and generous 
campaign donors -- in choosing the next president. 
</P>
<P>
	``California is the big ATM for any national campaign,'' says  
Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political analyst with the Claremont 
Graduate University School of Politics and Economics. ``The 
Democrats will come in here like a vacuum cleaner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Democratic National Committee shied away from the state in  
recent years because it was led by Republicans, said former 
Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, the chairman. He also cited ballot 
initiatives that rolled back affirmative action programs and barred 
state aid to immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
	Romer said the party was ready to return to the state now that  
Democratic Gov. Gray Davis is in office, and Democrats control both 
houses in the Legislature and occupy most statewide elected 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Andrew, head of the DNC's site-selection team, said  
California's diversity and Los Angeles' unique public-private 
convention bid were also key factors in the party's decision. The 
Republican convention will be in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``California is the ideal place to showcase the positive message  
and vision of the Democratic Party and our presidential nominee,'' 
Andrew said. ``California represents the great diversity of this 
country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bid, which was put together by an independent host committee  
dubbed LA Convention 2000, proposed that private donors pick up 
much of the convention's $35.3 million cost, contrary to the usual 
practice of having the city back the deal. Although that element 
supposedly was a point of contention between the two sides, Andrew 
praised the unique offer and touted it as a ``model for political 
conventions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Unlike Republicans, the 2000 political convention will be  
sponsored by the private sector with the cooperation of the public 
sector,'' Andrew said. ``Not the other way around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republican National Committee spokesman Tim Fitzpatrick  
criticized Andrew's remarks, saying the Philadelphia convention was 
part of an ``unprecedented, privately funded'' package. 
</P>
<P>
	Fitzpatrick also criticized the site, saying, ``The Democrats  
can't seem to get away from Buddhist temples and the Hollywood 
elite,'' in an apparent reference to the Hacienda Heights temple at 
the center of fund-raising allegations against Vice President Al 
Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	State and local governments will provide basic services like  
fire and bus service for the convention, while private donors, both 
individuals and companies, will pick up much of the tab. 
</P>
<P>
	Eli Broad, one of four wealthy businessmen who headed the host  
committee, touted the $150 million the convention is expected to 
bring the state in business and the publicity it will bring the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in the middle of a Renaissance,'' he said, pointing to  
the city's ongoing bid for an NFL expansion team and efforts to 
revitalize the city's troubled downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Davis, who lived in West Hollywood before being elected  
governor: ``The DNC has reaffirmed that Los Angeles is back. Los 
Angeles is once again ready to resume its role as one of the 
world's great urban centers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the money of donors like Broad and his co-chairs is  
considered one of the greatest benefits of coming to California, 
whose 54 electoral votes are the most in the nation, there's still 
no guarantee the Democratic nominee will win the Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats have held three presidential nominating conventions in  
California, and each time their nominee went on to lose California. 
</P>
<P>
	James Cox won the Democratic nomination for president in San  
Francisco in 1920, but Republican Warren G. Harding won 
California's then-13 electoral votes by a 3-1 margin four months 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Kennedy was nominated in Los Angeles in 1960, but lost the state  
to Republican Richard Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1984, Walter Mondale won the Democratic nomination in San  
Francisco. But that didn't help him against Ronald Reagan, either 
nationally or in California.

<HEADLINE>  Duke, SW Mo. State Win With Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- The difficulty of what's ahead hit Steve  
Alford even before the end of the party marking the biggest triumph 
in Southwest Missouri State history. 
</P>
<P>
	Alford's Bears rode a stifling defensive performance to an 81-51  
victory over Tennessee on Sunday, putting Southwest Missouri State 
in the NCAA tournament's round of 16 for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears' so-called reward is a date with top-ranked Duke in  
Friday's East Regional semifinals at East Rutherford, N.J. The Blue 
Devils have won 29 games in a row, including back-to-back 41-point 
blowouts to open the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we've got our hands completely full preparing for the  
best team in the country,'' Alford said with a shrug and a weak 
smile as the last of the Bears' noisy revelers left the Charlotte 
Coliseum. ``But you know what? We'd much rather be doing that than 
not playing at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tulsa was the latest team to find out how imposing Duke can be.  
The Blue Devils (34-1) built a 30-point halftime lead on the way to 
a 97-56 victory over the Golden Hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
	``Duke is probably better than advertised from our  
perspective,'' Tulsa coach Bill Self said. ``We don't get a chance 
to see teams like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the Blue Devils overwhelmed the Golden Hurricane by  
forcing 20 turnovers, converting them into 30 points and limiting 
Tulsa to 34-percent shooting, Southwest Missouri State did a 
similar job on Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears (22-10) scored 24 points off Tennessee turnovers and  
harassed the Vols into 30-percent shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second big defensive game in a row for Southwest  
Missouri State, which two days earlier held Wisconsin to 32 points, 
the lowest output in an NCAA tournament game since the introduction 
of the shot clock. 
</P>
<P>
	Danny Moore had 25 points and eight rebounds to lead 12th-seeded  
Southwest Missouri State, which shot 52 percent, had a season-low 
six turnovers and never trailed. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon Wharton and Isiah Victor had 11 points each for  
fourth-seeded Tennessee (21-9). The Vols were held to their lowest 
point total in more than two months. 
</P>
<P>
	``No explanation. We had a lot of open looks,'' Wharton said.  
``I guess we just hit a cold streak there. They made all the big 
shots and we didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vols were seeking their first regional semifinal berth since  
1981. Instead, that slot goes to a team that has become another 
example of Alford's NCAA tournament success. 
</P>
<P>
	He made a then-Final Four record seven 3-pointers to lead  
Indiana past Syracuse in the 1987 championship game, and in his 
first job as a head coach, he led Manchester, a school that had 
never been to the NCAA tournament, to the Division III title game. 
</P>
<P>
	Now in his fourth season at Southwest Missouri State, he faces  
his biggest test yet, and he's trying to face it with humor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll possibly put up some detour signs so Duke maybe gets  
lost and we start the game playing five on nobody,'' Alford joked. 
``We need to get a quick start because Duke has been putting away 
people pretty quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tulsa can confirm that. The ninth-seeded Golden Hurricane  
(23-10) was held to 28-percent shooting in the first half, and 
Tulsa was unable to challenge the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Making things even tougher on the Golden Hurricane was the fact  
that Michael Ruffin, Tulsa's best frontcourt player, got into early 
foul trouble. He wound up with eight rebounds and three blocks, but 
was held scoreless. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we got down, most teams let up a little bit, but they  
kept competing the entire game,'' Ruffin said. ``They never gave us 
a chance to come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Avery had 19 points, Elton Brand 17 and Shane Battier 14  
for the Blue Devils, who made the round of 16 for the 10th time 
under Mike Krzyzewski. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Harrington had 15 to lead Tulsa, which allowed a pair of  
13-0 runs in the first half and fell behind by as many as 43 points 
in the second. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt like we could stop everything,'' Battier said. ``I  
can't put into words how great it feels.''

	Alford's Bears rode a stifling defensive performance to an 81-51  
victory over Tennessee on Sunday, putting Southwest Missouri State 
in the NCAA tournament's round of 16 for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears' so-called reward is a date with top-ranked Duke in  
Friday's East Regional semifinals at East Rutherford, N.J. The Blue 
Devils have won 29 games in a row, including back-to-back 41-point 
blowouts to open the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know we've got our hands completely full preparing for the  
best team in the country,'' Alford said with a shrug and a weak 
smile as the last of the Bears' noisy revelers left the Charlotte 
Coliseum. ``But you know what? We'd much rather be doing that than 
not playing at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tulsa was the latest team to find out how imposing Duke can be.  
The Blue Devils (34-1) built a 30-point halftime lead on the way to 
a 97-56 victory over the Golden Hurricane. 
</P>
<P>
	``Duke is probably better than advertised from our  
perspective,'' Tulsa coach Bill Self said. ``We don't get a chance 
to see teams like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the Blue Devils overwhelmed the Golden Hurricane by  
forcing 20 turnovers, converting them into 30 points and limiting 
Tulsa to 34-percent shooting, Southwest Missouri State did a 
similar job on Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bears (22-10) scored 24 points off Tennessee turnovers and  
harassed the Vols into 30-percent shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second big defensive game in a row for Southwest  
Missouri State, which two days earlier held Wisconsin to 32 points, 
the lowest output in an NCAA tournament game since the introduction 
of the shot clock. 
</P>
<P>
	Danny Moore had 25 points and eight rebounds to lead 12th-seeded  
Southwest Missouri State, which shot 52 percent, had a season-low 
six turnovers and never trailed. 
</P>
<P>
	Brandon Wharton and Isiah Victor had 11 points each for  
fourth-seeded Tennessee (21-9). The Vols were held to their lowest 
point total in more than two months. 
</P>
<P>
	``No explanation. We had a lot of open looks,'' Wharton said.  
``I guess we just hit a cold streak there. They made all the big 
shots and we didn't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Vols were seeking their first regional semifinal berth since  
1981. Instead, that slot goes to a team that has become another 
example of Alford's NCAA tournament success. 
</P>
<P>
	He made a then-Final Four record seven 3-pointers to lead  
Indiana past Syracuse in the 1987 championship game, and in his 
first job as a head coach, he led Manchester, a school that had 
never been to the NCAA tournament, to the Division III title game. 
</P>
<P>
	Now in his fourth season at Southwest Missouri State, he faces  
his biggest test yet, and he's trying to face it with humor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll possibly put up some detour signs so Duke maybe gets  
lost and we start the game playing five on nobody,'' Alford joked. 
``We need to get a quick start because Duke has been putting away 
people pretty quick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tulsa can confirm that. The ninth-seeded Golden Hurricane  
(23-10) was held to 28-percent shooting in the first half, and 
Tulsa was unable to challenge the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Making things even tougher on the Golden Hurricane was the fact  
that Michael Ruffin, Tulsa's best frontcourt player, got into early 
foul trouble. He wound up with eight rebounds and three blocks, but 
was held scoreless. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we got down, most teams let up a little bit, but they  
kept competing the entire game,'' Ruffin said. ``They never gave us 
a chance to come back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	William Avery had 19 points, Elton Brand 17 and Shane Battier 14  
for the Blue Devils, who made the round of 16 for the 10th time 
under Mike Krzyzewski. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Harrington had 15 to lead Tulsa, which allowed a pair of  
13-0 runs in the first half and fell behind by as many as 43 points 
in the second. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt like we could stop everything,'' Battier said. ``I  
can't put into words how great it feels.''

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Jobless Rate Hits Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Unemployment has climbed to a record 6 percent  
as Hong Kong struggles through recession, the government said 
Monday in a report that offered a continued gloomy outlook for the 
near term. 
</P>
<P>
	``As overall economic activity might continue to be slack in the  
early part of the year ... the unemployment rate was likely to 
remain high in the near term,'' said Tang Kwong-yiu, the government 
economist. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest figure, for the three months ending in February, is  
the highest since the government started keeping its current type 
of employment statistics in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	About 206,000 people were unemployed, compared with 202,700 in  
the rolling three-month period that ended in January, when 
unemployment stood at 5.8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong's joblessness had stood at 2.9 percent from December  
to February of 1998, according to the Census and Statistics 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Tang said more people were thrown out of work around the Chinese  
New Year -- which was in mid-February this year -- when companies 
traditionally review their books and lay off unneeded staff after 
giving them year-end bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the newly unemployed were from the construction and  
restaurant industries, while joblessness in the real estate sector 
had eased. 
</P>
<P>
	Most economists expect unemployment to climb steadily in the  
first half of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	As factories continue to leave Hong Kong for cheaper land and  
labor across the mainland Chinese border, the tiny territory is 
vying with other Asian rivals like Singapore and Malaysia to 
transform itself to become Asia's technology hub to fuel economic 
growth and provide jobs for a new breed of skilled workers. 
</P>
<P>
	A recently-announced 13-billion Hong Kong dollar ($1.67 billion)  
Cyberport project and a similar Science Park project are expected 
to provide thousands of jobs, but not until construction starts 
around 2001.

<HEADLINE>  Indonesian Island Returns To Normal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMBON, Indonesia (AP) -- The riot-torn island of Ambon, where  
Christians and Muslims have been fighting one another for weeks, 
showed signs of returning to normal today. 
</P>
<P>
	Markets where many shops had been set afire during the fighting,  
which killed more than 200 people, began to reopen, selling fish 
and vegetables to people on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, soldiers and other security forces continued  
to closely guard the streets of Ambon city and to detain people and 
confiscate crude weapons, such as slingshots, used in the fighting. 
Those taken into custody included a high school boy who was found 
with a cache of homemade arrows and spears. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in a grim reminder of how brutal the fighting has  
been, security forces today found the body of a headless and 
handless victim in Air Salobar village. 
</P>
<P>
	Word also emerged that 15 more houses had been set on fire  
Sunday night in a Muslim area of Soabali village. 
</P>
<P>
	The fierce fighting erupted Jan. 19 in Ambon, 1,500 miles east  
of Jakarta, and spread to five other islands in Maluku Province, 
known as the Spice Islands in Dutch colonial times. 
</P>
<P>
	About 90 percent of Indonesia's 210 million people are Muslim,  
making it the world's most populous Islamic nation. But Ambon's 
311,000 people are nearly equally divided into Christian and Muslim 
communities. It is not clear what started the fighting in an area 
where the two religious groups had generally gotten along well. 
</P>
<P>
	But fighting between Christians and Muslims has broken out in  
other areas of Indonesia too, including Jakarta, since civil unrest 
led to the resignation of President Suharto last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The government that replaced Suharto's is more open and  
democratic and its forces and the military have spent less time 
enforcing longstanding rules that promote religious harmony. 
</P>
<P>
	The country also is suffering through its worst economic setback  
in 30 years -- all part of the Asian financial crisis, which began 
in Southeast Asia about 19 months ago.

	TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -- The country's main business group  
on Monday demanded a crackdown on crime in Honduras, saying 
kidnapping, robbery and other assaults have become too common. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the last five years, 104 businessmen have been kidnapped  
and three of them killed by their captors. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anti-social elements affect businessmen ... And foreign  
investment will not be consolidated until the government puts an 
end to crime,'' the Private Enterprise Council said in a news 
release. 
</P>
<P>
	It called on President Carlos Flores Facusse to take tougher  
measures to solve the problems. The president in August called for 
constitutional reforms to impose a death penalty and to more 
tightly control weapons, but the plan has not passed. 
</P>
<P>
	Police estimate that most Hondurans illegally carry firearms.  
Criminals, however, often carry military-style automatic weapons.

	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- President Carlos Menem marked the  
fourth anniversary of his son's death Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Menem traveled to the Islamic Cemetery in Buenos Aires, where he  
laid a floral bouquet at the tomb of his son, Carlos Jr. He later 
held a short mass at the Olivos presidential residence, where he 
was joined by his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlos Menem died March 15, 1995, when his low-flying helicopter  
crashed into electrical cables near a highway 150 miles north of 
the Argentine capital. The air force ruled the crash an accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Menem's ex-wife, Zulema Yoma, has repeatedly rejected the report  
and insists her son was the victim of an attack arranged by an 
organized crime syndicate. She says bullet holes in the 
helicopter's body is proof someone killed him. 
</P>
<P>
	President Menem, who initially dismissed the possibility, later  
acknowledged it was possible their son was murdered. 
</P>
<P>
	An appeal by both the president and his ex-wife to have the case  
reclassified as a homicide was rejected by a local judge last year.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Scientists have found a naturally formed mold  
of a dinosaur skull in northern Mexico, a discovery that could shed 
new light on the animal's intelligence and behavior, the government 
news agency Notimex reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The mold of the cranium, apparently from a raptor dinosaur,  
formed when a fine sediment filled the skull and petrified over 
time, paleontologist Rene Hernandez River said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hernandez, of Mexico's National Autonomous University, said  
scientists have studied similar molds made of silicon. He did not 
know of any discoveries of other naturally created cranium molds, 
Notimex said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cranium mold was found Saturday in Rincon Colorado, one of  
the world's most important dinosaur fossil fields, in the northern 
state of Coahuila.

<HEADLINE> `Analyze This' Rubs Out Competition / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The mobster comedy ``Analyze This'' held off  
``The Rage: Carrie 2'' and four other new films to remain on top of 
the North American box office, final figures showed Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Starring Robert De Niro as a crime figure with emotional issues

million, more than double the closest competitor, ``Carrie 2,''

<HEADLINE> Ex-Nev. Gov. Won't Run For Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Former Gov. Bob Miller said Monday he will not  
run for the U.S. Senate, putting a damper on Democratic hopes of 
retaining the seat being vacated by Richard Bryan. 
</P>
<P>
	``After weeks of soul-searching, the final conclusion is that I  
will not be a candidate for Senate in the next election,'' he said 
at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very enticing position, one that I had not previously  
aspired to. The swing balance was I like living in Nevada,'' Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, 53, stepped down in January after 10 years as the  
state's chief executive. He had been considered the leading 
Democratic candidate for Senate, and was wooed by some of the top 
names in his party, including President Clinton, Vice President Al 
Gore and the first lady. He also received a call from Senate 
Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., whose party needs a net gain 
of six Democrats in the 2000 elections to capture control of the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller said last month he would weigh his options after talking  
to his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats were counting on a strong candidate to make the Senate  
race. Former Republican Rep. John Ensign has already announced he 
will seek Bryan's seat. Ensign lost the 1998 Senate race to 
Democratic Sen. Harry Reid by 428 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jim Gibbons, R-Nev., is also considering the race. Gibbons  
said today he would not let Ensign's plans impact him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never ducked a good fight, no matter who's in the race,''  
Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
	During his final term as governor, Miller had been rumored for  
an ambassadorship in the Clinton administration, but he later said 
he wanted to remain in Nevada. The two became friends when Clinton 
was governor of Arkansas.

<HEADLINE> Death Occurs at Home for the Abused </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANNER ELK, N.C. (AP) -- Authorities are investigating a home for  
abused children following the suffocation death of a 9-year-old boy 
and a series of other complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	Timithy Thomas, who weighed only 53 pounds, died Thursday,  
shortly after he was subjected to a ``basket hold'' by his teacher 
at Grandfather Academy. 
</P>
<P>
	Basket holds are used on unruly children and involve a teacher  
getting behind the child, crossing his arms and holding on to the 
child's wrists. 
</P>
<P>
	County and state officials are investigating the procedure.  
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like it was definitely unnecessary,'' Avery County  
Sheriff Richard Buchanan said Monday. ``We feel like that this 
probably was the cause of death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said the death is the latest problem at the home in the  
western North Carolina mountains. The academy is the school for 
youngsters living at the Grandfather Home for Children. 
</P>
<P>
	Several children have run away from the home, claiming staff  
members verbally and physically abused them, Buchanan said. His 
office is investigating two other employees about an unrelated 
assault case. 
</P>
<P>
	Principal Roy Krege said he and the school board stand behind  
the school staff and have no immediate plans to change any 
procedures. He said children at the academy have extensive 
emotional and behavioral problems and must be restrained at times. 
</P>
<P>
	The teacher, whose name was not released, is an experienced  
employee with an exemplary personnel file, Krege said. ``If 
something did go awry, it was certainly and totally 
unintentional,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Y2K May Affect Chemical Cos. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Large chemical companies are well prepared for  
the Year 2000 computer problem, but smaller companies, many located 
near residential areas, may be less able to cope with potentially 
dangerous shutdowns, says a report presented to Congress on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 85 million Americans live within a five-mile radius of  
66,000 facilities handling high hazard chemicals, the report's 
author, Dr. Gerald Poje of the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard 
Investigation Board, told a news conference in the Capitol's Senate 
side. 
</P>
<P>
	While large plants are unlikely to experience major failures --  
unless there are serious utility breakdowns -- there is little 
information about how smaller companies are preparing for computer 
problems, and readiness efforts appear to be ``less than 
appropriate,'' Poje said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you happen to be living next door to one of these small  
entities, it's small comfort to you'' that 90 percent of chemical 
plants have fixed their computers, said Sen. Bob Bennett, R-Utah, 
who heads a special Senate panel on the so-called ``Y2K'' problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 278,000 facilities in the country generate, transport or  
store hazardous materials, he said, adding, ``The risks are too 
great to chance the possibility of failures that threaten human 
lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many older computers that use only two digits to record dates  
will mistake the year 2000, or ``00,'' as 1900, raising the 
possibility of computer errors and shutdowns that could affect 
basic services worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by the CSB, an independent federal agency, said  
smaller chemical companies lack awareness regarding the Y2K impact 
and the technical know-how to fix the problem. ``Given the time 
constraints, there is very little chance of changing that 
reality,'' the report said, urging the federal government to be 
more aggressive in setting safety guidelines and helping small 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	On the House side of the Capitol, Federal Aviation Administrator  
Jane Garvey told a hearing that her agency will complete its Y2K 
preparations by June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	``The advent of the new millennium will not bring any compromise  
in aviation safety with it,'' said Garvey, who reiterated her 
earlier promise to be on a commercial coast-to-coast flight at 
midnight, Dec. 31, to demonstrate her confidence in the system. 
</P>
<P>
	Joel Willemssen of the General Accounting Office, the  
investigative wing of Congress, told the same hearing that the FAA 
has ``made tremendous progress'' since a year ago, when it was 
seven months behind in fixing computers, but said much work 
remains. There also are concerns about foreign airports and air 
traffic control systems.

<HEADLINE> Pippen Searches for Offensive Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Scottie Pippen didn't expect to feel comfortable  
immediately with the Houston Rockets' offense. But he didn't expect 
to be a virtual spectator 22 games into the season, either. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen is getting more frustrated as his offensive production  
diminishes. The Rockets mostly pound the ball inside to Charles 
Barkley and Hakeem Olajuwon rather than run the ball, which Pippen 
prefers. . 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, who signed a five-year, $67.5 million contract in  
January, took only five shots and scored four points in 35 minutes 
Sunday during a 104-90 loss to the Phoenix Suns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm frustrated,'' Pippen said. ``Playing the minutes I'm  
playing, I'm not involved in the offense. It makes the game not fun 
anymore. My next step is to find why this organization wanted me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen is averaging 40.6 minutes per game, fourth in the NBA,  
but he doesn't believe the Rockets are getting the most from his 
talents. Against the Suns, Barkley took 21 shots and Olajuwon 14. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to get everybody involved,'' Pippen said. ``We have to  
make the game fun for everybody. There are nights when things are 
not going right. It's time to go to somebody else and get somebody 
else involved. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen had similar comments following Saturday night's 100-89  
victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers when he had only one point in 
the first half but ended up with 16 points and 10 assists. The 
Rockets might have lost without his second half spurt. 
</P>
<P>
	Against the Cavaliers, Pippen was 4-for-11 from the field and  
Olajuwon was 11-of-19. Pippen is averaging 15 points, 5.6 assists 
and 7.5 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been difficult for me,'' Pippen said. ``It's going to be  
hard for me to find myself in this offense. They've built the 
offense around getting the ball in to Charles and Hakeem. For me to 
get shots, that's not going to happen often.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen was accustomed to the consistency of the Chicago Bulls,  
where he was the sidekick for Michael Jordan. The Bulls won six NBA 
championships in Pippen's 11 years with the team. Pippen is not a 
pivotal part of the Rockets' offense and some of his teammates are 
aware of that. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just have to do a better job of diversifying,'' Barkley  
said. ``We've got to do a better job of getting it to Scottie and 
Michael Dickerson.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets have struggled to get all their all-star parts  
working together. They've beaten only two teams with winning 
records, but guard Brent Price has seen glimpses of what the 
complete offense can do. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had moments where we clicked on all cylinders and that  
is exciting to see,'' Price said. ``If we ever get into the flow, 
we can be dangerous. You don't just have a bunch of good 
individuals show up and be a good team. It takes time to learn each 
other and come together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen is awaiting more of those moments.  
</P>
<P>
	``If the opportunities are there, I try to take advantage of  
them,'' Pippen said. ``I am more accustomed to getting some 
(chances) throughout the game to see where my rhythm is from an 
offensive standpoint. You have to be patient.''

<HEADLINE> Soybean, Other Futures Slide  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Soybean and grain futures prices settled mostly lower Monday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade after a weekend of dry weather in South 
America accelerated the harvest of bumper crops in Brazil and 
Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, pork, coffee and energy futures also fell.  
</P>
<P>
	Traders had already been expecting bumper soybean and corn crops  
in Brazil and Argentina. But good weather is putting even more 
pressure futures prices, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of it had to do with the big harvesting weekend in South  
America,'' said Don Roose, president of Iowa-based U.S. Commodities 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	A strengthening Brazilian currency also may prompt Brazilian  
farmers to sell their crops quickly, further increasing the supply 
and causing worldwide prices to drop further, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Roose said traders also were anticipating end-of-the-month  
reports to show that the number of acres dedicated to soybeans and 
grains would increase. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that weighed on us today too,'' Roose said.  
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for May delivery fell 1/4 cent to $2.72 1/4 a bushel; May corn  
fell 2 3/4 cents to 2.20 a bushel; May oats dropped 1 1/4 cents to $1.09 3/4 
a bushel, and May soybeans fell 3 1/2 cents to $4.71 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, lean hog futures fell a penny a pound on the Chicago  
Mercantile Exchange on news that hog slaughter is expected to top 2 
million head this week for the first time in eight weeks. Bad 
weather in some parts of the country had kept farmers from 
delivering hogs to market last week. 
</P>
<P>
	In Monday's trading, April lean hogs fell a cent to 41.07 cents  
a pound; March pork bellies dropped 0.72 cent to 48 cents per 
pound; April live cattle futures fell 0.80 cent to 66.35 cents a 
pound; and March feeder cattle dropped 0.23 cent to 71.57 cents per 
pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, coffee futures fell on the Board of Trade of the City  
of New York amid concerns the Green Coffee Association will 
increase its estimate of U.S. warehouse stocks. May arabica coffee 
fell 1.65 cents to $1.033 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy futures also slipped a bit on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange. Analysts said warmer weather in some parts of the country 
-- which tends to lower demand for crude and heating oil -- eroded 
Friday's gains, which had been fueled by news of a deal to cut 
production by the Organization of Petroleum Export Countries and 
other nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Light, sweet crude for April delivery fell 4 cents to $14.45 a  
barrel; April heating oil fell 0.65 cent to 38.08 cents a gallon; 
April unleaded gasoline fell 0.17 cent to 45.01 cents a gallon; 
April natural gas fell 0.42 cent to $1.717 for each 1,000 cubic 
feet.

<HEADLINE> Pippen Wants To Be More Involved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Scottie Pippen is getting exasperated with his  
role -- or lack of one -- with the Houston Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen took only five shots and scored four points in 35 minutes  
in Sunday's 104-90 loss to the Phoenix Suns. Afterward, he wondered 
why the Rockets signed him to a five-year, $67.5 million contract 
if they didn't intend to use his services to the fullest. 
</P>
<P>
	He's averaging 40.6 minutes per game, fourth in the NBA.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm frustrated,'' Pippen told the Houston Chronicle following  
the loss. ``Playing the minutes I'm playing I'm not involved in the 
offense. It makes the game not fun anymore. My next step is to find 
why this organization wanted me. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to sit down and ask, `What's my position on this ball  
club?' If it's just from a defensive standpoint, then I can 
understand the point, then I can feel much better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, a seven-time All-Star in 11 seasons with the Chicago  
Bulls, said he did not regret his decision to sign with the Rockets 
but wants to be more involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to get everybody involved,'' Pippen said. ``We have to  
make the game for everybody. There's nights when things are not 
going right. It's time to go to somebody else and get somebody else 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``Games like tonight (Sunday) make the game very difficult.''

<HEADLINE> Brian Dennehy Hospitalized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two Broadway performances of ``Death of a  
Salesman'' were canceled because star Brian Dennehy was 
hospitalized with what his spokesman said was high blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	The beefy, 59-year-old actor went to the hospital around 3 a.m.  
Sunday because he felt ill and couldn't sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	Performances Sunday and Tuesday were canceled because Dennehy,  
whose role as Willy Loman requires him to be on stage for almost 
three hours, has no understudy. 
</P>
<P>
	Publicist Richard Kornberg said Dennehy was expected to be  
released on Tuesday, but doctors told him to rest at home that 
night and return to work Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kornberg said a decision would be made Tuesday on whether  
Dennehy would be able to perform in Wednesday's matinee.

<HEADLINE> The Boss, McCartney, Joel Inducted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Three singers who dominated radio in the 1970s --  
Bruce Springsteen, Paul McCartney and Billy Joel -- joined the Rock 
and Roll Hall of Fame on Monday along with Dusty Springfield, who 
died two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Springsteen reunited with his E Street Band for a brief set of  
'70s era classics and McCartney -- joined onstage by his impatient 
daughter, Stella, -- paid tribute to his late wife, Linda. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would like my baby to share this with me,'' McCartney said.  
``She wanted this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not as much as Stella, apparently, who wore a tank top  
emblazoned with the words ``about (expletive) time.'' McCartney, 
whose former songwriting partner John Lennon is also in the hall 
for his solo work, said George Harrison and Ringo Starr should be 
next. The Beatles as a band were inducted in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	During a jam session that stretched past midnight, McCartney  
performed the Carl Perkins classic, ``Blue Suede Shoes.'' He also 
sang ``Let it Be,'' backed with Joel on piano, Springsteen on 
guitar and Bonnie Raitt, Lauryn Hill, Melissa Etheridge and the 
Staple Singers as backup singers. 
</P>
<P>
	The ceremony at the elegant Waldorf Astoria Hotel also served as  
a warm-up gig for Springsteen and his E Street Band, due to kick 
off their first tour in a decade next month. 
</P>
<P>
	Springsteen paid tribute to each band member in his acceptance  
speech. ``Everyone wants to know how I feel about the band. Hell, I 
married one,'' he said, referring to wife Patti Scialfa. 
</P>
<P>
	As several audience members stood on chairs, Springsteen  
performed ``Promised Land,'' ``Backstreets'' and ``Tenth Avenue 
Freezeout.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Springsteen thanked his mother, who was in the audience, for  
buying him his first guitar one Christmas. He also thanked his 
father, who died in the past year, with whom he had a contentious 
relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	``If everything had gone great between us, what would I have  
written about?'' he said. ``I tried to write happy songs in the 
early '90s, but it didn't work. The people didn't like it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U2's Bono inducted Springsteen with a circuitous speech that  
recalled how Springsteen never embarrassed himself: ``No bad hair 
period, even in the '80s,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Springsteen was judged rock 'n' roll's savior upon the release  
of ``Born to Run'' in 1975 and hit his commercial peak with ``Born 
in the USA'' in 1984. The E Street Band did not join Springsteen as 
inductees because under Hall of Fame rules, artists aren't eligible 
until 25 years after their first record, and the band didn't 
receive billing on a Springsteen record until 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a misguided policy,'' said E Street Band drummer Max  
Weinberg. 
</P>
<P>
	Elton John inducted Springfield, recalling how he joined her fan  
club and stuck her pictures on his bedroom wall. ``Every song she 
sang, she claimed as her own,'' said John. 
</P>
<P>
	The British singer lost her long battle with breast cancer just  
before her induction. Her hits included ``You Don't Have to Say You 
Love Me.'' Her critical reputation deepened when she traveled to 
Memphis to record ``Son of a Preacher Man'' in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	``Piano Man'' Joel burst out of Long Island with a rocker's  
swagger and Tin Pan Alley songwriting skill. The wedding standard 
``Just the Way You Are,'' ``Uptown Girl'' and ``We Didn't Start the 
Fire'' are among his hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Joel gave a long hug to fellow piano man Ray Charles, who  
inducted him. Joel said he learned his music from Charles, Otis 
Redding, and Wilson Pickett. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know I've been referred to as derivative, Joel said. ``I'm  
damn guilty ... If everyone who is derivative was excluded from 
this institution, there wouldn't be any white people here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although he continues to perform, Joel hasn't written a pop song  
in more than five years while he concentrates on classical 
composing. 
</P>
<P>
	Other inductees included ``Superfly'' singer Curtis Mayfield,  
already in the hall as a member of the Impressions; Del Shannon, 
who made ``Runaway'' a hit in 1961; and the gospel group The 
Staples Singers. 
</P>
<P>
	Blues artist Charles Brown and the Western swing band Bob Wills  
and His Texas Playboys were honored as early influences. Beatles 
producer George Martin was saluted in the nonperforming category. 
</P>
<P>
	The names of Hall of Fame honorees are on permanent exhibit at  
the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum in Cleveland, which opened in 
1995.

<HEADLINE> Boxing Orders Holyfield-Lewis II </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It takes a lot to get the heads of boxing's  
three warring factions to agree on anything. Watching Evander 
Holyfield get a draw after taking a beating at the hands of Lennox 
Lewis apparently was enough. 
</P>
<P>
	Just hours after three judges concluded early Sunday that the  
first heavyweight title unification fight in seven years was a 
draw, the people who control the title belts ordered a second fight 
within six months. 
</P>
<P>
	If anyone is interested in paying to see it again -- and assuming  
the two fighters are as willing as they say-- Holyfield and Lewis 
will meet once more for the IBF and WBA titles held by Holyfield 
and the WBC crown owned by Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
	``In six months if he wants to get it on we'll get it on,''  
Holyfield said. ``Six months ain't no problem with me.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Nor with Lewis, although a lot of agreements would have to take  
place and deals be made if the fight is actually to occur. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief among them would be the purses -- Lewis is unlikely to  
accept half of what Holyfield gets this time around -- and a place. 
There's also the matter of competing networks -- Holyfield fights 
for Showtime and Lewis for HBO -- and promotional disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	``There should be an automatic rematch,'' said Lewis, who earned  
$10 million to Holyfield's $20 million in a bout promoted by Don 
King. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Lee of the International Boxing Federation, Jose Sulaiman of  
the World Boxing Council and Gilberto Mendoza of the World Boxing 
Association met after the fight and issued the rematch declaration. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shame there was so much controversy attached to this  
important fight,'' Lee said. ``But we did what we thought was the 
most sensible thing by ordering a rematch in six months.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. George Pataki wants the New York State Athletic Commission  
to look into the draw. He said his administration worked hard to 
bring boxing back to Madison Square Garden, ``but it has to be done 
in a way that upholds the integrity of the game and people's 
confidence in the sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd of 21,284 saw an aging Holyfield lose a lopsided  
fight. What two of three judges saw, however, was something quite 
different. 
</P>
<P>
	``He looked like an old man in there,'' Lewis said. ``He looked  
slow to me and he missed a lot of punches.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not in the eyes of ringside judge Jean Williams.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care who the winner was,'' Williams said. ``I scored  
by the blows that connected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams thought Holyfield connected with enough punches to win  
the fight seven rounds to five, allowing him to escape with a draw 
in a fight Lewis appeared to dominate from the opening bell. 
</P>
<P>
	She gave Holyfield the edge even though the WBA and IBF champion  
was credited in ringside stats with landing fewer than 10 punches 
in each of six different rounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have the privilege of a boxing stat,'' Williams said.  
</P>
<P>
	Neither did the sellout crowd, but that didn't stop the fans  
from booing lustily when the shocking decision was announced. 
</P>
<P>
	For 12 rounds, Lewis was in control, landing left jabs and right  
leads at will and frustrating Holyfield every time he attempted to 
get inside to neutralize the bigger man's advantages. 
</P>
<P>
	In one of those rounds, the fifth, Lewis clipped Holyfield with  
a hard right off the top of his head, sparking a flurry of 12 to 15 
head shots as Holyfield appeared helpless on the ropes and did not 
return a punch for 45 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Lewis' best round of the fight. It showed in punch stats  
tallied at ringside, which had the WBC champion landing 43 punches 
to 11 for Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, a New Jersey judge, gave Holyfield the round.  
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like the judging is rigged almost,'' said Lewis  
trainer Emanuel Steward. ``I hate to say it, this is a sport I make 
my living in. I'm ashamed of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams had Holyfield winning 115-113, while British judge  
Larry O'Connell had to give Lewis the last round to even get him 
the draw, with a 115-115 score. 
</P>
<P>
	South Africa's Stanley Christoudoulou had Lewis winning 116-113.  
</P>
<P>
	``I thought Lewis definitely dominated, especially the first  
seven rounds,'' Christoudoulou told the South African Press 
Association. ``Apart from the third, it was all Lewis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 36-year-old Holyfield looked every year his age as he tried  
to get inside the jabs and right leads thrown by Lewis. Holyfield 
connected occasionally, but never put together any series of 
punches in combinations that might have hurt the 33-year-old 
British fighter. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis was credited with landing 348 punches to 130 for  
Holyfield, yet if it hadn't been for a late flurry in the final 
round he might have been going home to England without his belt as 
a split decision loser. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was my time to shine and they ripped me off,'' Lewis said.  
``I am the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world and 
everyone knows it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis might actually have been the undisputed champion had he  
gone after Holyfield with a vengeance instead of fighting carefully 
when he seemed to have the bout in hand. 
</P>
<P>
	Always cautious in the ring, Lewis might have been a bit too  
careful when he needed to make an impression on the judges the 
most. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want to fall for any sucker thing,'' Lewis said. ``He  
was basically trying to use his experience to bring me in, but that 
didn't happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the left side of Holyfield's face was badly swollen by  
the end of the fight, while Lewis was basically unmarked. With just 
seconds left in the fight, Lewis threw his right arm up in triumph, 
seemingly secure in the knowledge he had won. 
</P>
<P>
	Holyfield's plan to knock Lewis out in the third round had  
failed, and there was no backup plan when he needed it. Yet, he 
wasn't about to concede defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still feel like the heavyweight champion,'' Holyfield said.  
``It's real simple. The people around the ring aren't judges.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Faulted in Airport Confusion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- A former U.S. Transportation Department  
official who became a top critic of goverment airline safety policy 
today blamed airport officials for turmoil that followed her 
attempt to put an unaccompanied suitcase on a plane. 
</P>
<P>
	Mary Schiavo said on NBC's ``Today'' show that she was sorry for  
any inconvenience caused when Port Columbus International Airport 
called the bomb squad and closed a runway for four hours Friday. 
``But it was done by the airport with the full knowledge of what 
was going on,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	WCMH-TV reported that it had told an airport official Friday  
morning that it was doing a story on airport security. The station 
said in a statement Sunday that Ms. Schiavo, working with the 
station, had checked in a bag for a flight as part of the story, 
and that airport officials were made aware of the existence of the 
piece of luggage at around the time the flight was to have taken 
off. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard L. Morgan, director of public safety at Port Columbus,  
said Sunday that he could not verify that the suspicious bag that 
shut down the runway was the one left by Ms. Schiavo. He told The 
Washington Post that airport authorities would not have acted as 
they did if they did not believe lives were at stake. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ms. Schiavo told The Washington Post in a story published  
today that she believes authorities created a major incident to 
diminish her role as an airline safety advocate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is pretty clear that the intent was to make a scene to  
stifle my activism,'' she told the newspaper. ``They may have 
succeeded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Schiavo confirmed she was working with the station, and said  
she regretted her involvement and wouldn't do it again but insisted 
she didn't do anything wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not illegal to buy a ticket, check a bag and not get on a  
plane,'' said Ms. Schiavo, the Transportation Department's former 
inspector general. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Schiavo, who resigned her federal post in 1996 in the wake  
of the ValuJet crash that killed 110 people, wrote a book accusing 
the FAA of sloppy inspections, lax airport security and disregard 
for substandard airplane parts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Schiavo, who lives in a Columbus suburb, said she bought one  
ticket to Washington, D.C., for a 2:58 p.m. Friday flight on 
America West Airlines and checked her bag at noon. But she didn't 
board the plane. She said she was hoping to determine whether the 
bag would be allowed to take off with the flight even though its 
owner was not on board. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the bag was clearly marked with her name and address  
and contained several items including a cellular phone wire and 
sneakers loosely packed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was not constructed to look like a bomb,'' Ms. Schiavo  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI spokesman Frank Scafidi said Sunday the agency is  
investigating. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there are going to be any charges brought, that would be a  
decision made by prosecutors, local or federal,'' Scafidi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Takemoto, FAA spokesman, said Sunday that the FAA was  
looking into whether FAA regulations were involved. Patty Nowack, a 
spokeswoman for America West, said the airline complied with FAA 
rules by not loading the unaccompanied bag. 
</P>
<P>
	WCMH said it is cooperating fully with airport officials.  
</P>
<P>
	Bags are matched to passengers on international flights, but  
checks are not required for domestic passengers. Discovery of the 
unaccompanied bag prompted airport officials to shut down a runway 
for four hours.

<HEADLINE> Arab-American Claims Israel Torture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department is attempting to assist  
an Arab-American in filing a protest against Israel based on his 
allegations that he was subjected to torture while being detained 
in Israel for six weeks last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokesman James P. Rubin said Monday that Anwar Mohammed, 27, of  
Miami, was detained on suspicion of membership in Hamas and other 
nationalist activities. 
</P>
<P>
	He was arrested on Oct. 28 and released on Dec. 7 without formal  
charges having been filed. 
</P>
<P>
	When a U.S. consular officer visited him in November, ``Mr.  
Mohammed spoke of mistreatment, specifically being made to sit in a 
low chair with his hands handcuffed behind his back,'' Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	On a subsequent visit by the consular officer on Dec. 3,  
Mohammed spoke of ``violent treatment by fellow prisoners, whom he 
characterized as informants working with Israeli authorities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to Rubin, Mohammed said these prisoners had forced him  
to admit throwing stones during anti-Israeli protests by 
Palestinians when he was 17. He said he wanted to file a protest 
once he was released. 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts by the State Department to reach him during January and  
February were unsuccessful. A meeting was arranged for March 9 but 
was postponed because of bad weather, Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	He added that the State Department wishes to reschedule the  
appointment at the earliest possible date.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Meets With Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- His face pale and his voice weak, President Boris  
Yeltsin held a hospital meeting Monday with his prime minister and 
pledged to ``take part'' in the country's two most pressing issues 
-- if absolutely needed. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the latest sign of Yeltsin's increasing distance from the  
day-to-day affairs of his office. 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting in front of a small table at the Central Clinical  
Hospital, where he is recuperating from a bleeding ulcer, the 
68-year-old Yeltsin was shown on television speaking with Prime 
Minister Yevgeny Primakov. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin was hospitalized for two weeks in January, followed by  
rest at home and in a sanitarium. He re-entered the hospital Feb. 
27, after his ulcer started bleeding again. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin says he has no intention of resigning though he has not  
been able to work full-time for the past several months. 
</P>
<P>
	He told Primakov that the two most pressing issues they had to  
discuss were Russia's deteriorating relations with the breakaway 
region of Chechnya and its difficult negotiations with the 
International Monetary Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin said Chechnya was a ``more complicated'' situation than  
the IMF talks. ``In both cases, in case of necessity, I am ready to 
take part,'' he told Primakov. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin spoke more slowly than usual and gestured without his  
usual forcefulness. He dismissed rumors that he was about to 
dismiss Primakov. 
</P>
<P>
	The news media want to ``drive a wedge between Yeltsin and  
Primakov,'' the president said. ``Nature has not even created such 
a wedge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I absolutely agree with you. Such a wedge cannot exist,''  
Primakov said, nodding. Rumors that Yeltsin was going to fire 
Primakov or shake up his Cabinet have ebbed and flowed for much of 
the past month. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting was the first face-to-face talk between the two  
since the end of February, when Yeltsin and Primakov went on 
television together to say they were committed to remaining in 
their posts until the presidential elections scheduled for the 
summer of 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin's illnesses have left Primakov holding most of the  
responsibility for the government's pressing issues, the economy 
foremost among them. The situation in Chechnya has also become a 
major concern following the kidnapping of a Russian police general 
there earlier this month.

<HEADLINE> Whitewater Lawyers Want Tape Played </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's  
prosecutors said Monday they hope to play part of Hillary Rodham 
Clinton's videotaped testimony to a grand jury at the trial of her 
former Whitewater partner, Susan McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr deputy W. Hickman Ewing Jr. said outside the courthouse at  
the end of Monday's testimony that prosecutors want to play 
``perhaps 30 minutes'' of the first lady's testimony, as early as 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. McDougal's lawyer, Mark Geragos, was expected to object at  
a hearing Tuesday morning before the trial resumes. 
</P>
<P>
	In a court filing prepared by prosecutors and obtained by The  
Associated Press, Starr's office suggests Mrs. Clinton's testimony 
makes it even more vital for Mrs. McDougal to cooperate with the 
criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors' court papers say ``the videotape will show that  
the first lady testified that she had no knowledge or information 
about either'' a $27,600 loan made in Bill Clinton's name or a 
$5,081.82 check signed by Mrs. McDougal and used to pay off part of 
the Clinton loan. The AP obtained the papers, which had not been 
filed with the court as of the close of business Monday, from a 
person familiar with the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutors say ``the videotape ... will establish ... the  
importance of questions posed to, and answered by, the first lady 
and prepared for'' Mrs. McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense opened the door for prosecutors to present Mrs.  
Clinton's testimony when Geragos questioned FBI agent Mike Patkus, 
who works for Starr's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Patkus said last Thursday that he did not know if prosecutors  
had asked Mrs. Clinton a series of questions about a $27,600 loan 
in the name of Bill Clinton from the Madison Guaranty Savings and 
Loan owned by Mrs. McDougal and her former husband, James McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors allege that the Clinton loan is connected to a  
fraudulent $300,000 loan made to Mrs. McDougal in 1986. She is 
charged with contempt of court and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Ewing said prosecutors want to ``clear up misimpressions'' left  
last Thursday when Patkus testified that he wasn't sure Mrs. 
Clinton had been questioned about the transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	In particular, Ewing pointed to questions put to the agent about  
how the Clinton loan was paid off. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecutor's interest in showing Mrs. Clinton's testimony  
from April 25, 1998, arose at the end of the day's trial testimony, 
when prosecutor Julie Myers, with Patkus still on the witness 
stand, went through the testimony the agent had given last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Myers referred to Mrs. Clinton's testimony and at that  
point Geragos asked for meeting with U.S. District Judge George 
Howard Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton gave the videotaped testimony at the White House  
and it was played several days later to the Whitewater grand jury 
in Little Rock. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Monday, Starr's office put one of its own prosecutors on  
the witness stand to fight Mrs. McDougal's allegation that 
Whitewater investigators pressured her to tell lies about the 
Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr's office only asked for the ``total and complete truth,''  
former prosecutor Amy St. Eve insisted. 
</P>
<P>
	The independent counsel's office has been thrown on the  
defensive by the strategy of Geragos, who is accusing the 
prosecutor's staff of a pattern of misconduct -- including urging 
Mrs. McDougal to give testimony that falsely implicates the 
Clintons. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely not,'' St. Eve replied when Myers asked whether  
Mrs. McDougal had been asked to lie.
